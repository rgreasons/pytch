The Brooklyn trio has done space-rock freak-outs, heavy minimalist drones, and abstract synthesizer mulch, all of which has been unspooled across two LPs, a handful of small-press singles, a compilation album, and, probably, a box full of all-night free-form practice tapes.</p>
<p>The Ills' third LP, <i>Hazed Dream</i>, finds them taking another approach, sidelining the guitar solos in favor of stripped-down and straightforward songwriting. In his lightly blazed tenor, Tres Warren-- the band's guitarist, singer, and principle songwriter-- coolly considers the subjects that have long fascinated and vexed his space-rock forebears: sunshine, roads, walking down roads, walking with Jesus, and things that are and aren't all right. The pace is whispery and mellow, the fuzz pedal presumably out of batteries. It's pure moods music for cowboy stoners. There's nothing here that's going to explode any eyeballs or melt the paint off the wall, but it's a step in the right direction for Psychic Ills, whose output has been fairly inconsistent since their 2006 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6596-dins/"" target=""_blank"">Dins</a></i>.</p>
<p>During the mid 2000s, it sometimes felt like Psychic Ills were a band in the right place at the right time with the wrong music. Their contemporaries and labelmates, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>, ditched guitars for samplers and new-age synthesizer tones, pursuing spacey music's more under-explored permutations and, eventually, finding modest popularity. For all their stylistic restlessness, Psychic Ills were traditionalists, sticking to established, well-worn 1960s psych and krautrock sounds.</p>
<p><i>Hazed Dream </i>is a record that fits more precisely into its time and place. With their mumbled verses and slacker spirituality, Warren's compositions aren't terribly distant from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>'s effect pedal-enhanced folk-rock, albeit lacking in some of the Philly-based rocker's gift for conjuring pastoral sprawl. In the subdued soloing, you can hear echoes of San Francisco retro noodlers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Shjips</a>. Psychic Ills hung on to their schtick long enough that they seem to have phased back into tune with their peers.</p>
<p>But transcendence via free-form freak-out is further away than ever. <i>Hazed Dream </i>has some heady moments-- the languid guitar intro to ""Incense Head"" and the head-nodding chords of ""Mexican Wedding""-- but the songs are just too mellow, understated, and lyrically anonymous to move the needle much.</p></div>"|15984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15984-psychic-ills/|5.9|Aaron Leitko

""2011 - A Space Woodysey"" is a stirring, dramatic opener of flaring strings and mysterious tribal percussion, leading directly into the ten minute frenzy of last year's single ""Moon Jocks N Prog Rocks"", an endlessly mutating singalong disco epic that draws the natural short-circuit between the Mos Eisley Cantina and the Muppets. Taken together, they form the culmination of the group's aesthetic, offering a version of dancefloor maximalism that always threatens to become too large, to careen out of control and explode or implode into the purely ridiculous--  like every great Muppets finale, really.</p>
<p>In fact, ""Moon Jocks"" is so perfect an encapsulation of Mungolian Jet Set's seductive extremism that it really ought to have been the last track of its type, after which the silly voices were locked away forever. For <i>Schlungs</i>, however, the Norwegian collective mostly go down the opposite route, spotlighting the puppets while backgrounding the elaborate set pieces behind them. The results are somewhat mixed: Even on the group's most outrageously rococo remixes, the speed of their largesse and the friction of their ridiculousness felt evenly balanced. Here, the music frequently scales down to more human dimensions, at which point the silliness starts to resemble that of real humans: flushed with an over-enthusiastic pleasure you can observe but not share, and at times a bit uncomfortable to be in the same room as.</p>
<p>Hypothetically this equation could work, but on the jaunty ""Bella Lanay""<i> </i>(Doobie Brothers take a trip to the disco) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16278-we-are-the-shining/"" target=""_blank"">""We Are the Shining""</a> (Giorgio Moroder outtake), it doesn't quite come together, the frequently excellent music sinking beneath the weight of the raucous warbling of a choir of funny uncles. The results aren't awful, but they do feel top-heavy, the unusually restrained arrangements never given a moment to breathe. The charming central synth vamp on ""Bella Lanay"" especially could benefit from an airier vocal, perhaps from a Michael McDonald or Phil Collins pretender who could gift the music's insistent prettiness with a pretense of self-belief. It's telling that ""Smoke N Mirrors"", the album closer and unofficial sequel to ""Moon Jocks"", switches from irritating to marvelous the moment the atonal vocal harmonies are abandoned.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Schlungs </i>works best when it runs as far from this idea of animatronic pop as possible: the sly, water-treading slomo disco balladry of ""Ties N Downs"", the wonderfully mutational instrumental melodrama of ""Moonstruck"", and the collision of the Black Dog and Jon Hassell on ""Shelton's on a Bender"". The last of these might be somewhat ungainly in its mixture of stabbing percussion, eerie trumpet, sampled choral vocals, and growling bass, but it's perhaps the album's most interesting moment, fully inhabiting the dark fourth-world funk that forms the yang to disco's yin in the group's best work.</p>
<p>Darkness-- or, more precisely, a certain ominous <i>alienness--</i> is what gives Mungolian Jet Set's preposterousness its charisma, suggesting an extraterrestrial consciousness operating beyond questions of humor or seriousness. Human dimensions don't really work for this group, not because the epic is what they ""do,"" but because their music sounds best when it becomes lost in its own logic, creating and then exploring a world of its own rather than just a quirky version of ours-- more <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, less ""Mork &amp; Mindy"". In its pinnacles and pitfalls, <i>Schlungs </i>confirms that, even if the results can be cute, communicating with humans is usually the least impressive talent any alien has.</p></div>"|15968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15968-schlungs/|6.7|Tim Finney

These 88 pages brim with an obsessive sort of information about Fahey: his slapdash drawings of important people and places in his life, the first known photograph of him with a Gibson F-hole guitar, the receipt for his Holzapfel 12-string, his Boy Scouts photo, and even a personal letter to Fonotone owner Joe Bussard where he begs for recordings of a few old blues heroes. There's a revealing and hitherto unpublished interview, remembrances from past collaborators, and Italian researcher Claudio Guerrieri's guide to the various hand-written labels Bussard affixed to the center of each record he hand-cut on order.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the book is Malcolm Kirton's exhaustive 40-page examination of every track on the 115-piece, 5xCD, six-hour set, including Fahey's thoughts on the tunes, his tunings, his techniques, and how a scrawny, awkward white kid from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. came to learn obscure songs from even more obscure black bluesmen long before CD reissues and online archives were even an idea. It should be noted that Kirton also helped produce The Roots of John Fahey, <a href=""http://grapewrath.blogspot.com/2008/04/roots-of-john-fahey.html."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a free online archive</a> of many of the songs in question. Like this set, it is also essential. As the guitarist, enthusiast, and project co-producer Glenn Jones quips in his own introduction, ""Let's face it, who is this set for if not Fahey's most hardcore fans?""</p>
<p>Actually, <i>Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You</i> is not just for Fahey zealots. It's for anyone interested in the story of American music, from its Appalachian string bands and mean-moaning Delta blues singers to the hymns sung from its church pews and the country-rock anthems soon enough crafted by its hippies. But <i>Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You</i> is not only the story of the musician John Fahey, it's also the story of the songs that have become crucial to his country, a place that Fahey explored from one end (he was raised in Maryland) to the other (he lived in Hawaii at one point and died in Oregon). Somewhat comparable to the sprawling ethnomusicological work of Alan Lomax, Harry Smith, Art Rosenbaum, Nick Perls, and others like them, <i>Your</i><i> Past Comes Back to Haunt You</i> is a rich overview of America's musical bedrock-- only here, it's told through the hard-won, fast-paced development of a guitarist who, in turn, changed the way future players could consider their instrument. A must-have collection of lore, music, and history, it's a unified, brilliant, and often very challenging archive.</p>
<p>During four decades between the time this set was recorded and Fahey's death in 2001, the guitarist would cover expansive musical ground, from transfixing, blues-based tone poems that stretched the boundaries of his instrument to, years later, luminous drones that synced with the interests of a new generation of his advocates. As Robbie Basho said in an oft-repeated explanation, ""Fahey and myself are playing frustrated little symphonies on guitar."" Over time, he was a philosophy major, an author, a record label owner, a curator, and a strange storyteller. However, here on these either unreleased or very hard-to-find tracks, he's a young American adult rifling through his friends' record collections and taking road trips to rural lands to find the music and musicians that he really loves-- raging country blues and blissful acoustic hymns, written and recorded by the likes of Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Elizabeth Cotten, Bukka White, Will Moore, Mississippi John Hurt, and a canon of others, all while building his own style.</p>
<p>Emotionally, technically, and stylistically, Fahey makes for a suitably uneven tour guide through these dusty back pages, like a metabolic personification of Greil Marcus' old, weird America. On one version of ""Poor Boy Blues"", recorded in 1959, he plays with a great, repetitive sadness, the 20-year-old doing his best to sing like a Mississippi septuagenarian, as if inborn with an inescapable melancholy. About a year earlier, he'd folded the same tune into ""Libba's Rag"", an apparent homage to mentor Elizabeth Cotten. It sounds young and vaguely hopeful, always on the verge of lifting off. Nearly two years later, he wove a glimpse of another version of the tune-- learned from his master of sorts, Charley Patton-- into ""Dasein River Blues"", the kind of slow, wobbly, serpentine country-blues stagger that would eventually give some of Fahey's best-known music its trademark, trance-like essence. Fahey sometimes navigates these tunes with crystalline clarity, as with his stately reverence for the fifth-century ""St. Patrick's Hymn"" or his haunted slide guitar dirge behind ""In the Pines"", a duet with mountain singer Fran Vandiver. Elsewhere, he pugnaciously repurposes the material, as when he snaps the strings hard against the slide of a 1960 take on ""John Henry"" or slurs the words of ""Green Blues"". He hammers out the chords with a great aggression, as though they'd said something about his mother.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Admittedly, some of the material here stands as a curiosity at best. Fahey's six collaborations with flautist Nancy McLean function more as a testament to his inquisitiveness as a player and listener than something you'll want to hear repeatedly; the same goes for his raucous, wasted take on ""I Shall Not Be Moved"". Similarly, some of the short guitar solos included here-- two versions of the gorgeous cowboy song ""Goodbye Old Paint"" or his slide through ""House Carpenter""-- aren't testaments to his otherwise-apparent abilities as an arranger. They simply shape our understanding of his lexicon. By set's end, though, Fahey's working through knotty versions of the romantic ""How Long"" and ""You Take the E Train"" (better known as ""The Last Steam Engine Train""). These songs and several of their contemporaries illustrate Fahey's very original synthesis of folk, blues, classical, and even old American standards. He was a zealous collector and an ingenious interpreter, two qualities that <i>Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You</i> takes great care to link.</p>
<p>Fahey's legacy and reputation among modern guitarists is overwhelming and inescapable. Just as pop-rock bands with stacked harmonies and two guitars can't escape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">Beatles</a> comparisons, an upstart learning to flatpick must initially step up to or around Fahey's prominence. Though <i>Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You</i> lives up to its name by finally presenting a lot of material Fahey admitted he would rather forget, it ultimately confirms his stature as one of music's pioneering polymaths. The tunes here are, at turns, funny or solemn, sober or delirious, studied or shambolic, but, with it all, Fahey was able to ingest and utilize a broad range of feelings and ideas into takes that remain totally singular and identifiable.</p>
<p>During a session at home with Bussard in the spring of 1960, Fahey cut seven songs, including a particularly charged version of ""Sitting on Top of the World"" and a delicate, subtle ragtime mutation he called ""Hill High Blues"". The last song Fahey ostensibly cut that day was ""Paint Brush Blues"", improvised on a lark after he picked up a paintbrush Bussard used to keep his record lathe clean. He beats the strings, the chords radiating through the speakers. It's a tossed-off moment, certainly, but the anything-goes spirit validates what Kirton calls a sign of ""Fahey's experimental propensities."" Fahey was a restless listener, tinkerer, thinker, and player-- a combination that makes this set fascinating both as a history book and a lifetime listening indulgence.</p></div>"|15959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15959-your-past-comes-back-to-haunt-you-the-fonotone-years-19581965/|9.5|Grayson Currin

You can bet that in the fast-zombies-versus-slow-zombies debate, Stott sides with the groaners and stumblers: As was his previous record, <i>We Stay Together</i> is a Frankenstein's monster pieced together from scraps of club tracks pitched down to an agonizing crawl. Funny things happen at this speed: The beats lurch violently, kicking up clouds of ash with every impact; every syncopation becomes a hesitant shudder. Sampled vocals, looming in the background, turn to a jellied groan.</p>
<p>The record begins rather demurely with ""Submission"", five minutes of choral samples and ambient flutter that suggests the sound of a thousand pigeons ruffling their feathers in a catacomb. ""Posers"", which follows, sets up the idea that will maintain across the rest of the record, with a slowed-down railroad chug, tri-tone strings, and dissonant washes of synthesizer; distant horns sound the mournful call of a failed hunt. Despite the leaden drowsiness, it still moves: There's an infectious sense of groove in its shuffling percussion and echoing finger snaps.</p>
<p>After ""Posers"", the record's fastest track-- around the same tempo as many of the slow-motion house and disco records being produced by artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a>, Kassem Mosse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28242-blondes/"" target=""_blank"">Blondes</a>; it only feels slower, thanks to its blasted, narcotic production-- things get really torpid. Not just sluggish, but also nasty and mean, degraded and depraved, with more of that death-gurgle bass that led me to compare Stott's last record to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>. If anything, <i>We Stay Together</i> sounds even more like it could have been released by <a href=""http://www.southernlord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Southern Lord</a>.</p>
<p>On vinyl, <i>We Stay Together</i> serves a two-for-one purpose: It's meant to be played at 33, but if you speed it up to 45, most of the record's tracks actually become punishing, industrial-strength techno, the kind of sledgehammers associated with Berlin's famously intense Berghain club. Even played like this, though, they don't sound like ""normal"" techno: they're warped, muted, blown out-- they sound <i>wrong</i>. ""Bad Wires"" becomes like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/"" target=""_blank"">Surgeon</a> being run through a cubic meter of boiled wool; the clanging ""Cracked"" comes to sound like several dub techno tracks being played in parallel, with rhythms so disorienting you may wonder if Stott simply sampled a particularly hairy passage from an old DJ mix and slowed it down by 30%.</p>
<p>There's another reason to get this record on vinyl: It sounds way, way better. That might seem odd, given that so much of Stott's sound has to do with using compression, distortion, and other effects to make his music not just strange but even ugly. But, on wax, his swollen low end growls in a way that's almost sensual. (If you must buy digital, pay the extra bucks for the FLAC version; the difference between the high-bitrate version and a compressed MP3 is very real.)</p>
<p>Despite the surface similarities between <i>We Stay Together</i> and <i>Passed Me By</i>, it doesn't feel like Stott is repeating himself. Both records may seem like hellish vultures picking over the carcass of dance music, but every track on the new record yields fresh morsels. Fans of Stott's labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare</a>, and all the other goth-n-screw artists out there at the moment, will be happy to gnaw on these bones.</p></div>"|15971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/|8.2|Philip Sherburne

Imagine that being true in 2009, when, after being outed as an ex-corrections officer, Ross got roped into a childish feud with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"" target=""_blank"">50 Cent</a>, who rediscovered his ability to ruffle the feathers of his overly serious peers, while blogs and commenters gleefully cackled along. That Ross emerged from the embarrassing fracas to become one of the few larger-than-life stars in the game was shocking enough, but now his stamp of approval alone is enough to make, or salvage, careers. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a>, who was left for dead by the major label system following his disastrous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13695-attention-deficit/"" target=""_blank"">first album</a>, was scooped up by Ross after a rather pedestrian appearance on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a>'s smash hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhxizRYxps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Hands""</a> and is now poised to sell hundreds of thousands of copies of his upcoming album. But Ross' most intriguing protégé is the young (though by no means rookie) Philadelphia street rapper <a href=""http://www.meekmilldreamteam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>, a fact not lost on Ross, who saw fit to include himself on both of Meek's radio singles from this year.</p>
<p>Being from Philly, it's easy to see the lineage of ex-Roc-A-Fella underlings State Property in Meek's excitable, eager shout. But we're a long way from 2002, and there's a distinctly Southern bent to his rapping that has helped him rise to prominence during the reign of Lex Luger. Meek still carries an air of detached cool that is no doubt filtered down from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>, but the rapper that he often resembles is the currently imprisoned Lil' Boosie. Though his music isn't as emotionally raw as Boosie's, both rappers engage the listener on a purely visceral level, primarily through deliveries that seem on the verge of careening off the rails. The ability to connect in this manner is something that can't be taught, or even really developed. An untold number of rappers have tried to get over on energy and the sheer force of their charisma alone, but certain guys-- DMX, Waka, Boosie-- have an innate ability to connect with their audiences in a way that can leave non-believers, especially ones who privilege lyricism, baffled. Sometimes pro scouts will watch an athlete and say that the player has ""it""-- well, Meek Mill, at least in this regard, has ""it.""</p>
<p><i>Dreamchasers </i>-- coming after the relative success of singles <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5spMjy8uhc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tupac Back""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1cxP2nCBdU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ima Boss""</a>, and with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4812-dj-drama/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Drama</a> on foghorn duties-- is easily the biggest solo release of Meek's career, and it ends up serving a dual purpose. On the one hand, it easily showcases how deep his talent runs and how versatile an artist he can be. On the other, it functions as a blueprint for exactly what kind of rap music he should and should not be focused on making as his career moves forward. Let's start with the disappointing stuff. The tape is littered with beats either produced by Lex Luger or by people copying Lex Luger, and while that sound is now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/out-the-trunk/7984-out-the-trunk-5/"" target=""_blank"">minted and unavoidable</a>, Meek Mill isn't a rapper that needs to be working off the template. ""Ima Boss"", which is also included on the tape, is evidence enough that Meek can bark his way onto the radio without having to fall back on Luger's lurching productions.</p>
<p>Meek doesn't sound bad on those songs, per say, but the highlights of the tape prove just how unnecessary the generics are. For someone who doesn't try and dazzle with his lyrics, he possesses an exceptional eye for telling stories on both a macro and micro level. ""Middle of Da Summer"", for instance, finds Meek using the season as a frame for sketching a portrait of how his city revolved around him as he grew into a life of crime. ""Tony Story"" is not only one of the most vivid story raps in recent memory, but its plot and development are so engrossing on a cinematic level that it should give David Simon pause. And then there's the title track, with a beat straight out of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> school of ""soulful"" and featuring a particularly devastating guest shot from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4118-beanie-sigel/"" target=""_blank"">Beanie Sigel</a>, which transcends the trappings of rote inspirational ploys via Meek's sober and realistic rendering of the life of a struggling rapper.</p>
<p>Meek is being groomed for rap stardom, and the genre would be better off if he were able to get there. But while his proximity to Rick Ross has accelerated his career and will continue to open doors for his art, it's important for him to remember that he's not Ross and doesn't need to be. There are plenty of mid-tier rappers willing to merely ride out Lex Luger's wave, but Meek has enough dimensions to be in it for the long haul.</p></div>"|15977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15977-dreamchasers/|7.4|Jordan Sargent

<p>Maybe it's got something to do with the boys being back in town: They recorded in their home city, where the drink will flow and the blood will spill and if McCauley wants to fight, you better let him. This isn't a problem in and of itself, since McCauley has an endearingly ragged, if not always euphonious voice that's built for this sort of outlaw pose. Likewise, as a band Deer Tick have enough expertise to handle any style of intoxicated rock with ample hooks-- alt-country, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"" target=""_blank"">Replacements</a> punk, Brit Invasion garage-- but play it sloppy enough to make it clear that being confined to a studio is a necessary evil before they come to your town and help you party down. Unless they have a warrant in it, and according to barnstorming opener ""The Bump"", they almost certainly do.</p>
<p>And it's certainly admirable in theory that McCauley chooses to be the increasingly rare lyricist relying on storytelling-- for all of the basic rhymes and stunted poetry, he intends to be heard and taken at face value. Problem is, these songs thus live and die by the depth of McCauley's characters, and while they fuck up repeatedly and alienate everyone including the listener, they're not so much lovable losers as horribly unsympathetic people who just aren't compelling at all-- the perfect bar band for Paddy's Pub, only without the jokes. ""Give me a spark!/ And I'm an atom bomb!/ Give me some pills/ And I can't stand up!"" McCauley yells during ""The Bump"" while the band barely chips in with off-key harmonies and an interminable whistling solo as reminders that these dudes don't give a shit, bro. They don't <i>take</i> no shit either-- not from no two-bit job (""Chevy Express""), or woman (take your pick), or new boyfriend (""Make Believe""), or the cops (again, take your pick). Problem is, it's hard for you to give a shit either with Deer Tick's insistence on merely borrowing swagger instead of owning it. This is particularly true of the otherwise anthemic ""Main Street"", which conjures the mythos of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">the Rolling Stones</a> by namedropping a bunch of their albums you could be listening to instead.</p>
<p>Then again, I'll take their unfocused flexing of beer muscles over weepy barstool poetry-- ""Electric"" nixes the drums and guitars so McCauley can get a little time to himself to philosophize about our social contract (""I need electric to get me high/ But I don't need your friendly smiles/ I'm just the brakes and you're the miles""...huh?). But even with the portentous, droning keyboards, the lack of resonance is borderline laughable, and besides, by the next song, he's regained enough of a third wind to act like a leg-humping frat dude turning on some last-call sleaze over ""Brown Eyed Girl"" (""Miss K.""). To top it off, there's the C&amp;W weeper sung by drummer Dennis Ryan working shopworn prayers about fighting off the devil, a concerned wife, and pedophilic urges with lines like, ""I take cover behind my white facepaint/ While I battle my bitter father's ghost."" Then you realize why this particular song is called ""Clownin' Around"", and it's actually more soul-crushing than Sufjan Stevens' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otx49Ko3fxw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""John Wayne Gacy, Jr.""</a>, albeit for none of the same reasons.</p>
<p>For real, I'd <i>love</i> to think Deer Tick are fighting the good fight or at least serve a necessary purpose as rock music skews increasingly meta. Even if it's essentially a Bloodhound Gang song, or ""TV Party"" for the kind of people who thought <i>Damaged </i> was an <i>endorsement</i> for alcoholism, I gotta admit I got a laugh out of the dumbshit chants of ""Let's All Go to the Bar""-- and if I ever find myself at a raging kegger in the near future, I won't hesitate to swap out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKZqGJONH68"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Red Solo Cup""</a> for it. But the problem is, almost none of the decadence on <i>Divine Providence </i> sounds like any fun at all, nor is it self-aware enough to serve as some sort of cautionary tale. Don't blame it on the Henny-- to name a few bands working in a similarly boozy milieu, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a> (the former band of guitarist Ian O'Neil) offer bracing unity, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">Hold Steady</a> great stories, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"" target=""_blank"">Drive-By Truckers</a> exponentially more empathy for the human condition. Deer Tick try to score points simply by sounding like they could drink all those bands under the table, and the self-absorbed and even downright hateful <i>Divine Providence </i> ends up drinking <i>at</i> you, not with you.</p></div>"|15965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15965-divine-providence/|3.9|Ian Cohen

His work to date has flitted between heavy-lidded rave-hop (it's easy enough to infer what the title of his <i>Magic Drops</i> 12"" refers to) and manic electronic funk (""Arpjam"", from the <i>Allstars</i> comp). I preferred the latter; crystalline techno pinging always seems a more difficult bar to hurdle than stoned beat-smithing. On his latest, five-track EP, <i>Waterworx</i>, Jam City paints in the bright, bold strokes that Night Slugs has made its name on while adopting a clarity and purposefulness he hasn't shown before.</p>
<p><i>Waterworx</i> reminds me of the work of second-wave Detroit techno producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28606-anthony-shakir/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir</a>. Craig and Shakir (and their peers) were in a unique spot: The techno sound had been developed, and they weren't necessarily beholden to it. They incorporated house and rave into their compositions. The result was often a level-headed brand of dance-funk that felt clean and precise. Jam City has no need for that scene's fantastical futurism-- <i>Waterworx</i> sounds very, very contemporary-- but it does borrow its linear beats and organized busyness.</p>
<p>Jam City pushes the melodic elements of his tracks to the fore, and the tracks are interesting in part because these elements are unlikely focal points. ""Aqua Box"" takes the recent proliferation of rave sirens and turns it on its head, offering a distended, zombie-fied bleat. An industrial hammer of a synth patch powers ""Countess""; the peeling scythe that interrupts it reminds me of the pitched strings in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7686-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-200-101/6/"" target=""_blank"">Britney Spears' ""Toxic""</a>. ""Waterfalls"" is softened by electric pianos and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Villalobos</a>-like chants. The only track that doesn't maintain this pattern is the widescreen ""Island"", which shoots chords toward the horizon then aims drum rolls at them. The bass on <i>Waterworx</i>-- thumping mallet hits, ever so slightly fuzzy-- confirm a producer who's spent his formative years in the bass scene but never became obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Though a good fit on the Night Slugs roster, <i>Waterworx</i> positions Jam City among artists like San Francisco's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29376-salva/"" target=""_blank"">Salva</a> and <span class=""st"">Nottingham's</span> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29381-lone/"" target=""_blank"">Lone</a> (he lacks Lone's knack for winding melodies) who have dropped bass music like an Alka-Seltzer into techno and rave. (There's lots of fizzing, and it may take a few years before they learn how to make it taste good.) <i>Waterworx</i> is an obvious step forward, the first clear sign of direction from an exciting talent.</p></div>"|15955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15955-waterworx/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

A couple of Chris Martin's good buddies memorably flipped this obscure bit of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBDoD-InUUE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Blades of Glory </i> dialogue</a> on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"" target=""_blank"">Watch the Throne</a></i> to annotate the purchase of Margiela jackets, but it's every bit as applicable to the title of <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> and speaks toward <a href=""http://www.coldplay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>'s lofty ambitions on it. A new Coldplay album is the sort of thing that's used as a health check for the record industry, and the band is very much aware that they could just release ""a new Coldplay album"" that would leave everyone involved satisfied-- this is essentially what happened on 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1541-xy/"" target=""_blank"">X&amp;Y</a></i>, their fastest seller and also their weakest LP according to many. But being criticized as bantamweight compared to peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> has clearly worn on them-- and truth is, they're all the better for their guilty conscience about a total lack of post-punk credentials. While Coldplay will always be more enjoyable than groundbreaking and their artistic advances seen as smart troubleshooting than divine intervention, <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> works because the band once again manages to sound like Coldplay without sounding like any of their previous LPs, maintaining their stadium-spanning grandeur while subtly challenging preconceptions.</p>
<p>While retaining the studio services and crucial cosign of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, it's a relief that their most carefully thought-out work initially sounds <i>less</i> ambitious than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11621-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends/"" target=""_blank"">Viva La Vida</a></i>, a record whose orchestral and political bombast felt at the very least a necessary act of aggressive rebranding. <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> is brighter in both attitude and especially timbre, sleeker, more emphatic and up to the task of being a capital-E Event. Though their collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> on ""Princess of China"" makes it all the more explicit, when you're at Coldplay's level, <i>pop</i> acts are your competition and <i>Mylo </i> places itself in a lineage of ultra-mainstream rock records spanning from <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13052-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</a></i>-- swaddled in synths and gilded by state-of-the-art production, but never too off-putting if you still insist that ""real music"" is played by men with guitars.</p>
<p>Indeed, the militant, pound-the-dashboard beat that powers ""Hurts Like Heaven"" sounds like the band jockeying for the Boss' nod of approval. It's a remarkably aerodynamic piece of all-purpose inspirational rock that never gets too pushy even with Martin's meaningful/meaningless proclamations (""You use your heart as a weapon/ And it hurts like heaven""), tweaking its classicist template with a slight Auto-Tune on the falsetto harmonies.<span> </span>Likewise, the imperial march of ""Paradise"" is wheelhouse Coldplay, as is Martin's unfortunate tendency to stretch out syllables for rhymes that really aren't worth saving.<span> </span>But its power has little to do with whatever Martin's going on about (dreaming of paradise, mostly)-- it's all about how they unabashedly flirt with contemporary R&amp;B production, cranking the drums way up in the mix and the massing the vocals on the chorus to overwhelming, Pavlovian effect. They don't want to completely do away with Coldplay qua Coldplay-- they're still four normal-looking guys who introduced themselves with frail post-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/"" target=""_blank"">The Bends</a> </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Britrock like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MwjX4dG72s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yellow""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHg-PhseKOQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Trouble""</a>.<span> </span>But they continually ask, why limit themselves to that?</span></p>
<p>Of course, some of their limitations aren't really a matter of choice. While there's no shortage of venomous carping at Coldplay's expense, I've never heard anyone complain about Jon Buckland's guitar tone or the rhythm section not being up to snuff. All sonic tinkering aside, Martin is still a full-time target serving as the perfect avatar for Coldplay, undeniably well-meaning, painfully earnest, and lord, does he <i>try</i>. When Martin tells you that <i>Mylo Xyloto </i> is a conceptual love story inspired by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Rose</a> movement and <i>The Wire</i>, don't you at least believe that <i>he</i> believes it? So he's still a sucker for big parables told like he's the first to come up with them-- the innocence lost on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a>-like stargazer ""Charlie Brown"" is documented awkwardly enough (""Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet/ Took a car downtown and took what they offered me""), even before you deal with the use of the <i>Peanuts</i> character as some sort of entry-level embodiment of adolescent purity. Likewise, though it's commendable that a multi-platinum band on its fifth record could make a swooning, waltz-time ballad called ""Us Against the World"" notable for not laying it on too thick, Martin pops off a line, ""Drunken like a Daniel in a lions' den,"" like someone who's somehow just managed to hear <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLk4vdY28Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hallelujah""</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>Still, the collection of softies is among their best-- the measured beauty of breakup weeper ""Up in Flames"" and ""U.F.O."" confidently update the guilelessness of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1539-parachutes/"" target=""_blank"">Parachutes</a> </i> through a self-described and self-explanatory ""Enoxification."" But maybe restraint's not what you're looking for out of a Coldplay album, and if that's the case, none of the ballads have the sort of shameless goosebump triggering of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI-o25K6B-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fix You""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWLpTKBFcU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Scientist""</a>. Which isn't to say that <i>Mylo </i> lacks populist thrill; it's just trying to mine alternative sources. They've sidled up toward music of more hedonistic ideals before, especially on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1538-a-rush-of-blood-to-the-head/"" target=""_blank"">A Rush of Blood to the Head</a></i>; Martin's vocals on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d020hcWA_Wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Clocks""</a> worked incredibly well filtered through dance remixes, while the ecstatic surge of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2qPxSUnOFg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Daylight""</a> really needed no translation. And thankfully, the revolutionary rhetoric of <i>Mylo</i> is based on love in this club rather than dope, guns, and fucking in the streets.</p>
<p>The aforementioned ""Princess of China"" is an insistent, mechanized grind that fits just as easily on <i>Mylo </i> as the next Rihanna album, though it wouldn't be a single-- everyone seems to be taking it just a <i>little</i> too seriously. The important thing is that it'll sound great at the Grammys. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15848-every-teardrop-is-a-waterfall/"" target=""_blank"">""Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall""</a> will surely work well as a festival closer: As a call to arms, it's pretty much nonsense, Martin's already infamous ""I'd rather be a comma than a full stop"" threatening to bring ""Teardrop"" to a dead halt. But then you remember Coldplay <i>aren't </i> just Martin-- it's Will Champion's kick drum guiding its four minutes of skyward propulsion, one of the cruelly underrated Buckland's pealing, major-key guitar leads (think <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb9X5jMofEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strawberry Swing""</a>), and, yes, Martin's wordless cooing coming together in a way that's <i>sui generis</i> Coldplay-- a band on top of a game they really don't have much competition in.</p>
<p>These are the moments I think about when people lament the lack of a monoculture-- so often we speak of indie bands that ""should be huge"" and songs that ""could be hits"" in an alternate universe. But with ""Teardrop"" and ""Hurts Like Heaven"", there's a thrill of knowing these songs can, should, and <i>will</i> be on the radio that you just can't recreate. With all due respect, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> shoot for a similar extroverted exhilaration on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</a></i>-- the penultimate electro rush of ""Don't Let It Break Your Heart"" proves both bands are ever closer to intersecting-- the idea that it could fill arenas still involves wishful thinking. It's still one man's project, whereas Coldplay was built for this from day one. It shouldn't matter, but it does-- while so many bands at their status revert to bloated contentment or some vague idea of rockist salvation, <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> finds Coldplay successfully continuing to explore the tension of wanting to be one of the best bands in the world and having to settle for being one of the biggest.</p></div>"|15953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15953-mylo-xyloto/|7.0|Ian Cohen

What about people who are totally passionate about dance music even if it's not their native language, who can tackle it with the fearlessness of musicians who love something but aren't of it? Stateside, the music of Talking Heads is one answer. Along with a host of American artists from the same time, they carved out a unique interstice between rock and dance-- not quite one or the other.<i> Fac. Dance</i> goes some way to answering those questions from the UK's perspective, and it's probably no coincidence that some of it mines the same vein as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a> before they discovered M.O.R. A collection of singles from (mostly) the early days of Factory Records, it's a glimpse of world where former wallflowers, whether one-time punks, or one-man avant acts suddenly found the possibilities of disco and post-disco club music too enticing to ignore.</p>
<p>For some, those possibilities were purely musical, a new set of compositional ideas to explore and formal rules to bend or break. On their 1985 single ""Boss Toyota Trouble"", Manchester post-punks Biting Tongues, featuring future members of Simply Red, Yargo, and 808 State, sound like an industrial band who got its wigs flipped by Middle Eastern music and Ethiopian jazz and gamelan, but who couldn't quite shake the perversity that leads people to form industrial bands in the first place. Two inclusions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a> are just jittery and uptempo variations on Vini Reilly's usual plangent and gorgeous brand of guitar-based instrumental music, seeming to have wandered in from a completely different compilation. In each case, the communal qualities of dance music get short-circuited, in both interesting and ""interesting"" ways, by artists too individualist to join any club night that'd have them as a member.</p>
<p>And sometimes this formalist fucking around just leads to jokes that burn themselves as quickly as you'd expect. Experimental jazz-rock group Blurt founded by poet/puppeteer <span class=""st"">Ted Milton</span>, for example, certainly earn their name, their 1980 track <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BIYqeed3Eg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Puppeteer""</a> featuring an early hip-hop groove where the MC is replaced by an imitation of a mentally ill ranter who owns a cheap saxophone. It's a curious artifact of one of those rare moments when bands felt the compulsion to experiment with whatever was in the cultural air around them, but ultimately that's all it is, like a lot of the stuff collected here to pad things out to two discs (the inclusion of such tracks when the comp has nothing by New Order doesn't help).</p>
<p>For other Factory artists, though, dance music became both an experiment in new sounds <i>and</i> their first real attempt to make records that met the needs of an audience who wanted to do more than nod with approval at the innovation on display. This is the impulse that animates the bulk of <i>Fac. Dance</i>, and it's why the compilation is worth hearing. Dance music can be many things, but to actually <i>be</i> dance music, it's got to be, you know, funky. You can't impede the groove, whether out of nervousness or perversity or indifference. What's most surprising is how many of these artists, a lot of them reared more on the pogo than the hustle, made these tracks into real-deal <i>dance</i> music that also served as experimental tape collages or extended trance-rock jams.</p>
<p>Section 25's legendary but only intermittently available-for-purchase 1984 B-Side <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGATFOcVjo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Looking From a Hilltop (Megamix)""</a> is, on one level, pure street-level electro of the glassy and inhuman sort that was everywhere in the early 1980s. But the tension comes from the way it seamlessly weaves in the abrasive, clanging post-punk Factory was first known for, jolting you out of dancefloor hypnosis without disturbing that groove. Section 25 and a few other Factory artists also helped not to break but to <i>extend</i> the rules enough to help create the next wave of dance. It's telling that <i>Fac. Dance</i> cuts off at 1987, a year before acid house took parts of Factory's later, compulsive, electro-driven sound and remade the dance mainstream. However out-there or abrasive it gets, much of <i>Fac. Dance</i> is also stuff that still worked for clubbers, mostly young ones hungry for something new, in New York and Detroit as much as Manchester and London, kids who saw group revelry as the whole point of pop.</p>
<p>Note, for example, how many tracks here are the ""New York Mix"" version, with Factory also drafting in U.S. producers like Jellybean Benitez as the label's records became international DJ tools and its artists began making pilgrimages to New York studios to learn the ropes, often leaving any lingering trace of their punk past behind. One representative and truly obscure American inclusion,  the Hood's 1987 cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATfV7tkNL0s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Salvation! (Nitromix)""</a> is pure early freestyle/electro, that simultaneously most machine-driven and most pop brand of mid-80s dance, denigrated by old heads but integral to all the house and techno tweaks that would follow. Much of <i>Fac. Dance</i> probably wasn't considered ""true"" dance music by certain disco aesthetes at the time. But its fearlessness, its untrueness, helped in a small way to invent the future we're still living through.</p></div>"|15963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15963-fac-dance-factory-records-12-mixes-rarities-1980-1987/|7.5|Jess Harvell

The 2007 effort made it onto my <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6738-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Show No Mercy year-end list</a> and didn't leave my stereo for long stretches. It followed 2003's <i>Through the Ashes of Empires</i>, a solid enough return to form that came on the heels of a couple of misdirected nu/rap-metal duds-- 1999's <i>The Burning Red</i> and 2001's <i>Supercharger</i>. Which is why <i>The Blackening</i> caught a lot of other folks off guard, too. Once someone flirts with Limp Bizkit territory (and then feuds with Fred Durst and friends), it's usually safe to stop paying attention. In that sense, <i>The Blackening</i> was a revelation. I was drawn to its ambitious sprawl and its dark, angry scowls; its impressive scope, melodies, vastness, and unexpected changes. There was no attempt to make it easy: The opener was close to 11 minutes long, the closer not much shorter, and a couple of the tracks went over nine. The sound, too, was huge-- enough so that, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6583-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">at the time</a>, I said the Oakland group was more mainstream than my usual taste. I meant ""stadium-sized.""</p>
<p>Album seven, <i>Unto the Locust</i>, is just as big as <i>The Blackening</i>, but it feels tighter, more easily digested, and yet somehow pleasingly rougher around the edges. As a whole, I ultimately prefer its predecessor, but <i>Unto the Locust</i>'s highs go places only hinted at on the earlier collection. See, for instance, opener, ""I Am Hell (Sonata in C#)"", an eight-minute, three-movement anthem that starts, somberly, with a mass of <span class=""st"">a cappella voices</span>, Flynn singing elegantly in Latin about a female arsonist. A few moments later, the band cruises into a violent explosion, Flynn's voice shifting into rawer thrash mode. This is the sort of transition that would be easy to fuck up, but Machine Head pull it off. From there, the seven-song, 50-minute collection slows down for a number of these sort of curve ball intros before breaking open into magisterial head-bangers.</p>
<p>There are curious details worth pointing out-- overlapping guitar and cello, the repeated use of a string quartet, crazy time signatures, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a>-style children's choir-- but none of this would matter much if the material weren't strong enough to contain these elements. (Machine Head are still very heavy, they've just done away with their earlier template.) Despite the length of these songs, <i>Unto the Locust</i> is focused, with memorable choruses, expressive riffs, escalating dynamics, and swarming instrumentation. Crunching floor punching shifts easily into acoustic madrigals. Classical moments turn into vintage thrash. The guitar solos are expressive and self-contained but deepen the rest of the track. Standout ""Be Still and Know"" opens with ultra-technical, dueling double soloing topped only by the track's huge chorus. There, and elsewhere, you get clean vocals messing with and cascading alongside raspy howls. At its best, this music is invigorating, urgent, necessary.</p>
<p><i>Unto the Locust</i> does fall off a bit toward the end, but that's largely because the first four tracks add up to just under 30 minutes of the most exciting metal you'll hear all year. (""Pearls Before the Swine"" is a solid enough thrasher and the anthemic closer ""Who We Are"" features the first use of kids in a rock context in ages that hasn't made me wince, though we could've done without the nu metal-ish ""Darkness Within"".) All told, like <i>Master of Puppets</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Metallica</a>, Machine Head are able to intelligently realize their ambition, weaving risky, progressive elements into the mix without forgoing their roots.</p></div>"|15978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15978-unto-the-locust/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

And yet, the masses have been mostly resistant to their charms-- the London group first surfaced in 2005 in the shadow of the similarly seedy but more widely celebrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"" target=""_blank"">Kills</a>, while the ensuing years have seen upstart acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28571-the-joy-formidable/"" target=""_blank"">the Joy Formidable</a> emerging with more bombastic, attention-grabbing takes on shared noise-pop influences.</p>
<p>The title of the Duke Spirit's third album would suggest they're tired of being relegated to second-class <i>NME</i> citizenry and ready to show the kids who's boss. But <i>Bruiser</i>-- produced by alt-rock spit-shiner Andrew Scheps-- feels oddly restrained, as the band sounds caught between the duelling desires to hold onto its grit-rock roots and to make its sound more sophisticated. The Duke Spirit have always attempted a tricky balancing act in their music--between the classic and the modern, the dissonant and the accessible, the decadent and the elegant-- but sometimes you wish they'd forsake this mode of controlled tension and give in to more extreme tendencies. Early singles ""Love Is an Unfamiliar Name"" and ""Cuts Across the Land"" weren't exactly textbook-definition ragers, but they still possessed a certain thrust, swing, and vigor; by contrast, <i>Bruiser</i> salvos ""Cherry Tree"" and ""Procession"" are set to lumbering, mid-tempo backbeats that don't provide the band with much opportunity to catch fire and push the Duke Spirit perilously close to run-of-the-mill mid-2000s modern rock. (The pomped-up power ballad ""Northbound"" doesn't do them any favors in that regard either, sounding a few years too late for an <i>O.C.</i> prom-scene placement.)</p>
<p>But if <i>Bruiser</i>'s more straightforward rock turns mostly disappoint (one notable exception: the late-game adrenaline shot ""Everybody's Under Your Spell""), the album does find the band showcasing its dynamic range in new and intriguing ways, from the winning ""Villain""-- the sort of sly, piano-rolled lullaby <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6523-nina-persson/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Persson</a> might've brought to a latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/682-the-cardigans/"" target=""_blank"">Cardigans</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8596-a-camp/"" target=""_blank"">A Camp</a> record-- to ""Sweet Bitter Sweet"", a solitary blues that blossoms into a theatrical show-stopper. Best of all is ""Bodies"", which makes great use of a stalking bassline and Moss' reverbed voice to set a grimly atmospheric scene, the creeping unease eventually manifesting itself into a powerful, almost stoner-metalesque surge. It's a rare instance where <i>Bruiser</i> lives up to its titular threat, but given this album's near-50/50 split between chugging rockers and elaborate, downcast balladry, it's safe to say that, at this point, the Duke Spirit are becoming ever more interested in cataloguing emotional wounds as leaving physical ones.</p></div>"|15960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15960-the-duke-spirit/|6.5|Stuart Berman

Though the band was originally founded as Kluster in 1969 at Berlin's Zodiak Free Arts Lab under the leadership of Conrad Schnitzler, it quickly became the project of Dieter Mobius and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"" target=""_blank"">Hans-Joachim Roedelius</a>. Together, this pair created one of the most singular and distinguished catalogs in electronic music, often working with collaborators, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, Conny Plank, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8798-michael-rother/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Rother</a> (with whom they had a side project called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28030-harmonia-eno-76/"" target=""_blank"">Harmonia</a>), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/880-holger-czukay/"" target=""_blank"">Holger Czukay</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4337-asmus-tietchens/"" target=""_blank"">Asmus Tietchens</a>. By the time Cluster took a break, Roedelius was already nine albums into a parallel solo career, on which he'd developed his own brand of calm, inward-gazing ambient music.</p>
<p>Odd, then, that on his second post-Cluster LP, 1982's <i>Wasser Im Wind</i>, he should have worked so diligently to sound a lot like Cluster. He dug out the Drummer One drum machine that was one of the group's signature sounds in its early days and crafted a series of keyboard sounds very similar to the ones he might have used in the early-to-mid 1970s. The resemblance is more than superficial, though. The convergence of strict, steady rhythm and drifting, amorphous melody on <i>Wasser Im Wind</i> has close relatives on <i>Zuckerzeit</i> and <i>Sowiesoso</i>. It's almost as if, one year removed from Cluster, he felt the need to go back and look around and make sure everything was still there.</p>
<p>Think about going back to look at a house you lived in long ago, one that's been occupied by another family for years. Provided they haven't done some sort of tear-down, it's going to look familiar, and yet somehow off. The bush they removed, the tree they planted, the new siding they put on. When Roedelius goes back home to check on Cluster a year later, he doesn't quite find the place he remembers. One of the first sounds that collides with that ticky, sort of muffled drum machine programming is a few little figures tumbling out of the middle octaves of a piano, which points toward his later work, and on several tracks, he's joined by a saxophonist named Czjzek, who haunts these songs with a tone that sometimes makes his instrument sound strangely ancient.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive things about the album is the variety Roedelius conjures using very basic ingredients. Drummer One may have been a limited machine, but he knew how to get a lot out of it, and he gets further mileage out of it by EQ-ing and tweaking the timbre of the clicks and thumps to make each beat feel very different. The standout track is ""Auf des Tigers Spur"", which goes some way toward predicting the complex ambient sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"" target=""_blank"">the Orb</a>'s 1995 album <i>Orbus Terrarum</i> with its dense mix of pulses, drifting melodies, and sequenced melodic figures. Like the other songs, it rises and falls with no sharply defined beginning, middle, or end, but as you take in the album as a whole, there is something satisfying about that structure. These are songs that feel as though they shouldn't have sharp beginnings, middles, and endings: They lift the curtain and lower it again on something already in progress, something that could conceivably still be in progress.</p></div>"|15946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15946-wasser-im-wind/|7.6|Joe Tangari

As in, it's impossible to discuss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a>'s sophomore album, <i>Audio, Video, Disco</i> without noting just how thoroughly the Parisian duo has adopted the brash sounds of late-1970s progressive rock. The referents-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4711-yes/"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a> for turbulent guitar lines, Goblin for sly italo beats, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"">Queen</a> for unapologetic bombast-- jump off the plastic, announcing that Justice will not re-hash the ornery, clubby obelisks that defined <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10321-justice/"" target=""_blank"">†</a></i>. Their new direction is precocious, brave, and surprising even if it damns them by placing emphasis on qualities-- arrangement, fidelity, patience-- that Justice lack.</p>
<p>Though it sparked a still-running debate about the duo's credentials, <i>†</i>, by accessing unexplored levels of sleaze and cheese, actually fit into dance music's long, proud tradition of not giving a fuck. That they did this in a rock context-- leather jackets; big live show; loud, terrible mastering-- seemed at the time reverent of peak-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> but in retrospect appears prescient: Deadmau5 and Skrillex headline festivals, hellbent on teasing out the most seizure-inducing mix of lighting and music possible. In 2011 anyone looking to beef about ""real"" dance music stares into a smaller barrel filled with bigger fish.</p>
<p>In this way, <i>AVD</i> is a natural progression for Justice. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: #ffffff;"">Their M.O. is bold irreverence, and they've found multiple ways to express it.</span> Still, it's hard not to admire their choice: It threatens to alienate their core audience while endearing them to a group of fans unlikely to take up their cause (or realize they exist). Prog-rock has long been championed by experimental music fans for its complexity and ambition-- it was outsider art that made the mistake of actually selling records.</p>
<p>Prog remains a mostly unclaimed orphan of rock history, and while certain corners of the indie establishment-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1602-the-fiery-furnaces/"" target=""_blank"">Fiery Furnaces</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>-- have adopted its structure and imagination, they've left the flute solos behind. (Dance acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27634-aeroplane/"" target=""_blank"">Aeroplane</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28956-wolfram/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfram</a> have mined this territory to mixed effect.) Justice take the opposite tack: <i>AVD</i> is composed of short, simple tracks stuffed with stairway-climbing solos, ascendant male vocalists, and starry-skied bridges. The duo has called <i>AVD</i> a ""daylight"" album, presumably in contrast with <i>†</i>'s nocturnal vibe. But just like a low-lit club can mask flaws, Justice's full-bore wall-of-dance bulldozed some of their compositional shortcomings. <i>AVD</i> is brighter and more diffuse (though, sadly, its recording style is no more dynamic), but the light shining through does Justice no favors.</p>
<p>It's easy to admire progressive rock for its immersion and commitment to concept, as well as its musical prowess and scope. These are, sadly, the elements Justice strip away. Instead, they employ prog's sounds in short, distracting bursts, filling <i>AVD</i> with melodies that are curious but difficult to remember or enjoy. They do this in the style they know how-- <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px; background-color: #ffffff;"">with hoary, space-eating electronics</span>-- which suggests supreme digital craftsmanship but doesn't do the listener any favors. The guitars sounds are uniformly shrill, the bass flatulent, the rhythms rudimentary.</p>
<p>They employ singers more frequently than on <i>†</i>: male voices, pinched and bleating. I won't do you the disservice of examining their lyrics (they're hardly the point, for Justice or for us), but suffice to say they don't add much. <i>AVD</i>'s finest moment is the title track, in which a voice is digitally manipulated into a current of high-strung, winsome tunefulness. ""Helix"", their most blatant disco move, is robotically funky, a reminder of what Justice are capable of when they commit fully to Daft pyrotechnics.</p>
<p>The majority of <i>AVD</i>, though, is cheese-rock signifiers dressed up as dance music. Once you get over the fact that the band got a little Cerrone in your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzdgU_kpGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kashmir""</a> (""On'n'on"") or spiked your <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Moroder</a> with Toto (""Horsepower"") there's little reason to come back to AVD. Immersing yourself in the record is an exercise in liking Justice as a concept more while liking their actual output less. There's too much space between <i>AVD</i> and actual prog to accept that Justice are committed to this direction. They spent all their daring on concept, with little to spare for execution. Even for a duo as image-conscious and savvy as these guys, there is little style in their reduction.</p></div>"|15966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/|5.3|Andrew Gaerig

English-born Paul Rose has historically been one of the earliest agents of this dubstep disintegration, making the move to techno haven Berlin early and establishing an interest in the genre that soon became commonplace among many of his genre contemporaries. Founding what would become one of the leading institutions in the techno/dubstep fusion with his <a href=""http://www.hotflushrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hotflush Recordings</a> label and unprecedentedly landing a residency at the world's most infamous techno club, Berghain, Rose-- better known as Scuba, SCB, or Spectr-- has been a leading light in dissolving the boundaries between different worlds of dance music.</p>
<p>But no matter how experimental or cross-boundary this particular sphere of music gets, there's always a line drawn between all these iterations of ""bass music"" and what might be considered ""proper"" techno and house. It's the reason why Rose splits his time between Scuba (bass music) and SCB (straight-up techno), why his <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=198"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">memorable RA podcast</a> was a ""versus"" between his alter egos, and why his SUB:STANCE club night happens on Fridays at Berghain and not Saturdays. It's the reason why his only previous commercial <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/"" target=""_blank"">mix CD</a> as Scuba focused almost exclusively on dubstep-centric sounds with none of SCB trickling in. But all bets are off with Rose's contribution to the long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series, where that border fence between ""bass"" and techno is finally demolished. Mixing genres isn't anything out of the ordinary anymore (in fact, it's pretty much expected), but rarely do we see this kind of flitting between extremes in such a small and confined space.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to say that the overarching theme here is techno, but it's a weird sort of techno. Even when we get big names like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/"" target=""_blank"">Surgeon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28849-marcel-dettmann/"" target=""_blank"">Marcel Dettmann</a>, we're not given chunky workouts or sleek, streamlined bangers, but the militarist thrust of ""The Power of Doubt"" and the jerky IDM of ""Captivate"". Rose prefers these album cuts over easily more functional single material from either producer, which says a lot about his outside-the-box approach here. Forgoing both the instant-gratification quick mixing of bass music DJs and the lengthy blends of Berlin techno jocks, the tracks feel like they're melting in and out of each other, which means their generic signifiers melt away as well.  Rose's style is a fastidious ebb and flow of microscopic beat-stitching. Structurally, Scuba's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> throws another curveball: It doesn't build toward any particular climax, nor is it centered around the ""drop"" structure inherent to most bass music. The closest we get are the bits of warm melody that seep in with tracks like Braille's jazzy ""Breakup"" or Mr. Beatnick's elegant G-funk epic ""Don't Walk Away From My Love"".</p>
<p>Lately Rose's own productions have been moving into house territory, slowing below even the accepted median ""bass"" tempo of 130 beats per minute (as theorized by Pitchfork's own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7965-grime-dubstep/%22%20http://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7965-grime-dubstep/"" target=""_blank"">Martin Clark</a>). What this means is that his mix plays the aural illusion of actually <i>slowing down</i> over the course of its duration: where most DJs would gradually ratchet up the tempo, Rose drags it down from a healthy 132 BPM to a leisurely 125, right where his newest tracks sit. The descent is deceptive, because the mix comes closer to anthemic as it slows: The CD-exclusive ""M.A.R.S"" is an uncharacteristically happy-go-lucky banger, and it's followed by a rousing selection of house producers like Recondite, Jichael Mackson, and Rivet, previously unassociated with either Scuba or SCB.</p>
<p>No late-2011 Scuba mix would be complete without his controversial <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/k7-records/scuba-adrenalin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a>, and <i>DJ-Kicks </i>finally delivers it. The track is given a five-minute spotlight, a gratuitous move for an equally gratuitous track touching on the untouchable: The pariah genres of prog house and trance are fastened with the most decadent breakdown you've heard since you used to listen to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3696-sasha/"" target=""_blank"">Sasha</a>. Leaving ""Adrenalin"" to the end of the mix is perhaps the only predictable moment on Paul Rose's <i>DJ-Kicks, </i>a disc that's otherwise determined in its mission to keep you on your toes, knitting complex percussive webs and blending genres at a reckless rate that feels like a new gold standard for an already bled-through music world. It might be just a mix CD, but Scuba's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> is a landmark both personal and scene-wide. It shouldn't come as a surprise though, because Paul Rose is just leading the pack like he's always done.</p></div>"|15928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15928-dj-kicks/|8.0|Andrew Ryce

Ryland Wharton, aka <a href=""http://www.eyewashsilver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Blood</a>, has taken the latter viewpoint to a mesmerizing extreme. On <i>Eyewash Silver</i>-- originally released in a tiny edition in 2010-- he treats fuzzy guitar riffs not simply as ends, but as mantras to be chanted and monuments to be worshiped. Each track offers one simple figure devoutly repeated, as if musical nirvana is always just one more riff away.</p>
<p>If I'm making <i>Eyewash Silver</i> sound too solemn or reverent, don't worry-- it's also a lot of fun. Wharton's clanging chords never feel dry or studied. Instead they're charged with an impulsive exuberance. Often it sounds like he came up with a guitar loop right before he hit record on his four-track, and was so excited that he didn't want to waste another second before churning away. That feel is enhanced by muddy, static-drenched production. The album drips with overload, creating a raw, gut-level immediacy. The idea behind each song is delivered unwashed and unrefined.</p>
<p>In that sense, <i>Eyewash Silver</i> reminds me of Neil Young, particularly his solo guitar <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx3ajYfbzcw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtrack</a> to Jim Jarmusch's 1995 existential western <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead Man</a></i>. Wharton's songs aren't nearly as sparse or forlorn as Young's score, but both share a near-anthropological fascination with the primal force of repeated notes. (Besides, the swinging hooks of ""Poison in Jest"" and ""Sinfull Woman"" sound extracted and extended from Crazy Horse tunes). You'll hear other reference points throughout <i>Eyewash Silver</i>-- the noisy wash of Japanese bands like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushitsusha"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fushitsusha</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rallizes_D%C3%A9nud%C3%A9s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Les Rallizes Denudes</a>, the motor-garage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"">Wooden Shjips</a>, and, on the near-perfect <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1G4OvcIn1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""End of a Primitive""</a>, the classic amp-melt of great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a> bootlegs. But I keep coming back to Young and his exploratory wanderings, a standard to which Wharton measures up well.</p>
<p>The only flaw you might find in <i>Eyewash Silver </i>is the claustrophobic effect its relentless distortion can create. Sometimes after I've listened to it repeatedly, it's taken me a while to shake the feeling that I'm wearing earmuffs. But this also gives the album a world-apart feel-- it's unlikely you'll get distracted by anything else while this album is on. Besides, even if you can't bear to hear King Blood over and over, one listen to its echoing riffs might make you feel like you have.</p></div>"|15967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15967-eyewash-silver/|7.5|Marc Masters

This record originally came out in 1979, just a few years after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> was in his pomp with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0h8Pjf4vNM&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel Love""</a>, and during a time when the ""disco sucks"" campaign was gathering momentum. This isn't a disco record, but it leans hard on the kind of arpeggiated synths Moroder often favored, and occasionally acts as a precursor to the kind of spacey club jams <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a> dabbled in around this time. It was certainly made during a period when dark clouds loomed over anything bridging the unholy triumvirate of dance, pop, and electronic music. Imagine Ann Magnuson of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bongwater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bongwater</a> teaming up with Russell in a dingy studio in Reagan-era New York City and you're close to grasping how <i>The Ann Steel Album</i> sounds.</p>
<p>So who are Roberto Cacciapaglia and Ann Steel? The former is an Italian musician who specialized in electronic composition after starting his career in the early 1970s on the edges of the krautrock scene. The latter is a Michigan-bred singer who spun into Cacciapaglia's orbit during a trip to Italy in the 1970s to do some modeling. <i>The Ann Steel Album</i> is the one-off result of that happy accident, a record so full of joy that it's a surprise they weren't tempted to go back for another bite once it was in the can. But it's a credit to both of them that they knew when to stop, perhaps feeling that the sugary pop perfection of these recordings could never be replicated. There's a clunky charm to many of the synth sounds, most of which influenced bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> and the perennially underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a> in future years; Steel even has a strain to her voice that's reminiscent of Pram singer Rosie Cuckston.</p>
<p>There are two modes that Cacciapaglia and Steel flit between on this album. Mostly it's a precise brand of fizzy avant-electronica with a utopian edge to it (""My Time"", ""Media""), set to lyrics about metaphysics, Freud, Warhol, the media, candy bars, and a huge range of pop culture marginalia. Albert Einstein gets a mention in both of the first two tracks, preceding a brief trend for writing songs about him (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZqUNEHYZgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Landscape</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHTDkJ-bQqM&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Audio Dynamite</a>) in the 80s. The second type of song on <i>The Ann Steel Album</i> echoes the kind of ruminative electronic work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a> would pick up on in future years, with tracks like ""Quite Still"" and ""Sparkling World"" set around half-paced beats and blotchy keyboard noise. But it's in the upbeat work that the pair really excels, and the basic formula is often retooled to work in other elements such as the funk undertow of ""Portrait"" and the unabashed <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/ABBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ABBA</a> tributary of ""Media"", which give the album a broad range of colors that help overcome Steel's limited (and endearingly squeaky) voice.</p>
<p>One of the strongest and most interesting songs comes at the center of the record in the shape of ""Measurable Joys"", which works as Cacciapaglia and Steel's paean to the completely synthetic world they long to inhabit. The lyrics condemn nature, punk, poetry, and even stained-glass windows, while praise is heaped on artifice, precision, technology, and TV. It's a song that works in two ways, both as a critique of the traditionalists crushing hard on the heels of musicians working in a certain strain of electronic music at the time, and as a harbinger of what was to come. After all, in a few years following <i>The Ann Steel Album</i> the pair almost got their wish, with the European charts awash with bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3859-soft-cell/"" target=""_blank"">Soft Cell</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7221-the-human-league/"" target=""_blank"">the Human League</a>, and other starry-eyed forward thinkers. But this record works somewhere on the fringes of pop, as a distant cousin to commercially successful songs with an off-kilter hue like the <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Rah+Band"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rah Band</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4R97AeM6IE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Clouds Across the Moon""</a> or <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dollar"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dollar</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMQZHpZjaM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand Held in Black and White""</a>, where its reputation has deservedly grown to something approximating cult-classic status.</p></div>"|15947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15947-the-ann-steel-album/|7.6|Nick Neyland

And the shadow of the California compulsive's most famous band's unfinished work seems to loom over <i>He Thinks He's People</i>, Crow's fourth solo effort. <i>People</i> got its start as something of a warm-up for Pinback's long-awaited follow-up to 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10656-autumn-of-the-seraphs/"" target=""_blank"">Autumn of the Seraphs</a></i>; a relatively modest affair, at times almost seeming as though it's saving its strength. But, while People doesn't set its sights especially high, as another showcase of Crow's multifaceted, pinprick-pristine songcraft-- and a sort of low-key sneak preview of the new Pinback LP-- it's a small success.</p>
<p><i>People</i> primarily draws from murkily precise post-grunge and morose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>-style balladry, cut with hints of hardcore, power-pop, and prog. Crow's laconic delivery gives the LP its distinctive mark; with a calm smirk, he centers the music, allowing a blast of spazz-punk to sit comfortably alongside a bit of intricate acoustic fretwork. Cloudy and labyrinthine at times, airy and placid elsewhere, <i>People</i> cuts a pretty wide swath, an approach that feels a bit more mature and confident than the bending over backwards he sometimes had to do to reach the disparate genres on his earlier solo records.</p>
<p>But one can't quite shake the feeling that a lot of these songs haven't been given the fleshing out they should have. One of <i>People</i>'s finest moment, <i>Either/Or</i>-nodding self-effacer ""Pat's Cabs"", matches a descending strum to a downtrodden melody that, halfway through, transforms itself, its quiet desperation taking a sharp turn toward the rousing. All this happens in just 65 seconds; then it's over, onto the chiming ""So Way"". This could've been the record's centerpiece, melodically rich and deeply moving; instead, it's something of a tease, just on the cusp of affecting. It's rare that Crow lets you get comfortable in a track before letting it veer into the next one, which-- when coupled with its frequent tone shifts-- lends the record a somewhat sketchbook-like quality. As ever, Crow is an impressive arranger, his claustrophobic compositions offer just enough room to uncoil, and even when the songs feel dashed-off, they rarely sound it. The driving ""Build"" isn't much of a tune, but it gets by on sheer propulsion. And while the knottier, Pinbackier stuff like ""Tranked"" or ""Prepare to be Mined"" don't quite affix themselves to your skull the way the best of that band's output can, one can certainly see why they were up for consideration.</p>
<p>Sweeping post-punker ""Locking Seth Putnam in a Hot Topic"" (a tribute of sorts to the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29737-anal-cunt/"" target=""_blank"">Anal Cunt</a> frontman) ushers in a late-LP shift that largely continues through the rickety ""I'd Like to Be There"" and the dewy sheen of ""Hangnailed"". This sequence finds Crow easing up on the tricky rhythms and the guitar tangles that are his stock-in-trade, drawing on Americana for inspiration, and bringing its dinger first half out into the late-afternoon light. These lilting, levity-imbued tunes never once feel like they're waiting on Crow to complete his thought, nor are they auditioning for a walk-on role in Pinback's next one; rather, they send the record out on a high, finally fixing on that warmth Crow sought from <i>People</i>. Now he's got some work to do.</p></div>"|15958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15958-he-thinks-hes-people/|6.5|Paul Thompson

It was an apt, even poignant title that still never managed to evoke half the wistfulness its paperback replacement did. Marcus' disciples quickly rallied around the new phrase, adopting it as a kind of credo, a genre, and an aspirational aesthetic that owed as much to Robert Frank and Jack Kerouac as it did to Charley Patton and the Carter Family. <span> </span>And while collective cultural nostalgia (for times real or imagined) has become part of the zeitgeist, longing for a dusty and peculiar past-- for the misbegotten and the unfussed-with, the archaic and the odd-- isn't a particularly new phenomenon. Marcus sought and found those things in pre-war vernacular American music, in the songs Smith culled from his crates of 78s and gathered under a Celestial Monochord. <a href=""http://www.tomwaits.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a> hears them everywhere.</p>
<p><i>Bad as Me</i> is Waits' first proper collection of studio material since 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8565-real-gone/"" target=""_blank"">Real Gone</a></i> (in 2006, he released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9661-orphans-brawlers-bawlers-bastards/"" target=""_blank"">Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers &amp; Bastards</a></i>, a 3xCD mélange of lost-and-found tracks). He's backed by a cabal of familiar, gnarly-faced noisemakers (David Hildalgo, longtime bandleader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3571-marc-ribot/"" target=""_blank"">Marc Ribot</a>, Keith Richards, Flea), and again shares writing and producing credit with his wife and frequent collaborator Kathleen Brennan. Waits' jerky grandpa bark, which he'd honed and perfected by his mid-twenties, was reverse-engineered to age well. Now, perhaps freed from the burden of approximation, he sounds especially wild and gleeful, hollering with deranged aplomb. <i>Bad as Me</i> is as essential-- and as essentially weird-- as anything he's done before.</p>
<p><i>Bad as Me</i> comprises mostly love songs: paeans to lasting love, the kind that changes and bends. Even when Waits is yearning for freedom, as he does on the drunk and twitchy ""Get Lost"", he still wants his longtime girl by his side. ""When you wear that real tight sweater/ You know I can't resist/ It's been that way forever baby/ Ever since we kissed,"" he croons, his voice raw and giddy; he sounds like a guy who was pummeled by a car, got up, staggered off, and started singing. On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43602-new-tom-waits-bad-as-me/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, over piano, baritone sax, and spastic guitar stabs, he celebrates mutual failure (""You're mother superior in only a bra/ You're the same kind of bad as me""), positioning compatible sin as its own triumph over circumstance. <span> </span>Elsewhere, he adheres to old-fashioned ideals about the ""power of a good woman's love,"" lamenting, as he does on the ramshackle ""Raised Right Men"", the ways in which imperfect husbands (""Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George, Ice Pick Ed Newcomb"") routinely fail their partners.</p>
<p>None of this is particularly new lyrical or musical fodder for Waits, and, nearly 20 records in, he's clearly locked into a formula-- however atypical, however idiosyncratic-- he's not particularly keen to abandon (read enough interviews, and you'll also see him trotting out the same stock punchlines-- and you'll still laugh). Still, he does push his voice here, and to wildly gratifying ends. On ""Talking at the Same Time"", a woozy, horn-accented shuffle (it evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Ennio Morricone</a>, David Lynch, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>), he adopts a soft, wheezing falsetto, while on ""Pay Me"", he sounds docile and sleepy, like he's singing from bed (it's a heartbreaking choice for a track that contains the admission, ""They pay me not to come home"").</p>
<p>As with any Tom Waits album, there are a few absurd affectations at work, both on record and off (in a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/arts/music/tom-waitss-new-album-bad-as-me.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent <i>New York Times</i> profile</a>, Waits is caught driving a black Suburban with a newspaper announcing the inauguration of John F. Kennedy spread across the passenger seat) but there's enough variation here that all that oldness and weirdness-- all those frantic, busted melodies, all that carnie growl, all those sarsaparilla bottles banging around the backseat-- never gets tiresome. For all his indulgences, Waits never lingers too long; these tracks are concise and expertly edited, and <i>Bad as Me</i> feels as new as it does ancient.</p></div>"|15961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15961-bad-as-me/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

So it would seem. ""Ready"" launches <i>Tarot Classics</i>, Surfer Blood's first proper release since early 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Astro Coast</a></i>. Title aside, it's a modest effort, four sturdy pop-rockers, 15 easy minutes. Blithely confident, <i>Astro Coast</i>'s sunsoaked power-pop found Surfer Blood blowing through one breezily bulbous hook and escapist lyric after another. <i>Tarot Classics</i> finds Surfer Blood throwing a little shade.</p>
<p>With its so-bright-you'll-squint melody and bummer-in-the-summer vibe, ""I'm Not Ready"" would've fit just fine almost anywhere on <i>Astro Coast</i>. But its crisp handclaps and neon guitars belie a serious compositional sophistication, a seemingly endless string of bridges charting the path to the song's bounding hook. ""Your mouth is running off now that you've seen a few things,"" Pitts admonishes, and ""don't get too big for your britches"" seems in some ways <i>Tarot Classics</i>' guiding principle. As on <i>Astro Coast</i>, they seem confident in their every move but unwilling to take on more than they can handle.</p>
<p>First single<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12305-miranda/"" target=""_blank""> ""Miranda""</a> is a bit of a blur, highlighted by its a rousing guitar break, its one-word chorus (hint: it's a girl's name), and a more-than-passable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> impression from Pitts. The hints of Anglophilia that emerge on ""Miranda"" and through the rest of <i>Tarot Classics</i> are, in many ways, their biggest step away from the distinctly American roots (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Boys</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/732-cheap-trick/"" target=""_blank"">Cheap Trick</a>) of <i>Astro Coast</i>. Pitts' voice wears this somewhat dolorous tone every bit as well as he did <i>Astro Coast</i>'s shouty Brian Wilsonisms, and the band follows suit, lending a richly textured, slightly overcast New Romantic lean to the proceedings that feels deeper-- if a bit less retina-searing-- than the brasher <i>Astro Coast</i>.</p>
<p>""Voyager Reprise"" takes off slowly, eventually settling into a shuffly, somewhat morose melody and dance-night-at-the-pub groove pitched somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a> and those early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">Cure</a> singles. <i></i>It's aching melody amplified by that newfound gravity in Pitts' voice, ""Voyager"" certainly feels like Surfer Blood's first truly sad song, the longing in its simply stated chorus impossible to miss. Closer ""Drinking Problem"" is alternately <i>Tarot Classics</i>' highlight and its least characteristic track, a lush, staggering bit of New Romantic pop that finds Pitts switching out the Moz for a Bernard Sumnerian swoon not unlike that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28702-kisses/"" target=""_blank"">Kisses</a> frontman Jesse Kivel. A shimmering synth melody buoys the aching Pitts, reassuring himself with, ""at least I know who my friends are,"" every utterance sounding less and less convinced of itself.</p>
<p>A year and change on the road finds Pitts seeming a bit guarded, picking at the long-term scars of short-term affairs, questioning everyone's motivations, starting with his own. But if he's undergoing some crisis of confidence, it's not shared by his bandmates; like <i>Astro Coast</i>, <i>Tarot Classics</i>' popcraft proves well beyond promising, and these songs are certainly sturdy enough to handle their lusher productions and knottier sentiments. <i>Tarot Classics</i> once again fixes the spotlight on Surfer Blood's insidious melodies, refining-- rather than reconfiguring-- their self-possessed sound. It's still summer where Surfer Blood come from, it's just a little colder there now.</p></div>"|15962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15962-tarot-classics/|7.2|Paul Thompson

This is far from a surprising development in the world of garage-rock, where most bands worth their weight in <i>Nuggets</i> compilations are prone (or, at the very least, prepared) to release two albums, five 7"" and 12"" singles, and maybe even a tour-only cassette as a forget-me-not in the span of about nine months. Being prolific is not a minor miracle in garage so much as it is muscle memory; the defining trait of this style of music is that it's not incredibly difficult to compose.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the Beets, a band who tours the Continental 48 in a station wagon, whose cover art is exclusively drawn with crayons. You get the impression that a Beets song takes about as much time to write and record a song as it takes Beets album artist Matthew Volz to run to Walgreens and get a 64-color box of Crayolas. What would probably be considered an insult to most other bands is part and parcel to the Beets' charm.</p>
<p>Much like their heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a>-- a band namedropped in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jcTt1JV-eWI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Howard Stern's brief on-air appraisal of the band</a>-- the Beets are long on attitude. On their debut, <i>Spit in the Face of People Who Don't Want to Be Cool</i>, the album's title served equally well as a mission statement. When the production quality of your record is equivalent to a damp fast food napkin, attitude is pretty much all you have to go on. <i>Spit in the Face</i> was intriguing and enjoyable because it was a lot like watching a band playing through a garage door made of opaque glass: You couldn't tell <i>exactly</i> what they were doing, but you wanted to be a part of it anyway.</p>
<p><i>Let the Poison Out</i> continues the band's gradual crawl out of the basement, and with the added sonic clarity comes the best collection of songs Wauters has written. Granted, the chords haven't ventured into jazzy diminished sevenths-- nor has the band decided to use a full drum kit to play its songs-- but the album showcases the Beets as a band every bit as off-the-cuff as it has been, though far more distinctive. With Wauters' voice pushed to the forefront, the bratty scream-singing of <i>Spit in the Face of People Who Don't Want to Be Cool</i> and <i>Stay Home</i> makes way for heavily accented-- and, in the case of ""Wipe It Off"", intentionally broken-- English, something undetected on past Beets records, where the vocals either sat among or were buried underneath the thudding drums. In general, Wauters is working with a broader songwriting palette. Adding  to various Beets traditions-- the tune sung in Spanish (""Preso Voy""),  the loopy, experimental interlude (""Eat No Dick 3"")-- he boasts a love  for stream-of-consciousness imagery on opener ""You Don't Want Kids to be  Dead"", offers sage advice on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12427-doing-as-i-do/"" target=""_blank"">""Doing as I Do""</a>, and plays a lovelorn game of ""this or that"" on ""I Don't Know"".</p>
<p>The record also marks the addition of drummer Chie Mori, whose plaintive anti-harmonies augment Wauters' singing in a way that recalls a less irksome version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2805-the-moldy-peaches/"" target=""_blank"">the Moldy Peaches</a>. The boy-girl vocals do more than just add to the pop bliss of the record's more infectious moments: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12611-friends-of-friends/"" target=""_blank"">""Friends of Friends""</a> is made rowdier by Mori's contributions, while her backing vocals on quasi-psychedelic closer ""Walking to My House"" give the song a skewed and eerie vibe. The Beets' newfound focus on recording quality could have easily highlighted shortcomings, but instead, the band found a way to broaden its sound by recruiting a member who exponentially adds to its worth.</p></div>"|15954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15954-let-the-poison-out/|7.7|Martin Douglas

<p>Of course, genre divides don't break down cleanly along national lines.

From the name <i>Rising Doom</i> to track titles that sound like weightier <i>Dr. Who</i> episodes (""Where the Gods Fall"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12463-the-song-of-shadows/"" target=""_blank"">""The Song of Shadows""</a>, ""Day of Anger"") on down to the creeping stereo synths and stalking drum-machine beats, the album is permeated by the kind of ominousness and menace that is increasingly the currency of dubstep as it goes teenage testosteroned and mainstream. Which would grate or bore if it weren't also so meticulously sculpted.</p>
<p><i>Rising Doom</i> is full of the kind of 3-D sound design, melodramatic melodic arcs, and chest-thumping bass beats that might make Mondkopf's closest peers in terms of pure sonics the German duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"" target=""_blank"">Modeselektor</a>, especially on songs like the staticky, synth-sawing ""Day of Anger"", although its classical-sounding piano bookends recall something else entirely. Other audio-engineering showpieces include the muffled haunted-house organs and big-room shuffle of ""Deadwood"", or ""Where the Gods Fall"", which-- with its lurching rhythm, shushing, shrill-as-hell hi-hat slicing, and mid-frequency rave synths stabbing in the background-- might be the closest thing here to a proper dubstep track.</p>
<p>This stuff can turn ponderous, though, as on the nine-minute-long closer ""Fossil Lights"", a half-time fade-out which strains for the sort of cinematic epic of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> coda but ends up feeling incidental. He sometimes succumbs to this sort of well-crafted sound for its own sake, rather than in the service of either a memorable song or a physically functional track.</p></div>"|15924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15924-mondkopf-rising-doom/|6.2|Eric Grandy

As guitarist-vocalist for Glasgow's preeminent indie pop outfit, Jackson typically contributes only a track or two per LP. While frontman Stuart Murdoch has been busy with new project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27746-god-help-the-girl/"" target=""_blank"">God Help the Girl</a>, and former bandmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/905-isobel-campbell/"" target=""_blank"">Isobel Campbell</a> has put out album after album with gravelly-voiced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27770-isobel-campbell-mark-lanegan/"" target=""_blank"">collaborator Mark Lanegan</a>, Jackson has pretty much limited his extracurricular activities to covers, soundtrack work, and instrumental appearances.</p>
<p>If Jackson's solo debut is overdue, though, it's also disappointingly undercooked. Sure, <i>(I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson</i> sounds a lot like what Belle and Sebastian fans might expect, with tinges of 1970s singer-songwriter records, bucolic late-1960s British pop, and, yup, showtunes. Put together intermittently since 2006 with fellow B&amp;S members and a few longtime friends, these 12 songs feel like whimsical larks, and Jackson's considerable charm should be able to put them over just fine in a live setting. But the record can also be too whimsical for its own good, and for most listeners, Jackson's Belle and Sebastian songs will be enough.</p>
<p>Chalk it up, perhaps, to yet another case of a solo artist's gifts working better with a band. In the context of last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14731-write-about-love/"" target=""_blank"">Write About Love</a></i>, Jackson's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLottSt17iY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Not Living in the Real World""</a> is as accomplished as it is crazy for key changes. Here, when Jackson channels Elton John while proclaiming that he's ""Pure at Heart"", tosses off literary puns over ambling ""Mellow Yellow"" psych-pop, and coos, ""Along came a bigger bird/ More bigger than he,"" amid twee-pop orchestration-- all on the same album-- it's a little tougher to take. When he jauntily narrates the potential pitfalls if you ""Press Send"" on an email to an object of your affection, context isn't the problem. On a musty tape somewhere, there must be a forgotten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"" target=""_blank"">Jens Lekman</a> song that brings this stale theme to wittier, more vivid life.</p>
<p>That said, Jackson has long since proved himself to be more than merely an adept sideman, and he flashes glimmers of those skills here. Jittery preview track ""Try Me"" skirts the album's occasionally narrow topical concerns (two songs loosely about directors, one about a redevelopment project) and dippy faux-innocence (""He was my best friend at school...""). Instead, Jackson homes in neatly on a rich, distinctive emotional state-- ""I got pills and I'm looking for thrills/ At the same time I want to start a family""-- and an equally well-developed organ-rock sound that builds on predecessors like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6984-and-the-mysterians/"" target=""_blank"">? and the Mysterians</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"" target=""_blank"">the Clean</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4750-love-is-all/"" target=""_blank"">Love Is All</a>. This one's definitely worth the attempt.</p>
<p>The new album's other preview track, the string-splashed, many-voiced ""Man of God"", comes closest to the <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> theatricality of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/639-the-life-pursuit/"" target=""_blank"">The Life Pursuit</a></i> songs like ""Act of the Apostle"". Only appropriate, given the title. Here, though, Jackson dodges some of the new record's pitfalls with yet another droll piece of songwriting: The religious imagery turns out to be just an unlikely setting for a music fan's doomed attempt to seduce through the strength of his record collection. Thankfully, Jackson doesn't make that mistake on <i>(I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson</i>. Still, there's a disconnect between this fair-to-middling solo record and the vital role its creator plays in one of the indie world's truly singular ensembles.</p></div>"|15939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15939-i-cant-get-no-stevie-jackson/|5.6|Marc Hogan

None of them is guaranteed to work, but some are more likely than others to flop, artistically or otherwise. This reissue of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a>'s final album, 1991's <i>Laughing Stock</i>, presented here without any distracting ""bonuses"" on immaculate vinyl, helps tells the story of Talk Talk's fraught, exhausting, confounding, brave, and ultimately brilliant final act. (There's also a postscript, in the form of frontman Mark Hollis' solo album, but we'll get to that.) Though you're more likely to describe <i>Laughing Stock</i> as lovely or otherworldly or even gentle, in its way it's as uncompromising as any apocalyptic noise record. And in a weird way it exists <i>only</i> because Talk Talk were at one time a hit-making pop band.</p>
<p>Formed in 1981, by 1986 Talk Talk were enjoying the biggest sales and best reviews of their short career, thanks to their third album, <i>The Colour of Spring</i>. Having started out as a moodier-than-average synth-pop act-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1170-duran-duran/"" target=""_blank"">Duran Duran</a> with the glitz and hedonism swapped out for nervous jitters and existential dread-- they'd transformed into the avant-garde edge of 1980s M.O.R. Even at their most acceptance-hungry, there'd always been something faintly left-of-center about Talk Talk, from Mark Hollis' haunted and word-swallowing singing to the musical hints that the band was more interested in 1970s prog than 80s dance-rock. On <i>The Colour of Spring</i>, the big, romantic ballads were still there, but they were strangely muted. They had an eerie jazz-like minimalism and attention to atmosphere that suggested an appreciation for Eno's ambient records.</p>
<p>This canny mix, stadium-friendly melodrama in an experimental but not too out-there package, paid greater commercial dividends than probably anyone would have guessed. With EMI's accounting department more than pleased, the label gave Talk Talk carte blanche to make any damned album they wished. The result was the band's fourth album, 1988's <i>Spirit of Eden</i>. Talk Talk took up this new freedom with a perverse relish, racking up countless hours and major dollars recording <i>Spirit</i>, a gorgeous but amorphous epic that proved that ruthless quiet could be just as difficult as ear-harassing volume. Talk Talk took this go-ahead from their label as their chance, possibly their last, to explore their truly envelope-pushing ideas, rather than the hints they'd offered on <i>Spring</i>.</p>
<p>By the time of <i>Spirit</i>, Talk Talk had fully rejected the sleek and kitschily futuristic music that first brought then to prominence. In its place, they crafted an immersive and ever-flowing style, alternately hushed and loud, lush and arid. It was a brand of unashamed art rock that was completely out of step with both the underground's unkempt roar and the manicured mainstream. Jazz became a more major component than ever, both in the overall style of playing, especially drummer Lee Harris' steady and cymbal-heavy swing, but also in the band's increasingly complex and usually improvised interaction. These improvisations were stitched together after the fact into what sound like carefully thought-out compositions that still somehow vibrate with the surprise of in-the-moment exploration. Which partly explains how <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHUDNZD5N88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Believe in You""</a>, Hollis' most comprehensible performance on an album where a lyric sheet is very necessary, can feel like a singer-songwriter ballad floating in and out of a swirl that evokes avant-classical at its least forbidding and electric jazz at its most beatific.</p>
<p>This genre-blurring fearlessness, along with the way <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Laughing Stock</i> bloom from extreme quiet to extreme loudness only to slowly recede again, is why these albums get tagged as precursors to post-rock, when no post-rock albums much resemble them in sound, construction, or especially ambition. Talk Talk use ideas from jazz and classical to build the subtlest gradations of drama. But despite the restraint, it's also not polite, musically or otherwise.</p>
<p>Hands were wrung on a corporate level over <i>Spirit</i>. Some old fans understandably balked, though new fans did gradually accumulate. An note of puzzlement could be read in the press notices, whether they offered praise or derision. The band decamped to Polydor and made an even more opaque fifth and final album, using much the same methodology as on <i>Spirit</i> and seeming to give even less of a shit about how it would all be received.</p>
<p>This is the oft-repeated and probably too-pat story that gave Talk Talk a second life as fame-spurning and journey-hardened underground icons. But it's also not hard to understand why the band broke up after <i>Laughing Stock</i>, or was simply broken. There's more going on in these six tracks than on <i>Spirit</i>, but the song structures are even stranger, built up from the tiniest musical gestures, clashing in mood from track to track, frequently more improvised-sounding than ever. The goal, assembling a coherent album from all this <i>stuff</i>, probably seemed quixotic to many of the contributors as it was being made. The recording process has long been described as one of the most arduous and prone to control freakitude ever. The band members were probably relieved to dissolve Talk Talk, move on to less demanding projects, or recede back into private life, once <i>Laughing Stock</i> was finished, despite the monumentality of what they finally made.</p>
<p>And it remains wholly singular, however many indie rock bands and experimental composers have genuflected toward it over the last 20 years. The half-dozen songs on <i>Laughing Stock</i> feel discrete, complete-unto-themselves, each one a little world that doesn't always seem to have much to do with the song that precedes or follows it. The underwater glide of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuYNidNgQic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""New Grass""</a> is Talk Talk as a purely placid and lovely proposition, electric organ and lilting guitar endlessly circling around Harris' heartbeat-steady drumming, recalling the tranquility threatened with an edge of disquiet in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Wyatt</a>'s early solo work. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGHwWwQw3tc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ascension Day""</a> remains the band's most chaotic and vicious song, like a small jazz combo being elbowed aside by a noise-rock band, with a climactic barrage of drumming that falls on your ears like an avalanche before the audible tape-splice cuts it dead. But even in this assault you can hear the monomaniacal care and craft that went into assembling and recording <i>Laughing Stock</i>, from the full-bodied throb of the upright bass to the little twitches and groans of horror-movie music lurking in the background on the verses. <i>Laughing Stock</i> was Talk Talk at their most demanding, and when listening to the spectral free jazz squeal of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piG59eSi6DY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Taphead""</a>, you understand why it was saddled for so many years with the ""difficult"" epithet.</p>
<p>The <i>Laughing Stock</i> reissue <i>sounds</i> amazing, as good as  the album's ever sounded, in any format. Which is crucial, because on  some level Talk Talk's later albums are all about sound. How startling, isolated moments of sound, or a formless wash of sound, can wring  emotions out of listeners as powerfully as any conventional  melody. How the ambient sound of the room in which an album was recorded  can be used almost as instrument in itself, and how the studio can be  used to create a sense of environment in the listener's mind that has  nothing to do with recording booths and control decks. How far the sound  of a rock song can be pared back and loosened up and still be ""rock,""  or even still be ""a song."" And especially how sound can become all the  more powerful when surrounded by silence, great gulfs of which are all  over the later Talk Talk albums, especially <i>Laughing Stock</i>, captured here in a remarkable vinyl mastering job on Ba Da Bing's part.</p>
<p>Seven years after <i>Laughing Stock</i>, and seven years into the band's slow word-of-mouth rehabilitation from pretentious flop to shining example for independent artists, Mark Hollis returned with a completely unexpected solo album, which seemed to almost sneak out into the real world rather than be ""released"" with the usual promotional fanfare. Part of this feeling comes from Hollis' almost Salinger-grade rejection of celebrity, journalism, the industry, even making art for public consumption. (Talk Talk virtually disappeared as a public entity from <i>Spirit</i> onward, leaving the records to do most of the talking.) But it also comes from the startlingly <i>private</i> sound of <i>Mark Hollis</i> itself, like the kind of painful, personal document that's usually released only after the artist's death.</p>
<p>Where <i>Laughing Stock</i> creates multiple environments, <i>Mark Hollis</i> is intimate, almost shockingly so. Hollis often sings as if he's right up against your ear, at a volume designed to not wake spouses and small children. Listening, you often feel like you're eavesdropping on a musician working in the supposed seclusion of his home. Indeed, like few other records I know-- maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6141-young-prayer/"" target=""_blank"">Young Prayer</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/"" target=""_blank"">World of Echo</a></i>-- <i>Mark Hollis</i> creates the sensation that you're very much in the room where it was recorded.</p>
<p>But where those albums sounded very much like thrifty, one-man-band operations, <i>Mark Hollis</i> draws on a cast of musicians almost as large as <i>Laughing Stock</i>, and in their own self-consciously restricted way, these songs are as dramatic as anything on that album. Certainly they're as immersive, if only because you have to listen so closely, thanks to the lower-than-low-volume approach to recording and playing, in order to follow the even more classical-informed logic of their movement, whole songs carried by just an oblique dance of woodwinds or a long-decaying string melody. Over its eight minutes, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGRI2o191Cc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Life (1895-1915)""</a> plays like a novel whittled down to a haiku, tracing one WWI soldier's tragic arc from birth to early death on the battlefield, with Hollis' barely audible voice at the song's end communicating as much ache as any of his more full-throated performances. If the hermetic <i>Laughing Stock</i> was a scaling back of the wide-open grandeur of <i>Spirit of Eden</i>, then <i>Mark Hollis</i> is an even more radical reduction of scale.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise that Hollis has been publicly silent ever since, since silence always seems to be where the songs on <i>Mark Hollis</i> want to go, as if it took great effort to even decide to commit these particular sounds to tape. Perhaps Hollis just feels that he's said everything he had to say. Or perhaps he's still deliberating as to what, if anything, he's comfortable with releasing next. Unlike many reclusive musicians, though, you won't feel that Hollis absented himself before his overall project was completed. These albums still stand a good chance of alienating you, but if you find yourself vibrating sympathetically to them, there's enough mystery and beauty in them to sustain a lifetime's listening, whether Hollis or Talk Talk ever record another note.</p></div>"|15957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15957-laughing-stock-mark-hollis/|10.0|Jess Harvell

Over its eight minutes, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGRI2o191Cc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Life (1895-1915)""</a> plays like a novel whittled down to a haiku, tracing one WWI soldier's tragic arc from birth to early death on the battlefield, with Hollis' barely audible voice at the song's end communicating as much ache as any of his more full-throated performances. If the hermetic <i>Laughing Stock</i> was a scaling back of the wide-open grandeur of <i>Spirit of Eden</i>, then <i>Mark Hollis</i> is an even more radical reduction of scale.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise that Hollis has been publicly silent ever since, since silence always seems to be where the songs on <i>Mark Hollis</i> want to go, as if it took great effort to even decide to commit these particular sounds to tape. Perhaps Hollis just feels that he's said everything he had to say. Or perhaps he's still deliberating as to what, if anything, he's comfortable with releasing next. Unlike many reclusive musicians, though, you won't feel that Hollis absented himself before his overall project was completed. These albums still stand a good chance of alienating you, but if you find yourself vibrating sympathetically to them, there's enough mystery and beauty in them to sustain a lifetime's listening, whether Hollis or Talk Talk ever record another note.</p></div>"|15957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15957-laughing-stock-mark-hollis/|9.0|Jess Harvell

But as Perri's discography has pluralized and diversified in unexpected ways, Russell has become less of a direct musical influence than an inspirational model of following one's muse across dance, avant-garde, and roots-rock boundaries, and marking those stylistic shifts with different, highly evocative aliases. Since first establishing himself in the early 2000s as a producer of aquatic, cerebral techno under the Polmo Polpo moniker, Perri has variously indulged his interest in Nigerian juju and shantytown funk with one-album wonders <a href=""http://www.sandroperri.com/discography/glissandro-70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glissandro 70</a> and dubby disco as Dot Wiggin. But since 2007, he's been releasing albums under his own name, signaling a singer-songwriterly shift that foregrounds Perri's considerable talents as a pedal-steel guitarist and fondness for 1970s AM-radio pop, even going so far as to faithfully cover Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" and Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin'"".</p>
<p>Scanning the tracklist on Perri's new album, <i>Impossible Spaces</i>, you're first greeted with another familiar title: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12565-changes/"" target=""_blank"">""Changes""</a>. But while the song that bears its name turns out not to be a version of either <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQ0Ryy01yE&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the David Bowie classic</a> or the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otSXkJWeSFo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath piano ballad</a>, Perri at the very least embraces the root sentiment behind that well-worn title. Though ""Changes"" picks up where 2007's tropically tranquil <i>Tiny Mirrors </i>left off, there are some immediately noticeable developments: Perri's plainspoken voice is several inches higher in the mix, and the sound has been thickened considerably by warm organ tones and more scabrous electric-guitar lines, while drummer Dan Gaucher sounds like he's itching to kick into a more robust backbeat. But then after three and a half minutes of stop-start teases, ""Changes"" does just that, by shifting into a glorious instrumental coda-- powered by a chugging Afro-funk groove and analog-synth starbursts-- that feels like an ecstatic, out-of-body-experience answer to the more tentative passage that preceded it.</p>
<p>""Changes"" effectively confirms <i>Impossible Spaces</i> as the first Sandro Perri release to truly synthesize his myriad musical interests and place equal emphasis on rhythm, texture, and melody. With Perri backed once again by a coterie of Toronto improv-scene all stars-- who provide him with all the queasy-listening sophistication of a more inebriated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"" target=""_blank"">Sea and Cake</a> or a less spastic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>-- the album strikes an uncanny balance between sounding ambitiously executed and completely off-the-cuff; an epic of both accident and design. Perri isn't afraid to push his song lengths past the seven-minute mark (or thematically link shorter tracks into two-part suites), but <i>Impossible Spaces</i> never feels taxing or overwrought. Rather, extended and exceedingly patient pieces like the woodwind-powered ""How Will I?"" and the exquisite 10-minute beast ""Wolfman"" yield a sustained thrill of discovery as, with each new verse, they wind and wander into an ever-dislocating swirl of brass, flutes, electric guitar, strings, and synth drones.</p>
<p>Throughout it all, Perri's invariably calm tenor assumes the reassuring presence of a tour guide who won't tell you where you're going but ensures you pass through safely: He rarely sings his verse melodies in any kind of formalized cadence but always returns to a familiar chorus refrain at just the right time to help you get reoriented. In that sense, <i>Impossible Spaces</i> isn't simply the most accessible and immediately rewarding album to bear Sandro Perri's name, it also serves as a handy musical roadmap to its maker's sinuous creative course.</p></div>"|15940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15940-sandro-perri/|8.3|Stuart Berman

They've been an ongoing concern only since 2007, yet they already have five LPs and just as many EPs (and a handful of singles) to their credit.  However, unlike other similarly prolific acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided by Voices</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, where the energy to write and record all those songs doesn't necessarily find itself reflected in the actual music, White Denim's material more than reflects the speed with which it was released.  It's only fitting one of their earlier full-lengths was titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13119-fits/"" target=""_blank"">Fits</a></i>.</p>
<p>It's not just that the band itself often seems eager to stuff as many notes as possible into every moment of every song, but that the songs themselves are filled to the brim with tempo shifts and nods to  different kinds of music-- and all these ideas that just seem to pour out of the band.  Even as the group's brand of psychedelica has grown from its garagey roots into something more expansive and jammy, that frenetic energy hasn't ebbed.  For the most part, White Denim succeed with this full-steam-ahead tack, though the generosity of creative spirit (and the high-speed fashion in which said spirit is imparted onto the listener) might seem exhausting as often as it does exhilarating.  What makes <i>Takes Place in Your Work Space</i> a welcome addition to the burgeoning White Denim discography is its road-not-taken approach. This EP might be the most relaxed the band has ever been on record.</p>
<p>Of course, I am talking in terms of the group, not what most folks consider ""relaxed.""  When ""Cat City"" starts up, the guitar and drums kick into high gear as if it's business as usual.  Despite how that may sound, the song itself is sedate, thanks in no small part to subtle, backward guitar loops and James Petralli's easygoing vocals.  Elsewhere on the EP, the band uses similar tactics and arrangements to take the edge off.  On ""Handwriting"", the contrast to the main group's hustle is provided by a string section, some nicely pitched background vocals, and a little pedal steel.  For ""Company"", it's Petralli's falsetto (at times sounding a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Bird</a>'s) that does the job, though nicking the gait and melody from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5339-love/"" target=""_blank"">Love</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFAm3zL6cwc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alone Again Or""</a> doesn't hurt.  The EP's best track, ""No Real Reason"", is similarly beholden to its possible source material-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> fans might hear more than a passing resemblance to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFhXMbICMzI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Never as Tired...""</a>-- but White Denim's homage (inadvertent or otherwise) is wholly successful, showing the group can slow its roll without losing its sense of direction or purpose.</p>
<p>More heartening than that minor revelation is the EP's overall cohesion.  Being only four tracks long goes a long way toward maintaining a release's integrity and focus, but unlike other White Denim albums-- which contain some great-sounding, highly dissimilar tracks that just happen to be sharing the same space-- the songs on <i>Takes Place</i> complement each other and sound like they belong together.  If there's been any tool missing from White Denim's warehouse-sized arsenal, it's this sort of ability to mete their boundless creativity with a sense of consistency and cohesion.</p></div>"|15956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15956-white-denim-takes-place-in-your-workplace/|7.1|David Raposa

Here's a group from New York that  shoots for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"" target=""_blank"">Basement Jaxx</a>-caliber house/funk crossover, one that rides  on the presence of a singer who paid her dues alongside Detroit rap'n'B  artists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3470-platinum-pied-pipers/"" target=""_blank"">Platinum Pied Pipers</a>, mutant-disco purveyors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28194-the-phenomenal-handclap-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Phenomenal  Handclap Band</a>, and post-dubstep architect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom</a>. Cubic Zirconia set  their sights on a genre-demolishing, universal club-hopper soundtrack  that's aimed to fuse altered-state headrush and restless libido in ways  that made those two sensations feel inseparable. And after surveying the  crowded field of all-purpose post-hip-hop/post-electro  dance music, they set about figuring out what parts to draw from to  synthesize it all into the only album in the field that anybody would  need to own.</p>
<p>The end result of all this is <i>Follow Your Heart</i>, and it's the  most frustrating kind of retro-pastiche. This is one of those albums  that attempts to fuse multiple instances of the familiar instead of  trying to coax underheard and unusual ideas out of a single deeper vein.  There's a dominant, vaguely 1980s feel about it, and even if there's  some loosely hinted signs of picking up a particular inspiration from  the big three mid-American hotspots of the era-- Minneapolis, Detroit, and Chicago-- they're rolled out with what feels like the musical  equivalent of received wisdom, letting experienced listeners fill in the  blanks in the hope that the blanks aren't the only thing they hear. You  like frenetic, high-concept synthesized funk à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>? See if you  can cope with the way ""Freebase You"" and ""Runnin' in and Out of Love""   siphon it into a nuance-free piledriver. Think acid/techno fusion is  interesting? The title track provides the absolute basic clichés of that  potential and lets it ride out on autopilot. You want an aloof,  slightly off singer muttering come-ons and empty debauched phraseology  over electro homages that don't sound much different as 30-year  throwbacks than they did as 20-year throwbacks? ""Cherry Nights"" and  ""Yellow Spaceship Pt. 2"" have you covered.</p>
<p>The singer in question, Tiombe Lockhart, is not untalented--  there are some flashes of charisma and fuck-what-you-think oddness that  sneak through during odd moments in <i>Follow Your Heart</i>. But  there's this sort of semi-intentional Teflon aloofness to her voice, and  for the most part her notes just kind of drone out instead of soaring  or piercing or hitting with any real impact. For most singers, that  detached, flat, and affectless tendency can sound either cool or empty  depending on the surrounding production.</p>
<p>So when it's hard to  tell how much depth the backing track's supposed to have, it's also hard  to suss out any real emotion from that pro-forma deadpan, whether she's  quipping about ""writing a neo-soul song"" on the exact opposite thereof  in electro workout ""Darko"" or making lovestruck euphoria sound mildly  diverting on ""Take Me High"". It only becomes more obvious when she's  pitted against someone with some chops (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"" target=""_blank"">Bilal</a> providing subtly rich  harmonies on ""Night or Day"") or an actual personality (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"" target=""_blank"">Dâm-Funk</a> going  all-out on ""I Got What You Need""). And when you pair that voice and  those beats with similarly placeholder-feeling lyrics-- ""Summertime""  actually follows up the couplet, ""Never makes me feel bad/ Never makes me  feel sad,"" with the line, ""Every time I see you my heart skips a beat""--  it's enough to make you wonder if trendy NYC dance music's found a way  to run on aggregators.</p></div>"|15948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15948-cubic-zirconia-follow-your-heart/|4.3|Nate Patrin

Despite those zeitgeisty triangles on the album cover, their debut LP, <i>Glowing Mouth</i>, brings to mind that period between 2005 and 2009, when the borough pumped out earnest rock bands that embraced ornate, occasionally anthemic song structures and on-the-cusp-of-turning-30 neuroses.</p>
<p>Needless to say, things have changed since then, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">James Murphy</a>'s decade-old jab about how ""your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables"" has more or less become reality (again). One of Brooklyn's remaining guitar bands, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, aren't really from Brooklyn, and elsewhere you're more likely to find piles of synthesizers and stoner-friendly visuals at a D.I.Y. show, anyway. Even that bastion of wistful, distanced indie-pop, <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>, has taken a turn toward largely embracing the harsh synth minimalism of coldwave. The sepia-toned M.O.R. <i>Glowing Mouth</i>, then, is almost tailor-made for those nostalgic for the days when nostalgia wasn't indie culture's M.O.-- or, for when tickets to see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a> weren't too expensive.</p>
<p>Calling Milagres ""fussy"" is only half the story, though. <i>Glowing Mouth</i> represents something of a collective split personality within the band, and they're at their best when embracing the high-stakes theater of emotional, mainstream rock. A recent article in <i>The Guardian</i> compared Milagres to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>, which is half right, since if Milagres were half as playful and unabashedly romantic as Coldplay, they'd be a much more interesting band.</p>
<p>There is a sort of distinctly British world-weariness to lead singer Kyle Wilson's voice, though, swinging and swaying toward the rafters while still retaining an elegant, low-level misery. A times, they recall the stronger points of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1314-elbow/"" target=""_blank"">Elbow</a>'s catalog (witness album closer ""Doubted"", where Wilson sounds like a slightly weakened dead ringer for Guy Garvey). If you've spent more than a minute of your life defending <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1135-doves/"" target=""_blank"">Doves</a>, there are moments on <i>Glowing Mouth</i> that are pure catnip.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it's Grizzly Bear's influence that looms largest over <i>Glowing Mouth</i>. There's plenty that brings <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"" target=""_blank"">Yellow House</a></i> to mind, from the cavernous surroundings to the jagged, obtuse guitars on ""For Disposal"". Like records by Grizzly Bear, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>, nothing feels out of place on <i>Glowing Mouth</i>; it's precise and hermetically sealed to perfection, the kind of reasonably competent mid-2000s mainstream indie that inevitably finds an audience, no matter how small and blog-specific. But while Milagres may sound like a lot of music fans' favorite bands, it's hard to imagine anyone preferring this record to the real deal.</p></div>"|15949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15949-glowing-mouth/|5.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

The combination of pop songcraft and electronic texture that Jimmy Tamborello conjured on <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/dntel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dntel</a>'s <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> seemed to achieve one of the implicit cardinal goals of independent music: to strike a seamless balance between ""catchy"" and ""experimental."" It was a coup for those of us who had both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"" target=""_blank"">Squarepusher</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Promise Ring</a> discs in our CD changers, a promise that the exhilarating high-budget sonics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/"" target=""_blank"">Kid A</a></i> could be brought down to the more human scale of bedroom indie pop. In a certain, ineffable way it just <i>sounded right</i> for its time, much in the way that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/"" target=""_blank"">Bitte Orca</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15321-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/"" target=""_blank"">w h o k i l l</a></i> have in recent years.</p>
<p>In the decade since <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> was first released on the Plug Research label, we've realigned our perceptions of both ""catchy"" and ""experimental."" The sweet, straightforward melodies on <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> now seem almost embarrassingly earnest, the electronic manipulations cold and procedural. While Tamborello's mastery is undeniable, there's a staggering sense of openness to <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> in both its content and its execution. There is no mystery here; you can see the gears turning, both emotionally and sonically. For all its skittery beats and overdriven synthesizers, <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> often feels less like an ""intelligent dance music"" record than a straight-up 1990s emo record, with the muscle of a traditional rock band proxied by Tamborello's smart, dynamic arrangements.</p>
<p>Though Tamborello's instrumentals are the only constant on an album studded with guest vocalists, <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities </i>feels more like the product of a disciplined, rotating collective than a solo album with one-off collaborators. Each song is particularly well-suited to its respective singer, and each singer fully engages with Tamborello's instrumental tracks. An air of melancholy hangs over most of this album, but Tamborello understands that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4252-mia-doi-todd/"" target=""_blank"">Mia Doi Todd</a>'s flat, confident vocals on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23PmvKXp7fY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Anywhere Anyone""</a> evoke a very different kind of melancholy from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/311-beachwood-sparks/"" target=""_blank"">Beachwood Sparks</a> singer Chris Gunst's fragile, unsteady vocals on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By56XR1U8nQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Umbrella""</a>. Tamborello foregos a more manipulated vocal treatment and lets a tuneful vocal from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a> frontman Ben Gibbard anchor the swirling, overdriven <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZM0A8EKMeY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan""</a>, setting the stage for the bajillion-selling full-length collaboration the two would release as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>. (Music theory geek aside: there's a certain magic to Gibbard's voice when he sings a perfect fifth up followed by a minor third down, as he does in nearly all of his best songs.)</p>
<p>Four remixes of ""Evan and Chan"" are far and away the drabbest bonus material on Sub Pop's deluxe reissue; removed from the original song's arc, the individual sonic elements here just aren't that interesting. An alternate version of ""Umbrella"" shows what a more half-assed version of this album might have sounded like, with Chris Gunst's voice locked into a repetitive pattern and bolstered by obvious, heavy-handed swells of distortion. ""Evan and Chan"" B-side ""Your Hill"" is the strongest non-album cut here, culling its primary melody from a loud monophonic synthesizer while using vocals as abstract, poetic ornamentation. Broadly speaking, the bonus material here veers more toward the conventional IDM of its time, falling short of the original album but also making a case for its unique strengths.</p>
<p>The best thing about this reissue has nothing to do with its bonus material, though; a solid remastering job pushes both treble and the bass beyond the relatively thin, high-mid-leaning sonic footprint of many late-90s and early-00s computer-recorded albums. Digital conversion technology, much like music itself, has changed a lot in the last 10 years-- which seems like a fairly short time between release and reissue, but also a really long time to have passed since this particular album came out. For a record fixated on personal nostalgia, <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities </i>still feels bright-eyed and forward-thinking.  That Tamborello's ambition and optimism now seem slightly distant and idealistic probably says more about us now than it does about this album. This may not be the future we chose, but it remains a beautiful future to imagine.</p></div>"|15950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15950-dntel-life-is-full-of-possibilities/|8.8|Matt LeMay

And yet, with the arrival of Class Actress's debut full-length, <i>Rapprocher</i>, that past seems worth pointing out again, if only to illustrate the drastic turn her career's taken over the past eight or so years. In 2004, years before Class Actress came into existence, Harper released a self-titled solo album of singer/songwriter-y material with no spangly synths. Even if what she was doing then wasn't terribly compelling, you get the impression she valued substance over style. Skip to five years later when Harper linked up with producer Mark Richardson (no relation to Pitchfork's editor-in-chief) and engineer/multi-instrumentalist Scott Rosenthal for Class Actress' debut EP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13847-journal-of-ardency/"" target=""_blank"">Journal of Ardency</a></i>, and you can almost <i>hear</i> her sonically relocating from open-mic night culture to cool, cosmopolitan glam-- in other words, from one part of Manhattan to, well, another part of Manhattan. (Even if they do call themselves a Brooklyn band, the truth is that Class Actress have never sounded like they're from Brooklyn.)</p>
<p>The cover of <i>Rapprocher</i> brings that transformation full circle: witness Harper, lying on white sheets, mugging seductively for the camera with something awfully sparkly hiding behind her ear. It's a glamorous image, and besides being incredibly reminiscent of the cover art for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"" target=""_blank"">Bryan Ferry</a>'s solo album from last year, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14782-olympia/"" target=""_blank"">Olympia</a></i>, it's an excellent representation of how <i>Rapprocher</i> sounds-- that is, luxurious and picture-perfect in presentation. The somewhat shy intimacy that marked <i>Journal of Ardency</i> is more or less gone, replaced by bright, layered production. (If Richardson and Rosenthal ever decide to ditch the band thing to become for-hire studio rats, they'll have little trouble finding work.) The synth work on <i>Rapprocher</i> is particularly impressive, maintaining a tangy sharpness while a pop sweetness flows from every corner.</p>
<p>Eschewing any notions of ""indie"" that come with releasing a record on the increasingly faddish Carpark label, <i>Rapprocher</i> is a capital-P pop album, and a pretty good one at that. Despite the band's cited influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, the first few Madonna albums), a fair amount of this record sounds rooted in the more out-there sounds of contemporary pop.  (If you're skeptical, listen to ""Prove Me Wrong"" back to back with Ludacris' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_sTTvyiiPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Splash Waterfalls""</a>.) There's little doubt that Class Actress are ambitious for success beyond opening tour slots; even the lyrical content, which is super-generalized and occasionally empty of meaning, suggest a yearning for mainstream achievement outside the five boroughs. Honestly, I'm not sure this album is their ticket to that party. Don't get me wrong, they sound plenty accessible here, and it's only a matter of time before early singles ""Keep You"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12371-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">""Weekend""</a> find placement on a TV show on the CW. Considering the populist roots of their sound, though, Class Actress still sound a little too <i>weird</i> to truly break through (and if they toned that weirdness down, this record just wouldn't be as interesting).</p>
<p>Another barrier holding <i>Rapprocher</i> from being a complete success is Elizabeth Harper's voice, a voice that worked well amidst the low-key surroundings on <i>Journal of Ardency</i> but often falters here. The issue at hand: there are more than a few songs (""Keep You"" and ""Love Me Like You Used To"" being the most egregious offenders) with choruses that call for world-beating, chest-thumping delivery. Harper doesn't have the strength for that, so every time she tries to tackle those, it fizzles like a wet bottle rocket. She fares much better on the album's closing track, ""Let Me In"", an electro-bliss freefall that takes <i>Rapprocher</i> out on a slo-mo rocket of beauty. Otherwise, she still sounds like she's struggling to find what fits her best-- she's come this far, though, so be patient.</p></div>"|15941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15941-rapprocher/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

London-based Still Corners are something of a transatlantic hybrid: American Greg Hughes began the band when he met Murray in London, and they grew to a quartet shortly afterwards. There was a long spell between their debut EP <i>Remember Pepper?</i> and last year's sweetly jangly single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14738-dont-fall-in-love/"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Fall in Love""</a>, but their first full-length, <i>Creatures of an Hour</i>, is a cohesive statement of the band's aesthetic-- nouvelle-vague-nodding retro-cool. Fashioning the most familiar signifiers of 60s style in a contemporary frame, <i>Creatures of an Hour</i> is a perfect soundtrack for the internet's vast acreage of Anna Karina Tumblrs.</p>
<p>Which makes a certain kind of sense: Still Corners like movies. They talk in interviews about the inspiration they draw from their favorite kinds of films (Italian horror, French New Wave, and anything soundtracked by Ennio Morricone), and their music often gets tagged with that puzzlingly synesthesiac adjective ""cinematic."" It calls to mind the way earlier this year the internet was buzzing with talk about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Beaches</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15281-badlands/"" target=""_blank"">Badlands</a></i>, a record that drew more comparisons to like-minded filmmakers (David Lynch, Wong Kar Wai) than musicians. It seemed to signal something about the way we listen to music now-- the importance of the audio-visual experience in making aesthetic connections in a digital music scene flooded with new artists.</p>
<p>Still Corners' most prominent touchstone, though, is a band that, even a decade ago, sounded like they were making soundtracks to imaginary French New Wave classics. The influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a> is evident all over <i>Creatures of an Hour</i>, from the eerie carnival synths of ""Circulars"" to the chilly, music-box plink of ""The White Season"". It's perhaps unfair to hold a band's first record up to the high-water mark of their idols-- and especially brutal since most of us are still reeling from singer Trish Keenan's untimely passing. But since they draw overtly from Broadcast's overall aesthetic, Murray's vocals cannot but fall flat under the inevitable comparison the rest of their sound evokes. She sings each track in a breathy exhale like she's trying to fog up a car window. All of which sounds lovely, but there's not enough substance or personality in the vocals she displays on these tracks to transcend her influences-- or to be very memorable at all.</p>
<p><i>Creatures of an Hour</i> is top-heavy: the early-sequenced ""Cuckoo"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14637-endless-summer/"" target=""_blank"">""Endless Summer""</a> are the record's incontestable highlights. The rest of the music lacks specificity: No particular melodies, images, or moods really stick out from the vast, dreamy atmosphere that washes over you while you're listening. <i>Creatures</i> is a nice dream-- certainly not an unpleasant place to be. But its resounding vagueness becomes apparent once you wake: It's not exactly going to make for a rip-roaring entry in your dream journal or anything.</p></div>"|15894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15894-still-corners-creatures-of-an-hour/|6.5|Lindsay Zoladz

The Melbourne band did just that, and on their 2009 self-titled EP, the influence of the Clean and other Flying Nun artists could be heard in the paced-but-driving riffs of songs like ""Little Guys"". Unfortunately, the EP wasn't very cohesive-- it sounded like a group of people tinkering with different ideas and sounds without fully settling on an aesthetic. There were ballads, but also a lo-fi tune where the vocal sounded like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27528-dead-milkmen/"" target=""_blank"">Dead Milkmen</a>-style monologue. On their self-titled full-length debut, they keep the Flying Nun influence, ramp up the jangle in their guitar sound, and find their voice.</p>
<p>""Voice"" can be a nebulous term for four people, but the the band definitely has a unified point of view here. Musically, <i>Twerps</i> features several breezy, reverb-laced riffs, most of which could earn them an easy comparison to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>-- although the influence, again, likely comes from their Australia- and New Zealand-based forebears. There are also some assertive riffs, like the driving surf rock solo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12355-dreamin/"" target=""_blank"">""Dreamin'""</a> or the urgent, distortion-heavy refrain of ""Don't Be Surprised"".  And, on  ""Who  Are You"", a paced, inebriated sing-along, the band's joined by members of their Australian rock community, folks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Eddy Current  Suppression Ring</a>, Beaches, and Panel of Judges all slurring a looped ""We'll  get drunk/ we'll get stoned/ We'll get high/ We'll get...""</p>
<p>They're tightest thematically: Every song follows a related narrative of young, conflicted love. Several times they present a melodramatic statement-- for instance, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12562-this-guy/"" target=""_blank"">""This Guy""</a>'s ""If you want me to/ I'll die for you""-- but sing the line with a straight-faced, unswerving delivery. Toward the end of the album, guitarist/vocalist Marty Frawley's voice  becomes quiet and fragile. On ""Bring Me Down"", it's weary and deep as he  quietly delivers a few vignettes of heartbreak behind an acoustic strum.  He doesn't get into specifics or talk much about his feelings-- he just  walks around the block to clear his head, and, after some thought,  hastily decides to skip town. In the middle of the album, there's the five-minute ""Jam Song"".  For the most part, it's exactly that-- a song where they jam for a while  with some loose vocals attached. But in fact, Frawley's slurring is  another illustration of overbearing desperation: ""I wanna live inside  your soul,"" he shouts.</p>
<p>These are all good examples of what they do so well on <i>Twerps</i>: excellent  melodies, simple guitar lines, and simple lyrics that imply something  urgent or devastating. As they've said in interviews, they've done some growing up for this album, and you can hear it, mostly in the tone of their instruments. They make those bold, doe-eyed statements, then offset them by a tinge of melancholy in their guitars, implying something more self-aware and devastating.</p></div>"|15951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15951-twerps-twerps/|7.9|Evan Minsker

Their ghostly style touches on the industrial haunts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a> as well as the mysterious vibes of various dance and techno sub-genres. It's not a wide range of reference points, but the limited palate helps give Water Borders focus. There are none of the random misfires or gratuitous left turns here that can mar debut albums.</p>
<p>Where <i>Harbored Mantras </i>does sound like a first try is in its lack of surprise. Water Borders haven't yet figured out how to insert substantial variety into such a well-defined sound. As the album progresses, consistency becomes a straitjacket. The duo seems so unwilling to break its own rules that it rarely bends them. This is most apparent in the vocals, which can be evocatively chilly, but often sound generic-- like a diluted <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murphy_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Murphy</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Eldritch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Eldritch</a>-- and more concerned with matching the music than adding something unique to it. The result is that you've heard everything Water Borders do long before <i>Harbored Mantras </i>is over.</p>
<p>Still, every track has something interesting to offer. At their best, like on the rattling ""Bad Ethos"", simple repetition becomes hypnotic mantra, evoking the stunning séances of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28042-forest-swords/"">Forest Swords</a>. The duo builds deep layers of mood, giving <i>Harbored Mantras</i> the feel of an infinite cave, which can be both absorbing and suffocating. But they fare best when their air-shaking beats thrust through those layers. Take the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"">Gang Gang Dance</a>-like ritual ""Feasting on Mongeese"", or the spooky tribalism of ""Antechamber"", which sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"">the Residents</a> doing techno. In both cases, rhythm proves to be an eminently sturdy spine. Perhaps that's what will ultimately allow Water Borders to stretch their sound: Their beats are solid and captivating enough that they should be able to expand sonically without surrendering their stable core.</p></div>"|15938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15938-harbored-mantras/|6.6|Marc Masters

Right on schedule, here comes <i>Norman</i>, a 2010 festival-circuit selection rolling into theaters across the country with all the proper credentials: the square-peg protagonist (here, the titular Norman), the sweetly bumbling dalliance with an equally off-kilter would-be soulmate (Emily, ""a girl who likes Monty Python""), the heavy-hanging bleakness of some unfortunately timed personal tragedy (the death and illness of Norman's parents).</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's the music, a soundtrack released a few weeks before the movie's super-limited national opening. But while the names on the<i> </i>tracklist read with the same indie-ish panache as those of <i>Garden State</i> and <i>Juno</i>, the two best-selling sophomore-year mix tapes in history, <i>Norman</i> takes a more focused approach. The film's score was composed and performed by <a href=""http://www.andrewbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Bird</a>, a move that should shock no one faintly familiar with the classically trained multi-instrumentalist: Over the course of five solo albums, his swooping melodies and carefully built arrangements have all but pleaded to be overlaid on celluloid. Ten of his <i>Norman</i> tracks are original instrumental pieces that, even when taken out of their intended context (as we experienced them, unable to catch one of the movie's limited screenings before press time), fit nicely among his existing catalog.</p>
<p>""3:36"" is perhaps the most readily-identifiable as a Bird song, its nervous, gnawing waves pocked with violin pizzicato and eerie whistling, his dual touchstones that he's almost always better off ditching. Here, though, they're used sparingly, maximizing their effect. When the dreadful pulse that opens first track ""Scotch and Milk"" repeats three tracks later on ""Hospital"", the ominous thrum glowers, grows heavy, then finally gives way to mournful violin pulls and plucks. That textural push-and-pull defines the score, Bird's strings caustic against the smooth, near-perpetual hum of the organ (or maybe it's a hurdy-gurdy, or deeply distorted violin loop-- whatever it is, its pitiless drone is so reminiscent of Wendy Carlos' analog-synth soundtrack to <i>The Shining</i> that Bird seems bound to one day score a horror flick). Here, if not for the gentle, almost mischievous lope of ""The Kiss/Time and Space/Waterfall"", the title of which tells its own little story, the tension would be nearly unbearable.</p>
<p>Bird has promised a new record out early next year, and if this  collection can be considered any kind of preview, the arrangements will  be darker, bolder, weirder-- but his songwriting, perhaps, more direct.  On recent albums, especially 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12605-noble-beast/"" target=""_blank"">Noble Beast</a></i>, he has seemed  nearly incapable of anything but lyrical abstruseness, throwing out  mentions of aubergines and Cypriots like decoys, as if his cleverness  would distract from his avoidance of grappling with anything more  frighteningly real.</p>
<p>Instrumentally, while ""Arcs and Coulombs"", the first of Bird's three proper songs on <i>Norman</i>, holds tight to brushed drums and glockenspiel (his third- and fourth-most-often-deployed tricks), but its talk of candy-apple lips and ""your serum in my veins"" are new, their borderline corniness forgivable for their offering of proof that Bird is capable of feeling, or at least transmitting, such a pedestrian sentiment as romantic infatuation. It seems to be the most straightforward love song he's ever turned out, at least until ""Night Sky"" comes along a bit later: ""What if we hadn't been born at the same time?/ What if you were 75 and I were nine?"" he wonders, supported only by a feverishly stroked acoustic guitar carried over from the preceding track. Nary a whistle, a pluck, nor an obscure scientific metaphor-- just straight-up wonder at two people somehow managing to find each other amidst the whole mess of space and time. It's a new Andrew Bird, followed shortly by the old one: ""Darkmatter"", from 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10016-armchair-apocrypha/"" target=""_blank"">Armchair Apocrypha</a></i>, is the only Bird song not original to the soundtrack, but here it blazes in with a cinematic bravado that all but destroys its former self.</p>
<p>Contributions from three other artists are nestled among Bird's tracks. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/398-the-blow/"" target=""_blank"">The Blow</a>'s Khaela Maricich lends the compilation its only female voice with ""S.O.S."", a dreamy, heavy-lidded cry for help: ""If you get a minute, would you come and look for me?"" ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son"", the crunching, stilted opener of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a>'s 2005 LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8794-apologies-to-the-queen-mary/"" target=""_blank"">Apologies to the Queen Mary</a></i>, is reworked here into a darkly pulsing near-dirge, its electric guitars pushed down, Spencer Krug's yawp subdued and accented with slinky percussion and accordion wheezes. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4533-chad-vangaalen/"" target=""_blank"">Chad VanGaalen</a>'s ""Rabid Bits of Time"" is carried over directly from his <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12319-soft-airplane/"" target=""_blank"">Soft Airplane</a></i>, its mournful cello slub and lonely guitar fitting it in neatly among Bird's instrumentals, VanGaalen's ragged, exhausted bleating no doubt laid over some key moment onscreen, pushing the movie and soundtrack into its cathartic final third.</p>
<p>A soundtrack taken apart from its movie is a funny thing, especially one working in such familiar territory as <i>Norman</i>. It's not hard to imagine the scenes these songs must play over on screen: here's when he walks through the halls and the other kids stare, here's when he wonders how her hair smells, here's where he wonders about the vagaries of human existence and what's the point of it all, here's where they kiss, here's where they cry. Maybe it's that easy; maybe it's not. At the very least, it's beautiful.</p></div>"|15943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15943-norman-ost/|7.3|Rachael Maddux

Younger bands making cool underground music have become goth-curious  for the first time in probably 20 years, and the tendency to filter all ""pop"" hooks through the funhouses mirrors of ""avant-garde"" production  techniques is so commonplace that <i>clarity</i>-- a voice spared from way too much reverb, for example-- has become the exception instead of the rule.<i> Tragedy</i>-- <a href=""http://juliashammasholter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a>'s first full-length-- is one of ""those records,"" but it's also  more: more sonically detailed, more attentive to its compositions, and  more clever and varied about its use of grayscale. Holter isn't just  holding a Russian icon painting in the air and cranking the echo. In  turn, it's a record with more <i>integrity</i> than a lot of its peers, a record committed to itself as a project but  also exemplary as a summary of several trends in contemporary  underground music now.</p>
<p>If ""integrity"" sounds like an old-fashioned argument, well, it is.  Holter's work here rhymes not only with artists as disparate as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola  Jesus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a> (or even a bad-dream version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>), but  with the quasi-classical, quasi-medieval sounds of 4AD bands circa the  mid-1980s or a tradition of adventurous female artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie  Anderson</a> and Meredith Monk-- arty music that tends toward a kind of  austere, asexual mystery.</p>
<p>Holter  uses plenty of synthesizers, but also field recordings and  percussion that sounds like rattling chains, a blend of sounds that  register as obviously ""unnatural"" and ones that register as almost  tactile. Long passages of the record have no beats or vocals, and some  of the more song-oriented tracks-- ""Try to Make Yourself a Work of Art""  or ""So Lillies"", for example-- are structured as ambient passages that  seem like they're trying to organically slip into their ""pop"" moments,  then slip out of them as the track comes to a close.</p>
<p>The result is that <i>Tragedy</i> is a continuous experience that I've enjoyed best front-to-back instead  of in parts-- a strength for when you have time and patience, a  weakness when you don't. (And there's no ambiguity, I don't think, that Holter wants it that way: The first track is called ""Introduction"", the fifth is called ""Interlude"", and the last is called ""Tragedy Finale"".) I first heard Holter's music a few years ago,  when a friend played me Monika Enterprise's <i>4 Women No Cry</i> compilation, and her contributions there were more contained and mixtape-able-- it's a mode I think she <i>can</i> work in but chooses not to here.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I try and avoid album concepts, especially when it gives the album weight it doesn't earn elsewhere. <i>Tragedy</i>, for example, is based on a 2,439-year-old Greek play by Euripedes-- just <i>try</i> and make it seem unimportant after that. Holter has made a dreamy,  intense album that aligns with a variety of traditions but, like a lot  of great contemporary music, synthesizes them in novel or at least <i>artful</i> ways.</p>
<p>What  gets me about it most, though, is its atmosphere and consistency:  Sounds I can't identify resonate in the background; drones underpin  entire songs without ever intruding. Still, I know Holter has made this  possible, and that's what makes me trust her-- that's what makes me  acknowledge the album's integrity. Results with other listeners may vary, but one of my favorite moments of <i>Tragedy</i> is listening to the murmuring, disjointed voices fade out in the album's last 30 seconds: That's when I realize how unified it is, hanging like a storm cloud that barely opens up.</p></div>"|15932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15932-julia-holter/|8.0|Mike Powell

For years, Worden has drifted between genres and tones (assimilating bits of the opera, classical, indie rock, folk, and experimental canons), letting her vocals act as the lone narrative thread and defining principle. These songs were hers because she was the only person who could sing them, and that felt like enough. Still, while confining artists to a single sound or style might be a philistine's errand, it also gives listeners something recognizable to cling to; there are no bits of boat floating in the water here, and her third LP, <i>All Things Will Unwind</i>, both suffers and succeeds in relation to its scope.</p>
<p>Already well known for her collaborations with chamber-oriented musicians (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>), Worden is now backed by the contemporary ensemble <a href=""http://ymusicensemble.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yMusic</a>, who add plenty of playful bits to her oft-ethereal, shifting folk songs. Strummed opener ""We Added It Up"" is punctuated by various strings and toots; it unfolds like a Rube Goldberg contraption, all call and response. Worden sings about circumstantial incompatibility-- ""If I was love/ Then you were shhh""-- with convincing fervor, before the track transforms into a quasi-reassuring mantra. ""Love binds the world,"" Worden and her backing vocalists chant, but it's still hard to know (with good reason) whether those particular shackles are supposed to be a comfort or a curse. <span> </span>It's a pleasantly hazy refrain; Worden's best moments come when she's at her darkest and most uncertain.</p>
<p>The excellent ""Be Brave"" opens quietly, with muted drums and Worden's low growls: ""I'm feeling scared and I am overwhelmed,"" she sings. ""Be brave, dear one/ Be changed, be undone,"" she coaxes, and like ""We Added It Up"", the song proffers a tiny, passing glimpse of insecurity. Although Worden's vocal performances are varied and borderline virtuosic, it's easy to find yourself wishing for her voice to crack or crumple or fail, to be fallible in a way that's just as beautiful. The carefulness of <i>All Things Will Unwind</i> can feel impenetrable sometimes, and while her closest musical analogue is the equally ambitious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>, Worden lacks Newsom's oddball vulnerability-- it's the difference between performance and possession, and while there's certainly room for both, the former comes, always, with the risk of affectation. <i>All Things Will Unwind</i>'s theatrical bent can read as goofy, if not wholly inscrutable (the slow-but-punchy ""There's a Rat"" feels cartoonish, while ""High Low Middle"" feels showy, staged). Mostly, though, Worden's drive-- to be so many things, to harness and perfect so many disparate sounds-- makes her work feel more distant than it should.</p></div>"|15942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15942-all-things-will-unwind/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

Whether chillwave or lo-fi, post-dubstep or just plain unclassifiable, many of our decade's most intriguing young voices are often less than wholly articulate. Even when you can make out the lyrics, as Pitchfork's Brian Howe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15850-an-argument-with-myself/"">observed</a> recently, they're often cryptic or generic-- both in big-tent indie rock and on the U.S. pop charts.</p>
<p>Take <a href=""http://www.gauntlethair.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gauntlet Hair</a>. They're not even alone in their own adopted Mile High City. Denver's nonprofit D.I.Y. art space Rhinoceropolis has also midwifed instrumental electro-rockers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tjutjuna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tjutjuna</a>, formerly instrumental electro-rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28277-woodsmen/"" target=""_blank"">Woodsman</a>, and punk-scorched electro-house producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9778-pictureplane/"" target=""_blank"">Pictureplane</a>. But the duo of Andy R. (né Andy Rauworth) and drummer Craig Nice (né Craig Fleischman) don't only hang out in the world of ""avant"" prefixes. Their stirring 2010 single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11874-i-was-thinking/"" target=""_blank"">""I Was Thinking...""</a>, aired during an ESPN special on quarterback Tim Tebow. And Craig, who also uses electronic drum triggers, has cited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a> as an influence on his beats.</p>
<p>Gauntlet Hair's self-titled debut is the most compelling demonstration yet of the band's knack for headphones-friendly fist-pumpers. Andy and Craig say they've been playing together since they were 15-- almost a decade ago-- and their songs are stacked with enough ideas to back that up. Andy, who lists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a>'s impeccably fluid guitarist Vini Reilly as an inspiration, uses lots of delay, chorus, and echo effects on his springy guitar licks, giving them a refracted, percussive quality while also making them sound larger than life. When Craig drops those <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>-style beats next to his cymbal crashes, you almost wonder whether these guys pal around with Colorado's own, chart-topping OneRepublic.</p>
<p>But then you remember Gauntlet Hair are originally from Illinois, where they recorded this album-- at Andy's grandmother's house. Andy and Craig trade off vocals, which evokes comparisons to likeminded duos: the more cerebral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age/"" target=""_blank"">No Age</a>, the more visceral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>. Except Gauntlet Hair sing in half-decipherable yawps, lofted, in celebration or in heartache, over neatly constructed, shape-shifting songs-- when words fail, the feelings still resonate. The longest track here, ""Lights Out"", plays like a fun-house guitar version of a hugely dramatic Tears for Fears song for three minutes, then swerves into a massive two-minute outro, adding and subtracting just enough catchy bits to maintain the emotional affect.</p>
<p>No, ""I Was Thinking..."" isn't here, and second A-side <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12018-out-dont/"" target=""_blank"">""Out, Don't...""</a> isn't, either. As a result, yes, <i>Gauntlet Hair</i> lasts only nine songs. But they're all potential singles in their own right, all different: the romantic smolder of ""Showing"", the jittery throb of ""Mop It Up"" (the one that goes, ""You say goodbye""), the sparkly shuffle of ""Overkill"" (something about ""praying"" and a ""vision""). On closing track ""Shout in Tongues"", the drums drop out to expose a repeated shout that brings to mind the most famous song by the godfathers of the current decade's artsy, reverb-damaged experimental poppers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>. ""I want a child that breaks the rules, goes to school, and""-- I'm not sure what comes next. Adobe slats? Better listen again.</p></div>"|15884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15884-gauntlet-hair/|7.8|Marc Hogan

A little over a year later, <i>Trust Now</i> has arrived, again on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a>'s <a href=""http://www.paw-tracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paw Tracks</a> imprint, to test out that prognosis. A few things have changed in the intervening months-- they've slimmed down to a duo of sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson after their fellow founding member Michael Collins went on hiatus from the group, and Scott Colburn (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3979-sun-city-girls/"">Sun City Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>) replaced Avey Tare and Deakin in the producers' chair. There's been a minor toughening up of the sound, with everything from the swampy keyboard work to the wailed vocal lines gaining a little more bite, but otherwise <i>Trust Now</i> continues in the same vein as its predecessor.</p>
<p>For a band reportedly raised on a Hare Krishna farm and with a live show that positively reeks of patchouli oil, there's a surprising amount of bad vibes sunk into Prince Rama's music. They may give their songs titles like ""Golden Silence"" and ""Summer of Love"", but the repetitive stretches of tribal drumming and vocal incantations makes them sound like they're trying to cook up the accompaniment to a horrific <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070917/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wicker Man</a></i>-style ritual. The problem is one of identity; the music doesn't swing far enough in a full-on occult direction to give a true sense of nastiness, nor does it completely bask in the hippy idealism the Larson sisters are clearly so well versed in. It's a touch too polite and apologetic, more <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115341/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</a></i> than <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063285/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Witchfinder General</a></i>.</p>
<p>""Trust"" is the best demonstration of the dichotomy at the heart of the band. It begins with a vocal line that intones the title of the song over and over, like we're being ushered into the most genial ritual sacrifice of all time, while squealing synth tones wail in the background. Midway through the song, it's turned into much lighter fare, with a keyboard motif that could have been ripped straight from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/947-haha-sound/"">Haha Sound</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>, which picks out a poppy melody that feels at odds with the first half of the track. In fact, Prince Rama could learn something by listening to Broadcast and the Focus Group's collaborative album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/"">Investigate W</a></i><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/"">itch Cults of the Radio Age</a></i>, which contains the creepy air of inventiveness that <i>Trust Now</i> is striving for but can't ever reach. The music here contains germs of good ideas, but too often they get frittered away through loose and indulgent jams that never go anywhere.</p>
<p>On those Broadcast/Focus Group recordings, the musicians appeared to be immersed in the kind of folkloric tales that provide the unpleasant edge material like this needs. It's also got the kind of razor-sharp sense of purpose from which <i>Trust Now</i> could benefit. Instead Prince Rama end up mired somewhere closer to kitsch, especially when their music meanders without much purpose on songs like ""Portaling"" or uses a corny ""boing"" sound (presumably made by a mouth harp, or a sample of one) on ""Incarnation"". Frustratingly, <i>Trust Now</i> doesn't advance on the better ideas from <i>Shadow Temple</i>, particularly the elements of dance music that occasionally surfaced. Essentially it's the core Prince Rama sound boiled down to its essence, which means anyone hoping for this band to ""become something more"" should sit this one out and hope the Larsons can finely trim their vision next time.</p></div>"|15933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15933-trust-now/|5.8|Nick Neyland

Given how well the New Jersey band fused disparate moments, you had to figure they could reach even greater heights were they to craft their next set all at once. They did just that last winter, and the result is indeed a step forward. Cleaner, sharper, and just plain stronger, <i>Days </i>is like a single idea divided into simple statements-- a suite of subtle variations on a theme.</p>
<p>Its coherence sounds remarkably effortless, as if stringing together catchy gems is as easy as, in the words of one song, ""floating on an inner tube in the sun."" Interestingly, Real Estate actually acknowledge this sense of ease. The opener is bluntly titled ""Easy"", and references to carefree simplicity abound. As singer/guitarist Martin Courtney puts it, ""If it takes all summer long/ Just to write one simple song/ There's too much to focus on/ Clearly there is something wrong."" But the band's celebration of the uncomplicated is less about how <i>Days</i> was written than about the beauty of life seen in retrospect, especially young life in small towns.</p>
<p>Like the stirring scenes of suburban Texas in Terrence Malick's <i>The Tree of Life, </i>these songs find meaning in daily mundanities-- in houses and gardens, phone lines and street lights, names carved in trees and leaves pressed by footsteps. ""All those wasted miles/ All those aimless drives through green aisles,"" sings Courtney wistfully. ""Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise."" That sentiment was evident on the band's debut, but here they've honed it to its essence.</p>
<p>The music bears a simplicity to match. These aren't minimal songs by any means, but the layers of cycling guitar, rolling rhythm, and gentle echo are always understated, more about conveying feeling than showing off the band's considerable chops. There's also a smooth efficiency in these rich tunes. No note feels wasted, and nothing happens at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Much of this precision comes from guitarist Matt Mondanile, whose nimble playing adds color to each song's shape. It's most noticeable in the insistent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12260-its-real/"">""It's Real""</a>, but I'm even more taken with his sonic smoke rings in ""Out of Tune"", and how his shimmering guitar evokes sunrays mingling through branches and sparkling off pools.</p>
<p>That idyllic tone permeates <i>Days</i>, and in lesser hands could deprive it of tension or variety. But Real Estate have such a knack for classic-sounding melody that every song quickly engages on a musical gut level. It's a quality their music shares with the jangly hooks of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>, the breeziness of later <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>, and the garage twang of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a>. But their closest kin are New Jersey forefathers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"" target=""_blank"">the Feelies</a>. That group's undying ability to mine repeated chords and Zen phrases is matched best by the album's closer, ""All the Same"", a looping study of how night and day are merely sides of the same coin. Lasting over seven minutes, it might be Real Estate's first epic. But it's as subtle and unassuming as anything on <i>Days</i>-- more evidence from this band that great music doesn't have to sound hard to make, even if it is.</p></div>"|15918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days/|8.7|Marc Masters

But the band were also skilled samplers of rock'n'roll storylines, arriving in the early 1990s pre-equipped with that classic intra-band conflict, the singer vs. the songwriter. The tension between Noel and Liam Gallagher arrived with Oasis in the early 90s as a fully-formed rock drama worthy of Keith-Mick, Robert-Jimmy, and Rog-Pete, given added juice by shared genetics. With Chekhov's gun inevitability, their squabbles blew Oasis apart in 2009, with the final indignity of forcing Noel, the band's master architect, to quit his own masterpiece project <a href=""http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=773"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">via blog post</a>.</p>
<p>So here begins the familiar second act of the rock'n'roll story arc, the competitive-solo-record period. While Liam and the rest of Oasis got in the first punch (reforming and flicking Vs at their former bandleader as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29539-beady-eye/"" target=""_blank"">Beady Eye</a>), Noel has launched his High Flying Birds ""collective"" with a premise that's also rock canon: who needs a frontman, anyway? Oasis history already gives Noel some credibility on that front-- by their second album, the guitarist was already taking lead vox duties on a hit single (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Look Back in Anger""</a>), and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4XC_kw9aJ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the notorious MTV Unplugged episode</a> proved he could do just fine without his brother on the band's other material, thank you very much.</p>
<p>But for a declaration of independence, the self-titled High Flying Birds LP sounds awfully nostalgic for the good old days. Through most of the mercifully brief 10 tracks, Gallagher passes on the opportunity to use this new career chapter for either an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Albarn</a>-like experimental exploration or something stripped-down and personal. Of course, nothing in his career to date would suggest ""stripped-down"" is in Noel's vocabulary. His new band goes straight back to the widescreen aesthetic, with choirs, string sections, horn sections, and choruses aiming for the universal. Noel is still writing for the stadium-- it's the only audience he knows.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, a listener can forgive a lot of corniness, even as Noel tests the limits. At this point, it's almost endearing that he earnestly sees no problem starting a song with the lyric, ""Hot time/ Summer in the city,"" and thinks the clunky ""(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine"" is an acceptable song title <i>and</i> hook. But the latter track also shows Gallagher can still tickle anyone who once took the kind of soaring-orchestra-and-guitar-solo bridge (think Slash emerging from a pool of water in the rain) seriously. If the emotional power of anthemic rock is quickly draining, Gallagher remains among the best conductors of the fumes.</p>
<p>Still, there are some intriguing ideas buried under the maudlin arrangements and verse-chorus-verses. Often, the most interesting parts of the songs float frustratingly on the periphery of the mix, as with the lap steel of ""If I Had a Gun…"" or the musical saw that eerily haunts both ""The Death of You and Me"" and ""AKA… Broken Arrow"". One place where that formula reverses promisingly is ""AKA… What a Life!"", which is built upon a stormy piano loop, filtered drums, and Noel's melancholic take on 20 years of stardom.</p>
<p>The song is a reminder that Gallagher might have found a more exciting solo path by revisiting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5NX1FC-7-w&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Setting Sun""</a>, the Oasis-related moment that sounds most vital in 2011 (and perhaps the inspiration for his upcoming collab with Future Sound of London side project the Amorphous Androgynous). But instead he chooses to make another MTV Unplugged statement that's equal parts self-sufficient and self-conscious, all but writing in Liam and the rest of Beady Eye drunkenly heckling from the balcony. Founding High Flying Birds on pretty much the same musical territory as his old band, where Liam's snide yowl will always win out over Noel's passable but pedestrian voice, is the album's critical flaw. Forever a slave to rock history, Gallagher feels like he's biding his time for the third act reunion rather than breaking from the well-trod path.</p></div>"|15944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15944-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-st/|5.7|Rob Mitchum

This year, Warp releases <i>Glass Swords</i>, the debut album by <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rustiebeetz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, a young Glasgow producer who's come up in the protean post-dubstep scene and has yet to rough up the mainstream. (Give him time, though, especially if he catches the ear of a diva.) Most of the vinyl-only singles by LFO's revolutionary contemporaries are now sadly forgotten. In another 20 years, there's a good chance that most of the singles by Rustie's boundary-pushing peers will likewise be gathering metaphorical dust in the deep recesses of some iPod. But LFO's music has survived, and I have a feeling Rustie's will too. Because Rustie knows, like LFO knew, that the surest route to dance music immortality is to reach both the dabblers and the hardcore, marrying underground innovation with as many of electronic music's biggest ideas and best hooks as you can cram in.</p>
<p><i>Frequencies</i> kicked off with LFO literally asking, ""What is house?"" The duo's answer was the album itself. For LFO, house was everything that had already come along, from wistful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> to future-shock electro to beatific Detroit techno. They then edited it all into short and vibrant jolts, without watering things down a bit. <i>Glass Swords</i> takes the same tack, to brilliant and sometimes bewildering effect. The heavy wobble of dubstep is the frame that holds everything together, but thankfully Rustie's no purist. The title track is a dreamy and disorienting merger of metal guitar and IDM ambiance, bombastic and beatless, that owes as much to a portentous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Metallica</a> intro as old-school shoegaze swirl as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s kitschy take on progressive rock. And like the new wave of take-rave-back-to-the-kids producers, Rustie is also fearless about rehabilitating and reinventing the genre's cheesiest and most pleasurable moments, the stuff dubstep's more glower-prone producers wouldn't even claim as being part of the genre's DNA. On the so-giddy-it-feels-unstable ""Crystal Echo"", you might mistake Rustie for a happy hardcore producer brought out of retirement to remix <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a>, all squeaky, sped-up voices and hammering drums, twinkling melodies running smack into dubstep's bass whomp. <i>Glass Swords</i> might just as well have opened with Rustie asking, ""What is dubstep?"" His answer is the same as LFO's was for house: Everything, but as shiny and delirious and speaker-rattling as you can make it.</p>
<p>But Rustie is operating in a world where radio producers have already plundered dubstep for fresh sounds, and as if knowing he's now competing as much with <i>Billboard</i> hit-makers, his tracks have the maximalist zeal of Max Martin bubblegum. Even his most traditionally ""dubstep"" tunes won't sit still or do what they're supposed to, maniacally morphing plastic basslines and synth riffs with the sharpness of the album's titular crystal weaponry. ""Surph"" has the genre's requisite big bass drops, but Rustie also throws in pop-rave pianos, trance keyboards, and snippets of sugary R&amp;B, because he can, because he's showing off, because it's fun, because he's never interested in just turning out another scene-pleasing exercise. He shares the make-it-immediate urge of Deadmau5 and his ilk but has no time for their simplicity or brutality. One of the best things about <i>Glass Swords</i> is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks-- as you'd expect from a Warp album-- whether we're talking their classic-era IDM records or more recent signings like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>. ""Cry Flames"" has more of metal's brute force in its gnarled groove, but the real shiver-inducing moment comes when Rustie begins weaving a fragile, almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13319-erik-satie/"" target=""_blank"">Satie</a>-like piano melody into the bass snarl.</p>
<p>All that said, there's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, <i>Glass Swords</i> can feel just as much like a ""greatest bits"" collage. A lot of <i>déjà vu</i> elements are worked onto the framework of a current club trend, little hints of everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"" target=""_blank"">Art of Noise</a> to U-Ziq to the S.O.S. Band to old RPG soundtracks colliding with dubstep's bass pressure. But compared to the sterile sound of most retro-collage electronic albums, it's also an undeniable and up-to-the-minute rush. And in a couple of decades, when you're looking for an instant hit of what  electronic pop felt like in 2011, you'll be able to throw on <i>Glass Swords</i> and get a dose of that feeling in its purest form.</p></div>"|15937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/|8.0|Jess Harvell

With partner Roly Porter, the duo highlighted the genre's grimiest qualities, making industrial tracks like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqV6zeCFkJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thunder</a>"" that sounded not unlike high-speed car crashes. But that wasn't his true calling. ""I was more the technical guy in Vex'd,"" Teasdale, now going by Kuedo, <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/07170-kuedo-interview-jamie-vexd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently told the Quietus</a>. ""A lot of the musical language came from Roly's side."" And so it turns out that Teasdale's own musical language is actually quite dreamy and even romantic. His debut LP, <i>Severant</i>, brings together expressive synth work and cinematic sweep with a degree of nuance and, well, prettiness that's frankly kind of surprising.</p>
<p>Teasdale cleverly combines a few different genres here. First, through the use of vintage synth equipment, he conjures sci-fi soundscapes similar to the type deployed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>. With Vangelis' 1982 <i>Blade Runner</i> score an obvious touchstone, he layers nostalgia-hued synths in swirling, evocative patterns. But where guys like OPN like to leave these sounds untethered, Teasdale grounds them in the wobble and kick of dance music. Hearing these generally spacey tones backed by drums is cool on its own, but it's the kind of beats he chooses that really sets this record apart. Ignoring the cavernous drops of dubstep, Teasdale pulls instead from the faster, tinnier percussion of Chicago footwork and Lex Luger-style hip-hop production.</p>
<p>This unlikely pairing creates variations in speed, color, and texture that make <i>Severant</i> a dynamic listen. There's constant tension between an otherworldly, futuristic feeling and this more stuttering energy that keeps the tracks earthbound. Take ""Scissors"" for an example: Teasdale floats an airy, alien organ over quick-hitting bass and machine gun hi-hats, and the result is visceral, like standing under a helicopter taking off; at the same time, there's an eerily peaceful sensation to it. He also shows a good amount of range, going moody on ""Seeing the Edges"", darkly menacing on ""Flight Path"", and even R&amp;B-sexy with closer ""Memory Rain"". In each case the tracks avoid one-note flatness by spreading the sounds in several different directions at once.</p>
<p>At 15 songs, <i>Severant</i> is long and occasionally becomes drifty, but at its best, the album is a confident, even inspired, solo debut. There are stretches where it feels like you're hearing sounds being put together for the first time, which is something that can't be said of many artists in an increasingly crowded and diluted electronic-music field. And it's not just that Teasdale cracks open a new micro-strain of music here-- call it the midpoint between experimental techno and the hip-hop street banger-- it's that he does it with a lot of warmth and nuance. Tonally these tracks are a world away from the aggro crunch of Vex'd. For other artists, there's plenty of value in that style, but <i>Severant</i> feels like the kind of music that this guy is intended to make.</p></div>"|15945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15945-severant/|7.7|Joe Colly

Apparently, the first two have been delayed, leaving us with this-- a handful of songs from each LP. But if the compilation is an indicator of the rest of the material, Sultan did an excellent job naming those records. These songs are exactly that-- whatever kind of track he wants to do, inspired by whichever era he chooses. Sultan-- who has pilfered from doo-wop, early-1960s rock and R&amp;B, punk, garage, and plenty of other styles--  isn't a guy with a limited palate, so maybe he didn't want to be limited to one time period or sound or idea.</p>
<p>In this sense, and others, <i>Whatever/Whenever</i> is a grab bag. The final track, for example, is an experimental free jazz song that's over eight minutes long. Surprisingly, it's the best thing on the album. Two tracks earlier, by contrast, is the gratingly repetitive ""Party Crasher"". The positive part of putting out such an uninhibited range of work? By moving into territory not covered by him or one of his various bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8662-the-king-khan-bbq-show/"" target=""_blank"">the King Khan &amp; BBQ Show</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11069-the-spaceshits/"" target=""_blank"">the Spaceshits</a>, the Ding-Dongs), he's managed to make something ethereal and oddly beautiful. The negative? <i>Whatever/Whenever</i> is all over the place.</p>
<p>There are quality moments, though, and songs that would fit well with the source material he's evoking. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12484-song-in-grey/"" target=""_blank"">Song in Grey</a>"" could stand next to an early-60s girl-group or rock song with its sunny delivery of a heartbreaking message and earworm vocal hook. But even when a song stands out, the next track cheapens it. ""Just Like Before"" follows ""Song in Grey""-- it's a breezy ukulele-wielding ballad that would've fit tidily in the Mills Brothers' catalog. And after that, ""Calloused Hands"", a fuzzy pop rocker, jumps in. Just about every song presents a new disparity, and with each subsequent track, it's a new genre or time or attitude that jumps in. It's a crowded album layout that doesn't give the songs much room to breathe.</p>
<p>One saving grace is Sultan's croon, which is especially bold this time around. ""If I Had a Polaroid"" finds him belting out those dragging vowels he's done for a while (""daaaaaarling""). It's a great vocal performance-- he tempers the volume to sound vulnerable, and later he growls out lines for an extra emotional punch. Unfortunately, the song itself sounds like a balladized cousin of King Khan &amp; BBQ's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvfnoqHuTFg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'll Be Loving You""</a> and doesn't bring anything new to the table. The songs where he does kick up the tempo are a welcome addition: ""Satisfied &amp; Lazy"" lights a rockabilly-paced fire with its heavy-handed drums and biting vocals, and ""Let Me Freeze"" is a lo-fi, minute-long song where he shouts and points back to the Circle Jerks. Songs like these deserve to shine, but <i>Whatever/Whenever</i> is too claustrophobic for that sort of possibility. Because Sultan casts such a wide net, it would probably be better if each song had its own 7""-- all together, it sounds like a poorly organized collection of demos and ideas.</p></div>"|15935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15935-mark-sultan-whatever-whenever/|5.8|Evan Minsker

With all due respect, consider the redundancy of that statement: Since 2003 breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5006-dead-cities-red-seas-lost-ghosts/"" target=""_blank"">Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</a></i>, every new and increasingly colossal <a href=""http://ilovem83.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> studio record has led to widespread crowdsourcing of synonyms for ""epic."" What exactly was he promising other than simply another album?</p>
<p>Well, throughout the past decade, the 30-year old Gonzalez has honored the tremendous impact of growing up during the golden age of CD buying by implicitly serving as a patron saint for those who treat the weekly trip to the record store as a pilgrimage and still covet the album as a physical proposition: His output always comes stylishly packaged, with cover art worth obsessing over and credits that need to be scoured in order to spot the guest appearances. Unsurprisingly, he ups the ante here by aspiring to what is still the paradigm of artistic permanence, both in terms of legacy and tactility: the double album, that occasionally ambitious, usually decadent, and almost always fascinatingly flawed endeavor of musicians convinced (rightfully or otherwise) that they're at the peak of their own powers. <i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming </i> might be all of those things, but above all else, it's the best M83 record yet.</p>
<p>But let's talk about restraint for a moment: While each side of <i>Hurry Up</i> would be oddly slight for an M83 album, the demands of its 74-minute runtime are hardly daunting. It's actually the easiest M83 album to consume in one sitting, a reverse accumulation of past strengths that makes for Gonzalez's most compact and combustive music yet. He continues the path set by <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/"" target=""_blank"">Saturdays=Youth</a></i> by easing out of the mini-movie business in exchange for pop songcraft, while trading that LP's pretty-in-pink pastels for the urban neons and fluorescents of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5009-before-the-dawn-heals-us/"" target=""_blank"">Before the Dawn Heals Us</a></i> and embodying <i>Dead Cities</i>' mile-wide expansiveness.</p>
<p>But the most crucial change is how touring with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> has inspired a newfound showmanship in his vocals: Previously, Gonzalez enlisted outside help, piped in plot-advancing narratives, or sang in a low, tentative murmur that submitted to its massive surroundings. But here, within the first minutes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12321-intro-ft-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">""Intro""</a>, he's matching blows with the juggernaut bellow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>' Nika Danilova to the point where it's much tougher than you'd think to tell them apart. It's really not too different from the first chords of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXyrCRd1ikw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Planet Telex""</a> or Lil Wayne's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGcyQH7BJUM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tha Mobb""</a> in terms of being an unmistakable sign that you're going to be listening to this familiar act differently.</p>
<p>M83 have never stood for half measures in any aspect, but Gonzalez is absolutely <i>going for it</i> here in a way that sheds new light on known tricks: The hair-triggered drum rolls of ""New Map"" recall <i>Before the Dawn</i>'s searing car-crash fantasy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aJypxFrVkU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Save Us From the Flames""</a>, but Gonzalez's nervy punctuation at the end of each line sells the idea that he's along for the ride this time rather than being a passive observer. <i>Dead Cities</i>' <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4tpeu_m83-in-church_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In Church""</a> was the sound of blissful acquiescence, but amidst the swaggering synth-metal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12263-midnight-city/"" target=""_blank"">""Midnight City""</a>, Gonzalez hollers, ""The city is my church!"" empowered and present, finding a voice for the evangelical zeal always implicit in his work.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has stressed <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i> as a major inspiration (and by extension, its forefather, <i>The Wall</i>), and its influence can be spotted in <i>Hurry Up</i>'s power ballads ""Wait"" and ""My Tears Are Becoming a Sea"", sumptuously arranged tracks that could still be played solo on an acoustic guitar. Thankfully, he didn't retain much from ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" or ""The Trial"", and rather than one man lashing out at the world from the safety of his own thematic construct, you feel that Gonzalez is trying to connect with it.</p>
<p>As such, the moments of indulgence are in service of the album's most endearing and silly emotions: Some might consider ""Raconte-Moi Une Histoire"" a throwaway because it's ""the one about a magic frog,"" but besides embodying the whiplash emotions of youth by following the magnificent melancholy of ""Wait"", its almost eerie brightness and Windows 95-era sound effects capture a technological optimism better than a lot of artists who are trying <i>only</i> to do that. Meanwhile, ""Year One, One UFO"" attempts to distill the percussion-mad, organic ecstasy of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/863-vision-creation-newsun/"" target=""_blank"">Vision Creation Newsun</a></i> into three minutes, while on the opposite side, ""Claudia Lewis"" and ""OK Pal"" show a mastery of slapbass-poppin', corporate funk-rock comparable to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"" target=""_blank"">Cut Copy</a> without the twinge of pastiche.</p>
<p>As with any double album, there's a temptation to strip away the instrumental tracks or simply pick the best 50 minutes for your daily commute. But the interludes here are intended to be every bit as purposeful as the singles: The shorter the track, the more evocative its title (""Where the Boats Go"", ""Train to Pluton"", ""Another Wave From You""). While many of them stand as intriguing meditations on their own merits, they reinforce <i>Hurry Up</i>'s intentions to be an immersive universe-- check in whenever you want, but the magic's in the exploratory phases. And why leave out what falls in between, like the thermite burst of the two-minute ""This Bright Flash"" or the stately ""When Will You Come Home?""-to-""My Tears Are Becoming a Sea"" triptych that serves as the connective transit between Side 1 and Side 2.</p>
<p>Then again, I can't blame anyone who takes shortcuts, since the traditionally structured songs here are some of the most thrilling pop music released this year. The heavily saturated synths Gonzalez favored early in his career invited plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a> comparisons, but whereas pure shoegaze of that nature attempts to overwhelm and obliterate, <i>Hurry Up</i> is like a sonic planetarium, penetrable and totally geared toward enhancing the user experience. Few artists make more ingenious use of the sheer physics of rock to this extent-- defining which synth pads strike which emotional pressure points, using percussion as explosives rather than mere elements of timekeeping, coiling the tension of a verse to make every chorus feel phenomenally cathartic even without any words.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank"">At</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15166-new-history-of-warfare-vol-2-judges/"" target=""_blank"">this</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">point</a> in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15623-last-summer/"" target=""_blank"">the</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15321-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/"" target=""_blank"">year</a>, you'd think a saxophone solo would have lost all the novelty it had accumulated over decades of disuse, yet when one pops up at the end of ""Midnight City"", it triumphantly squires the track out at the highest point possible. After a streak of staccato guitar chords and splashy cymbal hits rev up ""Reunion"", the shouts from its chorus could come from a soccer stadium or a speedboat chase. ""Intro"" is typical of Gonzalez's love for zero-gravity arrangements of massed choirs and cathedral reverb, but there's nothing buzzy or clouded about it-- as high as he takes things, you can still see everything underneath in crisp, butterflies-inducing depth and detail.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Steve McQueen"", which somehow makes the preceding hour of music feel like its prelude. Point blank, it's as close as most of us will get to being strapped inside a space shuttle, as midway through an almost unbearably tensile verse, you don't hear drums so much as afterburners kicking in. By the chorus, it simply cannot go further up, and it explodes at the perfect moment into hair-metal guitar chords and synth-led skywriting. And yet, because it's almost impossible to say what ""Steve McQueen"" is about (certainly not the actor), it's capable of glorifying anything you choose-- a slow motion shot of Kirk Gibson rounding the bases in the 1988 World Series, a holiday fireworks display, or getting into your car and simply celebrating the end of an exhausting day.</p>
<p>Is it a lot to handle? Of course, and those who have yet to connect with M83 may wonder if the sort of incapacitating longing expressed by ""Wait"" can possibly be experienced by anyone over the age of 16 or whether they'll ever be able to afford the stereo equipment seemingly required for its intended effect. But remember, it's called <i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</i>: It doesn't attempt to be a comprehensive or even realistic purview of the human experience, and lord knows there's plenty out there that's meant to capture small moments.</p>
<p>It's easy to mistrust something so irrepressibly optimistic about the affective possibilities of music and to attribute these feelings to the domain of some ""other,"" whether it's the 1980s, teenhood, or a pop product. Does it share some sort of commonality with ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Born This Way</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Firework</a>"", or any other entry from 2011's chart music that attempts to convince you of your own superstardom? Surely, but Gonzalez never comes off like he's selling a brand, a lifestyle, or even himself-- his lyrics remain as opaque as ever. <i>Hurry Up</i> instead serves as a framework to realize the marvelous capability of our dreams and daily lives, should we be open to experiencing it.</p></div>"|15881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/|9.1|Ian Cohen

Now, on the 20th anniversary of those events, both brands are still making headlines, despite enduring extended periods of inactivity, aborted restarts, and organizational restructuring. And it's perhaps no coincidence that both Jane's Addiction and Lollapalooza have evolved in exactly the same way: What were once unpredictable, chaotic forces have inevitably mutated into well-oiled, monolithic entities bearing little of the charm and character of their original incarnations. This circumstance is not lost on frontman/Lolla visionary Perry Farrell who, on Jane's Addiction's new album, proudly declares, ""We've become a big business/ A galaxy merger!""</p>
<p>Even if that line is intended to be a metaphor for a blossoming romantic relationship, the fact that Farrell's singing of love in the language of commerce effectively sums up the proficient but perfunctory nature of <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>, Jane's Addiction's fifth official album, their second comeback record (following 2003's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4203-strays/"" target=""_blank"">Strays</a></i>), and the first release since the short-lived reintroduction of founding bassist Eric Avery into the fold for a 2009 tour. No doubt, their various attempts to keep Jane's alive over the past decade have taught Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, and drummer Stephen Perkins that replacing Avery requires more than just finding a talented bass player. In many respects, Avery defined the band's sonic identity and mystique; think of any Jane's classic, and often the first thing that pops into your head is one of those <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kAIMlISHhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ominous</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx6691i0KDE&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">propulsive</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpCCfazKxzk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">basslines</a>. So while the middling <i>Strays</i> tried to plug session vet Chris Chaney into the dynamic, for <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>, the band makes a more concerted effort at revitalization, recruiting everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Dave Sitek to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1822-guns-n-roses/"" target=""_blank"">Guns N' Roses</a> bassist Duff McKagan to Morocco's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5bVR-zPYZ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master Musicians of Joujouka</a>-- a trifecta of collaborators who respectively play to Jane's Addiction's affinities for heady atmosphere, raunchy hard rock, and tribal-percussion jams.</p>
<p>At the outset, <i>The Great Escape Artist</i> lives up to that on-paper potential: Farrell's freak-scene re-indoctrination ""Underground"" and Avery-directed invective ""End to the Lies"" (featuring the Joujouka crew) open the album with a pair of promisingly authoritative metallic grinds that sound like they were grafted from the slow-motion mid-section of <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwI02OHtZTg&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop""</a>, but with Sitek's chrome-plated textures adding a post-apocalyptic ambience that greatly complements Navarro's eerie six-string squeals. But there's a palpable dip in intensity from there on in, as <i>The Great Escape Artist</i> gets mired in the not-quite-rock/not-quite-ballad purgatory that defines so much post-grunge alt-radio.</p>
<p>As slickly produced as <i>Nothing's Shocking</i> and <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i> were, you always got the sense that Jane's Addiction were a band of four interconnected personalities contributing distinct, individual parts to the majestic whole. But even compared to the nu-metalloid sheen of <i>Strays</i>, <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>'s intricate, heavily lacquered production-- courtesy of Muse-man Rich Costey-- has the effect of making Jane's Addiction sound like an anonymous assemblage of oversaturated recording tracks. More so than Avery's commanding presence, what's really missing here is Jane's Addiction's sense of playfulness, absurdity, and rhythmic verve. Beyond hard-charging closer ""Words Right Out of My Mouth"", powerhouse drummer Perkins is given scant opportunity to flex his percussive muscle and is instead relegated to playing the mild-mannered time-keeper on melodramatic turns like ""Twisted Tales"" and ""Splash a Little Water on It"", while Sitek's bass contributions are barely perceptible underneath the glossy sheen. And for a frontman who's always been happy to flaunt his own ridiculousness, Farrell is surprisingly humorless here, the quirky character studies and brash swagger of old replaced by straight-faced pleading and vague second-person admonishments. Sure, the line, ""You were the foreskin/ I was the real head,"" reads as hilarious but, coming from a Jew, probably isn't meant as a term of endearment.</p>
<p>There is, however, one song here-- ""Broken People""-- that cuts through <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>'s sleek surface and provides a glimpse of the charismatic, affective band that Jane's once were and still could be. (Surprisingly, it's one of McKagan's three co-writes.) And, as per the standard set by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN8V4VflpWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Would For You""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMcXjqUI8GQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jane Says""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uj4Q4zbtfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Then She Did...""</a>, ""Broken People"" is a melancholic reverie dedicated to a tragic female protagonist, though instead calling upon his usual cast of junkies and eccentrics, Farrell updates the archetype to paint a sympathetic portrait of a sex-vid-shilling celebutante. Despite the sensationalistic subject matter, Jane's treat it with an understated elegance, thanks to Navarro's beautifully restrained guitar line, a sensitive but not mawkish vocal from Farrell, and-- rare for this album-- a concise, unfussy arrangement; even the amped-up, fist-pump treatment applied to the third verse can't sully the song's graceful sway. In a world where truly nothing is shocking, Jane's Addiction have understandably lost the will and desire to be as outrageous and confrontational as they once were. But as ""Broken People"" attests, the most effective way for a big business to surprise you is through a simple, humble act of charity.</p></div>"|15910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15910-janes-addiction/|5.0|Stuart Berman

Appropriately, Giannopoulos sings of the end with apocalyptic imagery, a would-be horseman requesting that a ""divine mare"" help him spread an unspoken plague. ""Our light has been eclipsed, the tides washing ashore,"" he screams, his voice so serrated, his tone so saturated, that the words are barely decipherable. The sound is threatening enough, with words or not. Indeed, even during what turns out to be a fairly indelible chorus, ""Horse Thieves""'s voices vacillate between dark, darker, and darkest. It's like a seven-minute history of the progression of black-metal vocals from the basements of Oslo 20 years ago to, these days, high-end recording studios.</p>
<p>But the Atlas Moth aren't a black metal band-- at all. Rather, they're one of a growing legion of bands to use bits of that form-- and, really, everything from stoner metal to psychedelic rock, free jazz to electric blues-- to make militantly adventurous heavy metal. In fact, when Giannopoulos is howling his imprecations during ""Horse Theives"", he's backed by a slow, stubborn, swaggering blues riff and a rhythm section that has more to do with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"" target=""_blank"">Mono</a>'s escalating brood than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10031-mayhem/"" target=""_blank"">Mayhem</a>'s shrieking ferocity. Jamie Branch streaks the song's bridge with trumpet hiss, while Andrew Ragin puts down his guitar to add eerie piano jet wash. It all sounds like some awesome, evil vaudeville after-party that, after an impasse, somehow erupts into a sludgy sing-along about a serpent's tongue and staying alive.</p>
<p>Such patent unpredictability and versatility fuel the entirety of <i>An Ache for the Distance</i>, a dense, 45-minute listen that never seems to stop revealing new aspects and assets. The Atlas Moth are an excellent three-guitar quintet as capable of heroic, spiraling leads (see the start of ""Coffin Varnish"") as they are thick, interlocking lines that serve more as a working matrix for the lyrics, as with ""Your Calm Waters"". Giannopoulos takes the lead on that track, crying out for a commitment of assistance should he not make it out alive. ""Before you climb off, check the pulse/ Bring me back to life,"" he yells. His call is actually answered by David Kush, the Atlas Moth's sort of hook singer (the liner notes credit him with ""clean vocals""). Throughout <i>Distance</i>, he and Giannopoulos trade lines and parts, occasionally creating conversations between hope and despair.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Distance</i> is anchored on old-fashioned worry for the future; as with those blues guitars and rock'n'roll drums, Kush's hooks, which strangely split the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"" target=""_blank"">Hawkwind</a> and Hot Topics, create tension for Giannopoulos' protestations. They make his bleak seem that much bleaker. What's more, Kush's singing prevents the album's one collaboration from seeming out of place. Mark Solotroff is best known for his work in power electronics as Bloodyminded, but on ""Courage"", he sings like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Kozelek</a> fronting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"" target=""_blank"">Jesu</a>. The unlikely ballad offers a perfect respite for <i>Distance</i>'s general roar and, once again, reveals another capability of the band without squandering too much of the album's propulsion.</p>
<p>The divide between advocates for purity and post-everything blends feels particularly polarized right now-- not just in metal or even music, but in entertainment at large and politics. The Atlas Moth certainly falls into the latter category, churning ideas sometimes considered mutually exclusive inside one relentless package. Importantly, though, it feels neither like a pastiche nor like a pretense. On only their second album, the Atlas Moth have successfully captured a signature, singular mix of ideas and impulses, quickly covering a distance that others waste careers trying to match.</p></div>"|15936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15936-an-ache-for-the-distance/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Something about the music felt both gigantic and life-sized, characterized by a seamless mingling of the mythic and the quotidian. This was how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Isaac Brock</a> could stare at the queue at a dying shopping mall's Orange Julius and see a metaphor for an existential purgatory, or how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Martsch</a>, in his friendly, slacker lilt, could have late night bro-to-bro conversations <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS3NmClfaZU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with the Big Dipper</a>. The New York band <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/fuckforestfire"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forest Fire</a> don't <i>sound</i> much like early Modest Mouse or Built to Spill, but one of the exciting things about their debut, the sleeper hit <i>Survival</i>, was that it recalled the spirit of indie rock's feet-on-the-ground, eyes-to-the-sky stance. There was a lackadaisical quality to its casually strummed guitars and to Mark Thresher's easygoing drawl, but embedded within what a cursory listen might mistakenly dismiss as sonic shrugs was something that felt decidedly and almost deceptively epic. It was one of those records that would always trick you into forgetting it was only 29 minutes long.</p>
<p>It was also easy to forget that Forest Fire were from Brooklyn. Not just because of the sweeping sprawl of their sound, but because they seemed to exist, in 2008 anyway, somewhere just outside of the churn of the hype machine. Released as a free download through the tiny but formidable blog-based imprint <a href=""http://www.catbirdseat.org/catbirdrecords/index1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Catbird Records</a>, <i>Survival</i> built an audience mainly through blogs and ended up appearing on (and even, in a few instances, topping) some notable year-end lists. A vote for <i>Survival</i> was a vote against buzz, as it seemed to gesture toward a whole, wide internet dense with undiscovered gems. Three years later, the digital landscape into which Forest Fire release their second LP feels more cluttered and complicated for sure, but they've still got a rogue streak to their image. One of their press bios claims that Forest Fire ""reject the 'what's next' attitude plaguing so many of the NYC/Brooklyn scene,"" which-- as far as Amazon.com editorial lines go-- sound like fighting words. Fortunately, <i>Staring at the X</i> doesn't need them; it's good enough-- and weird enough-- to assert these kinds of claims on its own.</p>
<p>Signs of the band's development are scattered all over the record's first two minutes. Gone are <i>Survival</i>'s campfire strums, and in their place some fuzzed-out, Martsch-sized riffage that unfurls across ""Born Into""'s expansive sprawl. And in true Forest Fire fashion, there's plenty more sprawl where that came from. Clocking in at six-and-a-half minutes, the record's most extreme departure is also one of its standout moments: the sinister, hypnotic, bass-driven space-groove ""They Pray Execution Style"" (featuring perfectly deadpan lead vocals by multi-instrumentalist Natalie Stormann). Forest Fire swing between long stretches of darkness and sudden sunbursts (""The News""), and occasionally these two impulses compete within a single song. The ostensibly sprightly ""Future Shadows"" is a meditation on love and death, concluding with Thresher's steady-voiced admission, ""I am afraid/ And I'm on my way.""</p>
<p><i>Staring at the X</i> ambles and meanders-- occasionally too much for its own good. Its second half in particular stays at a pretty uniform and sluggish tempo, which will make you long for such pop interruptions as the infectious single ""The News"" provided on Side A. As on <i>Survival</i>, Forest Fire are at their best when they're teasing out the formal contrasts in their sound, pivoting expertly between spacey slowburners and compact pop gems. But even more so than their promising debut, <i>Staring at the X</i> proves them to be a commendably ambitious band with the chops to carry out even their most far-flung ideas.</p></div>"|15925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15925-forest-fire-staring-at-the-x/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

Early Moog-tweaking musicians  and engineers spent a lot of time figuring out how to electronically  warp the work of baroque composers into ironic juxtapositions between  tradition and technology, but eventually they had to come to terms with  the fact that much of it still registered as grotesque  distortions of nuanced melody. And for every <i>musique concrète</i> and  BBC Radiophonic Workshop genius who turned those limitations into  successfully arresting experiments, there was someone like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72sAJpDIeq8&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jean-Jacques  Perrey</a> who  thrived on the potential of the equipment's inherent pop goofiness.  Combine the cheerfully dippy, utopian enthusiasm of late-1960s electronic  music with the more whimsical strains of the same era's psychedelic  experimentation, and the end result can be clamorously demented at  worst. Or best.</p>
<p>Of course, it means something drastically different to invoke that  synthemesc horrorshow now that it's 40-plus years in the past,  what with a couple of dozen hours' worth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4604-gary-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Wilson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>, and  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5277-black-moth-super-rainbow/"" target=""_blank"">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a> having had their say in the intervening  decades. <i>Twirligig </i>is the first full-length album from Sydney  multi-instrumentalist Jonti Danilewitz, and if it follows those  aforementioned artists' archly playful approach to retrofuturist  synth-psych, it also embodies it in odd, frivolous little songs that are  as intricately constructed as they are naggingly irritating. Once the  second track and highlight ""Nightshift in Blue"" is done working  its sun-bleached, rubber-limbed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Sounds</a></i> vibe, the rest of the  album falls into a succession of woozy, disorienting, somewhat  uncomfortable assemblages of brow-furrowing sketch-songs that often  amble along a little too preciously for their own good.</p>
<p>Sometimes the tone is overly quirky: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15901-firework-spraying-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Firework Spraying Moon</a>""  and ""Begone Slumber"" are short, slight, and often pretty, but in a way  that seems too slapstick, like the notebook-paper-doodled title  sequence to your typical indie comedy film. Sometimes it's almost  obnoxiously overstuffed with noise, albeit in a half-speed, low-energy  way, as in ""Spooky Sport"" and the layers of screeching  bird/rubber/guitar/Atari ambiance that make its quasi-Polynesian swoon  so bracing. And sometimes it feigns one of those moods before dropping  the other on you. ""Nodlews Way Home"" stabs its ambling, mellow blues  lope between the shoulder blades with a piercing, oscillating  synthesizer squall that seems to be drunkenly picking a fight with the  rest of the song. And the title track feels like two half-finished ideas  haphazardly stapled together to make a quarter-finished song, a  rhythm-machine and faux-Theremin reverie pushed unceremoniously toward a  fuzz-synth drone through a tunnel of overbearing distortion.</p>
<p>But credit where it's due: Irritation and bafflement might  actually be part of the intent, especially when they're so often used to  cut through moments that would otherwise feel a bit pat in their serenity. It clearly took a lot of work to assemble some of these noisy,  chirpy things, and there are a number of odd little details of four-track  alchemy to unearth, even though the bulk of the songs clock in at less  time than your average commercial break. It's pretty dense stuff: Every sound melts into itself with  such viscous goopiness that eventually it's easy to forget that what  you're listening to may have involved instruments at some point, rather  than just the residue of some kind of ancient digital ectoplasm. It is a  bit ephemeral, but not quite as music to relax to-- more like music to  be bewildered by. And there's real craft in the way Jonti manipulates  his multitracked vocals, pulling them apart to disorienting, clashing  effect or merging them into seamless harmony. In either case, he's got a  good sense of how to shape his voice into power-pop harmonic  wonderment. It's not a good enough sense to avoid having it buried in  the mix, rendering the occasional lyrics not only indecipherable but  almost beside the point. But sometimes you've just got to let the  machines win.</p></div>"|15909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15909-jonti-twirligig/|6.1|Nate Patrin

The Sacramento quartet (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29131-off/"" target=""_blank"">OFF!</a> tourmates) wield such an in-your-personal-space presence and messy, spastic forward push that it can be hard, as a viewer or listener, to give them back the energy they deserve. When watching their shows-- during which they often repurpose bottles, mic stands, and garbage cans as projectiles-- it's thrilling when they unplug, and you're still locked in and protecting your head. The group's 10-song, 17-minute 2010 third album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14102-eyes-nines/"" target=""_blank"">Eyes &amp; Nines</a></i>, was good; their new, five-song, nine-minute <i>Awake</i> EP is great. Not all of this has to do with leaving-you-wanting-more brevity: The band, led by playfully (but effectively) violent, wall-climbing vocalist Lee Spielman, are finding more ways to cram hooks and distinctive details into what, in the past, followed a more specific punk template. Here, the guys nail a sort of thrashing pop to the spastic hardcore without loosening the grip around your throat.</p>
<p>See, for instance, the opening <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12406-awake/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>: Starting with solo drumming and then some guitar feedback and double vocal shouts--  Spielman's spastic upper register mixed with a deeper grunt-- ""Awake"" turns into something colossal in under two minutes. The pulse is rollicking, weirdly unhurried (no vocals until 23 seconds in), the whole thing packed tight. And, as usual, the lyrics feel like a call to arms. We get the scene-setting introductory line, ""In the land of nod, he who sleeps with both eyes open is god,"" but it's the chorus-- ""Reflected in conniption fits/ I'm jaundiced, gaunted, sick sick sick/ Awake""-- that establishes a more interesting tone.</p>
<p>It's a kind of vintage <i>Maximumrocknroll</i> vibe, with sentiments you might glean from <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrimethinc.com%2F&amp;ei=3waXTovQCMeLsgKxvoHtBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGonJ2f7JcBrzYOLfcOxIMeGMuVSA&amp;sig2=r9IKcMi8hlu07Xm7NaXxgg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Crimethinc</i></a>. From the thorny inverted peace symbol on the cover, the disenfranchised lyrical sentiment (see the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1395-awake/"" target=""_blank"">the smash-shit-up ""Awake"" video</a>), Trash Talk continue to dig into the sort of anger that inspired the recent Occupy Wall Street protests. Though it taps into feelings that have always been there, it feels especially important and of this moment. In the 58-second track ""Slander"" we get: ""Line up and call me names/ Come spit in my face/ It doesn't matter/ I'm in a better place."" In the fantastic closer ""Gimme Death"", we're given a protagonist making the most of destitution: ""Facedown in the gutter/ I've got my ear to the street."" In the breakdown-heavy ""Blind Evolution"", we're told, ""I've got a problem with no solution/ The solution's out of reach,"" and, ""Your revolution's already lost."" Even on this short burst of an EP, Trash Talk are working on a more expansive level.</p>
<p>For instance, the last lines of the record-- ""Gimme death""-- resonate as more than a standard punk toss-off after a close listen to fourth track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44195-video-trash-talk-burn-alive/"" target=""_blank"">""Burn Alive""</a>. In two minutes of the latter, there's a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a> nod (""When I grow up I wanna be sedated""), revolutionary imagery (""Plant the seed and the fury spreads like legs/ Without a light at the end of the tunnel unless they set the whole mountain ablaze""), and this: ""A blind man told me it's better to burn out than to fade away/ I said 'You're missing the point… yeah, the good die young/ But the great survive to burn alive/ The good die young, so burn alive.'"" Trash Talk have been drawing that sort of line in the sand for years-- it's the sort of thing lifers do. Still, in 2011 it's satisfying seeing a higher-profile punk band carrying a torch like this, and unafraid to use it as a weapon.</p></div>"|15911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15911-awake/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14111-one-one/"" target=""_blank"">One One</a></i>, a heady singer-songwriter record, there's a hushed creeping intimacy to the thing, and a Zen-like acceptance of overbearing forces, even if it intends to keep on kicking against them. Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14648-one-club/"" target=""_blank"">One Club</a></i>, which twisted field recordings from the Frankfurt nightclub Robert Johnson into splayed-apart dance music, thereby ingesting corporatized club culture on its own terms, <i>One Pig</i> is an overwhelming, inscrutably political electronic record culled from an unlikely source. In this case, it consists of manipulated recordings Herbert made of a pig's life, <a href=""http://pitchperfectpr.com/images/presskit/matthew%20herbert%20ONE%20PIG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""from birth to plate.""</a></p>
<p>This certainly isn't the exploitation record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38092-herbert-and-peta-beef-over-pig-album"">PETA</a> assumed it was gonna be, and it's not a slab of musical vegan didacticism that presumably, many more, who prefer their music to be good first, and message-oriented second, feared either. No matter how visceral Herbert's mix of animal grunts and menacing electronics feel, the message is never something simple like, ""it sure is sad that we kill animals."" Rather, it moves listeners to be more mindful of consumption and waste (the pig's parts were even turned into instruments), while acknowledging just how strangely disconnected we are from the animals killed to put food on our table, or say, shoes on our feet.</p>
<p>But the lingering feeling on <i>One Pig</i>, the first half in particular, is still one of abject horror. ""September"" (each song is named after the time of year when the sounds contained therein were recorded) begins with stabs of noise that could be from <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> score, and then shifts into a slowly molting rhythm, punctuated by horrifying retches from the pig. As the track perversely bounces along, the animal wails become harsher, and Herbert  pulls the growl in and out of the mix and you begin to expect, even anticipate them. Its appearance in the mix becomes as viscerally rewarding as a typical pop-song hook.</p>
<p>Much of the record intends to freak listeners out, but there are gorgeous moments of pause too, and often those conflicting feelings are contained on the same track, making the message complex and never one-note. ""November"" is a delicate recording of the pig oinking, jaggedly interrupted by telling sounds (knives clanging together, something plopping on a hard surface) and nervous rhythms (gulps of tinny feedback, vibrant drumming), foreshadowing the pig's death, and even suggesting it's oddly cognizant of the end in some way. It's a way to invoke empathy for the creature. But then, the track bounds foreword into an intense damaged dance track, slamming into ""December"" which begins with an ominous metal gate opening. Rarely does a piece of music feel this genuinely temporal-- like anything could happen at any moment.</p>
<p>As <i>One Pig</i> moves closer to the end, the songs gain focus and the pig itself is subsumed into the process, not just sampled, but literally creating the music thanks to a strange <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/matlocktest/6010945485/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""pig blood organ""</a> and a drum made of pigskin. ""August 2010"" begins with recordings of the pig being cut up and fried, and ends with it being joyously consumed by a room of people. In between is a sea of strange, melodic whines and moans-- like the pig cheaply Auto-Tuned or vocoded. According to this excellent <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2011/sep/23/one-pig-matthew-herbert-video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">making-of video</a> on <i>The Guardian</i>'s website, the sound's generated by that organ, whose sucking rhythms are the result of blood coursing through the instrument.</p>
<p>To suggest you cannot enjoy the record would be inaccurate, but Herbert has cleverly designed an album that must be experienced on its own terms. The last track, a touching, voice-and-guitar ode to the pig by Herbert that looks back to <i>One One</i>'s simplicity-- and in that sense, provides circularity to the entire trilogy-- makes the pig's absence palpable. Throughout the album, even those most viscerally catchy and hypnotic songs, just as they're almost getting into a conventional groove, are boldly interrupted by the pig, making it impossible to ignore the processes that lead to the record's creation. Imagine if those really sweet leather boots you bought let out a ""moo"" every time you stuck them on your feet and tightened the laces.</p>
<p>Herbert notes in the making-of video that, for legal reasons, he could not record the actual death of the pig. And that says a great deal more about government-sanctioned ignorance and the bizarre regulations on food manufacturing than <i>One Pig</i> really ever could. What Herbert has put together is a witty, difficult, touching testament to making something lasting out of one of the world's many cruel inevitabilities.</p></div>"|15930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15930-matthew-herbert-one-pig/|8.0|Brandon Soderberg

It radiates earnestness and simplicity, which can obscure the fine inner workings. Watery vocal hooks and refrains tug at your ear first, but it's the tiny moving parts and lathed instrumental motifs that really get lodged there. This works out to either a kind of failure for a persona-seeking indie-pop band or a kind of success for an atmospheric dance band, two spheres Casiokids have always seemed slightly adrift between, to intriguing but muddying effect. After a scrappy debut and a singles collection disguised as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14303-topp-stemning-pa-lokal-bar/"">sophomore album</a>, you might consider this their first shot at a ""mature"" record-- meaning more lavishly recorded, majestically played, and ambitious in scope. Maturity can be tricky to navigate for bands that have established themselves in the symbolic context of childhood.</p>
<p>At this point, Casiokids are a synth-pop band only in the same, broad sense that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a> (whose multimedia extravaganzas must have been an influence on their celebratory live show) are a psych-pop band. Big sing-alongs, Western house and disco beats, and squiggly analog synths are important elements of their sound, but no more so than Afro-Caribbean percussion, beatific 1960s pop, swarming funk guitars, and (especially as of <i>Aabenbaeringen Over Aaskammen</i>) gnarled psychedelia that drives the Flaming Lips comparison more firmly home. After about seven years in the game, they're no longer a motley crew of promising upstarts-- they're actually kind of a big deal. Their records are distributed all over the world (Universal in Norway, Polyvinyl in the U.S.) and they were one of four recipients of <a href=""http://soundcheckmagazine.com/news/2113-casiokids-open-for-a-ha-win-grant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a million-kroner grant</a> from Norwegian pop gods <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23642-a-ha/"">A-Ha</a>. If they still seem fringe-y here in the States, it may be because the communal pageantry of their live show is an indispensible aspect of their music. Somehow, their loopy mishmash of styles just makes more sense when you're <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FwLA6VJOaQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dancing with giant puppets under seizure-inducing lights.</a></p>
<p>So here's the weird thing about <i>Aabenbaringen Over Aaskammen</i>: I like almost every song on it, but they don't add up to an album I love. It's not quite hype enough to be pure party music and lacks the cohesive point of view that fosters a more personal connection with a record. At first I thought Casiokids sounded like a different band on every song, but that wasn't quite right. It's more like the same band trying on different looks, different ideas of what a band that got a million-kroner grant from A-Ha should maybe sound like. <i>Aabenbaringen </i>is actually more all-over-the-place than the singles collection. The stately orchestration of the opening track might make you think you've wandered into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5260-arve-henriksen/"">wrong Norwegian record</a> by accident. Lead single ""Det Haster!"" recalls the electro-funk of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCGcYDZmCQE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fot I Hose</a>"", but built from commanding slabs rather than twitchy bursts, indicative of a general deepening and swelling of Casiokids' sound. Meanwhile, ""Dresinen"" sounds like a post-punk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1225-dungen/"">Dungen</a> and the very catchy ""Golden Years"" is tropics-kissed indie-pop. No one's saying a band should only make one kind of song, but it takes a strong identity to make eclecticism feel personalized. I hear lots of cool grooves and marvelous texture, but I have trouble connecting them to anything beyond that.</p>
<p>Still, a vivid, decorative imagination makes these songs fun to glide along. ""Det Haster!"" begins with a bad-stereo-connection fake-out that will have you jiggling the pin in your speaker jack before it comes roaring into full 3D. The intro of ""London Zoo"", a coasting drums-and-synths haze evocative of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4822-au-revoir-simone/"">Au Revoir Simone</a>, features some of the most lusciously precise pin-pricks of guitar you'll encounter. The arpeggiated synth lead of ""Olympiske Leker"" morphs from voicing to voicing with unruffled ease. But no amount of microscopic detail feels sufficient without forming a bigger picture. This one's fun but kind of blurry, perhaps capturing a band in a moment of transition between anarchic youth and... whatever happens next.</p></div>"|15934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15934-aabenbaringen-over-aaskammen/|6.0|Brian Howe

Factor in this year's oddball side project as the Insane Warrior, the 1980s horror soundtrack/electro-prog/library music pastiche <i>We Are the Doorways</i>, and he's already put out a couple of solid pieces of work in the last few years that retain his adventurous nature without letting the burden of his early rep stifle him. Maybe all he really needs to do is keep working out the kinks and find a way to let his beat-making chops translate more readily into traditional song arrangement.</p>
<p>Plus, teaming up with a pretty good vocalist wouldn't hurt. Enter Aaron Livingston, a singer originally out of Philly who flirted with fame via a guest spot on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"" target=""_blank"">the Roots</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP9nrCYoOmY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Guns Are Drawn""</a> and showed up on <i>The Colossus </i>six years later to lend his talents to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgg85_91qI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crumbs Off the Table""</a>. That went so well that Livingston and RJ recorded another dozen songs under the name Icebird, and if <i>The Abandoned Lullaby </i>is the best piece of evidence so far to justify RJD2 Mk. II, it's also a good showcase for an eccentric singer on the verge of reaching a wide, receptive audience. Both parties click together because they're willing to let genre be an afterthought, yet they still avoid succumbing to a rootless, stylistically overreaching identity crisis.</p>
<p>Identity crises being what they've been over RJD2's career, the fact that he's pulled together a number of familiar elements from his past repertoire is unsurprising but well-executed. Fans enamored with the rangy, all-things-1970s blowout <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6798-since-we-last-spoke/"" target=""_blank"">Since We Last Spoke</a> </i>will find some good moments to grab on here-- there's still no gymnastic drum-break sample flipping, but RJ's geeky ear for cross-genre fusion pays off in a similarly satisfying way. The ""Move on Up"" vibe of ""Just Love Me"" and the minor-key, piano-driven skulk of ""Please, Don't"" are retro-funk 101, but their straightforwardness is driven by a marked flair for percussive arrangements that hit with more oomph than anything on his last two solo records. And his sense of ambition starts cresting on the album's dramatic, moody second half, where he indulges in the best instincts of his prog affinity to ends both icily ambient (""The Return of Tronson"") and arena-rock heavy (""Gun for Hire"").</p>
<p>Livingston, meanwhile, makes for a good foil to RJ's occasionally grandiose production. There are moments where he switches from a casually conversational way of singing into a full-on jolt of unadulterated joy or frustration with Swiss-watch timing. He works his raspy tenor well enough to make the moments where he drops flat, bum notes (like the quasi-Egyptian chorus in ""King Tut"") more of a jokey, self-aware idiosyncrasy than actual sandbagging. Best of all, he's got enough charisma to break out of pro-forma neo-soul roles: an optimist getting frustrated in the face of aggravating bullshit on ""Going and Going. And Going"", the desperately haunted lover on ""Spirit Ache"", the recidivist begging not to be led back into temptation on ""Please, Don't"". He doesn't have the show-stopping voice or the lyrical incisiveness of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo</a> to justify the surface-level <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a> comparisons <i>The Abandoned Lullaby </i>might rack up-- and RJ's not quite at the full command of a landmark signature sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a> was a couple of years back, either. But if there's been a better two-man indie-funk producer/singer superduo to come out of the woodwork since ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2B6SjMh_w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crazy</a>"" dropped, I must have missed it.</p></div>"|15919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15919-icebird-the-abandoned-lullaby/|7.2|Nate Patrin

And so Dreamers of the Ghetto write anthems, all these great big songs to go with their frontman's great big voice. <i>Enemy/Lover</i>, their debut LP, is not just indie rock-club big. It's mainstage big. Listening to <i>Enemy/Lover</i>, it takes no stretch of the imagination to see the band's long name inching its way toward the top of all sorts of bills in the months ahead.</p>
<p><i>Enemy/Lover</i> works in widescreen, searching verses crashing into sweeping choruses, Jones shouting big questions at the sky. Towering and triumphal, Dreamers take most of their cues from stadium-fillers from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Springsteen</a> to indie overgrounders like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>. I sometimes hear an optimism-infused spin on much-missed Canadian rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/820-constantines/"" target=""_blank"">Constantines</a>; listen close, and you'll pick up hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14130-rod-stewart/"" target=""_blank"">Rod Stewart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4072-simple-minds/"" target=""_blank"">Simple Minds</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>. It's not that Dreamers of the Ghetto sound especially like any one of these, but that they sound a bit like <i>all</i> of them, and just about anybody else who's ever stretched the canvas out as far as it goes. Nearly every note on <i>Enemy/Lover</i> is pitched as far as it'll fly; subtlety, as befits a band who would call itself Dreamers of the Ghetto, isn't exactly job one. More room under the big tent that way, I reckon.</p>
<p>A panoramic guitar figure and a stampede of drums set the scene for the ponderous ""State of a Dream"", a slice of <i>Inception</i>-style uncertainty blown up to billboard size. It's bettered by ""Connection"", its bleary, solitary organ giving way to its towering chorus, ""When you're gone, I know you're with me."" This is no mild disruption in the REM cycle or absence-addled fondness; both songs find Jones practically doubled-over from pleading, bouncing those lines off a (for now, imaginary) sea of thousands. The constant craving in Jones' throat keeps <i>Enemy/Lover</i> well-suited for a solitary bedroom hideout, but its insistent songs aim for anyone within earshot. The Dreamers aren't seeking some midpoint between intimacy and grandiosity, they're aiming for both at once; that same combination's kept Bono in leather and wraparounds for decades now, a rarified territory these Dreamers seem almost born into.</p>
<p>The band's gaping chords and roaring percussion rarely snag the spotlight from Jones' voice; when it does, as on the oscillating guitar that closes out ""Regulator"", what could easily turn to empty embellishment feels instead like an elevation of the song itself. Again, decorum's not their strongest suit, but when they swing a line from the aforementioned ""Regulator"" back around into ""Dark Falcons"", it suggests that there are plenty of small pleasures to be found amidst <i>Enemy/Lover</i>'s biggie-sized wallop. It's the sort of record you locate yourself in, its concerns universal, its populist appeal easy to grasp, its songs at once moving and movable.</p>
<p>Stirring as they can be, a couple of <i>Enemy/Lover</i>'s sky-streaking melodies seem to stick to a similar flightpath. And at times, the Dreamers' all-encompassing approach proves a little too ecumenical, its arms outstretched too wide to pull you in close. But those are the risks you run when you're operating on such a grand scale, and the exultant, openhearted <i>Enemy/Lover</i> is rarely outpaced by its lofty ambitions.</p></div>"|15931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15931-enemylover/|7.6|Paul Thompson

But for all the bonkers fashion choices, outré collaborators, and leftfield influences she pulls into her orbit, it's easy to forget that her worldview is also equally informed by a sympathy and awareness of the systems that guide us. From the ""beats and strings"" manifesto that shaped <i>Homogenic</i> to the ""music for laptop speakers"" mandate that drove <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/727-vespertine/"" target=""_blank"">Vespertine</a></i> through to the vocals-only absolutism of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/737-medulla/"" target=""_blank"">Medúlla</a></i>, her obsession with patterns and structure and conceptual boundaries has consistently been at the center of her work. Often, she has celebrated the messiness and the chaos implicit in these very things; in fact, the very first line of her very first single took a perverse delight in the lack of logic inherent in one of the biggest and most complex systems of all: human behavior.</p>
<p><i>Biophilia</i> marks Björk's eighth full-length release, and represents her definitive attempt to create an ecosystem around her work. Billed as her ""most ambitious and interdisciplinary project yet"" and boasting all the usual fixings of a Björk release (dazzling artwork, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43263-video-bjork-crystalline/"" target=""_blank"">Michel Gondry video</a>, vanguard instrumentation, a bizarre list of collaborators), it also comes supported by a corresponding iPad application for each of its 10 tracks, a new website, a series of live shows and ""music workshops"", and a forthcoming 90-minute film documenting its creation. Beyond that, the album itself purports to engage with some pretty momentous themes, with song titles like ""Thunderbolt"", ""Dark Matter"", and ""Cosmogony"" and imagery focusing on time, space, and the natural world. (Note that editor Brandon Stosuy wrote press materials for this release prior to being hired by Pitchfork.)</p>
<p>The stakes feel even higher in light of Björk's mottled output over the past decade. Between 2004's well-received but thin-sounding <i>Med</i><i>ú</i><i>lla</i> and 2007's unfocused and sprawling <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10204-volta/"" target=""_blank"">Volta</a></i>, Björk has arguably been unable to produce anything definitive since 2001's <i>Vespertine</i>. In its worst moments, <i>Volta</i> painted a picture of an artist whose quality control instincts had been eroded by indulgence. One would be forgiven if news of all the scaffolding around <i>Biophilia</i> sounded up alarm bells: Is this her coming back strong, or piling conceptual materials on top of her music in an effort to give it extra depth?</p>
<p>If the songs themselves are any indication, the answer leans more toward the latter. While the promotional and conceptual packaging around <i>Biophilia</i> are as forward-thinking as ever, the sheer quality of Björk's songwriting remains problematic. It feels, once again, as if she's prioritized the superficial aspects of <i>Biophilia</i>'s presentation over, well, the music. I can't imagine, for example, how a middle section as dull as ""Dark Matter"" and ""Hollow"" made the cut. Even slightly more realized compositions like the the music box plink of ""Virus"" and the twitching ""Thunderbolt"" are essentially just simple motifs stretched way beyond their limits. Too often, she combats the lack of any real structure or melody by over-singing, or lapsing into one of her familiar and increasingly lazy-sounding house vocal runs.  It too often feels as if Björk's songwriting process is now to sing arbitrarily over top of her collaborators' instrumental tracks rather than structure the music around a melody.</p>
<p>Sure, there are highlights. When she does get a tune to sing, she attacks it with almost apologetic gusto. Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12242-crystalline/"" target=""_blank"">""Crystalline""</a> features one of the album's best hooks, and as a result, one of Björk's best and most focused performances. Elsewhere, the gorgeous ""Cosmogony"" carries a faint hymnal quality and an immediacy that wouldn't sound totally out of place on <i>Vespertine</i> or even <i>Homogenic</i>. With its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk, the uptempo ""Mutual Core"" may be the album's best track overall.</p>
<p>Although a big part of the PR story around <i>Biophilia</i>, the apps ultimately feel less than essential to the overall experience. Even after spending significant amounts of time with them, it's easy to separate them mentally from the music. They're well-designed and infused with appropriate amounts of playfulness and mystery, and a few have almost meditative properties that suit the music well, but ultimately they feel like they're there to support a concept rather than vice versa. Beyond that, in costing $1.99 apiece (or just under $10 for the full complement), the app gambit ultimately hits upon another latter-day Björk tendency, which is her seeming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9250-surrounded/"" target=""_blank"">willingness to exploit all available revenue streams</a>.</p>
<p>Is it fair to fault <i>Biophilia</i> for failing to realize its own ambition? That's a tough question; Björk's curatorial acumen, her visual sense, and her vision are so beyond reproach that it feels almost churlish to complain about something as simple as a lack of melody, or the fact that she's an experimental music pioneer who might just be over-charging for her experimental iPad apps. Nonetheless, for an album ostensibly about the elements, there are some essential pieces missing here. As an innovator, she's as vibrant as ever, but as a songwriter, she sounds tired.</p></div>"|15915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/|6.2|Mark Pytlik

Too much, and you risk damning yourself to frivolity, cutesiness; too little, and you flirt with a potentially stultifying self-seriousness. Brooklyn-to-L.A. junkyard-pop duo <a href=""http://hellohighplaces.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">High Places</a> managed to keep their whimsy in check on their early EPs and stellar, spectral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12257-high-places/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a>, matching Mary Pearson's swooping sing-songs to an alluring back-bedroom clang, playfully delivered but painstakingly crafted. Time and again in those early days, High Places perched themselves at the midpoint between experimental, electronic mangling and wide-eyed melodics, then proceeded to double-dutch all over it.</p>
<p>Things took a turn toward the serious on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14103-high-places-vs-mankind/"" target=""_blank"">High Places vs. Mankind</a></i>. Adding further wrinkles to their rippling productions while tamping down some of Pearson's vocal buoyancy, it's an intriguing-sounding record full of alluring textures and warped schoolyard chants. Next to what came before it, though, <i>Mankind</i>'s melodies could seem soft-pedaled, its hooks wedged into tracks rather than constructed alongside them. And Pearson's oft-unaffected vocals took on a disaffection that felt a bit like detachment, that wonder in her voice oddly absent. This shift-- toward a fuller sound, but away from a lighter spirit-- continues on their third LP, <i>Original Colors</i>.</p>
<p>Drawing on a spectrum-spanning array of dance music, <i>Original Colors</i> takes its cues from drum'n'bass, minimal techno, and trance's dalliances with pop. Easily their most danceable, production-centered record to date, <i>Original Colors</i> moves with a quicker pulse than anything that came before it. Pearson and Barber still favor their homespun beatmaking setup, and while there's no mistaking most of High Places' production work with that of the pros, they at times manage a pretty good duct-tape-and-popsicle-stick approximation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3815-roni-size/"" target=""_blank"">Roni Size</a> &amp; Reprazent's earthy clamor and the epic, arid trance-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1375-everything-but-the-girl/"" target=""_blank"">Everything But the Girl</a> beatmaker Ben Watt. Though dance purists will likely find <i>Original Colors</i>' careening too sinewy and scattered, every beat is set just so, and Barber and Pearson's anything-goes confidence lends these tracks an appealing elasticity.</p>
<p>Though this shapeshifting sound world proves immersive enough, as a pop record on the order of their warbly, wide-eyed debut, <i>Original Colors</i> maintains a certain distance. Further flatlining her post-<i>Mankind</i> vocal delivery, Pearson deadpans her way through a good chunk of her lines in a distracted, almost drowsy manner. There are stretches where it seems as though she's left the room entirely; she's certainly singing less than ever before, and her vocals are often backgrounded or otherwise processed in a way that diminishes their potential impact. The crumbly, constantly undulating percussion seems to have edged Pearson out of the frame, and apart from a few more-than-milquetoast melodies they manage to set out front, she seems pretty content to let the beats take the lead, a task they're not always up for. The few graspable melodies she gets out front fare quite a bit better; ""Dry Lake"" is comfortingly loopy, if a tad lethargic, while the dubby, EBTG-nodding highlight ""Sonora"" finds Pearson doing a passable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5173-tracey-thorn/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Thorn</a> over its tumbling-downstairs backdrop. These two tracks see Pearson finally exiting her shell, shedding some of the timidity that seems to trail her here, and the beats-- easily <i>Original Colors</i>' most vibrant-- perk up to match. A few songs later, and there's that trepidation again.</p>
<p><i>Original Colors</i> opens up a bit with repeat spins, but its meek melodies never quite bubble to the surface the way you'd hope. Instead, as the beats deepen, their alien textures grow ever-weirder from prolonged exposure; they, too, lack some of the warmth of High Places' earlier work. But <i>Original Colors</i>' production still doesn't quite sit right next to its paucity of melody, and its sidestepping of the song in favor of the sound never feels like a fair trade. The beguiling interplay between the two halves of High Places-- the ethereal, almost cherubic vocals and the clattering racket in, around, and behind them-- is lacking here, along with much of their clubhousey sense of adventure. For a group who traded so well in whimsy, who got off to such a kaleidoscopic start, <i>Original Colors</i> can feel unusually drab.</p></div>"|15922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15922-original-colors/|5.9|Paul Thompson

Me neither. But given that this EP is a low-key release <a href=""http://juliannabarwick.bandcamp.com/album/matrimony-remixes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">being sold on Bandcamp</a> for $5 (and available to stream for free), you can't begrudge Barwick or her label for wanting to extend the life of that album. If nothing else, given the strength of her last record, she deserves a victory lap.</p>
<p>One issue with remixing tracks from <i>The Magic Place</i> is that they're hard to pull apart. With their layers of voices, heavy reverb, and instrumental loops, they feel integrated and whole, each part gaining its meaning through its relationship to the others. That's true in all music, of course, but with immersive ambient tracks based on addition and subtraction and so dependent on harmony for musical content, it becomes that much more difficult to isolate one element and build something new out of it.</p>
<p>Four remixers here give it a try (the six-song set is rounded out by the album versions of  ""Vow"" and ""Prizewinning""). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12546-vow-diplo-and-lunice-remix/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo and Lunice's take</a> on ""Vow"" is, in one sense, the most cookie-cutter version, in that it mostly does what remixes of indie music have been doing since the late 1990s: isolates a small section of the original and adds some programmed drums. By foregrounding an electric keyboard refrain, giving the tune more of a pulse, and adding a 1980s sheen, it actually bridges the gap between Barwick and Enya circa <i>Watermark</i>, but it feels more like an uninspired original track that happens to have some samples from Julianna Barwick than a proper song. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28016-helado-negro/"" target=""_blank"">Helado Negro</a>'s take is more interesting, as it condenses rather than separates, creating a compact loop of highly melodic sound that reminds me of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> remixes. On top of the loop is an original vocal, presumably from project leader Roberto Carlos Lange, and it has some relationship to the original but doesn't feel bound to it. It's solid, but not something I'm likely to return to.</p>

It's also their best release yet, but it it takes some time to sink in. The sounds that X&amp;O (Liz Wendelbo and Sean McBride) make are regularly referred to as ""coldwave""-- deadpan D.I.Y. post-punk filtered through brutal drum machines and synth lines so brittle and thin you could practically snap them over your knee. It's easy music to appreciate but hard to outright <i>love</i> this stuff in large doses (that held even for last year's excellent look at the original coldwave movement from the late 1970s and  early 80s, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13910-the-minimal-wave-tapes-vol-1/"" target=""_blank"">The Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 1</a></i>). The formal rigidity of Xeno &amp; Oaklander's artistic aims can cause them to blend together at first listen, and since this isn't wide-reaching, crowd-pleasing stuff, it takes some commitment to stick with it.</p>
<p>So <i>Sets &amp; Lights</i> is more of the same chilly, dusty electronic gloom, but they've stuck with their aesthetic and gotten better. Compared to 2009's attention-getting <i>Sentinelle</i>, <i>Sets &amp; Lights</i> is full-bodied and lush. Artists who release music on Wierd typically forgo computers"", so the fact that Wendelbo and McBride were able to coax such austere beauty from their machines is impressive in its own right. The highlights seem to take cues from ""Secret Stores"", a blissful track from  <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15123-you-today/"" target=""_blank"">You Today</a>, </i>McBride's otherwise disappointing solo effort as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29479-martial-canterel/"" target=""_blank"">Martial Canterel</a> from earlier this year. There's more intricacy, more gloriously tangled arpeggios, and a stronger focus overall on melodic composition. That last one is key, as it also Wendelbo and McBride have also developed stronger vocal presences. Wendelbo no longer sounds like she's simply sighing into an amplifier, while McBride's range has expanded and now runs from the gothic sighs on the lovely opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12448-sets-lights/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> to fierce determinism on ""Corrupt"", an aggro headblast of a number that should satisfy fans of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15284-cherish-the-light-years/"" target=""_blank"">latest Cold Cave album</a>.</p>
<p><i>Sets &amp; Lights</i> is also the first release from Xeno &amp; Oaklander where they reveal that they have a sense of humor-- one of the digital-only bonus tracks is a four-alarm Italo disco assault called ""Italy"". But <i>Sets &amp; Lights</i>, like earlier records, is ultimately a bit too stuffy and self-serious as a whole. Still, while this collection may not be a breakout release, it's good to hear them stepping out and experimenting with new moods and textures.</p></div>"|15927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15927-sets-and-lights/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Moments of atmospheric drift, mathematical twist, and belligerent march tied together into the suggestion that this was a band to watch. Hull's sprawling follow-up, <i>Beyond the Lightless Sky</i>, appropriately opens with ""Earth From Water"", an 11-minute triumph of that potential and one of the best gambits you're likely to hear all year. ""Earth From Water"" not only synthesizes those earlier qualities-- a pensive instrumental break here, a crusty mid-tempo stomp there-- but adds seemingly conflicting moments of hardcore maul and melodic bursts memorable enough for modern rock radio. What's more, ""Earth From Water"" is deftly built, with impossibly exhilarating moments of lift added at precisely the right moments, whether through a spiraling solo or a bass-thick, full-band roar. No moment is wasted, no idea is idle: This is the longest track in the band's catalog, yet it doesn't seem quite long enough.</p>
<p>""Earth From Water"" serves as a sort of manifesto for the rest of <i>Beyond the Lightless Sky</i>, an unabashed attempt to increase both Hull's scope and scale. While <i>Sole Lord</i> felt mostly like a collection of related tunes, <i>Beyond the Lightless Sky</i> is a deliberate sequence of songs and segues. Hull attempts to replicate the push and pull of ""Earth From Water"" throughout these 57 minutes by splicing an often-meditative instrumental between each pair of roaring, full-band numbers. ""Earth From Water"" exits with the sort of full-spectrum thunder that makes headphones hurtful, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16222-beyond-the-lightless-sky/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> pirouettes open with a serrated guitar line and a restless drum rush. But ""Just a Trace of Early Dawn"", which separates the two, rises slowly from an electronic din into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"" target=""_blank"">Six Organs of Admittance</a>-style smoky haze, drums tapping lightly behind a circular acoustic guitar. Like the opener, ""Fire Vein"" and ""False Priest"" both set their aims for triumph, dividing throaty declamations and malevolent moments with distended solos and elaborate bridges for nine minutes at a time. But they're distinct enough not to require ""Wake the Heavens, Reveal the Sun"", the intercalary passage that wraps an interesting sample of primitive chants in needlessly ponderous guitars and drums. Of the four shorter passages meant to bridge the album's five proper songs, only the last one, ""A Light That Shone From Aside the Sea"", stands for greater consideration. Suggesting a more rigorous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3472-pelican/"" target=""_blank"">Pelican</a> indulging in restraint, the brief piece reveals yet another, more nuanced side of Hull-- as the suggested coda falls into a fade-out-- one capable of denying gratification.</p>
<p>That quality is consistent with and complementary to Hull's ostensible aim on <i>Beyond the Lightless Sky</i>-- to make a colossal and cohesive statement that moves beyond the bounds of simply being a good rock record. This is, after all, a concept album about two Mayan brothers struggling with their separate and conflicting destinies. But the antiphonal approach between surging, complicated epics and complacent, ruminative tone pieces not only squanders Hull's hard-won momentum, but also renders an album full of misdirection and surprises sometimes indistinguishable from one side to the next. (Over time, a landscape of high hills and beautiful valleys eventually becomes just another landscape.) Still, at their best, Hull join a rare but growing class of bands resurfacing doom with new influences and expectations. <i>Beyond the Lightless Sky</i> doesn't meet recent high-water marks set by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10726-the-body/"" target=""_blank"">the Body</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5148-rwake/"" target=""_blank"">Rwake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a>, or Thou, but it does seem like the next stepping-stone for Hull. Two years ago, they proved they had the songs. Now, they've proven they have the ideas, aims, and skills. Given the depth and delivery of the best moments here, it's intimidating to consider how Hull might sound when they get it all right at once.</p></div>"|15929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15929-beyond-the-lightless-sky/|6.9|Grayson Currin

As a teenager in the late 1980s, he moved from his hometown of Louisville to Hollywood, where he struggled as an actor before eventually landing a small role in John Sayles' <i>Matewan</i> and a larger role in a TV movie about Jessica McClure. Oldham soon defected to music, writing songs first under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6070-palace/"" target=""_blank"">Palace</a> set of monikers and later as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a>. Twenty years later, while he still takes the occasional role, Sayles and McClure represent the poles of his subjects: His songs, often in a skewed country or folk tradition, are full of darkly American oddities and characters trapped down in their own metaphorical wells.</p>
<p>Oldham's film career continues to inform his music, as he writes songs as soliloquies and inhabits them the way an actor might perform a dramatic role, transforming dialog and stage direction into something flesh-and-blood, memorable, and moving. He writes in isolation and hires a small cast of backing musicians to help him bring these one-act songs to life. For his latest Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy album, <i>Wolfroy Goes to Town</i>, he's chosen a cast of regulars, including guitarist Emmett Kelly. Most of the <i>Wolfroy</i> troupe, like composer/multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily and Chicago-based singer-songwriter Angel Olsen, have toured with him for a while now, and backed him on many of his most recent records. Together, they give these new songs a soft, casual vibe, and the minimal instrumentation-- mostly acoustic guitars and bass-- evokes a dark, bare stage.</p>
<p>Oldham places the hardiest emphasis on vocals-- not just his own, but those of his players. His female duet partners have tended to act as his opposites, the coo of their voices offsetting his weathered creak. But on <i>Wolfroy</i>, Olsen sounds just as odd and ragged as he does. There may be no spark of contrast between them, but there's a spark nonetheless, and she's one of the most grounded female characters on any Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy record. The rest of the band's harmonies are rough and pointedly unrehearsed, barely holding together on ""Black Captain"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1411-quail-and-dumplings/"" target=""_blank"">Quail and Dumplings</a>"". Rustic, however, does not mean primitive. ""Cows"" ends with a sophisticated vocal roundelay that has more in common with British folk than with its American counterpart. It's a lovely moment-- a spare, hushed, and unexpected coda.</p>
<p>Oldham's music is deeply attuned to the past and to the people we imagine inhabited it, yet his actorly approach separates him from the mainstream Americana crowd, who tend to favor a more autobiographical approach, or at least some sense of direct confessionalism. Oldham's songs are only obliquely about himself, and they rarely reveal much about the man singing them. ""As boys, we fucked each other,"" he sings at the beginning of ""New Tibet"". ""As men, we lie and smile."" In other hands, such a line might deliver a shock to interrupt the lull of the music, but Oldham never breaks character. That f-bomb becomes part of the lull, and is not so much sung as ruefully breathed. The song possesses all the ruminative gravity of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAriDxTeed8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I See a Darkness""</a> and in tone and character could be interpreted as a sequel.</p>
<p><i></i>Heroes hold no interest for Oldham, who is much more concerned with the moral tangles of everyday people, like the character in ""Quail and Dumplings"" who promises a bright future of full bellies and no worries. Despite the subject matter, it's almost impossible to read that song strictly as a 2010s recession anthem, although it certainly derives some power from current conditions. Oldham's antiquated diction and sepia-toned details-- ""one day it's going to be quail and dumplings for we""-- removes the song from the present and sets the characters deep in some imagined past. In one sense, it robs the song of any topical gravity, but in another, he allows ""Quail and Dumplings"" to transcend any one era.</p>
<p>By this point in his career, Oldham seems to realize that it's difficult for his audience to hear his songs outside of the context of his previous albums and incarnations. So he plays that up on <i>Wolfroy</i>, both by shifting away from the fuller sound of his recent albums, and by subtly alluding to his own characters. By now it's esoteric, but hardly a simple retread of past glories. Instead, that sense of connectedness lends these songs a reassuring familiarity, as though they were new corners of a strange world whose boundaries grow larger and whose scenery grows more inviting with every Oldham release.</p></div>"|15886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/|7.8|Stephen M.

But I'll try to sum it up: If you've ever wondered what might happen if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1426-editors/"" target=""_blank"">Editors</a> were fronted by a freak-folk singer, by all means pick up their debut. Meanwhile, on last year's mostly acoustic soft parade <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14466-flaws/"" target=""_blank"">Flaws</a></i>, they sounded like they'd get their lunch money stolen by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2302-kings-of-convenience/"" target=""_blank"">Kings of Convenience</a>. I suppose their sales inspired more patience from Island than their art, but on <i>A Different Kind of Fix</i>, they follow in the proud tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"" target=""_blank"">Snow Patrol</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7304-final-straw/"" target=""_blank"">Final Straw</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4281-travis/"" target=""_blank"">Travis</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8143-the-man-who/"" target=""_blank"">The Man Who</a></i>, wherein a band links up with a hotshot producer, ditches a trad-indie sound that just wasn't working, and discovers its destiny churning out soft-serve sweetness that completely neutralizes your critical reasoning skills. I'm fairly certain the same impulse that triggers my desire for an Oreo McFlurry makes me want to listen to <i>A Different Kind of Fix</i>.</p>
<p>It's more likely that Bombay Bicycle Club sought out producer Ben H. Allen than the other way around-- after all, BBC have dutifully namedropped Allen clients <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a> as big influences leading up to the release of <i>Fix</i>. Yeah, it's 2011 and <i>just</i> discovering those bands is just another aspect of BBC that seems so easy to make fun of before they totally disarm you: While nothing here will make you say, ""yeah, <i>total </i> '<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/88-summertime-clothes/"" target=""_blank"">Summertime Clothes</a>' moment,"" they've opted out of ""quiet is the new loud"" by investing themselves in the elemental songwriting aspects of America's indie elite: repetition is the new chorus, texture is the new volume.</p>
<p>And indeed, Apple might need to take a long look at Allen as a product designer if they haven't found a worthy successor for Steve Jobs-- as with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank"">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank"">Halcyon Digest</a></i>, and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15614-within-and-without/"" target=""_blank"">Within and Without</a></i>, Allen gets a sound that's sleek, bold, and covetable, yet within the price range of the young and upwardly mobile. The easy lilt of Jack Steadman's vocals (thankfully shorn of his prior melismatic fringe) gives <i>Fix</i> enough humanity and extroverted charm to keep it from being a mere showcase for Allen's production tricks, but the depth of the low-end and a prudent amount of abrasive grit imparts a three-dimensionality that saves BBC from getting pushed around like any band that could reasonably be compared to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, the guitars on ""Bad Timing"" are thickly distorted, and the drums get a digital makeover into machinery, but it doesn't exactly rock-- it just asserts itself the right amount where a Steadman solo performance would be content to play the wall. The point of ""Lights Out, Words Gone"" isn't to praise BBC for apparently owning a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a> record, or writing the catchiest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a> song Foals didn't actually write-- it's to lose yourself in the luxurious gulf between the band's vaporous harmonies and the glassy, yacht-funk riffs. The title of ""Shuffle"" might just be an indication of <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">whose ad dollars</a> <i>Fix </i> has in its crosshairs, and it could very well get there. BBC make full use of a stammering piano loop for both melodic and percussive purposes, and Steadman's vocals tumble over handclaps and layered harmonies in a manner that becomes subtly unstoppable instead of mawkish.</p>
<p>And <i>Fix</i> is all about accumulative properties, little bits and pieces that add up to way more than it should. ""How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep"" seems genial enough in its first minute-- a blindingly clean guitar riff providing an acoustic sunrise while Steadman somnolently delivers the same line the same way (""Can I wake you up/ Is it late enough"") for nearly the song's entirety before an EQ-tweaked drum break sets things in motion. Frankly, you wonder what something this sparkly and chipper was doing on a <i>Twilight</i> soundtrack, but the sonic color is secondary to BBC and Allen playing off each other's skills in service of a certain kind of emotional ""click"" that's certainly in that franchise's demographic. I can't speak much for the actual biochemical workings, but at its best, <i>Fix</i> strikes that point where, ""oh, they're cute"" hits a groove in your mind and gets looped into total infatuation.<span> </span>After its three and a half minutes run out, not much has changed about ""How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep"" except maybe your way of looking at it.</p>
<p>But there's something faintly troubling about <i>A Different Kind of Fix </i>even in light of its success: While the songs are wildly improved, I still can't say there's much of a discernible <i>identity</i>. How much of Bombay Bicycle Club are you actually getting here? Steadman's lyrics and the band's tasteful playing convey, above all else, a kind of utilitarian earnestness endemic to young Brits with acoustics writing about girls and feelings. And you might find some of these hooks creeping up on you when you least expect it-- whistling the melody to ""Lights Out, Words Gone"" while buying groceries, realizing how deeply the riff of ""Your Eyes"" burrowed into your consciousness. But just as easily, it can pass right by you as you're actually listening to it, and the closing piano howler ""Still"" serves notice that they've still got an awkward sweet tooth or two left to extract. And maybe this stands out on account of filling a real void. Prior to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/"" target=""_blank"">the Libertines</a>, <i>this </i> is often what UK guitar bands sounded like-- unabashedly cuddly, a little cloying, and in thrall with even the most rudimentary facets of electronic music. But hell, this is called <i>A Different Kind of Fix</i> and not <i>The Shape of British Rock to Come </i> for a reason: whether you're totally nostalgic for a time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4308-turin-brakes/"" target=""_blank"">Turin Brakes</a> loomed large or just hoping that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5321-the-maccabees/"" target=""_blank"">the Maccabees</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29550-the-vaccines/"" target=""_blank"">the Vaccines</a> might have a decent album in them at some point, BBC are your pushers.</p></div>"|15914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15914-a-different-kind-of-fix/|7.0|Ian Cohen

From the start, Bachmann's longstanding, personnel-shifting, Americana-imbued second act's traded in a kind of weary reflection, but <i>Breaks in the Armor</i>'s brooding gaze mostly seems to be directed backward; at times, Bachmann almost seems to be addressing his younger self. The album finds him channeling hard-fought lessons into 11 remorse-tinged tunes with the weight of the world on their shoulders, the years caught in his battle-scarred throat.</p>
<p>Laid down with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a>' live sound engineer Matt Yelton-- with little other outside assistance beyond backing vocals from frequent Crooked Fingers collaborator Liz Durrett<i>-- Breaks</i>' homespun sound is solemn and spacious, opting for subtle coloring and economy of gesture. <i>Breaks</i> places the spotlight squarely on Bachmann's voice as it wearily recounts a series of past indignities; ""the ghosts,"" as he puts it on opener ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16258-typhoon/"" target=""_blank"">Typhoon</a>"", ""of all your old forgotten lows."" Bachmann's feeling more than a little low on <i>Breaks in the Armor</i>, and he wants you to know it. On lines like, ""I draw the same bad blood out of you,"" from the piercing ""Bad Blood"", he seems to want you to share in it, too.</p>
<p>Easy enough. You don't need to hear Bachmann sigh his way through highlight ""Heavy Hours"" to know he's been through plenty of them himself; his rich, roughshod voice suggests as much on every line. With a master's restraint, he imparts an almost apocalyptic dread to the ominous refrain of ""Black Candles"", a dead-serious desperation on the searching ""Went to the City"", a real finality to fare-thee-well ""The Hatchet"". <i>Breaks</i>' lyrical thumbnails of lost opportunities and forgotten friends can seem a touch too pathos-addled on paper, but drawn through Bachmann's lungs, they leave their mark.</p>
<p>While a few hints of light eke through <i>Breaks</i>' dark surface, it's a somber affair, and Bachmann's dour outlook can sometimes drag his melodies down with him; as much weight as his voice can carry on its own, a few of these tunes dial the music back so far that you're left with little else but ache. But even when Bachmann lays things out too bare, he'll slip scores of feeling into a line or two, leaving the listener with no doubt as to precisely which nerve he's intending to strike. ""Much too much for us to turn back now,"" the guy who once screamed, ""you've got it all wrong,"" sighs on ""War Horses"", the regret in his voice never far from the surface.</p></div>"|15917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15917-crooked-fingers/|6.7|Paul Thompson

My first taste of the quintet came in 2006 via their brief, self-released <i>Worship the Witch</i> EP. I didn't know much about the Athens, Ohio, group but enjoyed their mix of classic Bay Area thrash and Norwegian-style black metal-- it came off like Cliff Burton-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Metallica</a> jamming with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28432-immortal/"" target=""_blank"">Immortal</a>. The scruffy production, which matched the era, cemented the mix.

<p>Since then, they've played Ozzfest (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5404-danzig/"" target=""_blank"">Danzig</a>'s Blackest of the Black tour), gone through a couple of drummers and bassists, shown up on <i><a href=""http://www.adultswim.com/music/metalswim/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metal Swim</a></i>, tightened their sound, and released three records for the Los Angeles label Prosthetic. All of these albums were good, but nothing struck a chord like <i>Worship the Witch</i>. That is, until this new one, the Matt Hyde-produced <i>Forever Abomination</i>. It's their first album with heavy-hitting drummer Dustin Boltjes, but the core that drew me to the group early on is still intact-- guitarist Scott Hedrick, guitarist Nate Garnette, and Nate's death-growling brother, vocalist Chance Garnette. Under the watchful eye (and in <a href=""http://youtu.be/MX83Rjf_yVM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the sweet looking, beer-soaked pool</a>) of Hyde, a Grammy winner who's also worked with Slayer, Hatebreed, No Doubt, Porno For Pyros, and Sum 41, among others, they've managed to regain their early atmospheric density, only on a larger, more stadium-ready scale. It's darker and heavier than the last three, offering an icy, deep ambiance that went missing on the too cleanly layered, brittle post-<i>Worship</i> offerings. Really, <i>Forever</i> is the rare example of a big-name producer actually helping a metal band progress. (Jack Endindo's dialed-back approach didn't quite click with me on 2009's <i>Breathing the Fire</i>.)</p>
<p>The 11-song collection opens with a few seconds of pretty acoustic guitars before launching into the rest of ""This Horrifying Force (The Desire to Kill)"", a proper breakneck Skeletonwitch anthem. That quiet moment's brief, but the transition gives a good idea of the spaciousness-- you'll find a deeper bass sound, sturdier drums, more vibrant guitars. They also place the vocals a bit lower in the mix, which works, because in the end, it's those guitars that keep pulling you closer: the hooks on opener ""Cleaver of Soul""; the lighter-lifting notation of ""Rejoice in Misery"" and ""The Infernal Resurrection""; the forward-driving trade-offs on <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/tracks/12529-sink-beneath-insanity/"" target=""_blank"">""Sink Beneath Insanity""</a>; the huge leads on ""Of Ash and Torment"" that manage to be technical, anthemic, and memorable. Outside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26979-amon-amarth/"" target=""_blank"">Amon Amarth</a>, I can't think of another band that does a better job translating classic-leaning metal riffs into sugar-coated pop hooks without sacrificing heaviness or turning a blind eye to the band patches on their jean jackets.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the beginning: Chance Garnette's mentioned the evil and despair of <i>Forever</i>'s lyrics, and you can pick that up in his performance-- or via titles like ""Shredding Sacred Flesh"" and ""Cleaver of Souls""-- without being able to understand the bulk of what he's saying. But outside of the studio, Skeletonwitch have never done ""mean"" convincingly. If you've read their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6679-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, you've seen the happy exclamation points. If you've caught them live, you know they're first and foremost a group of Ohio dudes only too happy to smoke your pot and drink your beer. There's nothing wrong with that-- the transparency adds another layer of enjoyability to the tracks and connects them to a long history of pageantry in metal. Basically, this is exciting, skilled, fist-pumping, true-to-life stuff made by good-seeming guys who, in the end, aren't afraid to laugh, goof around, or make fun of themselves. The music feels grounded and blue-collar in that sense, even with Garnette going on about our souls suffering in the fires of hell.</p></div>"|15923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15923-forever-abomination/|7.3|Brandon Stosuy

His newest endeavor, the synth-pop duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/pallers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pallers</a>, has really hit the nail on the head. Joined by longtime friend Henrik Mårtensson, the group's debut album, <i>The Sea of Memories</i>, couldn't be more aptly titled-- these two wistful romantics are drowning in it. Not only is Pallers' music exquisitely beholden to the 1980s, the duo's songs are also lyrically obsessed with gazing backwards. In their melancholic Scandinavian way, Pallers find a way to ache about every kind of reminiscence. They can conjure up an old mistake or missed opportunity and wallow in regret, yet just as easily fixate on a moment of bliss from the past and then mourn the fact that it's gone. Even as a wonderful thing is in the process of happening, the seed of its loss seems to be lurking just beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Pallers know the right kind of musical accompaniment to make all of these retrospective bum trips feel beautifully poignant rather than drearily whiny. Taking ample pages from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>'s playbook, the duo sculpts soundscapes that are sufficiently moody to suit their sad-eyed lyrics, yet feature enough insistent beats and squirming synths to maintain a brisk, sometimes even heart-rushing pace. The album's second track, ""Humdrum"", sets this template, wedding nimble synths to plangent guitars, while the whispered lovesick vocals rue the fact that ""You're in my head/ Not my bed."" The congruently titled pair ""Come Rain, Come Sunshine"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12439-years-go-days-pass-wicked/"" target=""_blank"">Years Go, Days Pass</a>"" maintains this delicately percolating momentum, complete with the sort of terminally sighing lyrics that wonder, ""If we had the chance to do it over again would we let it be?"" or opine, ""Hearts are cold in the rain."" Better still is ""The Kiss"", a naked, lovestruck declaration heralded by the refrain, ""If it wasn't a kiss/ Then I don't know what it was.""</p>
<p>Admittedly, the album's moves are exceedingly well-worn, yet like fellow 21st century synth-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Junior Boys</a>, Pallers' precise craftsmanship means they're also able to elicit many of the same deeply affecting moods and sensations as their forbears. To their credit, Pallers also hit on a way to diversify their portfolio-- namely by turning over ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12439-years-go-days-pass-wicked/"" target=""_blank"">Wicked</a>"" to guest vocalist Elise Zalbo. Not only does the song break up the duo's lovely but same-y mooning, it also works as a canny, self-aware rebuke to some of the rehashing and ruminating that precedes it. Bright and lively, ready to embrace the possibilities of what lies ahead, Zalbo forcefully declares, ""I don't care about this pain tonight.""</p></div>"|15920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15920-the-sea-of-memories/|7.1|Joshua Love

If that made you check in for the first time in years, I'll translate: it's his first record that kinda <i>sounds </i>like <i>Heartbreaker</i>. Though his artistic daring over the past decade has been greatly exaggerated, this is truly a bold move for Adams. He can no longer claim to be a victim, whether it's a victim of an untamed creative streak, substances, tone-deaf record execs, or critics who have the nerve to judge him in light of his earlier work. You didn't have to hear <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM0mjukDGRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Come Pick Me Up""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBPa_JzNWBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Houses on the Hill""</a> first to see <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/44-29/"" target=""_blank"">29</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/41-love-is-hell-pts-1-2/"" target=""_blank"">Love Is Hell</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/40-rock-n-roll/"" target=""_blank"">Rock N Roll</a></i>, or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10363-easy-tiger/"" target=""_blank"">Easy Tiger</a> </i> as proof that prolific, self-destructive artists don't always make very interesting music. Above all else, there's the romantic ideal that he's a victim of himself, an implosive genius that <i>could </i> make <i>Heartbreaker II</i> if only his pride would let him belly up to the bar with his ""abundance of inherited sadness"" again and let the inevitably gorgeous and truthful songs simply take care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, yes, <i>Ashes &amp; Fire </i> is Adams getting on his ""I have no act"" act. And while these boundaries help make it more effortless and enjoyable than his prior works of dilettantism, the strict adherence to a platonic ideal of a Rootsy Ryan Adams Album can't help but make it feel every bit as limited, a snapshot of him as an artist rather than a full portrait. While <i>Ashes &amp; Fire</i> is somewhat one-dimensional, it at least picks one of his better dimensions. Above all else, it's a showcase for Adams' vocals, and they're uniformly excellent throughout. On the chorus of opener ""Dirty Rain"", he evokes Willie Nelson's jazzy, note-bending approach to C&amp;W, and whether it's the rousing performance on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43923-video-ryan-adams-ashes-fire/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> or the no-attack <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a> tributes on <i>Gold Rush</i>-style folk (""Rocks""), he shows a great deal of range without reverting to his past predilections for smarmy playacting.</p>
<p>The equal billing suggested by the title of <i>Ashes &amp; Fire </i> is a misnomer, though: There's more of the former than the latter, so don't expect the first-take intimacy of even his 2005 trilogy. Glyn Johns' production is spare and immaculate, and you can hear every bit of empty space between Adams and the other musicians, as well as the always tasteful organ and keyboard work of Tom Petty sideman Benmont Tench. But you can also hear that Johns has some very expensive microphones: it's a warm recording, but one that still has a glossy coating that never allows it to, well, catch fire. It does smolder a bit midway through with the modestly anthemic ""Do I Wait"" and ""Invisible Riverside"", which dabbles in psychedelic blues and establishes a lyrical link to ""Dirty Rain"" that gives the record a bit of conceptual heft. But immediately thereafter, ""Chains of Love"" gets a little too deep into the cushiony adult-contemporary of <i>Easy Tiger</i> and while it mostly evokes his own <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1bYBYZfS0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Firecracker""</a>, it nicks the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uttV1VZUgQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erasure</a> melody just enough to be kind of a distraction.</p>
<p>The aspect of ""ashes"" also designates this as a record obsessed with aftermath, searching for truth and permanence within the wreckage of the past. Though it lacks for autobiographical detail, it's easy enough to fill in the blanks when Adams gravely intones ""I'm just looking through the rubble/ Trying to find out who we were"" on ""Dirty Rain"", or more pointedly on first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43625-new-ryan-adams-lucky-now/"" target=""_blank"">""Lucky Now""</a>, ""am I really who I was?""<span> </span>And Adams' lyrics are every bit as based in the elemental: shadows, stones, rivers, and way more rain than should be allowed for a record made in Los Angeles. And yet, <i>Ashes &amp; Fire</i>'s mixed and muddled use of big symbols too often result in ballads of big nothing. A literally rendered song called ""I Love You But I Don't Know What to Say"" should be a self-deprecating epigram to an album that <i>sounds </i> like it's got so much truth to share, but here it's an M.O. It's actually more of a political work than his <i>Love Is Hell</i> laugher <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHBuktADSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Political Scientist""</a> in how it asserts that saying all the right things in light of a public admonishment is to say nothing that can be held against you. While the subtly devastating line, ""and the night will break your heart but only if you're lucky now,"" appears to welcome the ability to acknowledge and appreciate pain in light of his well-documented battles with Ménièr's Disease and alcohol, elsewhere he invokes what he sang on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4583-whiskeytown/"" target=""_blank"">Whiskeytown</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mijK9gHBYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sit and Listen to the Rain""</a>: ""used to feel so much, now I just feel numb.""</p>
<p>And it's not even the sort of impressionism he tried on <i>29 </i> or <i>Love Is Hell </i> to feign depth. Given the right emotional context, the tremble of Adams' voice and words can level easy marks-- upon hearing the distorted guitars slowly bloom during the bridge of ""Do I Wait"", I was anticipating a returned text message that arrived a half hour later, and during the span of those three minutes, Adams could make it feel like the onset of an incapacitating loneliness. Problem is, after a couple of spins wash out Adams' vocal color, you're left with the almost Zen-like emptiness and portent of would-be truisms like, ""Everything you are to me is bigger than the spaces/ Between us and the chains of love."" As a singer, he does what he can to redeem ""Save Me"" and ""Come Home"", which are every bit as trite as their titles would suggest. But while the emotions are too legibly rendered to be completely unaffecting, Adams' words fail him. I won't begrudge a man his feelings, but is the central architecture metaphor (""you built those walls to keep your fears inside"") the best he can do?</p>
<p>While discussing <i>Ashes &amp; Fire </i> with a friend, the question was raised as to what sort of reception the record would merit had it come from any number of acoustic-toting songwriters who didn't happen to be the former lead singer of Whiskeytown. That's up for debate, but the bigger problem is that <i>Ashes &amp; Fire could </i> have come from the likes of Matt Nathanson or Matthew Mayfield were it not for Adams' voice. While <i>Heartbreaker </i> is legendary as a drinking partner, calling it merely a break-up album doesn't do it justice. Adams could be funny, he could rock, he could be bitter, he could do that all in the span of one song, while <i>Ashes &amp; Fire </i> is steeped in a sober contentment that feels limiting even though it shouldn't. Adams evokes the goodwill of his masterpiece as a singer, anyway, even if the songwriting doesn't come close. Rather than equal <i>Heartbreaker</i>, here he might have accomplished something more difficult: making it somehow seem underrated.</p></div>"|15907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15907-ashes-fire/|6.5|Ian Cohen

Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, it's a pulpy story about a stoic wheelman (Ryan Gosling) who digs himself even deeper into the Los Angeles criminal underworld on behalf of a woman and her son. <i>Drive</i> is a genre film, heavy on style and short on dialog, complete with finger-shuttering spurts of violence and, despite being set in the present, a pointed focus on retro-cool and classic car films. The Monday morning after <i>Drive</i>'s opening weekend, the soundtrack-- anchored by a few unknown but choice 1980s-indebted synth-pop songs and a score by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Martinez"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cliff Martinez</a> (Steven Soderbergh's go-to guy)-- <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/drive-soundtrack-climbs-itunes-charts-237175"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">went to number four on the iTunes music charts</a>, its success credited to good word-of-mouth thanks to Twitter. If you've seen the film, it makes sense: The <i>Drive</i> soundtrack pops with just as much neon camp and sex as the lipstick-scrawled opening credits.</p>
<p>Effective and memorable soundtracks need to either introduce you to new music that works on its own or transport you into the world of the film. <i>Drive</i> manages to do both, mostly thanks to the five songs that come early in the album, preceding Martinez's score. Director <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716347/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Winding Refn</a> (known for ambitious indies <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172570/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bronson</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862467/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Valhalla Rising</i></a>) pre-selected these tunes before the score was written. Most of them catalog key moments in the film and are-- for the sake of getting this thing on folks' radars-- the real draw.</p>
<p>These songs follow such a similar format, you could almost mistake them for the work of a single band. All have hyper-literal lyrics, dry-pulsing beats, and subdued, comely female vocals. Sounding like a more sinister second coming of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_League"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Human League</a> is opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV_3Dpw-BRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nightcall""</a> from French electronic artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5245-kavinsky/"" target=""_blank"">Kavinsky</a>, featuring vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4821-css/"" target=""_blank"">CSS</a>'s Lovefoxxx. ""I want to drive you through the night down the hills/ I will tell you something you don't want to hear,"" purrs an almost demoniacally mechanized voice, and it's hard not to imagine yourself double-clutching it down Mulholland. Lovefoxxx's tender counter, ""There's something inside you, it's hard to explain,"" feels like a perfect encapsulation of the film's juxtaposing moments of benevolence and brutality.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Candy</a>'s Johnny Jewel gets his hands on two tracks here, with his Desire and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a> projects, respectively. However, Jewel could've played a larger part: In a <a href=""http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/articles/2011-09-johnny-jewel-on-developing-the-unique-soundtrack-for-drive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> with <i><a href=""http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Box Office Magazine</a></i>, he revealed being approached by both Refn and Gosling to score the film (Glass Candy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1rcdPCuWcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Digital Versicolor""</a> plays a big part in <i>Bronson</i>), but wires were crossed, and, despite having finished ""the whole score,"" conflicting interests left Martinez with the job. It's hard not to speculate what Jewel's music could have brought to the film but Martinez's muted yet deft approach makes it hard to imagine anyone else smearing such wonderfully subtle hues across the screen.</p>
<p>On the album's second half, Martinez's score works like a patient, engaging ambient record with a dramatic arc that works independently of the film. Keyboards plink back and forth like turn signals and human heartbeats, with atmospheres that hang in the air like ghosted taillight streaks. As things get grittier onscreen, so does the music, with industrial grindings and craggy booms slowly working their way into the mix. It's long-- 50 minutes to be exact-- and obviously not the selling point, but where other soundtracks weave bits of score around the proper songs, Martinez's vision, while challenging, smartly gets its fair shake being presented as a whole.</p>
<p>By far the most notable thing about the <i>Drive</i> soundtrack is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Real Hero""</a>, a collaboration between French producer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/collegeoflove"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">College</a> and Toronto duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/electricyouthmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electric Youth</a>, both of whose phones are no doubt ringing off the hook. Working as a theme and mantra for Gosling's Driver, it's a shimmering, deeply romantic track that, thanks to its repeated use in the film, sticks in your head. ""Try getting behind the wheel without hearing that 'Real Hero' song,"" a friend mentioned to me after I saw the film. Luckily, I had a four-hour slog ahead of me the next day, and while a clogged New Jersey Turnpike at noon is about as far away from a driving experience as the blinking sprawl of Los Angeles at 3 a.m., I couldn't help but feel the stitching from a phantom, scorpion-emblazoned satin jacket itching at my back.</p></div>"|15908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/|7.4|Zach Kelly

And for the first 15 seconds of album opener ""Earth Ripper"", when the trio erupts with the sort of squeal and devilish rock beat that suggest the bridge of Van Halen's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0XLKcMoXRE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot for Teacher</a>"", you might even believe it's true. But neither Absu nor the albums they make allow much room for levity. Rather, <i>Abzu</i> is the second part of a planned trilogy that began with 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13044-absu/"" target=""_blank"">Absu</a></i>, the band's first album in eight years and an ambitious, relentless meld that acknowledged and then blasted beyond most every metal covenant. The trilogy is due to end with <i>Apsu</i>, yet another spelling of the several dwellings associated with Enki, the Sumerian god at the center of Absu's saga. But <i>Abzu</i> doesn't need to be funny to be fun. With 36 minutes of stylistic ricochets, speed-metal slingshots, and momentum oxbows, that's exactly what it is-- breathless, focused, and fun.</p>
<p>Absu have long operated under a central slogan: ""Absu arrogantly executes mythological occult metal."" It's a sign of how self-serious and topically obsessive they've always been. Drummer, principal songwriter, and singer Proscriptor has never been reluctant to talk about the band's backstory or intentions, either, treating his own art with the sort of historical exactitude scholars reserve for the ancient mythologies he in turn renders as albums. In an early <a href=""http://www.battlezine.com/interviews/Absu/absu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, he diligently explained, ""After the immaculate indulgence in the Necronomicon, Voudon Gnostics, Thoth Magick, and Sumerian/Mesopotamian mythology, the name was altered to Absu, in reference to 'abyss' or even the 'blackened Earth.'""</p>
<p>With <i>Abzu</i>, he takes the next step, providing a detailed historical, theological, and personal synopsis of each song in the liner notes. Lyrically, after all, Absu songs are intricate webs of first references, context-less backstories, and shouted spells. It's multivalent stuff. ""Skrying in the Spirit Vision"" lasts only four minutes, but digging into its themes and allusions-- ""Travelling: the Radix of vibration/ Projections: in gale of the Ninth,"" reads half of one verse-- means pausing the song every other second to research another term or concept. Proscriptor's explanations are similarly dense with mathematical equations, ""teachings of Enochian Magic(k),"" and expositions on already elaborate theories. His own simplifications require either a highly functioning knowledge of Mesopotamian mythology or an inordinate amount of patience.</p>
<p>All that likely (and deservedly?) sounds pretentious, or at least like a lot just to enjoy some heavy metal. But Absu's unwavering subservience to their ideals is part and parcel of what makes <i>Abzu</i> so enjoyable. For Proscriptor, this is the equivalent of liturgical music, meant to be played with the kinds of energy and enthusiasm that the complete belief in any system or story can create. These esoteric and involved histories compel Absu to incredible conviction and resolve. They twist through intricate structures-- first verses reused as the coda, repeated bridges, impromptu acoustic impasses-- in four-minutes bursts. Occult or no, they move with a Pentecostal spirit. The band's big return, 2009's <i>Absu</i>, was a guest-heavy, 13-track, hour-long sprawl of ideas, a perfect reprise after such a long hiatus. <i>Abzu</i> keeps the crew tight, though, with new guitarist Vis Crom and bassist and vocalist Ezezu only joining Proscriptor and Mayhem's Rune Eriksen, the former Mayhem guitarist whose kinetic leads also lined moments of <i>Absu</i>. Part two misses some of the adventurism of its predecessor, but it makes the most of its concision, packing a lot of parts into convincing little packages.</p>
<p>Again, they've got motivation: As Proscriptor writes: ""Ontologically, It Became Time &amp; Space"" concerns the origins of those two crucial concepts, ""or the relationship between metaphysical nihilism and the 'physical' origin of one abstract occult concept."" What's crucial for the listener, though, is that this debate is the basis for a perfectly restless roar-- an irrascible string of swells, collapses, blast beats, pauses, downshifts, and sprints. The complicated subject material matters only insofar as it makes the music compelling. Absu have been exploring various belief systems on tape for the better part of two decades, but knowing the difference between Enki and Ea isn't essential for enjoyment. It's once again only the catalyst for an end product that works well as a piece of music-- and maybe mythology, too.</p></div>"|15916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15916-abzu/|7.4|Grayson Currin

It's a fitting place of origin considering their debut, 30 minutes of hook-y punk songs, hits a number of garage-rock beats: Their aesthetic offers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>-colored juvenility, their sound an in-the-red fuzz with a subtle pop sensibility and vocals delivered with a bratty abandon. Despite the shimmering album title, dinosaur-and-ice cream cover art, and bratty delivery, though, <i>Swimming</i>'s a darker album than you might expect.</p>
<p>Most of the 30 minutes consist of fast, jovial-sounding power chords, yes, but beneath the fuzz is a series of songs that builds a narrative about deteriorating love. It <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15908-like-they-always-do/"" target=""_blank"">begins</a> innocently enough with a series of drum crashes and a tossed-off line,""My thoughts just turn to you/ Just like they always do."" Soon enough, things get heavier, from the semi-desperate promises of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16109-be-so-true/"" target=""_blank"">Be So True</a>"" to the post-breakup of ""Someone to Blame"". It culminates in ""Without Your Heart"", a track that uses the vocals, tone, and hook of a 1950s teardrops ballad. It's the most clear-eyed and clean sounding song on the record.</p>
<p>The group is commonly cited as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a> side project, and while  there are connections between the two Cleveland-area garage bands,  that's not exactly the case. Cloud Nothings is primarily the project of  Dylan Baldi, so although Jayson Gerycz has played drums on one or two singles,  this is his first time recording as a multi-instrumentalist, let alone  as a songwriter. Some of that inexperience shows. Taken separately, the songs are driving punk gems; as a whole, they rarely offer a change of pace. The material is repetitive (down to the same general vocal patterns), each song bleeding into the next. The lyrics of each track push the story forward, but even that becomes difficult to parse past the samey delivery. Only the 50s vibe of ""Without Your Heart"" and the jangling, echoing closer ""Tip of My Tongue"" offer a rest.</p>
<p>That said, the semi-aggressive tone can serve as an ear-catching counterbalance to the emotional outpouring: ""Don't Have to Run"" leads with a vicious, rolling drum crash while asking, ""How will I go on without you?""; ""Rot Away"" features a more upbeat hook than the title suggests, though Brown does yell, ""I'll rot away inside your gaze,"" in the chorus. Catharsis is good, but slathering a variety of emotions with such consistently muffled vocals and  guitar distortion cheapens their point. By the  halfway mark, <i>Swimming Through Sunlight</i> starts sounding less like a garage-rock band and more like some kid howling about frustrated heartbreak in his parent's garage.</p></div>"|15912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15912-total-babes-swimming-through-sunlight/|6.6|Evan Minsker

After 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11486-memory-drawings/"" target=""_blank"">Memory Drawings</a></i>, the band reunited with original bassist Trevor Montgomery. But as a band member returned, another was saying goodbye: Jeff Jacobs, who primarily handled horn duties, died of cancer, giving the group his blessing to carry on without him before he passed away. The remaining members of the Drift chose not to replace him, and anyone with a working knowledge of the their back catalog thus far would understand why. He was far from just a brass sideman; the successes of <i>Memory Drawings</i> and 2005's debut LP <i>Noumena</i> were a result of not only the band's spacious dub-inflected sound at the time, but also the splashes of color that Jacobs' horn work lent to it. His wide emotional vocabulary allowed his contributions to range far outside the Drift's loosely drawn lines.</p>
<p>Jacobs was an integral key to that sound and they seem to be going for something different on <i>Blue Hour</i>. Save for a few delay-treated guitar lines on ""Continuum"", there's little trace of dub on the album, but what they're moving toward stylistically is less clear. The mood on <i>Blue Hour</i> is often understandably tense, with Montgomery's low rumbles (as well as Rich Douthit's rolling, punctuated percussion) throwing stones against guitarist/keyboardist Danny Grody's aquatic ripples. The album's opening cut, ""Dark Passage"", remains engaging as its negative space is filled and, subsequently, drained with dread, but its lack of an emotional payoff makes for something of an unfulfilled finish. That sense of building toward nothing runs through <i>Blue Hour</i>, where inertia takes the form of soft-loud climbing (the 12-minute centerpiece ""The Skull Hand Smiles/May You Fare Well"") and ominous, out-of-place ""Peter Gunn""-isms (early leak ""Horizon""). The band's gift for melodic interplay is in limited supply here, so when some light finally shines in with the sad sways of ""Hello From Everywhere"", the effect is that of windows being opened in a room filled with humid air.</p>
<p>On one hand, <i>Blue Hour</i> is a disappointment, especially coming off of an album as strong and promising as <i>Memory Drawings</i>. But the loss of a bandmate has been enough to stop other groups in their tracks. So another way to look at <i>Blue Hour</i> is as a document of survival, a record whose very existence shows the group's courage. It's impossible not to admire the Drift for doing anything other than packing it in.</p></div>"|15913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15913-blue-hour/|6.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Even accounting for the brief dip into balladry toward the end, bands don't generally come up with something this uniformly dense and tense by tweaking over multiple sessions. But as longtime students of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>'s Holger Czukay, Radiohead also know that fevered and compulsive-sounding records can be the product of painstaking editing, stitching multiple takes into one bristling rush.</p>
<p>Little of the band's careful detail work, or their general sense of passion, makes it onto <i>TKOL RMX 1234567</i>, a listenable but ultimately bloodless collection of remixes of songs from <i>The King of Limbs</i>. Whether intimidated by the thought of reinterpreting a band renowned for experimentation or unsure how to take apart and reassemble the band's tightly-wound recent material, too many of these 19 artists seem content to settle for bland beauty, or simply apply their usual sonic tricks without pushing themselves in the slightest.</p>
<p>The highlights are the tracks that take <i>TKOL</i>'s joy in rhythm to new places. Acclaimed UK neo-rave producer Lone turns out a typically brilliant take on ""Feral"" that somehow keeps the original percussion pattern intact while recasting it as an early-1990s ambient house record, giving us <i>TKOL RMX</i>'s most bizarrely enjoyable image: Radiohead gone to Ibiza. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a>, the alter-ego of dubstep progenitor and Hessle Audio label head <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ramadanman/6050069126"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ramadanman</a>, pulls a fantastic bait-and-switch, opening with an extended drone intro that shifts into a punchy mix of early Detroit techno and jagged jungle breaks. These two, along with a small handful of other acts-- Anstam squeezing drama from just a handful of skeletal drum patterns, <a href=""http://www.sbtrkt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SBTRKT</a> recasting Thom Yorke as a forlorn garage diva, <a href=""http://www.caribou.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a> returning to his roots as a left-field beatmaker-- are fearless enough to recreate the feeling of <i>TKOL</i> in a new form. And a few do get by on sheer loveliness alone, like <a href=""http://www.fourtet.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> spinning ""Separator"" into an old-school IDM lullaby.</p>
<p><span>But a far greater number of these remixes flatten out the complexity of <i>TKOL</i>'s grooves in favor of commonplace arrangements. Instead of Radiohead's pinpoint editing, we get generically ""wonky"" takes on house and techno filled with stuttering drums and formless synth goo, whether aggressive like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blawan/115678128712"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blawan</a>'s take on ""Bloom"" or shoegaze-lite like <a href=""http://www.nathanfake.co.uk/content/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Fake</a> doing ""Morning Mr Magpie"". And some of the most touted names fail to deliver the craft we've come to expect from them: On his ""Bloom"" rework, </span><a href=""http://www.jamiexx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a><span> ditches his minimalist gloom-funk for gauzy, forgettable ambience. More ethereal or abstract remixes of such anxious music <i>could</i> have been interesting, but few seem up to the task here, instead doling out placid and perfectly pleasant background noise.</span></p>
<p>For a while, until its complex grooves revealed the songs beneath, I dismissed <i>TKOL</i> as a brave but opaque attempt to remake Radiohead as just individual components in a roiling rhythm machine. In other words, it seemed like the <i>perfect</i> Radiohead album for remixing. Who would better understand that everything-is-rhythm impulse than dance music producers? If anything, wouldn't they take it further, make it wilder, go funkier?</p>
<p>The lack of rhythmic invention here could be forgiven if most of <i>TKOL RMX</i> displayed <i>any</i> kind of invention. Failing to match <i>TKOL</i>'s peculiar vibe-- aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital detritus, robotically repetitive yet humanly off-kilter, parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of melodic relief -- is one thing. Failing to replace it with anything that similarly rewards listening deeper and harder is quite another.</p></div>"|15905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15905-tkol-rmx-1234567/|6.0|Jess Harvell

I pictured Hecker using the setting's natural reverb to reflect what I imagined to be the space's chilly mysteries. I wasn't wrong-- some of that mood is there-- but <i>Ravedeath, 1972 </i>is wider and deeper than that, encompassing a multitude of tones. It's also a big, enveloping work, more interested in quickly surrounding you than in creating dark spaces for you to enter as you choose.</p>
<p>It turns out Hecker actually did create some dark spaces for <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>, but he did so<i> </i>before entering that church. The nine early sketches collected on <i>Dropped Pianos </i>are starker and colder than what ended up on the final album. Heavy reverb and minor-key tones produce lots of negative space-- shadows in which the spirit of the music hides a bit, poking its head around corners rather than looking straight into the camera. The source of these sounds is clear-- a piano on which Hecker is unafraid to bang out bold, dramatic notes. But most of those notes decay into echo right after they are struck.</p>
<p>That effect makes the album name apt-- Hecker's piano seems to always be falling from view. Such quick absence is an inversion of the more-present <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>. In fact, inversion is the prominent theme here: the album's title flips the name of <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>'s opener ""The Piano Drop"", while its<i> </i>cover image is the exact negative of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41245-take-cover-tim-hecker-iravedeath-1972i/"">its predecessor's</a>. Of course, the album name also indicates how piano was literally dropped from Hecker's creative process, replaced by the church organ. But what's most interesting about these pieces is their musical inversion, the way they can be as compelling as what they eventually became despite being tonally opposite.</p>
<p>They're compelling mostly because they sound intimate. Where <i>Ravedeath, 1972 </i>had a widescreen flavor, these sketches feel personal and individual. You can imagine Hecker sitting alone at a piano spinning simple yarns, rather than at a huge organ generating worlds of sound. Granted, there is a cinematic quality here that can be as moving as anything on <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>. But where that album is grand enough to soundtrack the space scenes in <i>2001</i>, this one would better fit the lonely, haunted journeys of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>. That analogy might imply that <i>Ravedeath, 1972 </i>is the bigger, better work, and it is. But the value of <i>Dropped Pianos</i> is not just in showing how small ideas can lead to greater ones. It's a strong record on its own, and solid evidence that Tim Hecker's range continues to expand-- even in reverse.</p></div>"|15906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15906-dropped-pianos/|7.8|Marc Masters

Herring, lyricist and lion-throated singer of Baltimore synth-romantics <a href=""http://future-islands.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a>, has written a lot of break-up songs. He penned some pretty vitriolic ones on the band's 2008 debut, <i>Wave Like Home</i>, and then he wrote an entire record's worth on their terrific 2010 release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14177-in-evening-air/"" target=""_blank"">In Evening Air</a></i>. About four songs into their latest-- which contains such boldfaced melodrama as ""I loved you and I still do""-- you get the idea that this guy might be something of a Sisyphus, relieved at last of the whole boulder-up-the-hill business but doomed to sit on the receiving end of an ""It's not you, it's me"" conversation ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Future Islands initially came out of Baltimore's <a href=""http://whamcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wham City</a> scene; their first, rather unexceptional record was built from electro-punk and day-glo squiggles. Over the past few years, though, they've become more aesthetically disciplined. The thing that made <i>In Evening Air</i> such a bruiser was how seriously it took its job as a break-up album: Its gaze was singularly affixed on hurt. Herring's lyrics were simplistic and conversational, yet pointed: ""You couldn't possibly know how much you meant to me,"" ""You hurt me so bad,"" etc. Amidst a steady, drum-machine heartbeat and uncommonly sentient-sounding synths, he repeated these lines-- the banal poetry of relationship-speak-- until they started to sound downright sinister. His refrain on ""Long Flight"" builds from a quietly mounting frenzy into, by song's end, a full blown, grown-man temper tantrum. Listening to the part when he finally breaks evokes the skin-prickling claustrophobia of watching a mild-mannered airplane seatmate start to freak out 30,000 feet above an exit route.</p>
<p>Their third and latest LP, <i>On the Water</i>, is more invested in wide-open spaces. The opening (and title) track gives all the elements of the band's sound more leg room: Herring's unhurried vocals, epic, smoldering synths, and the steady churn of a not-too-choppy tide on a sample that begins the song. Recorded in a friend's house in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, overlooking the Pasquotank River, <i>On the Water</i> draws from the imagery and movement of the sea. It's less intent on bringing the drama or the fury than <i>In Evening Air</i> was, but its reflections on aging and memory accumulate into something surprisingly moving.</p>
<p>With the songs' energy scaled back, the efforts of the other two band members come to the fore. Gerrit Welmers handles the keyboards and programming, bringing an evocative, setting-sun vibe to slowburners like ""The Great Fire"" (a soulful duet with Jenn Wasner of fellow Marylanders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5739-wye-oak/"" target=""_blank"">Wye Oak</a>), while William Cashion's guitars have the same low-end lurch of early-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> riffs. Though treading familiar sonic and thematic waters at the start, <i>On the Water</i> really comes alive midway through, beginning with the mournful ""Where I Found You"" and building to ""Close to None"", the record's most buoyant track.</p>
<p>Though some of Herring's more temperate moments make me miss his snarling freakouts of yore, one of <i>On the Water</i>'s most striking moments is decidedly minimal: ""Tybee Island"" pairs the sound of crashing waves with a warm synth tone, both of which overpower the presence of their frontman. For most people, Herring's hyper-theatrical vocals are the make-or-break point of Future Islands: He sings every line like Meat Loaf serenading Yorick's skull. It's an acquired taste for sure, one that's much easier to be unequivocally swept up in when you're watching him on stage (doing grand hand gestures, grinning like a maniac, and occasionally slapping himself across the face), but even on the record, Herring's signature affect communicates something about the operatic sadness of life's everyday banalities. ""Tybee Island"" finds him, for once, barely audible. It's a powerful moment to hear a voice usually so big made to sound-- in contrast with the natural world-- so human and small. It's the polar opposite of the tension-building repetitions of <i>In Evening Air</i>: With each utterance of this coda, he seems more and more to loosen his grip on the past.</p></div>"|15903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15903-future-islands-on-the-water/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

The duo of Alessio Natalizia (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27776-banjo-or-freakout/"">Banjo or Freakout</a>) and Sam Willis (<a href=""http://allez-allez.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allez-Allez</a>) have built on those promising beginnings by stretching Walls' sound on <i>Coracle</i>, principally by scraping away all the fuzz and upping the production values. Tracks like ""Burnt Sienna"" and ""Soft Cover People"" from the band's debut album flirted with the kind of filmy arrangements that chillwave was founded on, although their disposition toward harder dance music took them far enough away from the genre to escape too many comparisons. Still, it's hard not to feel that the tightening up of their sound on <i>Coracle</i> is a deliberate cutting of the chillwave tether, even though it's a change that feels natural and has forced the duo into functioning in brighter spaces.</p>
<p>One point of interest from that debut record was Walls' propensity for taking Krautrock influences and shaving them down into bite-size chunks; the entire record stopped short at just over 29 minutes. Here, they take the more obvious route and expand those inclinations out and latch them to the sunnier beats that are now firmly within their domain. There is more focus on producing complete songs and less deviation into abstraction here than before, although there are a few welcome moments (""Vacant"", ""Drunken Galleon"") when their fondness for ambient shines through. As such, <i>Coracle</i> is stylistically all over the map, with the pair behind Walls indulging vastly different parts of their personalities through the mostly instrumental tracks.</p>
<p>At the center of the album is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16054-sunporch/"">""Sunporch""</a>, a strapping electro-pop number built around a skeletal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> throb and pitch-shifted vocal screams. It's telling that Walls are touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a> to promote this album, as ""Sunporch"" is their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGp-22t0lU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Atlas""</a>, a great utopian future-pop moment that demonstrates the power to startle that this band occasionally possesses. But whereas ""Atlas"" felt like a genuine bolt from the blue, ""Sunporch"" is more of a distant cousin to it, playing out in an alternate reality where Battles have set down a blueprint for all manner of forward-thinking acts. Despite those misgivings it's definitely a step in the right direction, and it's almost equaled in the pretty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12453-raw-umbertwilight/"">""Raw Umber/Twilight""</a>, which combines Walls' love of setting forlorn shoegazer-y patterns to the grind of old analog bass synths.</p>
<p>There's a sharp contrast between the twin peaks of <i>Coracle </i>and the rest of its material, especially when they try to pointlessly channel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> circa ""Honey"" and shackle that sound to some perfunctory beats on ""Ecstatic Truth"". It highlights a danger when groups try to veer too far into eclecticism, where the overall focus of the band is lost amid the desire to keep playing around with the sound. There's little in the way of identity to cling onto, with no shared tropes to bind the sound together, making this feel more like a compilation than a focused work by one act. It demonstrates how big the band's record collections are, and how skilled they are at bringing those influences into their sound, but it leaves the question of who Walls are and what they are trying to achieve frustratingly open.</p></div>"|15901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15901-coracle/|6.8|Nick Neyland

The West London producer-- real name Nathan Jenkins-- first caught a fire in 2007 with<i> <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/mixtape-bullion-ipet-sounds-in-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pet Sounds: In the Key of Dee</a></i>, a surprisingly deft, quasi-mash-up record that married snatches of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beach Boys</a>' classic LP with a variety of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a> samples. Roughly four years, an EP, and a handful of singles later, and an honest-to-goodness Bullion full-length still hasn't fallen into our laps. This brings us to <i>You Drive Me to Plastic</i>, which saw release on <a href=""http://theyoungturks.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Turks</a> at the tail end of last year as a one-sided 12"". The 500 copies went fast, and while it was made available overseas on CD this past April, it's only now available stateside.</p>
<p>While it might be the second closest thing he's ever done to making an album proper, <i>You Drive Me to Plastic</i> is, in fact, not the debut we've been waiting out for. Billed as a ""non-LP,"" the piece's nine tracks blend into one another to create a 20-minute extended mix, highlighting Bullion's genre-smashing groovers that continue to prove just as idiosyncratic and danceable as past efforts. Using shorter, less movement-minded pieces to glue together three big, single-friendly tracks and a more ambitious finale, <i>Plastic</i> most certainly doesn't feel like a debut, but it also doesn't seem like just another keeping-busy-mix-of-the-month either. Whether the whole ""non-LP"" tag sounds like a bunch of nonsense to you or not, a little more Bullion in any capacity is a good thing.</p>
<p>One of Bullion's greatest assets is being able to work with so many different ideas and styles while being overwhelming, and the way <i>Plastic</i> is structured is perhaps even more of a testament to this ability. Each of those interludes provide a specific purpose, linking the more memorable moments to create an even more fluid experience. And while stuff like ""Lol Express"" can get by on its own merits, sounding something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> crashing into a 1980s cop-show theme, the real pull are the more fully realized songs that will inevitably end up in a ""Best Of"" folder along with his more pop-oriented assemblages. Everything from wandering saxophones, strange vocal clippings, chic club pulsings, and a variety of geographically varied rhythms coexist together while rarely sounding jumbled or too mazy. It shows that, for a guy who isn't terribly prolific, his attention to pacing and matching incompatible sources with finesse often results in success.</p>
<p>Bullion has often oriented himself using hip-hop-- he's the same guy that could thrown <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Klaus Nomi</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Sainte-Marie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buffy Sainte-Marie</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11728-say-goodbye-to-what/"" target=""_blank"">a track</a> and still have it sound like an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrika_Bambaataa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Afrika Bambaataa</a> record-- but <i>Plastic</i> finds him exploring the dancefloors of Europe and the Carribbean. <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/youngturks/magic-was-ruler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Magic Was Ruler""</a>, which again features a Sainte-Marie sample (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhmeroR20lc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot""</a>), feels as if you could salsa to it, with a bright guitar line and horns that are evocative of a night out in Havana, while ""Pressure to Dance"" splits the different between slinky Italo-disco moves and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>.</p>
<p>There was always a sort of deranged quality to Bullion's sound as well-- maybe it has something to do with the fact that his music has always had a joyous, almost spritely disposition, but often contained imperfect samples and darker tinkerings that could readily translate as feelings of unease. A good many of these 20 minutes explore even more haunted extremes. <a href=""http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2010/10/25/bullion-too-right/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Too Right""</a>, which features a pulsing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Anderson</a> vocal sample, is one of the more menacing things he's ever produced. <i>Plastic</i> might not contain your favorite Bullion moments (some of the shorter tracks feel a bit lost), but they're important in the sense that he can feel comfortable exploring certain extremes of his personality without compromising the sound he's been sculpting over the past few years.</p></div>"|15896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15896-bullion-you-drive-me-to-plastic/|7.1|Zach Kelly

Ostensibly, the feeling Blake is talking about is that of heady isolation-- the shadowy sensation that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> perfected with 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank"">Untrue</a></i> and Blake successfully brought into the singer-songwriter realm with this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a>. As for the many dubstep artists who rely heavily on computers during gigs, Blake hates them: ""To me, laptops have got no place on a stage,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7941-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">he told Pitchfork in March</a>. And when he covers quintessential songwriters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a> (on his album) or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> (on this EP), he's not trying to render them obsolete as much as join them within the canon of authentic artistes. For all of the futurist conversation surrounding him, James Blake is a bit old-fashioned.</p>
<p>When he took on Feist's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12014-limit-to-your-love/"" target=""_blank"">Limit to Your Love</a>"", he infused it with water-rippling sub-bass and epic pauses while retaining its original emotionality. In that way, it was the perfect cover-- he made the track his own while keeping all the key elements of the original. <i>Enough Thunder</i>'s remake of Mitchell's 1971 ode ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15405-a-case-of-you-joni-mitchell-cover/"" target=""_blank"">A Case of You</a>"", recorded live at the BBC, is different. Blake switches Mitchell's guitar for piano, and leaves it at that. There's no bass. No additional production. Unlike his ""Limit to Your Love"", which expanded and beautifully distorted the notion of a ""singer-songwriter,"" the ""A Case of You"" cover contracts the term, revealing Blake's limitations as an artist. Without any of his signature, modern embellishments, Blake's take has the feel of a stiff recital, his vocal undulations ironically sounding less natural without those well-situated sonic accoutrements. The same can be said of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44169-hear-james-blake-perform-another-new-song/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, an original piano-and-voice composition. Even though Blake has been slowly unveiling his singing voice over the last two years, these plain and flat tracks sound surprising. Perhaps they shouldn't. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38367-rising-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">an interview from April of last year</a>, he said, ""Although I'm making this heavy dance music, I sometimes just sit down at the piano and just sing. It's like that's my ultimate calling.""</p>
<p><i>Enough Thunder</i>'s remaining four songs are also decidedly low-key, though vastly more engaging. These are dubstep ballads reminiscent of his 2010 EP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14696-klavierwerke-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Klavierwerke</a></i>, except with his vocals brought to the front of the mix. As with many of Blake's best songs, they're simple, minimal, glacial. And even though it's pretty damn hard to understand a word he's saying, that melancholy core is present. It's conveyed through the elongated guitar feedback and pulsing submarine call of ""Once We All Agree"", or the sound of a record skipping (or is it a hard drive clicking?) that forms the subtle foundation of ""We Might Feel Unsound"", or the dolphin-like vocal whoops of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s Justin Vernon on the duo's collaborative track ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43562-james-blake-and-bon-iver-collaborate/"" target=""_blank"">Fall Creek Boys Choir</a>"", which is blessed (and kinda cursed) by sounding exactly like what you'd expect a Bon Iver/James Blake track to sound like. Only three-and-a-half minutes into the EP's penultimate track, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12400-not-long-now/"" target=""_blank"">Not Long Now</a>"", do we get anything resembling a beat dropping. For those who adored Blake's heavier, more rhythmic early material, <i>Enough Thunder</i> could easily turn into <i>Not Enough Thunder</i>.</p>
<p>But one of the great things about Blake is how he's willing to make a statement: in his uncompromising music, in his candid and thoughtful interviews, or in his choice of titles. <i>Enough Thunder</i> could be self-reflexive since this is easily his quietest release thus far. But it could also indicate a sort of corrective to the abrasive and cartoonish strain of dubstep that has taken grip as of late, especially in America. To Blake, dubstep means something intimate and internal, but to the many fans of acts including Skrillex and Bassnectar-- who use their wobbling bass like hair metal guitarists used solos-- it means something exuberant and euphoric. And while Blake recognizes both feelings, he certainly prefers one over the other. Talking about the faster-louder-stronger evolution of the style, he recently said, ""Those melodic basslines are insultingly simple and aggressive and annoying. That is now a valid genre, but it certainly isn't dubstep. It's turned into something else. That's cool, I'm happy about it. I'm not like, 'As soon as it became mainstream it became rubbish, or whatever.' It's just something different now."" It's a refreshingly mature yet opinionated take from someone who turns 23 this month. Blake is fighting the respectable fight on <i>Enough Thunder</i>, though the EP's totally bass-less tracks show that he needs dubstep as much as dubstep needs him.</p></div>"|15904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15904-enough-thunder-ep/|6.4|Ryan Dombal

The few singles that the London producer has released over the past two years have sounded anything but, with disjointed rhythms rubbing up against queasy tones and deep pockets of echo. Not that his music is joyless-- if you were captivated by 2009's collaborative single with French vocalist LaNote, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11396-space-ex-ft-lanote/"" target=""_blank"">""Space Ex""</a>, following the breadcrumbs he's dropped since has been a heady pleasure. But his music is geared toward dark landscapes.</p>
<p>Last year's single with vocalist and frequent collaborator Anneka, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14643-raindrops/"" target=""_blank"">""Raindrops""</a>, featured a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14777-raindrops-john-talabots-cosmic-rework/"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of the title track from Spanish psychedelic house wiz <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a>; like most Talabot re-works, the remix was outstanding, but it also sounded as if he were forcing his own style on the original's liquid gurgles and irregular beat. Some in the UK beat scene work with difficult, self-set parameters-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a>'s brittle woodblock accents and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"" target=""_blank"">Blawan</a>'s hard-as-nails acid patterns both immediately come to mind. But Blue Daisy isn't making music you can dance to. ""I don't go clubbing that much... the club thing, it's not timeless,"" he says in the press notes for this release. ""I'm making music for the long run, in 10 years I still want people to be able to listen to it... I'm not down with the idea of fitting in.""</p>
<p>Accordingly, <i>The Sunday Gift</i> is about deep listening, with plenty to get lost in and little to soundtrack a night out. There are long stretches of unsettling ambiance, with jarring, harsh textures and sonic mayhem erupting from the album's foundation. The tension is made tighter by elliptical strings and distant vocal samples spouting vaguely threatening political klaxon language and speaking in foreign languages. The guest vocalists-- Anneka, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/760-the-cinematic-orchestra/"" target=""_blank"">Cinematic Orchestra</a> collaborator Heidi Vogel, UK rapper Hey!Zeus, smoky singer Stac-- are treated less like stars and more like instruments in the mix, slathered in their sonic surroundings. For an electronic album from someone well-versed in beatmaking, the idea of rhythm almost seems secondary.</p>
<p>Comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>'s unimpeachable run in the 1990s come immediately to mind, but <i>The Sunday Gift</i> feels a shade darker. A better comparison would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"" target=""_blank"">Tricky</a>'s debut, 1995's <i>Maxinquaye</i>, a record that contains its share of blasted dub and hollow-point production. Another quality <i>Maxinquaye</i> and <i>The Sunday Gift</i> share is anger, something in no short supply in the UK lately. The mix of sounds and sensations has a cumulative quality. Some albums work best as front-to-back listening experiences; <i>The Sunday Gift</i> practically demands such attention, flowing in a single-track style that makes skipping around to specific songs feel like walking into a movie in the middle. And the payoff comes in the form of the album's gorgeous closing suite, which includes the woozy house of ""Spinning Channels"". For a producer who made his name with a sporadic series of singles, Blue Daisy knows how to fill a larger canvas.</p></div>"|15877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15877-the-sunday-gift/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Since launching about a year ago, the boutique label has pretty well dominated this dark, ethereal corner of the indie universe, introducing or helping introduce about a half-dozen of its most intriguing artists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, Holy Other). But if you think you've got Tri Angle pegged at this point, you may be surprised by its latest release, the debut EP from Fatima Al Qadiri, aka Ayshay. A New York-based singer and producer born in Senegal and raised in Kuwait, she makes digitally processed vocal music with an unusual global bent.</p>
<p>Al Qadiri is also a journalist and writes <i>DIS</i> magazine's eye-opening <a href=""http://dismagazine.com/blog/global-wav/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Global. Wav</a> column, which is devoted to highlighting obscure international sounds not usually covered by Western music outlets. Her own songs wouldn't be out of place there. Mixing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>-style vocal layering with traditional Islamic songs, she sings mostly in Arabic and builds spare, haunting tracks from her own voice. An airy falsetto in its natural state, her singing is tweaked and stretched, occasionally pitched downward to sound deep and foreboding, and stacked upon itself to create the sensation of some kind of otherworldly group chant. There are no other instruments, no beats, no gestures to pop songwriting of any kind-- it's music that lives in its own realm.</p>
<p>As unconventional as it sounds, <i>WARN-U</i> is, generally speaking, an affecting listen. Just hearing Al Qadiri recreate a version of this sacred music (which sounds like prayers, or at least the kind of hymns you might hear in a religious setting) is striking in its own right, and the addition of computerized elements creates an unsettling tension. The songs feel ancient and futuristic at the same time, like there's no identifiable place or time to pin them to. If that was Al Qadiri's artistic aim here, then she's achieved it, but in doing so I think has sacrificed some approachability. While at times beautiful and certainly inventive, <i>WARN-U</i> is somewhat one-note, and it can be difficult to differentiate between the three short original tracks. It's also free-form to the degree that it can sometimes be difficult to engage with.</p>
<p>That's where L.A. production duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"" target=""_blank"">Nguzunguzu</a> come in, who close things out with a 12-minute ""megamix"" of the EP's original numbers. Also globally minded but considerably more playful, Nguzunguzu are a great remix choice, and they give Ayshay's material a bright, neon makeover, adding in lots of fluttering drums, handclaps, and trunk-rattling bass. This is where <i>WARN-U</i> is most accessible and arguably most enjoyable, since the addition of structure helps bring Al Qadiri's more avant-garde leanings back toward earth. That a key track here comes from an outside source detracts some from the overall impact, but this is still a boundary-pushing work with strong ideas at its core. Whether or not you fall for it will likely come down to taste, but at the very least, <i>WARN-U</i> doesn't sound like anything else.</p></div>"|15902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15902-warn-u-ep/|7.2|Joe Colly

Emerging from the febrile imaginations of grime artists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5940-jme/"" target=""_blank"">JME</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5921-skepta/"" target=""_blank"">Skepta</a>, <i>Tropical </i>was messy and ravey, an exhausting sprint through spiraling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23832-todd-edwards/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Edwards</a>-style vocals and rough-hewn 2-step loops, as if grime's low-bit, high-contrast aesthetic had circled back to swallow early UK garage whole. But its rave was radically dysfunctional, too hysterically unbalanced for ordinary dancing. Instead it seemed a glorious, unrepeatable one-off, a sound whose moment had passed before it could arrive.</p>
<p>But the unrepeatable always <i>does </i>repeat, and here we are five years later with <i>Tropical 2</i>. Replacing Skepta with several younger-generation acolytes, JME's belated sequel already feels more at home in the wider world than its predecessor ever did. What's changed in the intervening half-decade is less the <i>Tropical</i> sound (though that has, too) than the sonic constellations into which it re-emerges. Whether in post-dubstep (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"" target=""_blank"">Zomby</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Night+Slugs"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a> stable), or the undergrounds of funky, grime and bassline, virtually everyone seems to want to make some brand of lurid, hypercolor (let's call it) rave-house, sonic approximations of the fixed grin of partying past your physical limits.</p>
<p>As if to underscore this point, <i>Tropical 2 </i>features several tracks from bassline-into-grime unifier DJ Q, whose pretty but disconcerting, stuttering house tunes constitute the tropical sound at its most resolved, their glowering basslines, gauzy synths, and overlapping sighs molded into a disorienting edgelessness even as they stagger, like a room with no corners. Even more pointedly spelling out the <i>Tropical</i> <i>raison d'être</i>, widescreen instrumental grime specialist Royal-T perversely switches to unabashed house for his sole contribution, ""Cool Down"". Like a hyperactive dub of Robin S.'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwaxy3KCfgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Show Me Love</a>"", ""Cool Down"" is the year's greatest dance anthem-in-waiting, an exhilarating victory lap of organ basslines, xylophone riffs, and a quavering Greek chorus of female vocal samples.</p>
<p>But with the glorious exceptions of ""Cool Down"" and ""The Stranger"" (unexpected but welcome bustling syncopated garage from Todd Edwards in a startling piece of <i>Back to the Future</i>-style intergenerational meddling), <i>Tropical 2 </i>is mostly less-excitable than its predecessor. Rather than skip relentlessly toward a fluorescent, drugged-up future-world, the mix instead plunges into zones of eerie, beautiful uncertainty. In particular, JME builds on the mysteriousness of his best contributions to the first collection, less laughing-gas rave than alien ballet on a helium-cloud planet. With their delicately stabbing snares and hesitantly strobing cut-up vocals, ""Sandy Beach"" and ""Easy Jet"" almost defy description, existing in a state of zero-gravity paranoid grace-- think the feel, rather than the specific sound, of <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>' underwater levels in the game's rudimentary, mid-1980s incarnation.</p>
<p>Throughout, the <i>Tropical</i> celebration of <i>wrongness</i> is retained, but in a manner more creeping and creepy for its near-respectability. Preditah's ""New York"" mis-remembers Skepta's earlier <i>Tropical</i> tunes like jungle misremembered hardcore techno, its jagged, asymmetrical snares and shrill, sliding vocal samples subsiding into jazzy piano chords, and the soothing refrain, ""tell me you need me,"" pushing U.S. garage to the max. What Preditah-- and everyone else here-- recognizes is how mixing in the smooth with the rough simply makes the latter more estranging and disquieting. This music is most exciting at its most morphological: Best of all are the interstitial moments between tracks when one contorted, molten shape deliquesces into another, beats interlocking in strange patterns of the residual and emergent while melting hiccup vocals form impromptu harmonies.</p>
<p>It's this sense of being thoroughly of its time and yet out-of-time, on-trend but off-world, that helps make <i>Tropical 2 </i>so much more compelling than the multitude of edgy house/grime/dubstep DJ mixes clogging the internet's arteries. Rather than expose the connections between everything in a vibe-killing process of demystification, the artists on <i>Tropical 2</i> trace a constellation of perspectives looking awry, a slippery articulation of that sense of (im)possibility in rave that is more than rave and more than dancing: the shapes we throw to constrain the aliens seething under the surfaces of our skin.</p></div>"|15888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15888-tropical-2/|8.3|Tim Finney

KoRn aren't going to ask him for a remix. And he doesn't hang too close to either of the distant poles that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> placed between his own indie-friendly ambience and the aggro, wobble-cannon zeitgeist of bass music's more populist and/or frattier impulses. Martyn's 2009 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12883-great-lengths/"" target=""_blank"">Great Lengths</a></i>, was ideal for dubstep aficionados to turn to when they wanted to explore the genre's extra rhythmic possibilities instead of just fiddling with the volume knob: It traded on gloomy emotional introspection even as the beat drove it into danceable territory, the nuanced buildups of techno and tech house influences either diverting or streamlining 2-step into 4/4.</p>
<p>So it's worth noting that emphasizing any real connection to dubstep as most people know it doesn't do <i>Ghost People</i> much of a service. Sure, there's an appearance by Hyperdub's in-house toaster the Spaceape on the sub-two-minute opener ""Love and Machines"", but the mannered cyborg deadpan he injects into his usually resonant, foreboding voice should give you fair warning that this isn't your typical Class of '06 sound. <i>Ghost People</i> is a significant tonal shift, a rhythmic paring-down into less complex sounds that border on UK funky gone throwback traditionalist. And while it often lacks the moodier, polyrhythmic highs of <i>Great Lengths</i> and the character that came with it, Martyn's efforts to make it back through no-nonsense propulsion nearly make up for it.</p>
<p>He goes about this to some singleminded, focused ends: between the steam-hissing, clap-driven Detroitisms of ""Masks"" and ""Horror Vacui"", the way the title track's congas-and-hi-hats pulse buffets a spiky tech-house riff, and the way he pits stammering vocal loops against clipped synth stabs and a spine-rolling locomotion in ""Twice As"", there's a lot of comfortable revivalism at work. (And if that's not late-1980s enough for you, check out the pitched-up integration of the spasmodic wah-wah loop that drove Public Enemy's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-JFHFDyqg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mind Terrorist</a>"" sneaking into the 808-punctuated ""Popgun"".) Wading through a lot of old-school signifiers and contending with the overarching feel of a two-decade retreat takes a bit of effort, but if you opt out of worrying your head over the nostalgic implications, you'll at least find some engagingly slippery beats driving the works.</p>
<p>Martyn's said that he's aimed for a sort of Paradise Garage feel to this set of songs, but the sense of uncanny vibe-catching perception and mood manipulation that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2465-larry-levan/"" target=""_blank"">Larry Levan</a> was legendary at doesn't entirely take here. There's plenty of intensity, some tracks filled with a bit more levity than others, but there's not a ton of immediate personality to this music. And as pastiche goes, its source material is done more justice than the artist's own back catalog-- which isn't a big loss if you care more about dancing than engaging with an artist's continuum of work. And as an extended buildup to the near-nine-minute closer, ""We Are You in the Future"", the first 10 tracks of <i>Ghost People</i> make for a good preparatory exercise. That last track might be the most audacious thing Martyn's pulled off to date, a stirring buildup to everything he's gleaned from a deep engagement with his classic techno and house heritage, all consolidated into one of those rare tracks that actually earns the overused descriptor ""epic."" If this album is Martyn's disengagement with 2-step and its descendents, even if it's only temporary, he's benefited from the breather.</p></div>"|15898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15898-martyn-ghost-people/|7.2|Nate Patrin

But what about those of us still holding the torch for <i>Psyence Fiction</i>, his insanely hyped, tragically flawed, and surprisingly enduring collaboration with James Lavelle as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4423-unkle/"" target=""_blank"">UNKLE</a>? With hindsight, the buzz surrounding that release seems quaint, but it came along during a time when CD storage towers were still proudly manicured physical manifestations of their owner's listening habits. Meaning it was worth sitting through all 13 false endings of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDLvYzZ0tB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lonely Soul</a>"" and the wackest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beastie Boys</a> verses ever put to wax because you certainly weren't getting peak performances from Kool G Rap, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/279-badly-drawn-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Badly Drawn Boy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a> on a single disc anywhere else. The good news then is that the bullishly titled <i>The Less You Know, the Better </i> finds Shadow back in that same mode of crowd-pleasing genre consumption. Problem is, you'll think it's even better news if you've still got that same exact CD collection from 1998.</p>
<p><i>The Less You Know</i> isn't really a record that has you asking ""What was he <i>thinking</i>?"" out of exasperation so much as genuine and concerned curiosity. After all, it's not like Shadow releases new music for any old reason. He puts out records sporadically and titles his albums like manifestos. And his collaborators seem to know they're not part of some tossed-off project-- even the singer-songwriter contributions here sound like they're deferentially acknowledging the boss. Like every DJ Shadow album, it's a statement of some sort.</p>
<p>But whether <i>The Less You Know </i> was intended to reestablish Shadow as a musician, as a producer, or even as someone with decent taste, he misfires on all counts. Judging from this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15525-i-gotta-rokk-ep/"" target=""_blank"">I Gotta Rokk</a> </i>EP, you could assume he had traded his turntables in for guitars and then decided to buy the turntables back. But as deep as his understanding of beat-driven music is, he's got a total tin ear for rock proper, and as such, and <i>The Less You Know</i> plays like a <i>DJ-Kicks</i> curated by a particularly unadventurous KROQ jock. Bad enough that the palm-muted guitar chug of ""Border Crossing"" finds Shadow trying to recreate <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4azhxMWmu48"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""She Watch Channel Zero!?""</a> by getting his fingers dusty digging in crates of Godsmack records. But as worrying as the conceptual aspect is, the execution is inexcusably half-assed for someone of Shadow's sample-chopping acumen. It's simply a <i>weak</i> guitar sound, the sort of RAT Distortion lick you can hear at the nearest Sam Ash, and like many of the cuts here, there's a perfectly decent 20-second intro that gets looped into becoming the entire track.</p>
<p>But as an instrumental, I suppose it's worlds better than the acoustic-slappin' folk-n-beats combo ""I've Been Trying""-- I envy those who hear it and can't immediately identify the Incubus song that sounds exactly like it (spoiler: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgT9zGkiLig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drive""</a>). You can call ""Sad and Lonely"" feminized blues haunted by CGI ghosts or whatever you choose; just know that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/"" target=""_blank"">Moby</a> tired of it nearly a decade ago. All of which is just a long way to say that <i>The Less You Know </i> is the kind of forward-thinking excursion that inevitably donates its sole hip-hop track to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/"" target=""_blank"">Talib Kweli</a>. Credit where it's due: at least he and Posdnuos resist the temptation to turn in ""Why Hip-Hop Sucks in 2011"", but over papery jazz-rap that could've been the softest track on any <i>Soundbombing </i> comp, the two kick the sort of polite, earnest, and flair-free 16s that come to them as effortlessly as college student union checks. The name of the track? ""Stay the Course"", of course.</p>
<p>Mind you, that's just the first half and before Shadow starts throwing out bleeding chum ostensibly meant to distract you from <i>The Less You Know</i>'s deep-seated and fundamental problems. Take the 28-second pit stop of ""Going Nowhere"" (""slowly we are getting nowhere, and that is a pleasure"") or the four minutes of Beat poetry that simply <i>had</i> to be included for comic relief or at least a preapproved mocking point for critics, a track called ""Give Me Back the Nights"". Funny thing about ""Nights"" is that it's actually the best thing here, a brief and haunted dub workout that earns a pretty cheap accolade of ""cinematic,"" but at least achieves its intended purpose. It works far better than ""Enemy Lines"", five interminable minutes of watery flange guitars and a vague awareness of witch house, or ""I Gotta Rokk"", whose glammed-up monotony actually has less to do with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a> than it does with the likes of Propellerheads, Freestylers, Wiseguys, or any other big-beat late adapter who owes their ad royalties to the invention of the word ""electronica.""</p>
<p>He at least hasn't lost his ear for drums-- the actual sound of the percussion on <i>The Less You Know </i> is often fantastic, all kinds of crisp snares and satisfying crackle giving you the hope that some intrepid beatmaker might be able to salvage some of this for his own devices.<span> </span>But outside of a good drumbreak, what is Shadow actually bringing to the table here? Featuring Yukimi Nagano, ""Scale It Back"" is the kind of cosmopolitan electro-pop that could just as easily have been a B-side on the latest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8133-little-dragon/"" target=""_blank"">Little Dragon</a> album.<span> </span>Unfortunately, the same applies to the Aqua Net stiffness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4531-tom-vek/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Vek</a>'s Flock of Seagulls rip ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12300-warning-call-ft-tom-vek/"" target=""_blank"">Warning Call</a>"", which could've just as easily have been an A-side on <i>his </i> last album. Which raises the question: Why does he care about these songs, when they deign to say so little?<span> </span>Better yet, why does he think you should?</p>
<p>Perhaps you've noticed that the word ""hyphy"" hasn't been used up until now, which some might take as a sign that <i>The Less You Know </i> simply <i>has</i> to be better than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9436-the-outsider/"" target=""_blank"">The Outsider</a></i>, his widely disliked excursion into Bay Area hip-hop that's aged about as well as, um, hyphy itself. But at least that showed some sort of interest in the contemporary, not to mention the balls to say he's moved on from <i>Endtroducing...</i>. And whether or not he's made one of the most influential electronic albums ever, I think Shadow has the right to be a working producer who doesn't have to show us how he feels about dubstep or Brainfeeder. After all, dude's on Verve, a label that certainly allows an artist the freedom to not give a shit about what the kids are into. But <i>The Less You Know </i> can't even be staunchly retro, or staunchly anything. Its only commitment is to a subtle antagonism, and it ignores pretty much any worthwhile development in pop, rock, electronic, or hip-hop music since the turn of the century.</p></div>"|15900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15900-the-less-you-know-the-better/|4.5|Ian Cohen

Critics (this one included) will tell you that it isn't just the best band Miles ever led, but one of the choicest small groups in jazz history. If you're not a jazz nerd, though, you may not know it existed. This is because the outfit-- rounded out by tenor saxist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams-- doesn't register on Miles' pop-cultural timeline. The group issued a string of brilliant studio LPs during its 1965-68 run, yet there's no <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Kind of Blue</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Bitches Brew</a></i> among them; by this period, Miles had pushed way beyond the sumptuously chilled-out sound of the former but hadn't arrived at the murky psych-jazz of the latter.</p>
<p>So if the Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams band (often called Miles' second great quintet, in deference to his stellar 1950s group) was transitional, a checkpoint between consensus masterpieces, why should you care that there's a new box set featuring previously unreleased live recordings from this time? Given that nearly every microphase of Davis' career has been expanded into box form by this point-- ask an expert before gifting a random one at Christmas-- casual consumers are right to be suspicious. But <i>Live in Europe 1967</i>, which presents five concerts from October and November of that year on three great-sounding CDs and one DVD, is no footnote: This set, Volume 1 in a new Davis <i>Bootleg Series</i> built on the Bob Dylan model, offers a chance to hear one of the greatest bandleaders of the 20th century push his collaborators into a creative frenzy and be pushed back in return.</p>
<p>Aside from Carter, each of these players would become giants of electric jazz (Davis and Hancock transitioned into something like pop stardom), and the period documented on this set represents their farewell to their bebop roots: both an ecstatic celebration and a ballsy deconstruction of how small-group jazz had been played for the previous two decades. <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> won't soundtrack any romantic dinners or inspire dorm-room acid trips, but it does show off the central thrill of jazz-- spontaneous interplay among dangerously skilled players-- as well as almost any other collection you could name.</p>
<p>That ""among"" is key. As much as this set testifies to the leader's own vision, the real takeaway is the virtuosity of other musicians, and how Miles' anti-hierarchical aesthetic spurred them toward the riskiest, most engaged performances of their careers. No player on this set reaches more than Tony Williams. A famously precocious drumming prodigy-- he first recorded with Miles in 1963 at age 17-- he was exactly the kind of daredevil Miles was looking for, a player naturally inclined toward pure outrageousness. (By 1967, he'd already explored cutting-edge improvisation on deeply unusual masterworks such as Eric Dolphy's <i>Out to Lunch</i>.) Williams is in particularly wired form here on the version of ""Footprints"" from November 2 in Copenhagen (disc two). During Miles' trumpet solo, the drummer casts himself as Donkey Kong to Davis' Mario, throwing out flaming barrels for the leader to navigate; Williams keeps time on the ride cymbal, but runs a near-constant interference pattern of asymmetrical fills and swelling cymbal flurries. (You can hear the legacy of Williams' pot-stirring percussion style, rarely better documented than on <i>Live in Europe 1967</i>, in players like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhoof</a>'s Greg Saunier, who loves to slide around a song's central pulse, sending bits of rhythmic shrapnel flying at his bandmates.)</p>
<p>As dazzling as Williams sounds, what really catches the ear is how the entire band provides the improvisational boldness that Miles was after. On the Copenhagen ""Footprints"", Herbie Hancock plays like a deranged outsider artist. Instead of providing a sturdy foundation underneath Wayne Shorter's saxophone solo, he offers squiggly little phrases, like jumbled fragments from a 20th-century classical score; on the outro, he answers the horn players' theme statement with a mocking paraphrase. Ron Carter, meanwhile, constantly reconfigures the piece's waltzing bassline, jumping between half-time and double-time, and mixing in percussive slaps and low, droney digressions.</p>
<p class=""p2"">These performances represent an upending of the soloist-and-background model of small-group jazz up to this point. Miles' second great quintet wasn't the first to play this way; by 1967, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"" target=""_blank"">Ornette Coleman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"" target=""_blank"">John Coltrane</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"" target=""_blank"">Cecil Taylor</a> had each exploded the conventions of 1940s and 1950s jazz in their own ways. Yet none of these other artists had figured out how to combine deep, risky interactivity with such sustained coherence. Many of the pieces on <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> play like cooperative action paintings, with everyone allowed but no one entitled to be the center of attention at any given time, and with the overarching logic of the compositions keeping chaos in check. It's at this stage, just before the quintet's dissolution-- over the next two years, as Miles engaged with electric jazz, Carter would exit, followed by Williams and Hancock-- that the conversation is at its most lively and lucid.</p>
<p>Crucially, though, freedom, as it was interpreted by this band, didn't always equal volume and density. Some of the strongest moments on <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> are also the calmest. During ""Masqualero"" from the November 6 Paris concert (disc three), as Miles plays a poignant, slow-building solo, Hancock settles into a haunting, repetitive figure and Williams quiets to a whisper, marking faint tempo on the hi-hat. Later, when Hancock's solo begins, Williams drops out entirely, leaving the pianist and Carter to play a delicate, free-floating duo. During the same set, on ""Walkin'""-- a staple of Davis' 50s repertoire-- Williams and Carter guide Shorter into an up-tempo frenzy and then gradually fade to silence. The saxophonist moves into a rare unaccompanied passage, playing an abstracted kind of bebop, full of tumbling phrases and murmuring digressions.</p>
<p>By late 1967, thanks in large part to John Coltrane (who had passed away in July) and mavericks such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"" target=""_blank"">Albert Ayler</a>, shrieking, high-density free jazz was in full flower. As you can hear in <i>Live in Europe 1967</i>'s many boldly stripped-down moments, Miles and his band were aiming for a different kind of freedom, one where aggression coexisted with near-stillness. Funk was in the mix too: During the October 28 ""Masqualero"" in Antwerp (disc one), Williams and Carter keep up an infectious Latin pulse behind the soloists, providing a danceable base for Shorter to tear off his heated phrases and also foreshadowing Davis' groove-based experiments, which would begin in earnest on 1969's <i>In a Silent Way</i>.</p>
<p>Miles clearly savored this band's broad dynamic and emotional range, and constructed its sets accordingly. Unlike the quintet's studio recordings, the concerts on <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> take the form of unbroken medleys. On four out of the five sets here, the tempestuous ""Footprints"", a Shorter original, segues into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2813-thelonious-monk/"" target=""_blank"">Thelonious Monk</a> favorite ""'Round Midnight"", which begins each time as a beautifully sparse dialogue between Davis and Hancock. Other transitions keep these long sets feeling brisk. In Antwerp, a lengthy version of Miles' hard-swinging, midtempo ""No Blues"", gives way to a turbulent three-minute sprint through Hancock's ""Riot""; in Paris, ""No Blues"" snaps into Shorter's moody, Spanish-inflected ""Masqualero"", a striking shift that immediately reengages the ear. <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> marks the first time we're hearing this band engage with such a wide range of material; a previous second-great-quintet live box, <i>The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965</i>, featured mainly well-worn jazz standards.</p>
<p>As much microscopic variety as there is in these shows, it's important to note that <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> documents a single tour with a more or less fixed set list. Davis did vary the repertoire occasionally-- trying out ""Walkin'"" and the standard ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" in Paris-- but buyers interested in a more diverse overview of what this band could do might be better off picking up one of their studio releases (<i>E.S.P.</i>, from 1965, and <i>Nefertiti</i>, recorded just a few months before the shows heard here, are both great starting points). Don't let the repetition scare you away, though. All five concerts here have their own rewards and idiosyncrasies; the best path through the box is to treat each segment like the concert it originally was and savor it individually.</p>
<p>The DVD, which documents two shows not featured on the CDs, is a sharp addition. There's a bit of arty treatment-- often two players appear superimposed in the same frame-- but on the whole, these are tasteful black-and-white concert films that put you in the midst of the onstage action. You see the youthful Williams bearing down fiercely on his ride, Shorter entering a closed-eyes trance while playing, and Hancock cocking his ear, tuning in to his bandmates' improvisations with genuine curiosity. And in the middle of it all is Miles: his usual, unflappable self. This is one of our last glimpses of the trumpeter in pre-psychedelic mode; the sequined pants and wraparound shades would arrive by 1969, as Miles flipped for Jimi and Sly and started co-billing with future rock legends at the Fillmore and the Isle of Wight, but here he sports natty suits (the sidemen wore tuxes), embodying the same model of 50s cool that won the trumpeter a mention in a 1960 <i>Esquire</i> <a href=""http://www.thematerialist.net/artofwearingclothes.html#5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">list</a> of ""Some of the Best-Dressed Men in the United States.""</p>
<p>That shift in fashion wasn't just superficial; Miles' music changed drastically in the period following <i>Live in Europe 1967</i>. LPs such as 1969's <i>In a Silent Way</i> and 1970's <i>Bitches Brew</i> are still some of the most compelling jazz-crossover experiments ever attempted. And Miles' sidemen would make equally important contributions to the movement that came to be known as fusion: Shorter with the vibrant Weather Report, Hancock with his funky Mwandishi and Headhunters bands, and Williams with Lifetime, one of the grittiest and heaviest of the early jazz-rock groups.</p>
<p>These impending transitions are part of why <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> is essential: You get to hear exactly how these virtuosos were behaving just before the big change occurred. They were still operating in an old mode, small-group acoustic jazz, but they were interrogating it relentlessly, seeing how far they could stretch its conventions without ditching them altogether. Before they could break into the larger world of pop, they had to reach jazz nirvana, and that's what they attain on <i>Live in Europe 1967</i>. The aesthetic here is less easily definable than those heard on <i>Kind of Blue</i> and <i>Bitches Brew</i>, but it's no less significant. At its heart, jazz thrives on bold, sensitive interaction in the moment, and <i>Live in Europe 1967</i> represents the pinnacle of that practice.</p></div>"|15887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15887-the-bootleg-series-volume-1-live-in-europe-1967/|9.0|Hank Shteamer

For a good chunk of the past two years, Cale has been touring a front-to-back performance of his 1973 chamber-pop masterpiece <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9356-paris-1919/"" target=""_blank"">Paris 1919</a></i>, the most enduring and beloved album amid his sprawling post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> discography. Naturally, the process of revisiting a specific body of work night after night can't help but exert some influence on an artist's subsequent move, and Cale is no different. However, in the case of the <i>Extra Playful</i> EP-- Cale's first release in six years, and a teaser for a new full-length coming in 2012-- the <i>Paris 1919</i> revival has seemingly inspired him not to revisit that album's orchestrated elegance, but to take a reactionary leap into the opposite direction, to further explore the deconstructed electronic productions and mechanized power pop heard on 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1228-black-acetate/"" target=""_blank"">Black Acetate</a></i>.</p>
<p>From an artist who's always evinced an adventurous spirit and sense of humor (however dry and dark it may be), the title <i>Extra Playful</i> is to be received as both a promise and a threat. The ideal here is a sort of absurdist, avant-garde take on adult-contemporary pop, feeding straight-forward, mid-tempo rock'n'roll songs and romantic balladry through synthetic sonics and alien frequencies. From the mellotron-like psychedelic textures that lend the endearing serenade ""Whadda Ya Mean By That?"" a woozy, weightless feel, to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA27aQZCQMk&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Scary Monsters</i>-esque freakazoid guitar squall</a> that rips through the android funk of ""Perfection"", Cale takes considerable glee in destabilizing his songs' structures. To wit, the Francophone-sung trip-hop flashback ""Pile a L'heure"" would sound right at home on some circa-1996 chill-out compilation, were it not for an unnerving background drone that provides a distant echo of Cale's viola-scraping on the Velvets' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Venus in Furs""</a>.</p>
<p>But Cale's sense of playfulness can degenerate into cringe-inducing silliness, as on ""Hey Ray"", which works the same <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Generation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beats</a>-plus-beats formula as <i>Black Acetate</i>'s equally ill-advised <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbHq-tcsUbc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Brotherman""</a>. As a satire of 1960s idealism, ""Hey Ray"" is actually pretty funny, as Cale plays call-and-response with his backing chorus, counting off each year from the decade before reducing it to a punchline: ""1967-- it's the golden age/ 1968-- and it's all over!” (Tellingly, he stops short of calling out 1969, effectively dismissing the year of Woodstock, Manson, and the lunar landing as just <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0mRfECsHrc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another year with nothing to do</a>.) As a song, however, ""Hey Ray"" is a sore-thumb irritant on an EP that otherwise carefully mediates between Cale's populist and deviant tendencies. That said, it's still guaranteed to be only the second <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7iWaJraAA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worst thing a former member of the Velvet Underground will release this year</a>.</p></div>"|15899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15899-john-cale/|6.0|Stuart Berman

Granted, it'd take the tinniest of ears to conflate Wolfe's music with the witch-house stylings of <a href=""http://matersuspiriavision.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mater Suspiria Vision</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28765-white-ring/"" target=""_blank"">White Ring</a>. Also, while her music is caustic and challenging in its own way, the semi-industrial loop-heavy <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/atelecine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aTelecine</a> runs laps around Wolfe in that department. Still, the image of her on the cover of <i>Apokalypsis</i> with whited-out eyes, coupled with her fondness for gothic and Greek typefaces, and choice of cover material (particularly her take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"" target=""_blank"">Burzum</a>'s ""Black Spell of Destruction""), makes her a perfect fit for Pendu's combination of high art/fashion/horror/goth signifiers (particularly of an early-to-mid-1970s, European vintage). The first track on <i>Apokalypsis</i> (""Primal/Carnal"") is a near-perfect apotheosis of this entire ideal, as Wolfe-- underneath a layer of static and fuzz that ages the clip by a good 20 years-- growls and gurgles like a woman literally possessed.  Once you move past this horrific introduction, though, <i>Apokalypsis</i> turns out to be a kind of book completely different from what its cover promises.</p>
<p>The title of the album refers to the Greek root of the world ""apocalypse,"" the root meaning ""lifting of the veil."" Folks not enamored with the way <i>Apokalypsis</i> was recorded-- an improvement only when compared to Wolfe's first album, <i>The Grime and the Glow--</i> might feel like the ""lo-fi"" vibe on some of these tracks is one veil too many, but that choice helps as much as it hinders. On ""Mer"", the first proper song on the album, the hazy film lends Wolfe's halting, fragmented thoughts an air of expectant mystery that's bolstered by the song's pensive rhythm. That veneer of mystery is less beneficial on ""Demons"", a straightforward track that's as close to actually sounding like a <i>Sister</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> outtake as anything made in the 21st century. Wolfe's uncanny mimicry of things musically goth-like doesn't end there. She's able to approximate the general pallor and stuttering sample-based rhythms of <i>Dummy</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a> (on ""Movie Screen""), makes like a superfan of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13487-the-spoils/"" target=""_blank"">The Spoils</a></i> (on ""The Wasteland""), apes early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a> (on the fittingly titled ""Moses""), and even recalls the icy allure and off-kilter harmonies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> (on ""Friedrichshain""). It speaks favorably to Wolfe's abilities that she's able to approximate all these different styles successfully, but these tracks don't say much about who Wolfe actually is.</p>
<p>The aforementioned ""Mer"" might take its cues from performers like Harvey or other like-minded singer/songwriters, but those potential influences are more fully integrated with Wolfe's actual voice.  The same goes for ""Tracks (Tall Bodies)"", a haunting ballad that features Wolfe imbuing a potentially heavy-handed line-- ""We could be two straight lines/ In a crooked world""-- with enough pathos to avoid any possible pitfalls. <i>Apokalypsis'</i> crowning achievement, however, is the album's penultimate track, ""Pale on Pale"". It's a turgid and powerful, metal-like processional fronted by lilting Gregorian-type chants that eventually turn shrill and cacophonous by the time the seven-minute track reaches its conclusion.  Its black-mass ambiance (coupled with its <i>de facto</i> coda, the ambient howl-laden ""To the Forest, Towards the Sea"") is the closest that <i>Apokalypsis</i> comes to realizing the foreboding, frightening airs that Wolfe's image and presentation promise.  It's also, not coincidentally, the closest that Chelsea Wolfe comes to sounding less like something else, and more like herself.</p></div>"|15893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15893-chelsea-wolfe-apokalypsis/|7.3|David Raposa

Where there once was little more than voice and guitar and a bit of keyboard, there are church organs and double bass and, at the end of ""Calm Down"", a gorgeous vibraphone solo, all swirling around Svanängen's high, lonesome vocals. Matching an intimacy of sentiment to a grandiosity of sound, the longing in Svanängen's throat seems palpable and piercing, and the rich orchestral arrangements he drapes over these tunes mostly serve to heighten Svanängen's matters of the heart. <i>Hall Music</i> may be Loney, Dear's most sumptuous-sounding record to date; its tender, plainspoken songs are just as humble and heartfelt as anything Svanängen's done. But their unguarded sentiments sometimes shrink under the weight of their ornate arrangements.</p>
<p>Opener ""Name"" turns ""I want your name/ I want your name next to mine"" into a mantra of devotion, its music starting small but swelling to match the accumulated emotion. The swarming music heightens Svanängen's lyrics. ""D Major"" starts out plaintive and pretty but slowly builds to a crescendo of Auto-Tune, while ""Loney Blues"" gracefully folds in glimmers of sound as it rolls along, lending the song a depth of feeling its semi-muffled vocals only half-express. Svanängen's long been fond of soft starts building to shimmering squalls, but on past albums, its been a flutter of synths and guitar rather than a tangle of brass and strings. When <i>Hall Music</i>'s flutter-by orchestrations run up against one of Svanängen's more heart-rending sentiments, there's a multiplying effect, the high drama of Svanängen's devotionals sent skyward.</p>
<p>But as often as they bolster Svanängen's pleas, these arrangements seem to crowd the songs themselves from the frame. Despite <i>Hall Music</i>'s expanded instrumental palette, Svanängen's songwriting style essentially hasn't changed much since his last LP, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12618-dear-john/"" target=""_blank"">Dear John</a>. </i>Svanängen still prefers to let a few words say what too many might muddle, doubling and tripling his oft-affected voice to send the central message of his songs straight through the chest cavity. But some of <i>Hall Music</i>'s grander instrumentations offer a lot for Svanängen's gentle voice to compete against, and occasionally it's just too much; the brassy ""Largo"" finds Svanängen duking it out with a tuba (and losing), while the slightly sour melody of ""Durmoll"" proves no match for its stabbing strings.</p>
<p>This newfound musical nuancé isn't at fault there; it's often the songs themselves, which can't always claim the same sort of depth. There's a track on <i>Hall Music</i> called ""My Heart"", and then, not too many songs later, another called ""Young Hearts"", which should tell you plenty. Love and the like have always been Loney, Dear's favorite subjects, but whether he's devoted or destroyed, the oft-puppydoggish Svanängen frequently falls back on familiar sentiments, leaving the in-between emotions for the music to handle. That, it often does, but even a stirring highlight like ""I Dreamed About You"" does little more than increase the drama behind its titular line over progressively swelling synths, and too often here, Svanängen's sweet nothings come up a little empty. For all the sonic strides Svanängen takes on <i>Hall Music</i>, he sometimes seems stuck singing the same sad song.</p></div>"|15895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15895-loney-dear-hall-music/|6.7|Paul Thompson

She had a richly gothic perspective honed by a rural upbringing and studies in philosophy, a background in opera conjoined with a taste for industrial music, and a scarred-yet-commanding voice. The albums and EPs she issued over the last couple of years were startlingly realized for such a young artist, but <i>Conatus</i>, a big record that keeps turning dark and strident,<i> </i>makes them seem like warning shots. Most traces of obscuring murk have burned away, so that every pock and ridge in the rugged, elemental music stands out distinctly. It's new wave mounted on a geological scale, where Danilova's solipsistic spirit-- ""I was able to communicate this universe that is my prison,"" <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/sep/22/zola-jesus-conatus-album-stream"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she said of ""Vessel""</a>-- assumes epic proportions. Her bouts of nihilism feel nervier and more bracing in the unforgiving light of sonic clarity. The closer she gets, the more enigmatic she's revealed to be.</p>
<p><i>Conatus</i> is mainly built from thundering toms, majestically revolving synthesizers, and warm courses of classical stringed instruments. ""I kept having these primal images,"" <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/now-playing-zola-jesuss-vessel/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she said of the music</a>, ""just quite strange landscapes and shapes I couldn't shake."" That may sound like a meaningless gloss, but on ""Swords"", the minute-long opening track, you can hear exactly what she means. Concussive drums and scrolling mechanical textures vividly evoke a terrain. Whatever biosphere you choose to project on it (I get <i>desert</i>), Danilova's voice remains fixed on a faraway horizon, receding as you approach. When she bursts into the foreground on ""Avalanche"" and stays there for the remainder of the album, the impression of impassable distance lingers. This is partly because of the authority of Danilova's voice, and partly because the music gives nothing away, thrumming along with power that shades into ambivalence toward the shifting emotional register of the singing. The results are dramatic but never melodramatic, as Danilova maps the dimensions of her self-imprisonment with resolve.</p>
<p>There has always been something almost subliminally idol-killing about the Zola Jesus project, and it really comes into focus here. Danilova's childhood opera aspirations are subverted into something nearly opposite. Opera singing is narrative and flows smoothly from deep within. Danilova is more allusive and tortuous. Her voice keeps getting caught in her throat, where it's stressed and twisted by transient emotional surges. Though the theatricality and the epic-pop trappings may evoke artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a>, the vocals have the passion of blues singing. Danilova is equally iconoclastic when it comes to industrial influences like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, finding ways to make abrasion as musical as possible without sacrificing tension. Her touchstones have been digested into a personal style that is much more substance than reference.</p>
<p>She has said that she struggled with the psychological pressures of opera singing. You could regard her early run of Zola Jesus recordings as a direct reaction against intricate formality and classical perfection: an eruptive loosening of strictures and simultaneous retreat into shadow. Though some may miss the rough and raw approach of her last two EPs, it's refreshing and exciting to hear music that relies on bone-hard essence rather than gauzy trimmings to create an aura of mystery. There's a newfound sense of purpose, as if, having tested her abilities, Danilova now understands exactly what she's doing.</p></div>"|15897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15897-conatus/|7.7|Brian Howe

No, the real reward is in being elevated to a position where your words suddenly carry some weight, where a simple endorsement can provide a career boost to an unsung forebear. In retrospect, MGMT's wiggy, divisive 2010 release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"" target=""_blank"">Congratulations</a></i>, was less a premeditated ploy to alienate their more casual fans than a noble attempt to turn them onto some of Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser's more eccentric influences, via songs named after cult heroes like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M30WPeyEY40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> and Television Personalities founder <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP7r7bRgBzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan Treacy</a>. And if but one of the 39 million people who've watched <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIEOZCcaXzE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ""Kids"" video on YouTube</a> was inspired to pick up a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a> record on account of seeing Pete ""Sonic Boom"" Kember's name listed in the <i>Congratulations</i> liner notes, then his producer's fee was worth it. (Likewise, when recently invited to perform a cover for Pink Floyd Week on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"", MGMT passed over the Floyd's deep well of FM-radio standards in favor of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckYRK8MFAaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Syd Barrett's menacing ""Lucifer Sam""</a>.)</p>
<p>That same charitable spirit more explicitly informs MGMT's curatorial contribution to the <i>LateNightTales</i> series, which draws evenly from obscure turn-of-the-1970s psych-folk, the more pastoral end of 80s post-punk and indie, and modern variations thereof. The tracklist is dotted with some notable avant-rock icons (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, Spacemen 3, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a>), but they're represented by serenely atypical tracks (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItbfBcm1Aik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ocean</a>"", ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOCOAUFWXX4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lord Can You Hear Me?</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzZNPyixNJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cheree</a>"", respectively) that serve to set up this compilation's more esoteric selections. And as if to further increase their aesthetic distance from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10761-oracular-spectacular/"" target=""_blank"">Oracular Spectacular</a></i>'s day-glo pop hits, the mood here is almost uniformly somber, if not downright ominous (hello there, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc_tSNivCgg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Frost</a>"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5411-the-chills/"" target=""_blank"">the Chills</a>). More so than previous participants in the series, VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take the <i>LateNightTales</i> concept at face value, weaving together their song choices into a dark-night-of-the-soul narrative heavy on themes of isolation and 4 a.m. introspection. Even the band's own contribution is a straightforward rendition of the one Bauhaus song (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4rqbs0vxK0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">All We Ever Wanted Was Everything</a>"") that perfectly suits this stoned-and-dethroned mood.</p>
<p>VanWyngarden and Goldwasser take great care to ease you into this despairing headspace, opening with the fortuitously timed inclusion of a track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15814-the-5-eps/"" target=""_blank"">the recently resuscitated Disco Inferno</a> (the gorgeously glistening ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYvqhZEb50"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can't See Through It</a>""), and offsetting more droll depictions of loneliness (the Television Personalities' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOCslEM8peM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stop &amp; Smell the Roses</a>"", Julian Cope's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNqtqi9MCX8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laughing Boy</a>"") with affecting instrumental interludes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1596-felt/"" target=""_blank"">Felt</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VyetoB0ZyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Indians</a>"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDyzOQuBm20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">For Belgium Friends</a>""). However, everything on this compilation feels like a set-up for and recovery from the harrowing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rX7hB-9Qd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drug Song</a>"" by Dave Bixby, a 70s-era Christian folk singer whose songs of spiritual reawakening are nonetheless colored with melancholy and regret; divorced from their born-again context, lines like ""How did I get this way/ It's so unreal/ I'm no longer a person/ I can't even feel"" seem especially resonant for a couple of guys who went from recording in their dorm room to suddenly finding themselves playing <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/30275171@N04/3158618292/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VIP parties at upscale department stores</a>.

It's easy to see the connection from his earlier life to his current solo work, for <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a> and other labels: His tracks are vibrant, ear-pleasing candy of the most licensable order, and his full-length albums have thus far stuck to a fairly simple formula: one or two big, dreamy, tastefully sun-kissed vocal house anthems selling the surrounding tangents into minimal techno.</p>
<p>If that doesn't sound like a golden ratio, you're right: While Gui Boratto's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9929-chromophobia/"" target=""_blank"">Chromophobia</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12843-take-my-breath-away/"" target=""_blank"">Take My Breath Away</a></i> are both solid, sometimes spectacular albums, you're most likely to have Boratto saved in your mp3 locker as a singles artist, best known for evaporating vocal tracks like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajWPpl2sDl0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beautiful Life</a>"", ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAqJVRS19s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like You</a>"", and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZiCvGFnpJ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Turning Back</a>"", or for his subtly percolating <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9418-total-7/"" target=""_blank"">Total 7 </a></i>instrumental ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y2W2-oSqOU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arquipélago</a>"". But while those remain his most breathtaking songs, such an appraisal does disservice to his deeper album material-- tracks that, once you stop hunting for the car-commercial hook, make for some pretty enveloping listening.</p>
<p><i>III</i>, Boratto's sensibly titled third album for Kompakt, follows the same pattern as his previous records, but it also pushes that balance between pop standouts and functionalist tracks further. Here, the vocal tracks are buried, both in terms of mixing and album sequencing, and instead the record emphasizes Boratto's range as a producer.</p>
<p>There is some range, and some real technical skill on display here. Album opener ""Galuchat"" comes on with a filter-swaddled melody that sounds borrowed from an early-2000s Morr Music artist-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2414-lali-puna/"" target=""_blank"">Lali Puna</a>, perhaps-- and which all but invites you to imagine a lyric over it. ""Stems from Hell"" and ""The Drill"" demonstrate Boratto's facility with darker, steamier techno-- all pneumatic pumping rhythms, ominous melodies, and grain-spitting synth sounds.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, two of the vocal tracks here, ""Striker"" and ""Destination: Education"", hew to a similar mood, more underlit-corner-of-warehouse nightclub than roof-down, coastal-highway cruising. More so than on any other Gui Boratto album, the moments of brightness seem to lift off out of a largely melancholy gray. It all culminates with the soft, steady thaw of ""This Is Not the End"", the best vocal track here, but also a rather Gui-by-numbers retread of its superior pop predecessors.</p>
<p>So if you're not already sold on Boratto as an album-length artist, <i>III</i> isn't likely to get you there. Worse than that, though, it doesn't have any a single exceptional track to add to the singles pile. Instead, it's another merely fine, expectation-meeting entry into Boratto's discography, a stopgap until the next knockout single comes along.</p></div>"|15892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15892-gui-boratto-iii/|6.4|Eric Grandy

On <i>Lose Today, </i>the implied eruptions never come, but always seem to be just over the horizon, creating a constant tension even when the pair sound comfortably stoned.</p>
<p>Much of that tension comes from an unlikely source: Young's bass, an instrument he hadn't played on record before Stare Case began in 2010. It's the center of the five songs here, and it's always slow and sparse, with plucks doled out like ominous ticks of a time bomb. On top of that heavy foundation, Olson spreads swaths of electronics and horns, while Young sings in a manner straighter and clearer than his more strenuous Wolf Eyes vocalizing. ""You never lost, 'cause you never wanted to/ But maybe you just never had a plan,"" he moans wearily on the title track, echoing the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"" target=""_blank"">Jandek</a> turns a few simple, lonely words into something thoroughly creepy and hypnotic.</p>
<p>Jandek may seem like lofty company to put Stare Case in this early-- <i>Lose Today </i>is<i> </i>technically their debut full-length. But they've already made reams of low-run cassettes and CD-Rs via Olson's American Tapes label. All that public woodshedding has honed their approach-- they've clearly grown into a fully formed entity rather than a side project. Olson in particular has become a deft sonic commentator. When he slyly inserts sax runs in ""Days Like Faces"", or sticks in small ripples of electronic noise during ""Bed That Eats"", he shows an uncanny knack for sounding loose and random at first, but remarkably precise on closer inspection. His interjections have a kind of storytelling feel, turning abstraction into narrative.</p>
<p>It's hard to guess what turns the Stare Case plot will take next. I've listened to a lot of their rumblings in the past year and have yet to tire of the way their music lurks and lurches around, like the unexplained creaks of a decaying house's dimly lit basement. It seems likely that they'll eventually unleash the loud detonations that <i>Lose Today </i>implies and previous releases have veered toward. The impressive patience that Olson and Young have exhibited so far has certainly earned them the right to fire away.</p></div>"|15890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15890-lose-today/|7.4|Marc Masters

While the leader of the Young Man project was studying English and French at Loyola, he took to YouTube to offer covers from bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a> and also posted a few originals. Bradford Cox found <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFynyCHdmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his version</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11202-rainwater-cassette-exchange/"" target=""_blank"">Rainwater Cassette Exchange</a>"" on YouTube, posted it on his blog, and called it superior to his original. Then came the signing to Frenchkiss and a 2010 debut EP; <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14553-boy-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Boy</a></i> was like a sunnier version of Cox's music. With the Deerhunter cover still somewhat fresh, it was easy to view <i>Boy</i> as ""the EP by 'Rainwater Cassette Exchange' cover guy.""</p>
<p>The internet doesn't forget that stuff. To some, Caulfield will always be that guy. But what can he do? Clearly, he's inspired by Cox and Noah Lennox, so some of his music clearly shows that influence. And sometimes, it's hard to ignore. On <i>Ideas of Distance</i>, his full-length debut, there are ghostly harmonies and fingerpicked guitars that at times evoke Cox's vibe (especially on ""Then and Now""). But it seems doubtful that Caulfield's intent was to be Lil' Bradford, and here he's added a few new wrinkles and veers into ambient territory. He told Spinner that around the time he recorded <i>Ideas of Distance</i>, he was ""almost exclusively"" listening to ambient music from artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Voigt</a>.</p>
<p>You can hear that influence percolating throughout the songs. Caulfield still has his guitar, but he uses synths to fill out a darker, more spacious, and more atmospheric sound than <i>Boy</i>. At times the mood is there, but the music has a hard time conveying emotion. ""Low"" features over four minutes of simple acoustic guitar licks, later accompanied by swelling horns and buried dialogue. It sounds pleasant, but again, there's no real build or pull to it. The volume picks up toward the end, but faraway screams and high notes from the horns don't do anything too compelling to pull the song out of its mundane flow. ""Only You"", which is mostly Caulfield's a cappella vocals, is the same story-- over four minutes without any tug. Static music has its place, but it it's a tough fit on an album driven by love and heartbreak.</p>
<p><i>Ideas of Distance</i> does have a more fleshed-out sound than <i>Boy</i>, and there are some compelling elements in play. ""Tired Eyes"", aside from leaning on a well-worn analogy between the end of a relationship and the end of a road trip, is a beautiful ballad with glitchy synths. ""Nothing"" features the best hook on the album, and its droplet synths and drum machine backing don't leave much room for empty space. ""Felt"" is over 10 minutes and uses pillowy synths and string sounds. The unadorned acoustic guitar in the last minute feels especially powerful. At moments like this, Young Man transcends easy comparisons.</p>
<p><i>Boy</i> was a set of cheerful bedroom recordings about being a kid, and you can hear Caulfield trying to run away from that sound. <i>Ideas of Distance</i> feels like an album about growing up. At times, the vague lyrics about love and the darker vibe sound like an affectation. It's Caulfield's first foray into more mood-driven territory, and it ultimately feels like a collection of pleasant sketches, unburdened by the need to resolve a sound or be especially deep.</p></div>"|15891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15891-young-man-ideas-of-distance/|5.5|Evan Minsker

In July of this year <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"">Gorillaz</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"">Damon Albarn</a> brought a group of producers to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in an attempt to forge some of those exchanges of his own. Along for the ride were <a href=""http://www.xlrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XL Recordings</a> boss Richard Russell, frequent Albarn collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"">Dan the Automator</a>, and self-styled ""R&amp;B concrete"" producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>. Over the course of five days, local musicians came and went, bringing with them various esoteric instruments and lending their vocals to different songs, while Albarn's producer-collective worked as a unit to fashion the finished product into <i>Kinshasa One Two</i>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/DRCMusicKinshasa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Video</a> from the recordings highlights the cross-cultural gap that needed to be bridged, with Albarn communicating via hand gestures and vocal inflections, and the rest of his team surrounding the local musicians with the ""winking lights"" of their digital gadgetry.</p>
<p>In a sense this is a more fully realized vision of the <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mali Music</a></i> project Albarn released in 2002. That record saw him gingerly feeling out whether harmony could be extracted through the osmosis of his trip-hop and pop-oriented outlook and the work of Malian artists including <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Afel+Bocoum"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Afel Bocoum</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Toumani+Diabat%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toumani Diabaté</a>. In contrast, <i>Kinshasa One Two </i>is a more confident recording, with Albarn still working outside his comfort zone but given little chance to think or breathe due to the self-imposed time limit on the project. All the colors feel a little brighter here, especially when the energy of the Congolese musicians is allowed to shine through. With so many people involved, both locally and from the imported crew of producers, it's no surprise that <i>Kinshasa One Two</i> feels unfocused at times. There's no underlying narrative or musical structure to this record; instead it's a grab bag of ideas and impulses, assembled as an approximation of the raggedy and lively way in which the recordings were conceived.</p>
<p>For much of this album, it doesn't feel like the two contrasting approaches solidify into a satisfying whole, with stems of ideas stretching out toward one another but never fully germinating. Instead, the focus gently rocks back and forth. At times (""Hallo"", ""African Space Anthem"") the gap between DRC Music and Gorillaz is negligible. ""Hallo"" comes across like this album's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/939-stylo/"">""Stylo""</a>, with its featherweight pop groove and Albarn's strained falsetto demonstrating his undeniable pop know-how. On ""K-Town"" the group moves closer to the exuberant Ethio-jazz swing of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Mulatu+Astatke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mulatu Astatke</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDC7oMOnmCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yègellé Tezeta""</a>, while ""We Come From the Forest"" leaps into a frantic pace via the great swoons of thumb piano that click and clack into place. The latter is a stark demonstration of the successes and failures of this project, where the bubbling electronics of Albarn's team become cursory and intrusive, causing the vigorous backbone laid out by Bokatola System (who surface four times on this album) to feel like it would work better in isolation.</p>
<p>So <i>Kinshasa One Two </i>often comes across an album that doesn't know what it wants to be, and that's mostly in keeping with the nature of the way it was conceived. But the raw power of the music from the region, which is presumably what attracted Albarn and his group to make this record, often feels curiously lacking in this context. Perhaps that's an inevitable consequence of mixing up these different styles. But the weak, Portishead-lite beats aren't missed when you hear the vocalist Love performing the song ""Love"" a cappella, and the ultra-distorted hidden track at the end of the album derives a brash charm from its coarse textures. The unshackled nature of those pieces makes the contributions of the Congolese musicians elsewhere on this record feel restrained. There's none of the unhinged joy you might find on a <a href=""http://www.sublimefrequencies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sublime Frequencies</a> recording like <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Group+Inerane"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Group Inerane</a>'s startling <i><a href=""http://www.sublimefrequencies.com/item.asp?Item_id=37&amp;cd=Group-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guitars From Agadez</a></i>, which causes it to feel like unnecessary restrictions were being imposed for the sake of balance between the musicians involved.</p>
<p>It's when the quest for equilibrium eases up that the quality rises a notch or two in either direction. The contribution of Washiba is barely detectable on the slamming, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2581-lfo/"">LFO</a>-circa-<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3og0oFiDO3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freak""</a> techno of ""If You Wish to Stay Awake"", while the softly spun groove of ""Lourds"" is pleasingly dominated by the forceful personality of Yende Bongongo. Occasionally successful collaborations arise, usually when the loopy impulses of both sides are fully indulged; the rattle and bump of ""Customs"" is particularly notable in that regard. But often it's hard to reconcile the songs here with the lively video clips from the sessions on the DRC Music <a href=""http://drc-music.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a>, and that's its central flaw-- a little spirit got lost along the way, somewhere between the performance and the final mastering, possibly due to the sheer weight of numbers involved in the recording process. Despite those reservations, <i>Kinshasa One Two </i>is worthwhile both as a cause (all proceeds from sales go to <a href=""http://www.oxfam.org.uk/oxfam_in_action/drcmusic.html?cid=Rdt_drcmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oxfam</a>) and as an experiment, albeit one that requires some judicious editing to extract the tracks that really count.</p></div>"|15874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15874-kinshasa-one-two/|6.8|Nick Neyland

It was rambunctious enough for kids who craved the caffeinated buzz of punk rock at its catchiest. It was also tender enough for kids who loved hearing their own human-sized romantic foibles reflected in indie's everyperson approach to the love song. <i>Foolish</i> can be plenty fast and plenty noisy, but it skips the meathead aggression that's a nasty side effect of so much fast and noisy music. It's unafraid of getting down to personal angst, but smart enough not to get all gross and mawkish about it. It was made by a group who could have walked off stage and gone to their day jobs without having to change out of their Rock Band costumes. These are the kind of songs about bad breakups, worse parties, and lonely walks home that you and three of your friends might have written.</p>
<p>Except you probably wouldn't have, or couldn't have. Like a lot of early-90s indie music, <i>Foolish</i> still projects a D.I.Y. spirit, a welcoming vibe of accessibility, community, small-scale ingenuity. But there's nothing about the album that really says ""anyone can do this."" In fact, it still sounds like a major statement, albeit one from a self-effacing band. You knew from ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c_GX2CYkcQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slack Motherfucker</a>"" that Superchunk would not be destined to play college-town gigs for a couple of years and then disappear. They were just more driven than the bulk of their contemporaries, a work ethic that's pretty obvious from at least album no. 2 onward. You don't come up with that many intense and memorable choruses, or play that tight, thanks to luck. And while they had an anti-pretentious streak that was a godsend in the messianic years of grunge, <i>Foolish</i> is where the band's ambition really blossomed for the first (but not the last) time, a dozen songs that turned small-town heartbreak into loud and weirdly triumphant anthems.</p>
<p>A big part of that is the <i>sound</i> of <i>Foolish</i>, and how that sound perfectly complements the more adventurous songs. But then, despite their rep as a smoking live act who do their best to simply translate that vibe in the studio, Superchunk have always had a real knack for picking the right producer for a specific set of songs, almost from the start. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Albini</a>'s typically unembellished recording on 1991's <i>No Pocky For Kitty</i> accentuated the wiriness of its very frantic tunes. John Reis added an almost claustrophobic, garage-rock intensity to the rawer set that would make up 1993's <i>On the Mouth</i>. Those albums weren't exactly static, though they did get a lot of mileage out of punk's joyful bashing. But <i>Foolish</i> is very much a big-canvas album, full of stark, quiet-loud shifts, songs with more breathing room, and grander peaks.</p>
<p>Given that producer Brian Paulson's the guy who recorded <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Spiderland</a></i>, he seems to have been the perfect choice to give <i>Foolish</i> the appropriate weight and ferocity. Mac McCaughan and Jim Wilbur's guitars on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqbA263yZA&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The First Part</a>"" clang and scrape as fiercely as any of the post-hardcore bands coming out of D.C. at the same time. But there's also a real bottom-end under all that trebly attack, the kind missing from most classic indie albums of the period, give or take the similarly minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/123-archers-of-loaf/"" target=""_blank"">Archers of Loaf</a>. Paulson keeps things crisp and booming in the low-key moments, going full-tilt when the band decides to get loud. Painful examinations of an exhausted relationship, like ""Keeping Track"" and ""Revelations"", start out at a slow-burn and build to a thrilling climax or three, the wave of feedback coming almost as a relief after all that pensive tension. <i>Foolish</i> is a heavy album, musically and emotionally. But it's also never a drag. That controlled sense of pacing extends not just across the songs but the whole album. There's still plenty of that old joyful bashing, the caustic moments balanced by speed and sweetness. Heart-punching breakup songs like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNNaIGq4IMI&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Driveway to Driveway</a>"" are also bright shout-alongs.</p>
<p>This remaster sounds just fine to me, maybe a little louder in the top end as usual, though my much-played and more-than-a-decade-old CD copy also sounds plenty fine. The real benefit is that <i>Foolish</i> is once again available on vinyl; while clearly aimed at longtime fans, the newly appended live set and handful of other bonuses are still largesse on the part of Merge, one the few labels that actually bothers to include something of value if you're going to repurchase an album you've already owned in multiple formats. But the original album remains the main draw, especially if you just came onboard with last year's swift and colorful and totally fun <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14642-majesty-shredding/"" target=""_blank"">Majesty Shredding</a></i>. This is probably the darkest album Superchunk ever made, but however serious <i>Foolish</i> gets, there's always more of the giddy thrill of hearing a group friends who sound like they're having a blast playing together, even if they're also pushing themselves to go further, giving the songs that much more all-or-nothing intensity than everyone else around them.</p></div>"|15889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15889-foolish/|8.8|Jess Harvell

Sharing a name with both an Elvis Costello song and a jangly 1980s New Zealand indie-pop group, the four-song EP was little-noticed by Americans at the time, but it marked a turning point for their city's music scene. Blending Fredrik Lindson's yearning vocals and chiming guitar chords with Torbjörn Håkansson' pattering percussion, euphoric electronics, and occasional exotic sample or two, the record had more in common with the twee-meets-house hybrids of early-1990s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Etienne</a> than with any record of its period-- even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"" target=""_blank"">the Avalanches</a>' similarly balmy, ambitious <i>Since I Left You</i>. By the end of the 2000s, echoes of the Embassy's aesthetic could be found in critically acclaimed albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"" target=""_blank"">Jens Lekman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">the Tough Alliance</a> (who named their imprint, <a href=""http://sincerelyyours.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sincerely Yours</a>, after an Embassy song), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"" target=""_blank"">Studio</a> (ditto for their Information imprint), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27763-jj/"" target=""_blank"">jj</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5554-the-honeydrips/"" target=""_blank"">the Honeydrips</a>, among others. Gothenburg's indie pop scene was now run by mysterious pranksters all too happy to tie the already thin line between sincerity and artifice up in sailing knots.</p>
<p><i>Life in the Trenches</i> contains 13 hard-to-find tracks, most of which haven't appeared on an album. The set has a gleaming surface-level appeal, with the meticulous production and bountiful melodies that are to Sweden what beer is to Milwaukee. This music's vibrant lushness is most evident on the two newest tracks, the stoic strummer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pna_ZseA88k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Tend to Forget</a>"" and loping fake-it-til-you-make-it manual ""St8"", both 2009 singles--  a woman's soft moan, a vaguely African vocal snippet, or a bit of oceanic echo converts fairly simple songs into endlessly replayable tracks. But there's a fragile, unfiltered quality to Lindson's contributions, in particular, that keeps the atmospheric prettiness from lapsing into wallpaper. Slick craftsmanship? Raw expression? The Embassy reinforce how moot such questions can be.</p>
<p><i>Life in the Trenches</i> also embodies most of the contradictions that make the Embassy so beguiling. The impression of earnest sensitivity that makes you want to pat the guys on the head often gives way to a mischievousness that leaves a not-unpleasant sensation that you're being had. Subtitled ""The Other Side of 2001-2011,"" the album sure gives the impression of being a rarities compilation, but one of the songs, ""Information"", appeared on the second of the band's two highly recommended full-lengths, 2005's <i>Tacking</i>. Then there's 2004 single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyzYWBTXA4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flipside of a Memory</a>"", which starts with a guitar part that's jarringly similar to Nirvana's bone-simple ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabnZ9-ex7o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Come as You Are</a>"" riff, then builds it into a shiny electro-pop stomper about old love-- vague and vaguely familiar but no less affecting for either. Whether venturing into synth-drenched instrumentals (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1ptNtJl20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Puttgarden</a>""), dubwise hip-house (""Heathrow""), or distorted electro-rock (""No Thanks""), <i>Life in the Trenches</i> rarely keeps its simple pleasures as simple as they may at first appear. If these guys were handing out Halloween candy, you'd check it for syringes.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Embassy look finally poised to capture some of the attention they were too early for the first time around. Elements of their cryptic presentation and polished yet slightly warped sonics can be heard across the indie pop spectrum, and the press materials for <i>Life in the Trenches</i> hint at potential new Embassy recordings in the near future. In the meantime, it's worth seeking out <i>Tacking</i> and 2002's <i>Futile Crimes</i> (itself a likely inspiration for the Tough Alliance title ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn5D3msfAUk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Silly Crimes</a>"") to get a fuller glimpse of the duo's style. As for the <i>Sneaky Feelings</i> EP, the only copy I can find online is selling for upwards of $100, and the other non-album releases compiled here aren't much easier to track down. So for those of us who prefer to own our music in tangible form, <i>Life in the Trenches</i> is the best chance many listeners have had to acquaint themselves with these overlooked architects of some of the past decade's best new sounds.</p></div>"|15812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15812-life-in-the-trenches/|8.0|Marc Hogan

Since then, they've slimmed down to one member, Stefanie Franciotti, who returns with an upgraded full-length debut that plays like a shoegaze record for a generation reared on <i>The NeverEnding Story</i>.</p>
<p>Franciotti's sound hinges on her dual interest in highly textured pop and errant noise. On the project's early tracks, those elements resulted in a sound that was aimless and a little soupy, if still pretty. Here, Franciotti is able to create a dynamic contrast by giving equal prominence to each, alternating between new wave-indebted slow-dance jams and experimental tracks that range in tone from sublimely ambient to jagged and far-out. This puts Franciotti in the company of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"" target=""_blank"">Peaking Lights</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Araw</a>, and while she's not as cosmically bent as either, she's making the same kind of escapist music that, at its best, can feel transportative.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the album's song-oriented material is the most memorable. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16259-romantic-streams-romantic-streams-balam-acab-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Romantic Streams""</a>, ""Casual Diamond"", and highlight ""Stickers"" are peppered with space-age chimes and melting glissandos that feel grounded and organic. And despite all the machine noise, Franciotti's vocals feel approachable and human. Though her singing is sometimes unremarkable, at times sound like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar (this is a compliment). At these moments, <i>Forever</i>'s frozen lullabies provide mix immediate gratification with a hint of mystery.</p></div>"|15858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15858-sleep-over-forever/|7.0|Zach Kelly

Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti's <a href=""http://www.luomomusic.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luomo</a> is nominally his ""house"" project (as distinct from excursions into stripped-back dub-techno or fractured ambience) but to date it has consistently flirted with an <i>idea </i>of house-- as feminine, gentle, lovelorn, ostentatiously emotive-- quite distinct from the often quite blunt realities of the genre. <i>Plus</i>, then, is Ripatti's first album of house <i>qua </i>house: specifically the cooler, big-room sound of tech-house circa 2006, equal parts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2890-michael-mayer/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Mayer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>.</p>
<p>If Luomo's previous work often could feel like the sound of the ""body speaking"" (to steal the title of one of his best tracks), the colder and harder surfaces of <i>Plus</i> are positioned between the body and the dancefloor, less the sound of movement than the sounds that <i>make </i>you move. Song takes a backseat to groove: while most of the tracks here feature gentle ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWTUt2RZh0&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Computer Love</a>""-style male vocals (courtesy of the Chicago Boys), they are less the music's emotional center than a framework around which Ripatti can weave his typically intricate, hypnotic arrangements. Only on the fragile, trebly new wave of ""Form in Void"" and the seductive schaffel of ""Immaculate Motive"" does Ripatti gesture toward the glittering disco-pop of his prior work.</p>
<p>This feels like a deliberate aesthetic shift. Previously, many of Luomo's finest tracks featured late-blooming hooks that would carry the tune's second half in euphoric or melancholy new directions. By contrast, the best moments on <i>Plus </i>tend to turn inward, homing in on the beat until its urgency is almost too close to your ears. The effect can be like sitting in the front row at the cinema, the peripheral details of melodic color and vocals overwhelmed by the abstract throb of the hyper-percussive, multi-tiered groove. In particular, the massive climaxes of ""How You Look"" and especially ""Make My Day"" (by some distance the album's finest moment) feel designed to burn out your senses with an overload of physical intensity.</p>
<p>These tracks stand and fall on their own robust physicality: ""Happy Strong""<i> </i>features an inane vocal hook and almost no melody to speak of, but its immense, banging groove (all slamming snares and delectable hand-clap counter-rhythms) makes it an album highlight. Only on ""Good Stuff""<i> </i>does Ripatti's new aesthetic veer off course entirely, spending nine minutes trying but failing to achieve lift-off through chattering Chicago-house revivalism. Here, the groove isn't compelling enough to distract from the perfunctory song it props up.</p>
<p>If <i>Plus </i>ultimately is only the fourth-best Luomo album (after 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12390-convivial/"" target=""_blank"">Convivial</a> </i>and certainly Ripatti's peerless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/"" target=""_blank"">first</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4928-the-present-lover/"" target=""_blank"">two</a> albums under the moniker), it's because maintaining that level of intensity across entire tracks, let alone a whole album, is near impossible, while the moments in between the peaks no longer can coast on the singularity of the producer's sound. The less-exciting stretches on previous albums at least might have boasted a bruised-sounding bassline or delicately mutated vocal harmonies to establish a sense of unity with the climaxes. On <i>Plus</i>, the periods in between the climaxes can slip more easily into the category of fine-- but rather less-distinct-- German-sounding tech-house.</p>
<p>The importance of this criticism depends on how invested you are in house as dancefloor music first and foremost: Ripatti's music demands to be judged purely on the terms of the genre it inhabits, and the way that genre interacts with the bodies of dancers. If you come looking for house with an obvious point of difference, this decision seems puzzling, but if you're prepared to forget the name ""Luomo"" and simply lose yourself in the groove, then <i>Plus </i>is as involving and engaging as any dance music you'll hear this year.</p></div>"|15883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15883-plus/|7.8|Tim Finney

Things got heated, ""spit [was] flying,"" and Bay stormed off set. Whatever this incident tells us about Michael Bay (like maybe he's just really impassioned in his opinion that <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3314-let-it-die/"" target=""_blank"">Let It Die</a> </i>was a better record), it tells us even more about where we're currently at, culturally speaking, with <a href=""http://www.listentofeist.com/metals/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a>. Even among Hollywood titans, she's divisive. She has probably, over the past couple of years, helped an infinite number of jocks and action stars get in touch with their latent emotions (""It's a little feminine,"" LaBeouf <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/entertainment/la-ca-shia-labeouf-20110626"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> of ""Brandy Alexander"", ""but it touches me""). But most importantly, the low croon of her honeyed, creaky-door voice has become pop culture shorthand for ""the diametrical opposite of what robots blowing shit up sounds like.""</p>
<p>And yet, her third album, <i>Metals</i>, is full of dynamic outbursts. There's the chorus of austere, male shouts that punctuates ""A Commotion"", the towering, climactic swell of strings in ""Anti-Pioneer"", and plenty more folk-pop numbers that begin small but explode suddenly into stomping, hollering, densely peopled jamborees. Building on some ideas she first explored in <i>The Reminder</i>'s lively take on the folk traditional ""Sealion"", <i>Metals</i> is a record animated with, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/interviews/"" target=""_blank"">as she put it</a>, ""the movement of a lot of humans."" Though her least immediate album-- it lacks <i>The Reminder</i>'s pop showstoppers or the charm of <i>Let It Die</i>'s restless genre-hopping-- <i>Metals</i> is a vivid evocation of a place that touches on fittingly vast themes about nature, love, and life itself.</p>
<p>To record <i>Metals</i>, Feist-- along with her trusty producers Chilly Gonzales and Mocky (who've been working her since she was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3271-peaches/"" target=""_blank"">Peaches</a>' hypegirl back in early-2000s Toronto)-- headed out to Big Sur and built a studio on the side of a cliff. All the things you might associate with the area (majestic expanse, outdoorsiness, and Kerouac-sized spiritual interrogation) seep into <i>Metals</i>' sound, which conjures panoramic vistas with quiet ease. String and brass arrangements (the latter of which heavily feature avant-saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>) are omnipresent but never overworked: check out the way they briefly balloon into the frame toward the middle of ""Anti-Pioneer"" and then gracefully recede a moment later. <i>Metals</i> is invested in subtle, textural detail and shifting dynamics; it sometimes stays so quiet that a whole flock of birds would feel compelled perch on it, and then in the next breath it does something surprising enough to send them scattering in a flurry.</p>
<p><i>Metals</i> is the <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1518812/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meek's Cutoff</a></i> of Feist records, both in the way it eschews the traditional rules of the crowd-pleasing blockbuster, and also because there's a lot of talk about pioneers and mountains. Nature imagery is everywhere: the serene meditation ""The Circle Married the Line"" escapes the busy squiggles of modern life (""I'll head out to horizon lines/ Get some clarity oceanside"") by boiling down a sunset to its simplest geometric forms, while the gorgeous acoustic number ""Cicadas and Gulls"" takes flight: ""The land and the sea/ Are distant from me/ I'm in the sky."" <i>Metals</i> displays a shift in Feist's perspective as a songwriter; after <i>The Reminder</i> she's said she's now less interested in writing songs that could be read as intimate and personal but instead crafting lyrics that read almost like sparse proverbs. (She's likened some of the lines on <i>Metals</i> to ""adages and morals that you find embroidered in junk shops."") The resulting tracks feel universal, and not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15285-apocalypse/"" target=""_blank"">Apocalypse</a></i>, in their attempts to use the contrast the elegance of the things around us with the weird, erratic ways of human beings.</p>
<p>And now to address the break-dancing, earbud-wearing, silhouetted elephant in the room: there's no ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABYnqp-bxvg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1234</a>"" on this record. In fact, though it's by no stretch a difficult album, <i>Metals</i> feels deliberately uninterested in courting pop audiences or crafting easy hooks, which is why it feels like such a refreshing and slyly badass statement of artistic integrity. At the same time, this is also the reason it doesn't reach <i>The Reminder</i>'s heights. It's a bit too even-keeled to incorporate the sense of pastiche that made her earlier two records so exciting.</p>
<p>Side B's most exquisite highlight is ""Anti-Pioneer"", a song that Feist started working on 10 years ago but could never quite capture to her liking on tape. Here, she got it so right: An unhurried guitar lick and the bluesy gust of her vocals roll like tumbleweeds over a minimal soundscape as she sings about a woman who was used to moving but, ""for a year,"" set down her roots and ""was anti-pioneer."" A touring musician since her teens, Feist has spent the past 15 years more or less on the road, so it's hard not to read these lines as autobiographical. But the chorus brings in the universiality, applying that sense of restlessness to a healthy creative process: ""When the flag changes colours/ The language knows."" It's a fitting statement about <i>Metals</i>, and Feist herself-- shifting between moments of repose and restless explorations of new frontiers. <!--EndFragment--></p></div>"|15878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15878-feist-metals/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

The music was so animally energetic that it took me a while to realize how off-base this early impression had been. But while those free-jazz shamans embraced volatility, Stetson is much more aligned with minimalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>, which is to say that he restricts himself and knows exactly where he's going. Glass' longtime saxophonist Dickie Landry, whose excellently mellow 1977 album <i>Fifteen Saxophones</i> was <a href=""http://www.unseenworlds.net/UW06/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reissued earlier this year</a>, provides an intriguing precedent. Landry was a member of the Philip Glass Ensemble who played on <i>Music in Twelve Parts</i>, a piece whose <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2euBS6YzrK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">edge-of-madness harmonic grind</a> is in full force on <i>Those Who Didn't Run</i>. The title's whiff of courageous endurance gets more and more apt as Stetson pulverizes daisy-chained squalls for 10 minutes at a time, in two uncompromising arcs that exclude the airier respites of <i>Judges</i>.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"">Bryce Dessner</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4779-glenn-kotche/"">Glenn Kotche</a>, Stetson adeptly straddles pop and the academy. And like Merrill Garbus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"">tUnE-yArDs</a>, a big part of his magnetism derives from a combination of unusual music and bold feats of physical daring. A one-man polyphony machine, Stetson sets his feet in a resonant room and wires himself up like a cyborg, with microphones on the walls, all through his bass sax, and on his throat. Pointedly ignoring decades' worth of looping and overdubbing technology, he blows the bejeezus out of arcane contrapuntal variations over and over again, with phantom sounds gathering around the deep pulse. The music seems weirdly sentient because only the continuous cycle of breath pumping through it keeps it alive.</p>
<p>You wonder why Stetson doesn't just turn blue and fall down, and how one instrument can make so many different noises at once. Circular breathing accounts for the former (Stetson must play a mean didge) while inventive mixing accounts for the latter. The clack of keys becomes an insistent rhythm track, microphone signals fry into ambient ozone, and ghost voices reverberate through the reed. Not only does this technique make brainy variations feel hot and haunted, but it gives us a fresh vantage on the saxophone itself. Though it plays a highly respectable role in jazz, the instrument takes on cheesier cultural baggage as you move outward, from marching bands to soft pop to <a href=""http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/SNL-Digital-Short-The-Curse/1198000"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sergio</a>. By enlarging the inner workings of the sax, Stetson demolishes clichés to unleash fresh, unexpected energies. It's like being inside an enormous brass tunnel full of windy byways and slamming valves, at once exhilarating and frightening.</p>
<p>Here, Stetson pits the low end versus the high; granular texture versus crystalline purity; deep, earthy groove versus high, watery shine. On the A-side, grungy riffs churn over a thumping substructure of bass and key action, and on the B-side, the bottom falls out and we're transported to a completely different world, one cleansed of heavy metal and drone-rock traces. Stetson's horn spirals through an upper-register series of intervals that seem to be trying to wrench themselves free of each other, and the disparity between prettiness and conflict is riveting. Though this EP plows a narrower row than <i>Judges</i>, Stetson still manages to show us two very different aspects of his visceral minimalism. The only downside for me is that his music really thrives on accumulation, which is to say that it thrives in longer formats. I suspect that this EP serves as a palate-cleanser for the final volume of the <i>New History Warfare</i> trilogy, clearly polarizing Stetson's impulses for incantatory force and eerie beauty before drawing them back into a complex whole.</p></div>"|15876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15876-those-who-didnt-run/|7.8|Brian Howe

But if the Berlin duo has never been entirely easy to categorize-- hip-hop with techno sensibilities or vice-versa, with recent forays into all-purpose <i>et cetera</i>-step (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14975-modeselektor-presents-modeselektion-vol-01/"" target=""_blank"">Modeselektion Vol. 01</a></i>)-- it helps quite a bit that they've never been self-serious purists. As it happens, their new album, <i>Monkeytown</i>, should benefit from the fact that there's still a boom market for nebulously connected circles of ""bass music."" Listening selectively, it's pretty easy to hear Modeselektor picking up on some post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> signifiers.</p>
<p>Opener ""Blue Clouds"" seeps out like a slightly more placid take on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/"" target=""_blank"">Cosmogramma</a> </i>highlight ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14057-and-the-world-laughs-with-you-ft-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">...And the World Laughs With You</a>"", swapping out its frantic, future-junglist breaks for a less-cluttered rhythm and letting the synths simmer instead of boil. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"" target=""_blank"">Busdriver</a> feature ""Pretentious Friends"" rides off a buzzing throb that fits the MC's wiseass art-rap credentials well, though the most interesting sonic tweaks-- and maybe the most disorienting ones-- are all the hitches and hiccups and pitch-warps that they embed into his voice, like a mangled stretch of magnetic tape that can't quite find the right tracking. ""Humanized"" is a nauseatingly wobbly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/104-anti-pop-consortium/"" target=""_blank"">Anti-Pop Consortium</a> team-up teeming with winking, retro-space-age analog noise.</p>
<p>And the highest-profile cosign comes in the form of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a>; ""Shipwreck"" and ""This"" highlight his ability to sound more emotionally compelling the more his voice is dissected. The former track's ramped-up, nervous-twitch ambience and the latter's massive yet isolated empty-arena echo both loop snatches of half-formed words and phrases into hypnotic swells that are bobbed and tossed by roiling, skittering rhythms-- it's heady stuff, easy to sink into.</p>
<p>But don't look for that sort of <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a>-like atmosphere to run through the whole album-- there are more than a few tracks that refuse to let <i>Monkeytown</i> be defined by a single operating motive. ""Evil Twin"" in particular busts out a more straightforward take on techno, bumping a 4/4 beat that's as upfront as some of the glitchier tracks are evasive. ""German Clap"" flirts with UK-funky rhythms in a way that seems to beg from a titular scene of its own, ascending synth chords clashing against descending, liquid-burble bass.</p>
<p>The club tracks, the more experimental IDM-skewing cuts (""Blue Chords""), and the Yorke collaborations form their own kinds of peaks, but Modeselektor pull off accessible, pop-friendly stuff just as well. Hearing Miss Platinum go from disconnected voice-chopping to euphorically harmonizing with herself on ""Berlin"" gives the slow-ride electro-R&amp;B groove some real gravity, especially when all those parts finally reassemble into her untouched human voice for the hook. And even if the delicate melodrama of ""Green Light Go"" seems a bit too self-serious amidst an otherwise playful and energetic collection of songs, it still builds tension in a way that manages to sell its wistfulness as something legitimate. The album may be scattershot, but perhaps that doesn't matter so much when it's delivered out the barrel of a 12-gauge.</p></div>"|15867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15867-modeselektor-monkeytown/|7.4|Nate Patrin

Knowing that they were championed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5046-frightened-rabbit/"" target=""_blank"">Frightened Rabbit</a> on MySpace and then signed to <a href=""http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/index.php?"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FatCat</a> would have you believe that they're similarly aligned as scrappy, heart-on-sleeve romantics. And yes, their 2009 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13136-these-four-walls/"" target=""_blank"">These Four Walls</a></i>, delivered on that notion, however intermittently. But based on the name <a href=""http://wewerepromisedjetpacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Were Promised Jetpacks</a>, you might think they're a hyper-stimulated and wordy post-hardcore/emo act too. That's also kinda true. Shuttling between the sound of weathered, masculine brooding and the lyrical sentiment of immobilized, teenage pining, they're something of a genre of one that's managed to sound perfectly compatible as an opener for both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/"" target=""_blank"">Twilight Sad</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Eat World</a>.</p>
<p>There was hope that <i>These Four Walls</i>, like most overeager and uneven debuts from killer live acts, was a dry run for inevitable greatness once their execution caught up with their energy. And yet, while more focused in just about every way conceivable (no more eight-minute songs with glockenspiels), <i>In the Pit of the Stomach</i><i> </i>can't seem to move things forward,<i> </i>weirdly sitting in a purgatory of sounding like an anthemic rock record without the actual anthems.</p>
<p>Feeling stuck is certainly something WWPJ identify with. As with <i>These Four Walls</i>, the pervading feeling expressed on <i>In the Pit of the Stomach</i><i> </i>is foretold by its title: a sense of jittery readiness as reaction to the unease of being trapped inside yourself. Fittingly, WWPJ's musicianship sports the tightly-coiled motions of someone trying to bust out of restraints-- drill-like riffs and insistent hi-hats are punctuated by short, almost epileptic bursts of distortion and drum rattle. Despite the roomy lengths and arena aspirations of these songs, Peter Katis' strapping production casts WWPJ as meticulous and muscular post-punk militants at their core. Though they don't aspire to the jackbooted combativeness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29071-wu-lyf/"" target=""_blank"">WU LYF</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>, Thompson's melodies do have an orderly, call-and response aspect to them.</p>
<p>And yet this newly disciplined sound mostly reveals a band that has the earnest diligence of foot soldiers but not the spark of leadership. Catharsis is something they just don't have the patience for, and <i>In the Pit of the Stomach</i><i> </i>blasts out of your speakers from ""Circles and Squares"" and never yields, buzzing constantly rather than building toward moments of rabble-rousing revelation.</p>
<p>While posing as assaults, ""Medicine"" and ""Picture of Health"" ingratiate their jagged hooks subtly through insistent repetition. But elsewhere, WWPJ typically treat verse-chorus structure like a straitjacket with the longer instrumental passages feeling just as maxed-out for radio readiness: first single ""Act on Impulse"" patiently works through some pretty, post-rock guitar figures during its build-up to the verse, yet it ends five minutes later without reaching any kind of gratification-- it's just a single with an unusually long intro. The LP's one true blowout comes halfway through ""Sore Thumb"", and it requires a preceding production trick where you hear Thompson's voice, stripped of all studio treatment, sounding like he's doing practice takes in a hallway. I've heard this done on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"" target=""_blank"">Snow Patrol</a> records. And while I get the feeling ""Pear Tree"" was intended as an epic, exhaustive closer because it's six minutes long, it draws to a close pounding as loud as anything else on the record. This leaves <i>Pit </i>to<i> </i>end with the vague sense that you've been pummeled for the last 45 minutes but with no real recollection of the specifics. It's the sort of thing that can feel thrilling in perhaps five-minute bursts, but the evenness of <i>Pit</i>'s landscape makes it hard for me to say which five minutes that is.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it's easy to be a sucker for Thompson's Edinburgh accent and to assume it lends a wizened gravitas to his grief over enlisting in ""an army that only fights boredom"" and painting rainbows black. But unlike the rangy vocals of benefactors like Scott Hutchison and James Graham, there's something wooden about Thompson's intonation that betrays his hot-blooded emotional state. For the most part, WWPJ show up to each track with the same bundle of nervous energy and simply churn until they wear themselves out. Though Thompson's plaintive wails and the brawny playing of the rhythm section give the impression of relentless and differentiable activity, they're holding patterns all the same.</p></div>"|15859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15859-in-the-pit-of-the-stomach/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Tinkling bells, faraway strings layered with static, soft-pedal piano lines ready to soundtrack footage of rain falling from the window of a slow-moving train: This is Kirby's world, and in Kirby's world the moments are lost, the opportunities missed, and the sky gray, then black, than gray again.</p>
<p>I suspect this all sounds heavy-handed, but what makes his music appealing to me is its curious lightness. It takes a teenager to be melodramatic, but it takes an adult-- an adult capable of the weird human reflex called nostalgia-- to achieve Kirby's levels of ambivalence and indifference. <i>Eager to Tear Apart the Stars</i>-- his first full-length under his own name since 2009-- is melancholy, sure, but it doesn't strike me as the kind of album designed to make its listeners melancholy. Its operative verbs are drift, float, shrug.</p>
<p>A record like this takes poise and patience-- aside from the grim opener ""The Arrow of Time"", I almost never feel any muscle, any sense that a mood is being forced on me. And yet at nearly every turn music like this seems eminently delicate: A stray sound could shake the listener out of whatever dream the album has put them in. There's depth here, too, and enough bass, grain, and atmosphere to make the music as engaging at louder volumes as it is passive at quieter ones.</p>
<p>On my first few listens I thought of a quote from the filmmaker and archivist Jonas Mekas that my editor, Mark Richardson, quoted in his review of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9760-endless-summer/"" target=""_blank"">Endless Summer</a></i>, in talking about the look of decaying Super-8 film footage: ""time is laying a veil of poetry over them."" <i>Eager</i> is filled with moments where static is employed as a texturing device and sounds have a recycled, distant, and broken-down character. In 2011, this tactic is nothing new-- nostalgia is just a clipped signal away. Ultimately, though, that is where the album's poetry comes from: hearing Kirby's sweet, sad piano and string lines sound like they're crumbling as they reach our ears.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Eager</i> is Kirby's second great album of 2011: He's also responsible for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"" target=""_blank"">the Caretaker</a> project, under which he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/""><i>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</i></a> near the beginning of summer. The alias isn't really just for the sake of the artist's ego: While both this record and and <i>An Empty Bliss</i> have an unrepentantly nostalgic quality to them, the Caretaker records have become narrowly focused on microedits of pre-war parlor and ballroom music, but the music Kirby's releasing under his own name has a more cinematic, less conceptually unified feel. I'm not sure one's better than the other: There's something satisfying about how contained the Caretaker sound is, and something equally satisfying about how permissible-- and personal-- Kirby sounds under his own name.</p>
<p>I can't say as many nice things about the two <i>Intrigue &amp; Stuff</i> 12""s he's put out this year. The first has a vaguely techno conceit to parts of it, with more clearly defined and rhythmically rigid synthesizers. The second, for interested parties, is closer to <i>Eager</i>, but denser and outrightly threatening. In both cases what I think turns me off about them-- and what turns me on about <i>Eager</i>-- is the constant feeling of Kirby's presence, pushing buttons, triggering things, mixing sounds together. And that brings me back to what makes <i>Eager</i> a compelling and frankly weird album: At times, it sounds like there's nobody there making it.</p></div>"|15882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15882-leyland-kirby-eager-to-tear-apart-the-stars-etc-m/|7.9|Mike Powell

For 2002's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/"" target=""_blank"">Remission</a></i>, they focused on fire; 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan</a></i>, water (and <i>Moby Dick</i>); 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9426-blood-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Mountain</a></i>, earth (plus a vision quest up the side of the title's mountain); and 2009's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/"" target=""_blank"">Crack the Skye</a></i>, aether, linking astral travel, wormholes, Rasputin, possession, and the suicide of drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye. There's no way to follow that, so for their fifth album, <i>The Hunter</i>, they offer 13 stylistically and lyrically varied tracks. The title references the death of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds' brother, who suffered a heart attack while hunting last December, but there's no overarching thread. Despite the heaviness of that kind of information, the record works best as a catchy guilty-pleasure party album-- there's a song about sex in zero gravity, another about the Swamp Thing, one titled ""Bedazzled Finger Nails"".</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about a storyline they can barely explain in interviews, Mastodon put the complexities into the songwriting and vocal harmonies. <i>The Hunter</i> is longer than <i>Crack the Skye</i> by a couple of minutes, but it <i>feels</i> briefer. As the band itself noted early on, it comes over like a Mastodon mixtape. The Atlanta sludge veterans have never taken the easy way out, sure, but they've also never cycled between so many styles: We get crusty snarling dotted with spaced-out moments (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16111-black-tongue/"" target=""_blank"">Black Tongue</a>"" and its ""I burned out my eyes/ I cut off my tongue"" welcome), funky, psychedelic heavy rock (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44079-video-mastodon-curl-of-the-burl/"" target=""_blank"">Curl of the Burl</a>""), crazy keyboard noodles (""Bedazzled Finger Nails""), meditative, progressive Milky Way excursions (""Stargasm""), hammering tech-psych anthems with crazy-climber riffs (""Octopus Has No Friends""). Outside that, ""Blasteroid"" could almost pass as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a>. Really, it's like pressing buttons at random on a jukebox.</p>
<p>Mastodon 2011 are largely about restless experimentation.<i> The Hunter</i> is the quartet's first collection with cover art by someone other than Paul Romano. They recorded it with hip-hop and Maroon 5 producer Mike Elizondo, the guy who co-wrote <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"" target=""_blank"">50 Cent</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In Da Club</a>"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"" target=""_blank"">the Game</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IB21pwbMMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Higher</a>"".  It also features the first track sung entirely by Dailor. They use a Theremin. The sound is certainly chewier and, at times, more pop than usual. Two of the best songs--  the fuzzed sing-along ""All the Heavy Lifting"" and the slowly unfurling title track-- deliver memorable, vaguely radio-friendly choruses. But there's also the tech-heavy weirdness of ""Bedazzled Finger Nails"", a pretty, stumbling track that offers mathy psychedelia with a variety of vocal approaches (though I could do without the synth squiggles).</p>
<p>As you might expect from a record this jumbled, there are parts that lag. Here, they sequenced three duds together, the generic classic rock of ""Dry Bone Valley"", the mid-tempo ""The Thickening"", with its sexy oohs and ahhs, and Brann Dailor's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"" target=""_blank"">Syd Barrett</a>-like ""The Creature Lives"", a song that opens with more than a minute of Moog and laughter. (Note: It's not a great idea to follow one of your throwaway tracks with more than a minute of Moog and laughter.) They come back strong with ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12344-spectrelight/"" target=""_blank"">Spectrelight</a>"", a burnt offering sung by  regular guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a>' Scott Kelly, and the pretty finale, ""The Sparrow"", a track dedicated to the band's accountant's wife, who died of stomach cancer. Lyrically, they simply, rather beautifully, repeat her supposed life motto: ""Pursue happiness with diligence.""</p>
<p>It feels like <i>The Hunter</i>'s motto, too. I do miss the grit, heavy-lifting, and larger excavations of their earlier work-- nothing merits tossing around the word ""epic"" here-- but what they do, and what they've become, is fascinating. I ended my review of <i>Blood Mountain</i> by jokingly referring to the guys as the new ""Monsters of Rock."" They went on to play the festival of the same name the next year, but I was more talking about the ascension of a new brand of mainstream heavy metal, one that would sit beside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Metallica</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9199-megadeth/"" target=""_blank"">Megadeth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"" target=""_blank"">Slayer</a>, and others of their ilk. What I hadn't expected was that, a few years later, it would make more sense to pair them with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, and other guys not afraid to spend an entire set smiling.</p></div>"|15880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15880-the-hunter/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

Thinkpieces about indie appropriation, flame wars about ""real hip-hop,"" stock insults hefted toward Billyburg trusties-- good times, right? Well, not every pioneer goes unrewarded. Five years after the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>-sanctioned fuck-bass shtick of <a href=""http://www.spankrock.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spank Rock</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7856-yoyoyoyoyo/"" target=""_blank"">YoYoYoYoYo</a></i> set critics' brows furrowing, there's a lucrative boom in party music that turns the once-communal dancefloor/club experience into overblown swag-level competitions between Red Bull-addled alpha males. And if you push hyperactive pussy-popping anthems to enough well-meaning lefty skeptics who are otherwise hesitant to buy into strip-club chic, eventually that noise will ricochet its way toward the mainstream. Anything that skeevy to the point of being problematic has to have real transgressive pop cred, right?</p>
<p>So waiting a good half-decade between the debut and the follow-up shouldn't matter too much. Not with an updated production sound and some choice gigs sharing bills with Ke$ha and LMFAO to back the sophomore effort. The beats on this new album signal a shift in emphasis from Spank Rock as self-contained <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2030-hollertronix/"" target=""_blank"">Hollertronix</a>-satellite rapper/producer group to Spank Rock as MC showcase, with <i>YoYoYoYoYo</i>'s sonic architect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7389-xxxchange/"" target=""_blank"">XXXChange</a> taking a backseat to a new palette heavy on German electro-scuzz specialist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8269-boys-noize/"" target=""_blank"">Boys Noize</a>. It all bumps distractingly enough, sure. The opening salvo of ""Ta Da"" builds off a decent swath of plink-thump minimalism that serves as a little early snap-music nostalgia, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a>-boosted ""Car Song"" pulls off a good mixture of jittery, late-nite, uptempo, indie dance-punk bombast. Even the token sop to indie-punk, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5784-the-death-set/"" target=""_blank"">the Death Set</a> collaboration ""Energy"", has a neat interpolation of the break from Can's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a1NhRbNJ_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vitamin C</a>"" underpinning its bursts of freakout rock. The worst you can say about the production is that it can be sort of anonymous-- there's a song called ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1409-1-hit/"" target=""_blank"">#1 Hit</a>"", and I bet you know what it sounds like without listening-- but it's nominally the sort of stuff an engaging presence on the mic can overcome.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the problem of Spank Rock himself. After originally carrying himself like a smartassed joker on the debut, he now comes across as someone more ambivalently unserious. <i>Everything Is Boring &amp; Everyone Is a Fucking Liar</i> is the title, and maybe the easiest joke on the whole album: the cynical veneer on a loosely bundled collection of bass-rap tics that are delivered from a vantage point you can't quite see. There's no point in trying to sneak bass music through under cover of irony these days, but the edge that sparked Spank Rock's best moments back in the day either isn't there or flails around without direction. His rhymes are occasionally vaguely political, sometimes intentionally disingenuous, but never confident enough to tell you just where he stands. Somewhere between the rote, my-dick-rules bragging (""Hot Potato""; ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12307-nasty-ft-big-freedia/"" target=""_blank"">Nasty</a>""; ""Race Riot on the Dance Floor"") and the even more rote, I'm-so-fucked-up material (this is a dude who requests coke in place of salt on the rim of his margarita in ""Cool Shit""), it's easy to hear that title's disillusioned cynicism in the spaces where the actual persona should be. <i>YoYoYoYoYo</i> at least tried to let some of the sketchier meat-market catcalls off the hook because they were funny; here it's just a bunch of boilerplate sex raps that seem a little too possessive to be fun.</p>
<p>Trying to engage the pop market with something there's already a surplus of is tricky enough when you're outsized enough to justify it. For Spank Rock, it just gets exhausting. He's a stylistic free-agent with a flow that drifts between Baltimore club, Southern bass, post-Guetta house-rap, and the occasional halfway-inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> pastiche (""Baby""). But if his enthusiasm for genre-hopping gives him carte blanche to work his hyperactive, higher-register yawp into some interesting shapes, it does so at the expense of attention-getting things to say. And if lines stick out, it's usually because they're kind of tone-deaf-- ""now I wanna go west (like Kanye?)/ I was thinkin' more Cornel"" (wow, someone just heard his first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> track). But his flow is either too rushed or too buried in the mix to jump out. What you're left with half the time for a lyrical identity is a hook, and the thing about hooks is that they work best if you can shout along without either feeling like an asshole or hoping everyone catches your scare quotes. If you can pull that off with lines like ""shake it 'til my dick turns racist"" (""Race Riot"") or ""I can make you famous/ He can buy you bottles but I can buy you Billboard"" (""#1 Hit""), congratulations on overcoming the crippling burden of self-awareness.</p></div>"|15845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15845-spank-rock-everything-is-boring-and-everyone-is-a-fucking-liar/|3.5|Nate Patrin

Cole</a> is the kind of rapper who worries aloud, and frequently, if he's getting too deep for his own songs. A St. John's University <i>magna cum laude</i> graduate raised in poverty by a single mother, Cole distinguished himself in his early career as much through effort as talent. Over a string of fiercely earnest, frequently impressive mixtapes, he rapped in writerly thickets in which the semicolons and embedded clauses were audible, and he produced all his own tracks. He became a leading light of the conscious-rap crowd, who, always eager for a viable mainstream entrant in rap's ongoing culture wars, fervently embraced him. And then, perhaps inevitably, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a> swooped down and signed him.</p>
<p>The resulting major-label debut, <i>Cole World: The Sideline Story</i>, which finally saw release this week, is shaping up to be an actual Big Moment for Cole: Despite a tepid radio presence, it is projected to sell nearly 250,000 copies. Those are startling first-week numbers for a new rapper these days, and they assure that J. Cole will get at least a partial promenade through the spotlight. People appear to care deeply about this guy. But it's difficult to imagine why from the evidence of this studiously bland and compromise-riddled record, which seems to be searching for the meeting point of every conceivable middle.</p>
<p>About half the album bears Cole's production signature: a glimmering update on 1990s jazz-rap, spiked with live-sounding boom-bap drums. As a rap aesthetic, it's about as rigidly conservative as they come. But Cole is admirably committed to it, and he fleshes it out with surprising musical detail-- backup vocals, comping jazz guitars, lots and lots of grand piano. The songs that stick to this template feel warm, pleasant, and Cole-ish. The rest of <i>Cole World</i> is a 2011-era pop-rap project with a varying success rate: the madcap, syncopated single ""Can't Get Enough"" feels like a lost transmission from 2002-era rap radio, and it succeeds only insofar as it compels you to imagine how much better an '03-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a>, or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10740-nore/"" target=""_blank"">N.O.R.E.</a>, would have finessed the beat than does Cole, who deflates the track's bounce.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Cole brings the least-flavorful bars of his career to his debut, aiming, most likely, for something more universal than his diaristic mixtapes. The few glints we get of his personal life are intriguing: ""Lost Ones"" is a slippery and well-conceived, two-sided argument between Cole and his baby mother over whether they will keep the child. ""Breakdown"" affectingly recounts his late-in-life reunion with his father. But otherwise he seems to be playing by implied, major-label debut rules: keep it simple, slow it down, don't lose anyone. The result is like glutinous paste that results from mashing together <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">Big K.R.I.T.</a> and straining out what makes them interesting.</p>
<p>Jay himself, the benefactor figure, pops up twice, and both times his presence subtly undermines the marquee star. On his guest verse for ""Mr. Nice Watch,"" he flexes his double -time flow and coolly blows Cole out of the water. He's heard again on the intro to ""Rise and Shine,"" musing in a sampled snippet from his 2000 concert film <i>Backstage</i> on his ideal signee: rapping over his breakfast cereal, gunning for Jay's own spot. ""I'mma find him, though, and sign him; I don't want no problems,"" he says and there is a startlingly predatory ring to his laugh. J. Cole certainly posed no threat to Jay-Z's crown; he's too humble and lacks charisma. But maybe the next up-and-coming rapper to successfully forge and remain in his own lane is the one who refuses Jay's help.</p></div>"|15879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15879-j-cole-cole-world-the-sideline-story/|6.1|Jayson Greene

Even the band's unexpected 2008 reunion was both of and against its time, a beacon of clear-eyed virtuosity and precision amidst an encroaching tide of gauzy 1990s nostalgia. The reunited Shudder to Think toured sporadically for a couple of years, released a live album (2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13473-live-from-home/"" target=""_blank"">Live From Home</a></i>), and once again disbanded.</p>
<p><i>WAND</i> is Shudder to Think singer Craig Wedren's first album since he got the band back together, and it is exactly the album you'd hope somebody would make after reengaging with complex, dynamic music. While 2005's <i>Lapland</i> was stately and muted in its execution, <i>WAND</i> is falling all over itself with ideas. Wedren's voice commands rising and receding string sections, intricate multi-part harmonies, and subtle electronic textures that bloom into full-on rock arrangements. The album's title is apt; though Wedren is joined by a formidable cast of supporting players, much of the record feels conjured out of thin air.</p>
<p>Wedren possesses one of those rare rock voices that is both distinctive and versatile, and he covers a good deal of expressive ground on <i>WAND</i>. On <i>Lapland</i>, Wedren was able to coax a surprising amount of understated sweetness from his voice. Here, Wedren combines that sweetness with the eerie trills of Shudder to Think and the glammy vamp of his pre-<i>Lapland</i> quasi-dance project, Baby. The resulting cognitive dissonance is one of <i>WAND</i>'s greatest assets; the opening verse of ""Make Me Hurt You"" might be the most irresistibly catchy and unabashedly Classic Pop thing Wedren has ever recorded, but the song's titular chorus proves, uh, awkward to sing along with.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no such reservations are present in Wedren himself. The man seems to be having an absolute blast here; his mugging, cursing, strutting, cooing, and wailing make for the most exhilarating moments on <i>WAND</i>. At his best, Wedren spins incongruous-seeming sounds and gestures into shapely songs, buttressed by smart, lively arrangements. On <i>WAND</i>'s weaker tracks, these arrangements seem to follow a logic of their own, building and shifting cleverly around songs that don't really stick. A lot of time (and, presumably, a lot of pent-up creativity) went into this record, but the best songs here feel as tight and spontaneous as Shudder to Think, even when the multi-tracked instrumentation is dense and meticulous.</p>
<p>Shudder to Think fans who were disappointed by the relative timidity of <i>Lapland </i>should find a lot to love about <i>WAND</i>. The bangers here are true goddamn bangers, and even the draggy stretches have their moments. But it would be unfair to call this a return to form. <i>WAND</i> builds upon aesthetics that Wedren has played with throughout his career, including the understated pop of <i>Lapland</i>.  Taking the long view, the fact that <i>WAND</i> feels a bit overstuffed is more exciting than it is disappointing; 17 years after releasing a classic album, Craig Wedren could do a lot worse than some young man's problems.</p></div>"|15872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15872-craig-wedren-wand-76/|7.6|Matt LeMay

But there's at least one that nobody could've deduced: ""tic videos."" As Orcutt told <i>The Wire</i>, he's fascinated by clips ""made by people... who have these involuntary physical and verbal tics, and they actually document their symptoms and put the videos up on YouTube."" It's an odd inspiration, but one that says a lot about his playing style, which Orcutt himself likens to hiccuping. His wiry plucks and messy note clusters come in exhilarating fits and starts, so fast and impetuous that his guitar strings seem hard-wired to his firing neurons. His obsessive repetition is less about creating studied mantras than capturing the primal power of involuntary impulse.</p>
<p>That goal is reflected in the title of his second acoustic album, <i>How the Thing Sings</i>. It implies that Orcutt would rather document his muse than control it, letting the flow of his spilling ideas be the thing that sings. This approach gives his music a distinct immediacy, something like a waterfall of consciousness rather than a stream. And its rapid, irregular heartbeat creates an urgency that commands attention. You may not love all the moves Orcutt makes, but together they quicken your pulse and pressurize the atmosphere, much as a good horror film makes even calm moments seem one second away from shock.</p>
<p>Such tension allows Orcutt to venture into all kinds of territory without hitting lulls. Often he'll veer from plaintive strums to lone plucks, then into torrents so hyperactive they sound overdubbed, even though <i>How the Thing Sings</i> was recorded in single takes with a single room mic. This forceful jamming together of moods results in overlapping narrative arcs. In ""The Visible Bosom"", sandy chords give way to halting minimalism, only to smash into lightning bolts of string strangling accompanied by Orcutt's possessed moans. That sound collage is stretched to epic proportions on closer ""A Line from Ol' Man River"", which fuses together so many hectic ups and downs that calling it a rollercoaster would be an understatement.</p>
<p>The same is true of <i>How the Thing Sings</i> as a whole. It's tempting to focus solely on the adrenaline rush of Orcutt's playing, and let it all fly by like a stoner zoning out to Jackson Pollock's splattery paintings or Stan Brakhage's color-filled abstract <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61SzOGVdOnk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">films</a>. That's a fine way to experience Orcutt's music, but there also seems to be a lot of intense thought going on behind his impulsive acoustic clatter. Maybe that's why his solo acoustic work has so far had a lot more staying power than the fleeting pleasures of a single trip.</p></div>"|15875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15875-how-the-thing-sings/|8.0|Marc Masters

""Posters"", the opening track on his debut LP, <i>The Year of Hibernation</i>, even starts with a warbly synth to evoke the fabled VHS glow that has become a touchstone for kids of his generation. When you hear so much of this stuff, it starts to bleed together-- almost as if by design-- and you start to wonder what it would take for an artist in this realm to stand out. Powers has a few ideas.</p>
<p>Some of the album's appeal is straightforward. Powers writes melodies you remember and has an excellent ear for arrangement, even if the songs are rendered crudely. They generally start as whispered laments and then twist and turn until they become huge ""oh oh oh"" sing-alongs. The album <i>sounds</i> like it was recorded in a bedroom, which feels right given the small and personal details of the songs, but it strains to break free of its technical limitations. Rare is the record in this sphere that works much better loud, but <i>The Year of Hibernation</i> wants to be cranked. Room-filling volume allows a song like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12488-afternoon/"" target=""_blank"">""Afternoon""</a> to grow from its delicate, whistle-and-electric-keyboard opening into its grand, swelling conclusion, with a 4/4 marching drum and wordless vocal refrain that envelopes you like a hug.</p>
<p>The title of the record describes its world. These are songs about alternately hunkering down and hiding, and heading out into the world to explore and report back on what you've found. Powers is very much an innocent here, a kid with an ear for poetry who mixes striking images with the occasional groaner. The music of the Pacific Northwest feels like a key touchstone, and in many ways Youth Lagoon seems like a shy, quiet, and more hermetic version of what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a> were doing before 1997's <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i>. Small town claustrophobia bumps against the possibility of wide-open spaces. Two of the first three songs reference the late-night strobe of the television and beds and walls of posters, and these are mixed with campgrounds, woods, lakes, and watching fireworks from a roof. I don't want to strain the Modest Mouse comparison, since this record doesn't have a ""band"" feel, but the guitar breaks also show Isaac Brock's early flair for simple melodic embellishments that complement the songs perfectly.</p>
<p>Dean Wareham is another guitarist with an ear for elegant guitar leads, and the comparisons with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a> extend to Powers' cracked guitar whine and way of building clattering and echo-laden arrangements to moments of grandeur (not to mention the G500-like song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12197-july/"" target=""_blank"">""July""</a> that outlines a disintegrating relationship against the backdrop of a sky filled with explosions.) Powers is small-town through-and-through and doesn't have a hint of Wareham's cosmopolitan sophistication, but that works for this landscape. <i>Hibernation</i> is a record for pulling up the covers and dreaming and then venturing out to the town to see the strange and magical world of encroaching adulthood. The anthemic ""Cannons"" starts off with Powers singing, ""Rolling up the windows of my '96 Buick so the rain can't get inside of it,"" and that pretty much sums it up: The record mixes feelings of protection and safety with the tug of adventure and wraps it in compulsively listenable music that explodes at just the right moments.</p></div>"|15873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15873-the-year-of-hibernation/|8.4|Mark Richardson

A rapper named <a href=""http://donteatmymind.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a> has chosen <i>that</i> for his album cover. Your mind's already made up. That is, if it wasn't already after his searing, anti-everything calling card ""Triple F""-- that's ""fuck 'em"" in triplicate-- or ""Huzzah"", eXquire's dangerously catchy single produced by horrorcore vet Necro, with a hook that packs boundless socio-pathology into five words: ""drunk driving on a Wednesdayyyy."" Such an assault of antisocial behavior would lead to you believe there's nothing pleasant or new about <i><a href=""http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/mr-muthafuckin-exquire-lost-in-translation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lost in Translation</a></i>. But it's a nice surprise how it reveals itself as a comprehensive and ultimately human, if not always humane, portrait of eXquire's consummate underground ruggedness.</p>
<p>eXquire's been getting a healthy share of buzz of late, in large part because of the most divisive aspect of <i>Lost in Translation</i>: this is a New York mixtape and one that's provincial as fuck. His cantankerous and bullish flow can be traced to all purveyors of unwashed hoodie rap, but he boasts of a ""Vote for Pedro"" tattoo representing the underdog and all of the alcohol being abused is within the budget of the listener. Casual fans will easily spot the interpolations of Jay-Z and Lil' Kim tracks from 1996 but bonus points if you spot the hat-tip to a 50 Cent freestyle on Hot 97. Likewise, it's not enough to have a boom-bap medley called ""Pissin' Between Train Cars"" stuck between ""Cockmeat Sandwich"" (""if you ain't seen <i>Harold &amp; Kumar</i>, that means suck my diiiiick"") and an indefensibly drawn-out blowjob skit-- he tells you where his stop is on the C Train from Euclid (Utica, if you're interested).</p>
<p>That some of these beats are ripped from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/670-cannibal-ox/"" target=""_blank"">Cannibal Ox</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1284-the-cold-vein/"" target=""_blank"">The Cold Vein</a></i> might be the best illustration of the realm in which eXquire functions. It's a world of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu</a> murk where even the gulliest sounding dudes escape into comic books and hip-hop CDs because girls just don't understand. Even if it all takes place within a couple of city blocks, eXquire makes it feel like a universe of experience where he comes of age as a microphone fiend (""I Should Be Sleepin'""), lays out some deeply nerdy storytelling raps (""Maltese Falcon Pt. 1 and Pt. 2""), and joyfully gets on some Anthony Bourdain shit as an ambassador to his local chicken spots (""Plus they got pizza, y'all can't fuck with this/ Got macaroni salad too, but I don't trust that shit"").</p>
<p>But don't think that this is merely a celebration of New York… or really a celebration of much of anything. His focus on humility and grind doesn't separate eXquire from many other up and comers, but when I hear, say, Green Ova Undergrounds, their hustle raps seem to take place in some sort of vacuum, and it's unclear what they're pushing against other than themselves. <i>Translation </i>is similar in a lot of ways to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"" target=""_blank"">XXX</a> </i>mixtape in that eXquire's sharing some very uncomfortable and often unflattering aspects of his life in order to fully express just how real this is to him. You get the feeling <i>Lost in Translation </i>wasn't chosen as a title for the fact it's a cool phrase: Despite the occasional guest rap, it shares the movie's overwhelming loneliness and desperation. He's in command railing against hip-hop ass kissers-- dud skits named ""Hip Hop Networking 101"" and ""YeahRight!.com"" should make that obvious-- but when bills, guilt, and the impending sense he's fucked up his life get the better of him on ""Nuthin' Even Matters (Regrets)"", eXquire's surprisingly effective singing voice rings out like a distressing call from someone who might end it at any moment. Likewise, while the drowsy hooks on ""Lovesponge"" and ""Build-A-Bitch"" might initially signal the point where this 18-track tape should've packed it in, eXquire sounds more confused than misogynistic.</p>
<p>On ""Huzzah"", eXquire boasts, ""publicist asked me what's my gimmick, I said 'going in,'"" and it's based in truth: these aren't the kind of lyrics filled with punchlines and tricky wordplay, and his fairly unglamorous strengths lie in his ability to pick beats, flesh out concepts, and develop stories. There are plenty of easily identifiable precedents in his tone and cadence-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7846-method-man/"" target=""_blank"">Method Man</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"" target=""_blank"">50 Cent</a>, hell, even a hell of a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dre</a>-- whether topically or vocally, eXquire covers so much ground that I'm not sure I'd be able to spot an uncredited verse from him. Particularly on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12460-huzzah-remix-ft-despot-das-racist-danny-brown-and-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">The Last Huzzah!</a>"", he sounds a little indistinct compared to highly pronounced stylists like Danny Brown, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>, and El-P.</p>
<p>The ""Last Huzzah!"" remix is easily one of the best posse cuts of the year, and besides hearing Brown continue his hot streak and Das Racist come through with the kind of quotable jaw-droppers that were few and far between on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15822-relax/"" target=""_blank"">Relax</a></i>, there's the sense that some kind of vanguard is being established. Along with Brown, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, in a different era, they're the type of song-savvy hardheads whose skills and sound might have landed them on a major label with no real idea of what to do with them. But the freedom they have allows them to honor and revive ""New York rap"" as an artistic framework rather than a matter of geography: Of course that designation was going to generate skepticism when the personality-free likes of Skyzoo, Maino, and Saigon were all too eager to claim the throne. But eXquire has less to do with ""real MCing"" than a relatable realness, so yeah, that cover really does make sense: eXquire is flaws and all, and it's tough to look away.</p></div>"|15864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15864-lost-in-translation/|7.9|Ian Cohen

And not just think about it: pick it apart, deconstruct it, comb it for references. <i>Overthink</i> it, even. Hot-button issues both musical and not-- hypnagogic pop, 90s revivalism, feminism-- are baked into <i>Cabaret Cixous</i>, her second album for Los Angeles-based anti-pop label Not Not Fun. Maria Minerva (real name Maria Juur), certainly has the <a href=""http://alteredzones.com/posts/1776/artist-profile-maria-minerva/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pedigree</a>: the daughter of an Estonian music critic, Juur studied art history while in college; she contributes to <i><a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Wire</a></i>. <i>Cabaret Cixous</i> borrows monikers from two Juur favorites: the pranging electro of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/640-cabaret-voltaire/"" target=""_blank"">Cabaret Voltaire</a> and lauded feminist writer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Cixous"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hélène Cixous</a>.</p>
<p>Juur doesn't soft-pedal her exploration of sexual dynamics; she pouts lustily in photos and gyrates in music videos. Sex can be a tricky subject for an artist from Juur's world: mainly, it's difficult to walk the line between the carnal and political in pop music. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"" target=""_blank"">Madonna</a>, for instance, expertly managed both, but it seems easier to err on the side of the carnal, like almost everyone else.) Self-consciousness and obfuscation can be deeply unsexy, and while it's easy to admire the games Juur wants to play with her image, there's very little allure or attraction on <i>Cabaret</i> itself. It's one thing to undermine the exploitation of female sexuality to sell pop music; but in doing so she also seems to undermine the immediacy and compassion-- the very <i>appeal</i>-- of pop music.</p>
<p>Juur, at least, has the right inspirations: 1980s electro and dance-pop, 1990s house. Much of <i>Cabaret</i> sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> covering <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A20uGgj09oE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Paige's ""Crush""</a>-- hooks made to quiver over seasick chords and seasick-er drum machines-- though I don't think Juur is playing the same savant-like memory games Pink is. Her referents are too carefully cultivated, too obviously considered (though no one should do her the disservice of suggesting insincerity). Juur's treatments are like the soap scum: Her aim isn't just to dull the shine of the nickel-plated pop that informs her music but to alter its texture. <i>Cabaret</i> conveys thinness above all, Juur's dryly echoing vocals and keyboard presets hovering on the same plane. It constantly feels like even a cursory scrubbing would make a world of difference.</p>
<p>In this environment, beauty and melody are secondary concerns, though they are concerns. It's impossible to hear standouts such as ""Pirate's Tale"" and ""Soo High"" as anything other than soberly conceived pop songs, but ""pop songs"" is a tricky term: these tracks aren't meant to unite, or inspire, or empathize. They're meant to make you think. About what, exactly, sometimes gets lost: the lyrics of ""Ruff Trade"" eerily triangulate sex, violence, and despair, but ""Soo High"" begins with ""Baby baby baby/ You make me so high/ When I'm around you/ Time just flies by."" Tongue-in-cheek? Probably, but I don't always wish to exit my swoony pop trance to suss that out. So you see why <i>Cabaret</i> functions best in the midst of the Maria Minerva audio/visual/theoretical experience: Juur's music isn't yet precise enough to probe the nuances of admittedly weighty material on its own.</p>
<p>I really like <i>Cabaret Cixous</i>' sound, though-- it's fidgety and restless, full of love for its inspirations despite its partly academic birth. I'd be more optimistic on Juur's future if her prodigious output-- Cabaret follows her <i>Tallinn at Dawn</i> tape, also released this year-- and haphazard recording style signaled a clearer process of trial/error/refinement. She is not moving toward a more perfect remembrance of or epitaph for dance pop; we remain firmly in the realm of ideas. For now, <i>Cabaret</i> is paper disco of a thoughtful and occasionally moving variety, more durable than it lets on.</p></div>"|15871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15871-cabaret-cixous/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

As far as gospel collections go, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13759-fire-in-my-bones-raw-rare-otherworldly-african-american-gospel-1944-2007/"" target=""_blank"">Fire in My Bones</a></i> felt revelatory, crucial:  those three discs of evangelical missives reconfigured religious music as unpredictable, sonically challenging material. McGongial's next project, <i>This May Be My Last Time Singing,</i> focuses specifically on gospel songs recorded and released between 1957 and 1982. Like its predecessor, it's a deeply compelling document of the various ways human beings talk to God.</p>
<p>There's urgency to all good art, but gospel music, in particular, is fueled by desperation: Transmit your message of gratitude to Heaven before you lose the chance entirely (and end up somewhere else). The mission is massive, but in many cases, the material legacy is humble; at least a third of the songs included on <i>This May Be My Last Time Singing</i> were self-released and pressed, in small batches, onto 7"", 45-rpm discs, a process paid for by church congregations or the singers themselves. Decades later, McGonigal tugged those little records out of cardboard boxes and milk crates, trawling record shops (this might be the only compilation in recent memory that thanks at least a dozen), online auctions, and flea markets for lost prayers. That these songs were released commercially (even if they sold only a few dozen copies for local or vanity labels) feels paramount to any real understanding of the performers' intent-- these aren't field recordings. They're solicitations: holler along, fall to your knees, pray with me. Believe.</p>
<p>McGonigal's finds are spread across three discs, each loosely organized around a state of faith (""The Devil's Trying to Steal My Joy"", ""Perfect Like the Angels"", and ""All Wrap Up in One""), and while they range dramatically in style-- from funk to rhythm and blues to drum machine psychedelia-- they're linked by an industriousness that feels unique to the genre.  No matter how rowdy these tracks get, their creators are still doing selfless work.</p>
<p><i>This May Be My Last Time Singing</i> focuses specifically on post-war gospel, but most of it feels oddly timeless. Rev. J.W. Neely and Family's ""Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around"" was self-released in 1980 but sounds divorced from the era altogether; it's disorienting to consider that this rendition was born into the same pop landscape as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/"" target=""_blank"">Blondie</a>. An a cappella, handclap-heavy ode to solidarity in the face of temptation-- ""Don't you let nobody turn you around/ You just keep on together,"" Neely and family shout, their voices warm-- it's encouraging, never threatening. Same goes for the Exciting Traveling Four's ""O Lord I Have No Friend"", which was released by the National Recording Label in 1982. Save a wonky electric organ intro (which sounds as if it were being piped up from the deep end of a swimming pool), ""O Lord I Have No Friend"" is quaint and earnest in a way that defies its age. You can practically see the matching bow ties, the four faces crowded around a single mic.</p>
<p>The collection's longest track, the seven-and-a-half minute ""He Walks With Me (Parts 1 and 2)"", is also its most exhilarating. Calvin Leavy, a singer and guitarist from Arkansas, scored a modest hit in 1970 with ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZDuDqtPLhE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cummins Prison Farm</a>"", a scrappy electric blues that decried conditions at Cummins Prison, the Arkansas penitentiary infamous for its abuse (torture and inmate rape were common, and in 1968, three skeletons, one decapitated, one with a crushed skull, and a third with both legs broken back were discovered in shallow graves on the prison grounds). In 1976, Leavy-- who, in a particularly cruel twist, would be shipped off to Cummins himself for drug charges in 1992-- recorded ""He Walks With Me (Parts 1 and 2)"" with the Cummins Prison Farm Singers for the aptly named Messenger Records. The song contains a bogus fade out three and a half minutes in, but Leavy's really just warming up, his raspy voice growing higher, wilder. The music-- loose, rudimentary rock-- gently revs back up, providing a steady, rhythmic canvas for Leavy to scribble all over. His message is determined, redemptive: we are not alone, not ever. By the time the track actually fades out, it feels like there's a full army of believers crammed into the room.</p>
<p>Plenty of new, privately sourced anthologies have inadvertently positioned the record collector as curator, savior, interpreter. But unlike many maniacal stockpilers of vinyl and shellac, McGonigal doesn't fetishize these songs as hard-sought rarities. <i>This May Be My Last Time Singing</i> contains plenty of oddball finds, but, as McGonigal explains, these are just the tracks he loves the most-- which is exactly what renders him such a reliable guide. As his brief liner notes state, ""these are the songs I'm most obsessed with, that if you dropped by my house I'd say 'You have to hear this.'""</p>

Some bands had a well-reasoned method to their misanthropic madness, and some just wanted to piss people off (or, in special cases, actually piss on people).  What's most 0ffensive about <a href=""http://cerebralballzy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cerebral Ballzy</a>'s attempts at ""edgy"" provocation isn't tastelessness or insensitivity-- it's the blandness.</p>
<p>To be fair to these five guys, it's not like they're aiming for any sort of lofty artistic goal.  They just want to be a punk rock band, with their own stupid band name, with their own songs about getting fucked up and telling various authority figures and peers to fuck off, and with their own Raymond Pettibon cover art (complete with bonus photo-copier fuzz at the edge of the image, for that extra bit of D.I.Y. verisimilitude).  Granted, it's on the music-label offshoot of the studio famous for a lot of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim content-- it's the label's first non-compilation full-length that has nothing to do with one of their shows, actually-- but let's leave the scene politics to the <i>Maximumrocknroll</i>'s of the world.</p>
<p>And it's not like they're necessarily bad at it.  They know the moves (the spoken-word intro, the slow-into-fast start-up, the ""bridge""), they know the rules (the album proper is only 20 minutes long, with only one song clocking in at over 150 seconds, and to hell with a guitar solo), and they hit their marks. ""Singles"" like ""Cutting Class"" and ""Insufficient Fare"" are perfectly OK punk songs.  So are the other 10 ""official"" album tracks, as well as whatever non-live bonus tracks come with the various different versions of the album. ""OK"" is about where these guys top off, though-- subject matter notwithstanding, the songs are pretty interchangeable, meaning there's not much that distinguishes anti-establishment tracks like ""Anthem"" and ""Don't Tell Me What to Do"" with pass-the-pipe tracks like ""Drug Myself Dumb"" and ""Puke Song"".</p>
<p>This album features perfectly serviceable and perfectly competent, middle-of-the-road punk rock music that probably sounds much better live than it ever could in a recording studio.  If it weren't being released at a time when groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29131-off/"" target=""_blank"">Off!</a>, Double Negative, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28767-trash-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Trash Talk</a>, and any number of hardcore-flavored punk groups are putting their own individualistic spins on the well-worn, three-chord monte, Cerebral Ballzy's paint-by-numbers take would possibly stand out. And if it weren't for the countless number of precedents that have done exactly what CB are doing here, their faithful-to-a-fault homage might actually seem quaint.  In this day and age, though, what these kids are doing, and the way they're doing it, means that their only truly distinguishing feature is their band name.  And when all you've got going for yourself is that you're called Cerebral Ballzy, you've got your work cut out for you.</p></div>"|15868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15868-cerebral-ballzy/|4.8|David Raposa

Equal parts girl-group gloss and brash punk energy, <i>I Will Be</i> paired the tinny jangle of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11882-psychocandy-darklands-automatic-honeys-dead-stoned-dethroned/"" target=""_blank"">Psychocandy</a></i>-coated guitars with lead singer Dee Dee's exquisitely aloof vocals to create a vibe of timelessly cool abandon. It sounded like a girl gang had kicked the authority figures out of the principal's office, barricaded the doors, and taken to blasting their delinquent anthems like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14464-bhang-bhang-im-a-burnout/"" target=""_blank"">Bhang Bhang, I'm a Burnout</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11721-jail-la-la/"" target=""_blank"">Jail La La</a>"" over the school's loudspeaker.</p>
<p>The Dum Dums might have been the baddest girls on the scene, but they certainly weren't the only ones: over the past couple of years <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28336-frankie-rose-and-the-outs/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Rose and the Outs</a> have each dusted off the kitschy cultural detritus of 1960s girl-group pop and filtered it through a hefty dose of D.I.Y. grit. It's been a blast. But even the most enduring of the original practitioners carried some decidedly pre-feminist baggage (baby love, wide-eyed devotion, Svengalis), and at times the new stuff didn't feel too much more enlightened. Or at least it could have seemed that way if you made the mistake of looking for meaning solely on the surface of the songs.</p>
<p>Dum Dum Girls in particular had a way of reminding you that there was more to it than that. They had fun with irony; artifice; and winking, revisionist takes on musical history (Kristin Gundred's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a>-nodding stage name Dee Dee; Richard ""My Boyfriend's Back"" Gottehrer's co-producing credit on both full-lengths) that reminded you of the simple, triumphant facts: these women were all pretty excellent pop songwriters, and this thing they were part of was the most visible all-female front in indie rock since the riot grrrl movement in the early 1990s. And yet, even the highlights of the girl-group garage scene (of which <i>I Will Be</i> is certainly one) still focused pretty narrowly on simple, youthful emotions and didn't seem to care much about aesthetic development. Some time around the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15233-share-the-joy/"" target=""_blank"">third Vivian Girls LP</a>, you couldn't help but wonder: Will any of these groups be bold enough to move forward? Will any of them stick around long enough to, well, <i>grow up</i>?</p>
<p><i>Only in Dreams</i> is the first record of this wave able to form an answer to that question, and for that it feels admirably bold. Spurred by the death of Dee Dee's mother and the separation anxiety she felt while she and her husband (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27783-crocodiles/"" target=""_blank"">Crocodiles</a>' Brandon Welchez) were touring with their respective bands, it's a statement of thematic maturity and emotional depth we've not yet heard from Dum Dum Girls-- nor many of their contemporaries. It builds on the momentum of this year's terrific and shimmery <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15156-he-gets-me-high-ep/"" target=""_blank"">He Gets Me High</a></i> EP, but it's even more of a hi-fi affirmation (""It's cool to record in [an] actual studio and use real mics,"" <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/home/2011/02/04/the-self-titled-interview-dum-dum-girls/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dee Dee said recently</a>) and an introduction of a whole new set of influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"" target=""_blank"">Mazzy Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3485-the-pretenders/"" target=""_blank"">the Pretenders</a>) in the band's sound.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice is Dee Dee's voice. If you've seen the band live, you know: girl's got pipes. But you didn't get that from <i>I Will Be</i>, which kept it distorted and low in the mix. In interviews, she's been candid about her stage fright and her gradual acceptance of her role as a frontwoman, and her newfound confidence is pretty thrilling to hear on <i>Only in Dreams</i>. Vocally, Chrissie Hynde is the obvious reference point, but Dee Dee's less interested in aping Hynde's sneering, Jagger-like strut than channeling the lush depths of her own voice on tracks like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12304-bedroom-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Bedroom Eyes</a>"". For the first time on a Dum Dum Girls record, the rest of the Girls sing backup, which adds even more fullness to the sound. As on <i>He Gets Me High</i>, Gottehrer shares a producing credit with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3531-the-raveonettes/"" target=""_blank"">the Raveonettes</a>' Sune Rose Wagner, and they've effectively scrubbed the grit off the Girls' guitars until they glimmer.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the problem with <i>Only in Dreams</i>: the pristine production <i>sounds</i> great, but it makes the lack of complexity and occasional shortcomings-- the kind of issues that were easier to disguise, or perhaps shrug off, on <i>I Will Be</i>-- all too apparent. Most of the songs are mid-tempo, and there's little variation in the drum beats, phrasing, or song structure. Some people might also take issue with the relatively simplistic rhyme schemes, but thanks to Dee Dee's expressive vocals, that's not a problem. She's able to conjure powerful emotions from minimal imagery and simple, straightforward declarations. It's not much to look at on paper, but the way she holds the notes in ""Heartbeat""'s bridge-- ""I don't know/ Where to go/ To get away from this sorrow""-- is nothing less than a gutpunch.</p>
<p>There are 10 songs on <i>Only in Dreams</i>, and every one of them contains the word ""you."" Some of them Dee Dee wrote about her husband, and some she wrote about watching her mother succumb to cancer last year. Perhaps the most moving thing about <i>Only in Dreams</i> is that it's not always immediately apparent which of these people she's addressing; its state of longing feels universally applicable. ""Heartbeat"", ""Wasted Away"", and ""Teardrops on My Pillow"" can pass on a cursory listen for odes to romantic heartbreak, but the startlingly direct references to death (""It's a game, how tight/ Can you shut your eyes/ Shut out the light/ Death is so bright"") make you look back and realize that there's a sense of loss throbbing throughout the record. (Dee Dee's mom played an important role in the band's aesthetic-- that's her on the covers of <i>I Will Be</i> and the self-titled debut EP.) There's a passing moment on ""Caught in One"" when she wishes to trade places with her ailing mother, but by the closer, ""Hold Your Hand"", she's facing down her own identity (""But she's not you/ No, she's not you"") and finding the strength to begin picking up the pieces and rebuilding on her own. It's a step forward for her as a songwriter, articulating-- let alone sharing-- a feeling this intimate.</p>
<p>Nothing on <i>Only in Dreams</i> has the immediacy of a track like ""Jail La La"", so those looking for a retread might be disappointed. But songs like the slow-burning ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12264-coming-down/"" target=""_blank"">Coming Down</a>"" show Dum Dum Girls pushing themselves in new directions-- you get the sense, if you hadn't before, that this band might be around for a while. <i>Only in Dreams</i> isn't a perfect record, but a little while down the line it might end up looking like the beginning of something-- the first steps forward for the band, or perhaps a raising of the bar for this entire revival. I wouldn't put it past Dee Dee to be the leader of the pack.</p></div>"|15851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15851-dum-dum-girls-only-in-dreams/|7.6|Lindsay Zoladz

Here, an acoustic guitar line circles around itself with a slide guitar and a keyboard drone distantly echoing the melody. As with most everything on <i>Rest</i>, Rwake makes this relatively placid introduction-- nearly as much a heavy metal trope as the apocalypse and goblins-- a bit weirder and wilder than expected. As the drone swells, female vocals intertwine with the guitars, casting a spell that seems to summon the band's scorn. When it finally arrives, it's relentless and exhilarating, the sort of inclusive ""doom"" that moves with the same unpredictable force of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10726-the-body/"" target=""_blank"">the Body</a>'s 2010 opus, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/"" target=""_blank"">All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</a></i>. If that sounds like high praise, it is: <i>Rest</i> is the best album of Rwake's 14-year career, further proof that doom does exist beyond <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a>.</p>
<p>Although Rwake have been making music for more than a decade, <i>Rest</i> comes turbocharged by an obsession with ideas and influences different from those you might generally expect from a younger band. The album incorporates flute, MIDI, marimba, mandolin, stacked sine-wave drones, and loads of acoustic and electric guitars, all expertly captured by go-to metal guy Sanford Parker. After that eerie introduction, for instance, a viscous riff expectedly cascades in turgid waves. That lasts only for about 20 seconds, though, at which point a sizzling lead cuts through, like an Allman perched atop an army. Actually, within the first two minutes of ""It Was Beautiful But Now It's Sour"", moments of Teutonic thrash, Pentecostal glossolalia, and power-electronics din have their spotlight share. The song lasts nearly 12 minutes, and it never starts to scrimp on the surprises. The same goes for the 16-minute ""The Culling"", a sidewinding number that builds from the kind of electro-acoustic drift <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"" target=""_blank"">Agalloch</a> favor into a pummeling rage with twin guitar leads, risky vocal manipulation, and a restless rhythm section that consistently pushes the band into unforeseen directions. And, in spite of the frequent doom tag, ""An Invisible Thread"" races through speed metal, black metal, and hardcore-like blasts before-- after more than four minutes-- settling into a malevolent, down-tempo throb more consistent with the niche. This slower section not only offers four of the album's most compelling minutes (Rwake seem most practiced and comfortable at this pace), but also gives them the chance to offer a sort of mission statement-- a vision of artistic renewal in a world plagued by fakers. ""When all the others give and fucking take/ Users suck the life to fucking live,"" Rwake's B. and C.T. shout together in scorn. ""Imitate life but never recreate.""</p>
<p>After all, <i>Rest</i> is very much made with a bleak worldview, built lyrically on references to being pulled into the sun, singing songs of sorrow, and having a sick stomach. But there's a core of resilience here that seems to be anchored to an idea of exploration and conquest-- survivors fighting their way through a tunnel, working against evil forces that hide in the shadows. It's an appropriate theme for Rwake, a band that seems to hold nothing sacred within its purview of what is and what is not heavy metal. Sure, they use a half-dozen of the techniques you'll anticipate from a brutal Southern doom band, from samples about death and the cosmos to calm passages meant to offer relief from and juxtaposition to the record's generally vengeful maul. But for these 53 minutes, they also offer a barrage of the unexpected, relighting doom from the strangest corners.</p></div>"|15865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15865-rest/|7.8|Grayson Currin

With the release of their eponymous debut record on Stones Throw, they step into center stage, a place where the glare shines not only on their chops as musicians, but also on their personality as a band and their ability to carry off these impressively formed, iridescent soul songs.</p>
<p>There's no doubting the musicianship here-- they effortlessly drift from loving soul homages to delicately experimental psychedelic touches that recall the spaced-out synths of P-funk and, more recently, artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"" target=""_blank"">Thundercat</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"" target=""_blank"">Janelle Monáe</a>. Boundary-pushing songs like ""Brain Ninja"" and ""Suburban Dream"" are draped in sparkling, trippy synthesizers and off-kilter vocals that eventually anchor themselves in the kind of gorgeous harmonies that are all over this record. Carrying an acid-fried tinge, those left-of-center moments are the strongest.</p>
<p>""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15132-legend-in-my-own-mind/"" target=""_blank"">Legend in My Own Mind</a>"", a song deeply rooted in 1960s pop, is played a little straighter-- the shimmering violins recall Van Morrison, while the panned left and right vocals would work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13433-rubber-soul/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rubber Soul</i></a>. Those nods are played earnestly, but at the same time nothing feels forced or overly studious, just a little timeworn. On the less out-there moments like this it becomes difficult to sift through the dozens of influences and find something distinct-- for a group of guys used to playing other people's music, maybe this isn't such a surprise.</p>
<p>Really, there are no particularly bad moments here. What makes <i>Stepkids</i> feel slight isn't the musicianship or songwriting-- both of which shine-- but an absence of personality. By the band's own admission ""any lyric, any melody, any idea could have been done by any of us,"" and it's this egalitarian approach that's also the project's biggest shortcoming. The result is something that sounds like three session players and lacks the presence of somebody to step up and take this beyond being merely a decent, functional collection of songs.</p></div>"|15847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15847-the-stepkids/|6.5|Hari Ashurst

They're an art-and-literature collective that happens to play music too, a small community who used to be punks together, a hydra whose three heads each sing in a different voice. They've also effectively become process artists. The ideas that shape their songs, and the means by which they create them, are the important part; the songs themselves are basically just documentation.</p>
<p>That makes latter-day albums like <i>Ancient &amp; Modern</i> very interesting in a contemporary-art context, and occasionally tough-going in a putting-on-recordings-and-listening-to-them context. If you're waiting for them to write another ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71s-T8oUTQs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Where Were You?</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCQ6DLwV9CI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Memphis, Egypt</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7A7mLEfOWY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Now We Have the Bomb</a>"", don't hold your breath; it's hard to imagine most of these songs being the kind of thing grouchy old guys at Mekons shows yell for. (Mekons shows are heavily populated by grouchy old guys.)</p>
<p>The ostensible concept behind this record is drawing parallels between the present day and 100 years ago. It's a concept that would be entirely opaque without the album's title-- although, of course, with their ties to the art world, Mekons know that titles can carry a lot of weight. Opacity, though, is a persistent problem on <i>Ancient &amp; Modern</i>. A lot of its lyrics might as well have been assembled exquisite-corpse style: ""Calling All Demons"" wanders from ""a reptile thinking its first thoughts"" to the head of John the Baptist to ""a fan-club meeting down the steps on Briggate"" to ""ice cream, eggs and bread,"" and so on. A couple of its lines seem to allude to Oscar Wilde, but that's the only point of coherence to someone who wasn't in the room when it was written.</p>
<p>Still, Mekons know when they've come up with a good phrase, and how to build an arrangement around it. On the title track, it's ""I had a minor breakdown,"" repeated as a refrain while a tiny, four-note figure loops and loops; on Jon Langford's splenetic rocker ""Space in Your Face"", it's ""I was tempted to believe,"" howled by an ensemble with someone's devotional humming behind them; on the old-timey strut ""Geeshie"", it's Sally Timms ending some lines with ""while there's still time"" and others with ""try to still time."" (That last appears to be a tribute to Geeshie Wiley, the mysterious singer-guitarist who recorded her haunting ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKfy2W70Qg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Last Kind Word Blues</a>"" in 1930. Again, the title's the only explicit cue.)</p>
<p>The other thing Mekons have picked up from contemporary art practice is the principle that, once you've established your voice, you can keep doing variations on the same thing indefinitely. Their lineup has been fairly stable for a couple of decades now, and it's hard to imagine a band more comfortable with each other's playing than they are. When they feel like it, they can conjure moments of disarming beauty. (""I fall asleep when I should pray,"" Timms and Tom Greenhalgh repeat together-- she's clear-voiced and reserved, he's quavering and sardonic-- and then the song briefly dissolves into a dubbed-out froth of piano and violin before resuming.) When they don't, they still sound like no one but Mekons: prickly, jovial, boozy, resistant to the bourgeois pleasures of rhyme and tune but sometimes seduced by them anyway. For anyone who's not already a Mekons enthusiast, though, this has to be an alarmingly forbidding, cryptic piece of work.</p></div>"|15869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15869-mekons-ancient-modern-1911-2011/|6.6|Douglas Wolk

I didn't listen to Plaid-- British production duo Andy Turner and Ed Handley-- very much, not even their 1999 mini-masterpiece <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6332-rest-proof-clockwork/"" target=""_blank"">Rest Proof Clockwork</a></i>. Instead they remained faintly but firmly ensconced in my memory, the result of a burgeoning electronic music fan seeking a group Radiohead wasn't constantly namedropping (scratch <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>), but that was still available at Sam Goody. I would never suggest that Plaid were a direct inspiration for a group like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a>, though there are worse things than being a token in the revival of soft-focus, reasonably scaled beatmongering.</p>
<p><i>Scintilli</i> is Plaid's first non-soundtrack work since 2008 and their first proper studio album since 2003 (2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9173-greedy-baby/"" target=""_blank"">Greedy Baby</a></i> having been an audio/video collaboration). It doesn't count as a ""new direction"" for the duo because they've never really fucked with ""direction"" in the first place. At their best, Plaid nestled into the wide crevasses between hardline, dystopian techno, broken beat, and experimental composition. Their synthesis was recognizable but not unrepeatable; they stood out for their casual, unhurried sense of adventure. (In the late 1990s, they were called Intelligent Dance Music because  their records had ""Warp"" on the back, and they didn't sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/"" target=""_blank"">Moby</a>.)</p>
<p>There's a danger in this lack of direction, though: sometimes you exist comfortably outside electronic-music narratives and sometimes you get lost. <i>Scintilli</i> isn't the first time Plaid have stumbled into the latter state; all things being equal, they operate in this mode better than most. Still, <i>Scintilli</i> underwhelms, lacking the ease with which Plaid used to stitch sound together. They're no longer inscrutable; like their previous work, <i>Scintilli</i> contains heavy doses of sounds that rile, pacify, and intrigue, but here they constantly tip their hand. The dolloping keyboards of ""Craft Nine"" calm; the walloping bass of ""S<span style=""color: #222222;"">ö</span>mnl"" disrupts.</p>
<p>Plaid's skillful incorporation of the female voice remains intact (Bj<span style=""color: #222222;"">ö</span>rk sometimes seems to aspire to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEMOSY27QY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lilith</a>"", her 1997 collaboration with the duo) on soft-footed opener ""Missing"" and closer ""At Last"". Their overall sound has remained eclectic even as their tracks grow compartmentalized.  I still appreciate Plaid's baselessness-- how I can never quite place  what I'm listening to. They're less diffuse than their late-90s Warp  peers but far more so than, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/"" target=""_blank"">Mouse on Mars</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>, artists with whom Plaid share sensibilities but little more. I find <i>Scintilli</i>-- and its ambitious alternating of composure and chaos-- admirable, but ""admirable"" sounds (and feels) like a backhanded complement. I would prefer to find it fizzy or confusing or aggressive. <i>Scintilli</i> is a disappointingly static record from a duo of born tinkerers.</p>

Of course, no diamond-certified, canonical treasure hitting the two-decade mark can be left well enough alone in 2011-- especially one that changed the lives of a lot people now approaching middle age, with the discretionary income to prove it. After all, ""super deluxe"" reissues of classic albums don't even have to be tied to an anniversary these days. But <i>Nevermind</i> is 20 this week, still a pretty respectable number in a world where any milestone marks an excuse to shift a few more units. The only question is whether these reissues-- a single-disc remaster, a 2xCD ""deluxe"" version, and a 4xCD+DVD ""super-deluxe"" edition-- are that rare essential repurchase that makes you hear an album you've possibly exhausted in new ways, or if it's just another mediocre jumble of odds and ends that inadvertently reveals the flaws and blemishes carefully excised from the original 12-song set.</p>
<p>Sadly, both expanded versions fall into the latter category, with material ranging from ""interesting"" to ""historical curiosity"" to ""of zero value to even superfans."" But this mish-mash of sketches, practice-space woodshedding, and alternate-but-not-very mixes <i>does</i> help explain what makes <i>Nevermind</i> so unique.  Nirvana certainly never made another album like it. The precocious <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/"" target=""_blank"">Bleach</a></i> still has its partisans, folks who think its primal bash-and-howl is the be-all-end-all of rock, while <i>In Utero</i> stands as the band's most harrowing statement, where it's a toss-up as to whether the riffs or the lyrics hurt more. But <i>Nevermind</i> was and remains an unrepeatable object. It retains the gleeful pummel of the first album while hinting at the bleakness of the third. Yet there's also a concision and clarity that Nirvana hadn't quite mastered on the gnarly-by-necessity <i>Bleach</i> and wouldn't allow themselves on the stark and caustic <i>In Utero</i>.</p>
<p>Nirvana began their career with no illusions about their chances for mass success and ended it by seeing just how abrasive a platinum-selling band could get away with being. But when they got their chance at the brass ring, they went at it with a bubblegum band's canniness, however much Cobain shit on the shiny final product after the fact. Andy Wallace's radio-ready mix certainly helped sharpen this potentially no-concessions, indie-to-major leap into an obvious commercial proposition. But even if they'd settled on producer Butch Vig's slightly less slick mixes-- made as a reference for the band and identified on the super deluxe edition's third disc as the ""Devonshire mixes""-- <i>Nevermind</i> would likely have fared well in the charts, since these early passes aren't far from Wallace's infamous high-gloss version. Listening in hindsight, though, they have the woozy effect of feeling just slightly <i>off</i>, leaving you to focus only on what's missing.</p>
<p>The box set does make clear that Nirvana honed these songs over a long period. Listening to the various sessions leading up to the one that gave us the album we know-- especially the nearly unlistenable ""boombox"" mixes of early demos-- you learn very quickly that these songs didn't arrive perfectly formed in one sustained burst of inspiration. The hours of rehearsals and the expensive time spent tinkering in the studio shaped them into classics. It helped that there are songs on <i>Nevermind</i> that might appeal to people who've never heard a hardcore album in their lives, who might have even (gasp!) kinda liked the glossier hard-rock bands whose era largely ended with the rise of grunge. Moving away from the heavy-at-all-costs sound he'd always been both enamored with and suspicious of, Cobain worked diligently on his big hooks and decided to stop smothering his natural melodic gifts under so much self-conscious sludge.</p>
<p>The key was that Nirvana, unlike many of their indie peers, didn't assume that intensity was incompatible with polish. Cobain's discomfort could be unnerving because it sounded as unmediated as anything allowed on the radio could get. There was too much pop-rock study involved to claim <i>Nevermind</i> as some kind of art brut document of one dude's unraveling. Confronted with something like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdXy75VrQho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Polly</a>"", Cobain's distress was obvious in 1991, long before his shotgun-assisted exit. But it wasn't the way <i>Nevermind</i> exposed Cobain's psychic wounds that provided support for those who related to him. It was the fact that, fucked up as he was, Cobain still found pleasure in rock's most emphatic clichés and bent them to his own never-quite-smirking ends. He snuck into the spotlight while remaining an alienated weirdo, but for a while there, you suspected he was enjoying the attention, even if he knew that it was all a joke to be taken about as seriously as high school cliquishness. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCGvONbVCa0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Territorial Pissings</a>"" is as raw as any punk song I know, but it actually found its way into the hands of suburban tweens. How good must that have felt, to be responsible for such a thing?</p>
<p>Even as they moved toward the mainstream, Nirvana were trying shit that no one would have called an easy route to success. <i>Nevermind</i> is drenched in the filthy Pacific Northwest roar that slapped Cobain into action as a teen, but it's as catchy as any of the radio giants that caught his ear as a kid. It's driven by pain as naked and personal as the riot grrrl bands whose company he kept and as fuck-around goofy as the Seattle contemporaries who both reveled in and mercilessly parodied machismo. And despite the fact that none of those modes would seem to fit together on the same album, let alone all of them, it's all hammered into a still-disarming whole, a collection of anthems that retain the idiosyncrasies of the very weird band that made them. It helped that Cobain had yet to be disabused of the idea that you could be an idiosyncratic indie kid and a rock star without compromising on either front.</p>
<p>That's probably why the bonus material here feels less like a revelation and more like the kind of peek-behind-the-curtain that you wind up regretting. <i>Nevermind</i> is basically a great fake-out. It presents itself as an off-the-cuff explosion, a from-the-gut expression of realness and energy in the grand punk tradition, but it was actually the product of a shit ton of hard work. If you don't hold with the first-take-is-the-best-take philosophy, your respect for Cobain may actually increase when you realize how dedicated he was to getting every element right. Listening to him fumbling his way toward greatness on the ""boombox"" mixes of songs like ""Come as You Are"" and ""Something in the Way"" or hearing a newly cemented group working out the kinks in their interplay in the studio, you may also realize that you don't <i>want</i> to hear the missteps and rewrites and second guessing that went into the perfect-as-is final product. The ""boombox"" mixes, Devonshire mixes, and Smart Sessions (early Vig-produced takes recorded with drummer Chad Channing that were initially intended for release on a second album for Sub Pop) are largely work tapes. Listening to them feels like studying every unused scrap of a film classic that someone managed to sneak out of the editing room, which is about as fun as that description makes them sound. If you've always been suspicious of the album's production sheen, there's no Holy Grail here that's going to give you the raw take you're looking for.</p>
<p>For all its finessing and tweaking, though, <i>Nevermind</i> is still a thousand times closer to the unpremeditated intensity of Cobain's D.I.Y. days than any of the post-grunge rockers who claimed it as an influence. I defy you to listen to any of the live performances on this edition-- the only essential extras, though less uncomfortably intense than 1994's MTV <i>Unplugged</i> set and less definitive and uniformly powerful than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/"" target=""_blank"">2009's release</a> of their king-making set at the 1992 Reading Festival-- and not hear a ragged, joyful, charismatic band that makes those inert, angst-ridden followers sound like they come from another aesthetic universe.</p>
<p>That charisma is a big reason why <i>Nevermind</i> remains a 10. But in-concert takes on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QECJ9pCyhns&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sliver</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLrfVAdYuTY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Been a Son</a>"" that are the third most thrilling live versions officially available on CD? It's not as if all this ""exclusive"" dreck-- most of which has been floating around on bootlegs and .zip files and YouTube for eons-- will permanently dull the excitement of the <i>Nevermind</i>, but trying to swallow it all might put you off the album itself for a long while. If you're truly interested in hearing this stuff, the two-disc deluxe set is easily the better deal, giving you a little hint of the various stages of <i>Nevermind</i>'s construction without wearing you out the way the four-disc set will. But if you <i>really</i> want to celebrate the 20th, you'll be better off just giving the original album a few spins. Despite how much better-left-forgotten material is being offered up here as essential, there's still more life in the real <i>Nevermind</i> than anything that's attempted to replicate its attack since.</p></div>"|15854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/|10.0|Jess Harvell

At the time, the forward-thinking Swedish group was still very much performing within the metal tradition. On their 10th album, <i>Heritage</i>, they aren't. For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's <i>Damnation</i> gave a good idea of what Åkerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, <i>Orchid</i>, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (Åkerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: <i>Heritage</i>'s 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1225-dungen/"" target=""_blank"">Dungen</a>'s 2004 opus<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2575-ta-det-lugnt-expanded/"" target=""_blank"">Ta Det Lugnt</a></i> than Opeth's own <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11575-watershed/"" target=""_blank"">Watershed</a></i>.</p>
<p>The 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with Åkerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title  track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece Åkerfeldt  says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk  music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist  Björn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout ""Famine""), give <i>Heritage</i> a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"" target=""_blank"">King Crimson</a>-nodding lead track, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1436-the-devils-orchard/"" target=""_blank"">The Devil's Orchard</a>"", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes.</p>
<p>Another track, the muscular ""Slither"", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old Åkerfeldt, who says <i>Heritage</i> is an album he's been ""building up to write for  and participate on"" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. Åkerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, <i>Heritage</i> feels somewhat empty. It's the group's  most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: <i>Heritage</i> lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, Åkerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills.</p>
<p>The story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told Åkerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's ""The Triumph of Death"", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' <i>Yellow Submarine</i>. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into ""a pile of ex-members' skulls."" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing <i>Heritage</i>. Then comes the line of people ""want[ing] a piece"" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as ""observations"" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, <i>Heritage</i> too often feels like a passive, backward glance.</p></div>"|15866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15866-heritage/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

And yet the bands shared uncannily similar trajectories-- each was at the forefront of significant sea changes in its home country's independent music scene (lo-fi American indie rock for the former, Britpop for the latter), only to peter out around the turn of the millennium. Both bands' respective frontmen-- Stephen Malkmus and <a href=""http://www.brettanderson.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brett Anderson</a>-- have since embarked on solo careers that have seen each go to great lengths to redefine himself: Malkmus as a guitar hero, Anderson as a brooding balladeer. And both had to put those personal evolutions on hold last year to take their old bands on the reunion-tour circuit for the sole purpose of airing out their 90s-era classics, with no intention of recording new material.</p>
<p>That last point is underscored by the fact that, this year, to the month, Malkmus and Anderson have swiftly resumed their solo careers as if those Pavement and Suede reunions never happened. Like Malkmus' recent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15736-mirror-traffic/"" target=""_blank"">Mirror Traffic</a></i>, the origins of Anderson's fourth album, <i>Black Rainbows</i>, predate the reformation of his marquee band. But both albums are infused with the anticipation of what was to come: just as Malkmus reins in the Jicks-ian jamming on <i>Mirror Traffic</i> in favor of more Pavement-like concision, <i>Black Rainbows</i> sees Anderson-- after three relatively sullen and sedate solo releases-- cautiously reconnecting with his suppressed pop-star swagger. When he plaintively sings, ""give me your brittle heart and I'll light a fire,"" on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOIGxfr_6wg&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the album's lead single</a>, it's almost as if he's pleading for his old job back.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Black Rainbows</i> is some calculated '92 throwback. As ever, Anderson likes to speak in suggestive metaphors (""ashtray eyes,"" ""a sabotage of lipstick,"" ""burning mattress,"" ""paper cuts,"" ""carpet burns""-- the last two of which turn up on multiple songs), though his withered voice is far less elastic and outrageous than it was 20 years ago. And in lieu of Suede's glam-rock crunch, the new album mostly favors the atmospheric, middle-aged Brit-rock of, say, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH6TJU0qWoY&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Urban Hymns</i>-era Verve</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUl0d-PCUY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">latter-day Echo and the Bunnymen</a>. (The invitation to ""come taste the orange blossom"" on ""In the House of Numbers"" is especially McCullochian in its pastoral whimsy.) As such, there's often a palpable disconnect between Anderson's naughty narratives and the passivity of the performances: only in its accelerated, 40-second finale does the shimmering ""Crash About to Happen"" realize its potential as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD6Pq0bSMPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Stone Roses-worthy student-disco staple</a>, while the sluggish, bluesy swing of ""Thin Men Dancing"" sounds like it'd be more at home on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcOJu0g8dbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Beady Eye album</a>. But in the elegant opening ballad, ""Unsung"", and the ticking time-bomb intensity of ""The Exiles"", we hear a boldness that's largely been absent from Anderson's solo work to date. ""I am yearning/ I'm still burning,"" he dramatically declares on the latter-- and while <i>Black Rainbows</i> may represent more of a flickering flame than a raging inferno, it at least yields some evidence that Anderson's once-fiery persona has not been completely extinguished.</p></div>"|15862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15862-brett-anderson/|5.8|Stuart Berman

For the past couple of years, he's been releasing tapes for his one-man project <a href=""http://speculator.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speculator</a>, taking samples and blurring, frying, or completely eviscerating them. Much of his music to this point sounded like 1980s and early-1990s nostalgia blown apart from the inside. While the notion of sample-based music is usually accompanied by the image of someone hovering over a machine, Ray treats his compositions with the immediacy of a garage band finally figuring out its parts-- everything is usually nailed in the first take. Last year's <i>Lifestyle</i> featured hair-metal, chart-topping pop, and the Super Shredder scene of the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie all thrown into a torrent of distortion. It was an avant-garde, postmodern collage of blown-out pop music, carrying the woozy and deteriorating quality of a frequently malfunctioning VHS tape.</p>
<p>While <i>Nice</i> isn't as reliant on art-damaged nostalgic sign posts (it uses far fewer samples than his previous work), it certainly doesn't neuter Ray's flair for sonic exploration. The album effortlessly segues from 80s radio-ready pop-rock and chillwave to first-wave shoegaze and motorik. Ray can sound like he's from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29258-purling-hiss/"" target=""_blank"">Purling Hiss</a> School of Classic-Rock Appropriation in one move, and just as seamlessly turn in a lilting, ambient piece that may or may not be named after a member of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/368-black-eyed-peas/"" target=""_blank"">Black Eyed Peas</a>. There's the corrosive synth line that swells to the top of ""Design"", and there's the tape decay and clanging guitars that interrupt ""I'm a Slug"". What's remarkable about <i>Nice</i> is how cohesive it sounds in spite of the vast array of styles; it never submits to the ""album that sounds like a mixtape"" format; instead, it sounds like the work of an artist crafting everything he touches into something of his very own.</p>
<p>This is the first Speculator full-length pressed onto vinyl, and <i>Nice</i> is definitely a work of two sides. Side One sounds like an album all on its own, starting with the found-sound rumblings and spectral guitar line of the album intro and ending with album highlight ""(It's on) Every Channel"", a blaring drone track whose tempos and pitches are shifted by Ray using the tape machine itself as an instrument, a trick he uses more subtly on a few of the album's tracks. The four songs on Side Two feature a meditative pace, the album's final minutes a more glacial stride than the pop-focused numbers that populated Side One. Instead of ending with the slow burn of ballad ""Blue Rose"", <i>Nice</i> closes with the buildup of distorted synths that is ""Sweet Emotion"". Even without a drum track, the rhythm of the song's elements is hypnotic, eventually swirling into a vertigo of drone and delay effects, serving as the album's eroded, dissonant, and weirdly effective punctuation mark.</p></div>"|15863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15863-nice/|7.4|Martin Douglas

But the 90s aren't just a musical inspiration-- they're the band's entire aesthetic. They co-opted the typography and dinosaur from the <i>Jurassic Park</i> logo and slapped their own name on it. They named their band after Richard Linklater's 1991 film <i>Slacker</i>. Their lyrics cite ""Full House"", New Kids on the Block, and Bagel Bites. They have an entire song about a VHS collection and another one called ""Stuck in '93"". It's not a subtle implementation of the decade's many pastiches, nor is it meant to be.</p>
<p>Total Slacker's sense of humor is the album's driving force, and it's both overt and weirdly specific. The lyrics, for the most part, are a goofy celebration of the slacker caricature. Between the references to weed and various snack foods, and the record's languid pace, Rountree perpetuates the archetypal slacker character with his nasal whine. The track ""Thyme Traveling High School Dropout"", for example, is a <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>-style branding for a guy who goes back to the 18th century because marijuana isn't illegal then. And the title ""Stealing From Salvation Army"" says it all-- he plans on doing just that after he wakes up in the afternoon. That's pretty much the whole album. <i>Thrashin'</i> largely depends on buying into that character and thinking it's funny, or at least interesting, for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>At first, it works-- the aesthetic is clearly defined, and the jokey tone of each track functions as a cohesive statement. Most of the juvenile imagery is funny (""He's watching 'Full House', playing Sega on his Slip 'n Slide""), but an extended 1993 joke backed by a series of ""woo's"" and references to Crystal Pepsi ultimately doesn't stick. After you've heard the songs a few times, the gags become empty and start to sound like a roll call of 90s nostalgia keywords and stereotypes. And worse, some of the lyrics eventually grate (the second series of VHS references, for example).</p>
<p>It's up to the music itself to hold up the album, and for the most part, their alt-rock churn works in their favor. The hooks, grinding guitars, and ""ooh-waas"" of ""Psychic Mesa"" may drag, but they're catchy. If that song presents a joke, it's the most subtle one of the album (it's a song about an ideal psychedelic otherworld, and even if they're being ironic, it works). And thankfully Rountree is an adept guitarist. His style is reminiscent of some of their aforementioned influences, particularly Weezer and the Breeders. He uses a mild fuzz to accent simple, elegant guitar lines. ""Magical Date Night"" and ""High School Dropout"" open with mood-setting one-note solos that act as complete earworms. And even though ""Koolz Mccrulez"" is 11 minutes of one hook on repeat, it's offset by echoing psych guitars. It's a nice, spacey cooldown from the gimmickry.</p>
<p>It's impossible to ignore what <i>Thrashin'</i> is at its core-- a shrine to growing up in the 90s. Sure, there are references to things that are post-90s, like MySpace and Four Loko, but even those things are shellacked in irony at this point. <a href=""http://www.nypress.com/article-21241-dazed-and-amused.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oppenheimer said</a> that these songs were written as jokes, but they ended up having a good time with them, so they built the band with that general aesthetic. And maybe that's the most important thing: The songs can be fun, if only for a moment. Their narratives-- sharing pizza bagels in a bunk bed, going back in time to meet Miles Davis-- are weird and silly enough to warrant some kudos to Rountree as a weirdo and songwriter. But even with great hooks and bubblegum melodies, it's hard to imagine <i>Thrashin'</i> as an album that outlasts the initial series of laughs.</p></div>"|15853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15853-total-slacker-thrashin/|6.7|Evan Minsker

These records seemed at times curiously unambitious, coming as they did from one of the most forward-thinking American bands of the last decade and change. Wilco made their early reputation on their creative restlessness, their ongoing identity crisis, but since 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/"" target=""_blank"">A Ghost Is Born</a></i>-- still, by some distance, their most difficult work-- their music's seemed something of a retreat from their early-decade boundary-shoving. Wilco's great strength lies not just in Jeff Tweedy's world-weary inscrutability, but the ways he and the band matched those stark, sometimes startling sentiments to expectation-defying deconstructions of Americana. The best thing about<i> The Whole Love</i>, Wilco's adventurous, elliptical eighth LP, is the ease with which they've recaptured some of that old unpredictability: From <i>Being There</i> through <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, the band's best work has always perched itself upon the edge of traditionalism and experimentation, and <i>The Whole Love</i> is the first of their albums in years not to shy away from such risks.</p>
<p>As soon as opener ""Art of Almost"" whirrs to a start, you'll know something has changed. A glitchy motorik groove crashes into swarming strings before giving way to a slippery Tweedy melody; then it's elegant bass ooze and keyboard creep, over which Nels Cline drapes a searing <i>kosmische</i> capper. Fraught and foreboding, the song is easily the most daring thing they've put to tape since <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, a interstellar spin on <i>Wilco (The Album)</i>'s highlight ""Bull Black Nova"". It seems at first as much statement as song: The self-produced <i>Whole Love</i> is the first LP the band laid down entirely in their practice loft, and the brash, voluminous ""Almost"" feels like six musicians bottling themselves off from the world and pushing each other towards their breaking points. Though nothing else on <i>Whole Love</i> quite matches the exploratory zeal of ""Almost"", <i>The Whole Love</i>'s littered with enough alluringly off-balance arrangements and instrumental left-turns-- Cline's screaming guitar interludes on ""Born Alone"", the  gurgling keyboard underneath the otherwise old-timey ""Capitol City"", countless rhythmic exchanges between drummer Glenn Kotche and bassist John Stirratt-- to lend the record much of its precipice-teetering feel.</p>
<p>When <i>The Whole Love</i>'s not defying expectations outright, it's tweaking them gently. ""Capitol City"" comes across like Hoagy Carmichael for the ""Boardwalk Empire"" crowd, a moddish organ gives the bouncy ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12243-i-might/"" target=""_blank"">I Might</a>"" the spring in its step, and Tweedy's deft verse-ending vocal turnaround on highlight ""Born Alone"" is as sharp as it is sly. Much of <i>The Whole Love</i>'s midsection draws from this lineup's folk-rock foundation-- splitting the difference between <i>Being There</i>'s rockier material and the sunlit <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> stuff-- but these songs seems to bend and sway a little differently than they have in the past. The band, unchanged since the <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> days, seems increasingly comfortable as a musical unit; Cline in particular, whose hotshot contributions to Wilco's last two LPs sometimes felt like glorified session work, is both everywhere and nowhere, subtly coloring in the backdrops yet unafraid to step out into the spotlight. Kotche and Stirratt's aforementioned interplay does wonders even on the quiet numbers, keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen mirrors Cline's dialed-down everpresence, and Tweedy himself is still underrated as both player and arranger. Dressed-up with detail as <i>The Whole Love</i> can be, they know just when to it pull back.</p>
<p>In pre-release interviews, Tweedy's suggested many of <i>The Whole Love</i>'s lyrics were born of phonetic garble later wrestled into verse. That much would seem to be true of lines like ""The Magna Carta's on a Slim Jim blood, brother"" from ""I Might"", but when Tweedy sings, ""I wish you were here,"" on ""Capitol City""-- and then, seconds later, corrects himself with, ""And yet I wish I were there with you""-- his meaning's certainly clear. This back-and-forth between alluring nonsense and open-hearted sentiment isn't new for Tweedy, but here the sharp split leaves <i>The Whole Love</i> feeling a bit muddled. He's a devoted romantic one moment, detached and random the next, with far fewer of the knife-twisting standout lines that characterized the band's earlier work on either end of the spectrum. Tweedy's crushed-charcoal voice is as rich and immediate as ever, and though he brings it on the big numbers like ""Monday"" descendent ""Standing O"", he occasionally loses a syllable or two to nonchalance during the quieter moments.</p>
<p><i>The Whole Love</i> bows out with ""One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)"", a gently unfurling umpteen-minute heart-stopper loosely centered around a weekend with the Iowan author's paramour. The gorgeous, gripping ""Sunday Morning"" proves<i> The Whole Love</i>'s second major triumph, epic in length but intimate in effect. Unlike ""Art of Almost"", ""Sunday Morning"" does nothing to push out the band's boundaries; it is, rather, a very good, very long Wilco song, one that could've appeared on nearly any of their post-<i>A.M.</i> albums. But its length, coupled with its minute-to-minute success rate, leaves it feeling at once impressively ambitious and completely natural, the very midpoint mined by Wilco's three or four agreed-upon masterworks.</p>
<p>It took Jeff Tweedy years to get comfortable with his place in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4416-uncle-tupelo/"" target=""_blank"">Uncle Tupelo</a>, and a few more to truly settle into Wilco's first act. After a few years of constant sonic flux and personnel shifts, <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> and <i>Wilco (The Album)</i> found the band feeling more resolved than ever, a consistent lineup settling into what seemed increasingly like a signature sound. But Wilco's always seemed their most creatively surefooted atop uneven ground. So the weird, winsome <i>Whole Love</i> is certainly Wilco's least consistent LP in a while, but inconsistency has its own rewards. At its best, <i>The Whole Love</i> finds Wilco casting aside the caution, reveling in their own contradictions.</p></div>"|15856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15856-wilco/|6.9|Paul Thompson

And from the pillowy indie-pop numbers to the more stretched-out, soft drone pieces, it was the kind of record that just felt nice to hear. You wanted to cuddle up with it. But then there was ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11857-all-around-and-away-we-go/"" target=""_blank"">All Around and Away We Go</a>"", the slice-of-genius, introverted disco gem that suggested there was more to these guys than just pretty bedroom pop. <i>In Heaven</i>, their debut LP, very much supports that idea. It's a crisp-sounding, nuanced album that highlights all the right things about the band.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between <i>In Heaven</i> and Twin Sister's two previous EPs is that they've cleaned up their sound and tightened their arrangements considerably. Where individual sounds sometimes used to get swallowed in an underlying hiss, instruments now have room to breathe. Guitars sparkle, synthetic drumbeats strike with purpose, and singer Andrea Estella's charming vocal squeak is closer to the fore. Increasing the production value is more than just a technical upgrade-- it lets the band open up creatively and try different kinds of new sounds. And they do that with grace. From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>-like lounge-pop to R&amp;B-flecked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4691-young-marble-giants/"" target=""_blank"">Young Marble Giants</a> minimalism, these guys run the gamut.</p>
<p>While the sonic palette is definitely a lot wider, Twin Sister still keep the songwriting focus small and detailed. More interested in documenting life's minor moments than the big, transformative ones, they sing about things like recommending movies to friends or having an awkward crush go unspoken. Little stuff, but meaningful in its way. Take ""Stop"", for example, a track breathily sung by guitarist Eric Cardona and featuring a sultry R&amp;B thump. It reads heavy romance on first listen, but that's actually not the case. ""I keep telling myself to stop, to feel if I like it,"" Cardona sings, describing a new relationship he's trying to be responsible about. It seems he <i>doesn't</i> want to rush into sleeping with this person-- someone's feelings could get hurt that way.</p>
<p>This type of narrative might skew a little twee for some (and there is an element of that here, for sure) but it's one of the things that gives the band a sense of identity. Also, it's important to point out that they buoy these bashful sentiments with some really outward, bouncy music. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16122-bad-street/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Street</a>"" is set over choppy 1980s electro-funk, ""Daniel"" takes its cues from zoned-out space disco-- the songs have legitimate grooves. In the end, what's really impressive is that the mousey quality of their music doesn't work against these nimble, cosmopolitan arrangements. If anything, it makes the songs richer, gives them more of a backstory. Because Twin Sister operate with a good amount of subtlety, it can take some time to absorb all that, but give yourself over to this record, and it gives back.</p></div>"|15857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15857-in-heaven/|7.8|Joe Colly

On stage with his band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a>, he rocks out like Eddie Van Halen, even though the sound coming from the speakers could blend into your yoga teacher's chill-out mixtape. For his solo guitar work, McGuire dials down the bombast, jamming out on simple chord progressions funneled through a bevy of effects pedals.</p>
<p>McGuire has been releasing a consistent stream of tapes,  singles, and CD-Rs, both solo and with his band, since the  mid-2000s. So he's kicked around the noise and drone world long enough to  have a sense of the handicaps inherent in loop- and footpedal-based  music. Rather than using effects to gradually gather sounds into a sonic  layer cake, he lets his pedals act as an accompaniment and augmentation to his live playing. It gives his music more range, allowing for  peaks and valleys rather than a single, linear zone-out.</p>
<p><i>Get Lost</i>, the full-length follow-up to 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14758-living-with-yourself/"" target=""_blank"">Living With Yourself</a></i>, finds McGuire tightening his routine. It's a more deliberate, less improvisatory effort built around frequently recurring motifs-- mainly, gurgling loops and major key plucking. ""I really want the records to be more concise and to zone in on one idea and let it elaborate in different ways throughout the album,"" he <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/mark_mcguire/Page/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> following the release of his compilation record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15420-a-young-persons-guide-to-mark-mcguire/"" target=""_blank"">A Young Person's Guide to Mark McGuire</a></i>. ""Before maybe it was just getting stoned and jamming for a couple hours, and thinking, 'Man, this tape's going to rule.'"" Where <i>Living With Yourself</i> found McGuire sticking to moody, simple melodies, <i>Get Lost</i> inches up the volume a little.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12361-get-lost/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> uses a heavily filtered guitar loop to frame gently strummed chords, gradually inching forward in volume and intensity toward a fuzzy climax. ""Another Dead End"" slowly builds steam on a hypnotic krautrock riff before drifting into a three-chord progression. Though McGuire's sound is heavily influenced by European pedal gurus like Robert Fripp and Vini Reilly, there's something distinctly American in the sound of his soloing. The harmonized leads that end the song owe much to classic-rock radio. Where <i>Living With Yourself </i>struck a contemplative, reflective mood, <i>Get Lost</i> strives for a summery, optimistic feel.</p>
<p>He also takes a stab at vocals. On ""Alma"" he repeats the single line, ""It must resolve, we try and evolve."" The theme returns on ""Alma (Reprise)/Chances Are"". Anybody who has ever spent time with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4935-robbie-basho/"" target=""_blank"">Robbie Basho</a> record knows that, in the world of mystic new-age guitar, picking up the microphone can be a dicey proposition. McGuire fares fine, though: If anything, his singing provides an island of organic sound amid electronic squiggles.</p>
<p>Then again, he does just fine without words. On the nearly 20-minute closer, ""Firefly Constellations"", for instance, his live picking slips into and out of an ever-cresting wave of gurgling drones. It's easy to get sucked-- or, right, lost-- in. But even at his most chilled-out, there's always a hint of attitude to McGuire's music. The album's title can be interpreted in two different ways-- one that invites listeners to lose themselves amid a haze of lush, trippy guitar arpeggios and another, less friendly message to go away, or else.</p></div>"|15855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15855-mark-mcguire-get-lost/|7.9|Aaron Leitko

Vocalist Christopher Barnes sings in a quivering whisper, and these minimal accompaniments assure that their sound never becomes louder than a hush. But the Massachusetts duo's debut EP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14245-acid-and-everythingsevens/"" target=""_blank"">Acid and Everything</a></i>, showed just how much emotional intensity you could pack into compositions so spare, and how much could be suggested with so little.</p>
<p>Everything on <i>Breakers</i>, their first full-length, sounds frozen over: icy, quiet, austere. You know that eerie feeling when you find yourself alone in a huge public place that's usually crowded-- maybe a shopping mall or a playing field-- but at that moment is totally empty? This record sounds like a sustained version of that feeling. ""I Heard the Party"" juxtaposes echoing piano chords and a general sense of unease (""No one could have told you/ Your body would fail you"") with the refrain ""I heard the party's here"" floating across the track like the sound of dried up laughter. The word ""party"" feels so out of place in a song so pensive and lonely that there's something jarring about the experience. The feeling crops up repeatedly on <i>Breakers</i>: a sense of slow-motion detachment, a suggestion that there were signs of life here once, but you've arrived a couple of hours-- or maybe a couple of weeks-- too late.</p>
<p>In these blaring, hyperactive times, there's something refreshing about a record so comfortable with silence and pause. In that way, the elegance of <i>Breakers</i>' particular brand of minimalism is obliquely reminiscent of James Blake's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a>, or even Grizzly Bear's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"" target=""_blank"">Yellow House</a></i>. But there's something impenetrable about <i>Breakers</i>: It's not nearly as inviting or inhabitable as the worlds conjured by either of those records. Barnes' voice is haunting and lovely, but it doesn't display enough range to give this material any real emotional variety. <i>Breakers</i> effectively conjures a space unto itself, but it's one that lacks an easy entry point.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Breakers</i> has its moments of beauty. ""Lands"" begins with a faint pulse of low-end distortion like tiny landmines going off in the background and builds from there. ""252"" also has a cumulative intensity, and the succinct and powerful ""Red Arrow (John)"" showcases Kristen Drymala's cello playing. The strings often feel like the most corporeal elements of  the whole record-- Barnes' voice takes the shape of breath turned visible on a frigid morning. ""Wait until spring sets in,"" he sings on ""Tanager"". You get the feeling it's probably going to be a while.</p></div>"|15846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15846-gem-club-breakers/|6.9|Lindsay Zoladz

Obviously, he got from Point A to Point B explaining how romantic comedy isn't even really an artistic genre so much as a strict format whose monetary success is predicated on telling people what they're getting and then giving them exactly what they want. While <i>Romantic Comedy</i> is too scrappy and bummed-out for usage in cute montages anytime soon, Big Troubles' sophomore LP and first for Slumberland is still every bit as beholden to an overt sense of values: If 1990s indie revivalism gets you going like seeing <a href=""http://bigtroubles.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Aniston</a> and some other dude find true love does, it's easy to imagine a tagline saying ""from the people who brought you <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> and the producers from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12499-brighten-the-corners-nicene-creedence-ed/"" target=""_blank"">Brighten the Corners</a></i>…"" doing its risk-free aspirations justice.</p>
<p>Those familiar with last year's super-lo-fi <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14956-worry/"" target=""_blank"">Worry</a></i> will certainly be taken aback by Big Troubles' spruced-up presentation, but it's hardly surprising: It's not like they could go much further into the red than they did on their self-produced fuzzbomb of a debut. For the most part, they err on the bookish side of the Slumberland sound, dabbling in both U.S. and UK varietals of mope-pop while producer Mitch Easter (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12464-murmur-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Murmur</a></i>, <i>Let's Active</i>) shows a steady hand letting the ringing guitar leads and Alex Craig and Ian Drennan's hushed vocals exist in a soft and appealing glow.</p>
<p>But while I don't blame Big Troubles for reaching out to Easter, together they overshoot the mark and ultimately <i>Romantic Comedy </i>often feels like it's uncomfortable using language and volume more suitable for the library. Single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12253-misery/"" target=""_blank"">Misery</a>"" is certainly the pluckiest of the bunch and has inspired a few mentions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">the Smashing Pumpkins</a>, which is on point if you can find me the pre-<i>Adore</i> singles without the searing guitar work, cathartic lyrics, studio polish, or Jimmy Chamberlin on the drums. A nice major-thirds riff complementing a boyish, breathy vocal only gets you to the point of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4929-silversun-pickups/"" target=""_blank"">Silversun Pickups</a>.</p>
<p>It's a rare record of this sort that makes you think, ""If only they raged as hard as<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong/"" target=""_blank"">Belong</a> </i>does,"" but <i>Romantic Comedy </i>innocuously charms instead of breaking hearts or breaking anything really-- even the feedback-laced, vaguely glammy ""Time Bomb"" can't achieve the kind of escape velocity required to get them out of sounding like a rock band that doesn't actually rock. Still, they're precocious songwriters who know from a good hook: If you can get past its title rhyming with ""bad world,"" ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16247-sad-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Sad Girls</a>"" is a exceedingly catchy Britpop genre exercise, though the big key change sounds like them pressing too hard for extra credit. Likewise, ""Softer Than Science"" and ""Never Mine"" have a gorgeous shimmer and propulsion that similarly gets over some remarkably rudimentary ""mine""/""mind"" rhyme schemes. I suppose you can find the economy of the lyrics to be endearing, but it makes their awkward attempt at purple social critique on ""Make It Work""-- ""such little relevance in the perfumes of high culture""-- sound like they might be making fun of the National or something.</p>
<p>More typically, <i>Romantic Comedy </i>earns its title from Craig and Drennan's narrators mostly dealing with relationships that are ultimately doomed if they even get past the point of premature negation. It's perfectly fine for a half hour of commiseration or wish fulfillment for romantics who take their loneliness as evidence of their humanity: a treatise on the utter futility of heterosexual relations stems from a glossy magazine ad on ""She Smiles for Pictures"" (sort of a simplified, non-academic version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"" target=""_blank"">Jawbox</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvz1JQAPgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Savory</a>""), ""Engine"" wistfully reminisces of after-school heavy petting (sort of a simplified version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab</a>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwAUca79c4o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Looked Like Giants</a>""), and ""Minor Keys"" goes metacritical in its study of pop's emotional manipulation (<i>very much </i>a simplified version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpf6gJU3520"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rubber Ring</a>""). Of course, it's a bouncy piece of jangle pop referencing something other than itself, and that's <i>Romantic Comedy </i>writ small, appealing and in tune with admirable influences but ultimately lacking the sort of unpredictability or drama that can make <i>these </i>the songs that saved your life rather than reminiscent of ones that can.</p></div>"|15839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15839-romantic-comedy/|5.9|Ian Cohen

(Black metal can be a strange place: at times, it's more acceptable to remain boring and unknown than be ambitious and heard.) A couple of years later, United States black metal in general is at an interesting point. The scene, or lack thereof, is something I've been <a href=""http://www.believermag.com/issues/200807/?read=article_stosuy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">going on about</a> for the last few years; now, on the backs of crossover ""experimental black metal"" acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a>, it's nudging into even more mainstream corners. And this time, there's more at stake than the ire of a 16-year-old Darkthrone fan.</p>
<p>Sure, there are longtime USBM diehards like Inquisition, Absu, and Averse Sefira, groups who've been there for decades, and who will keep releasing strong albums without showing up on your non-metal friend's iPod. That said, even three years ago, nobody would've expected Liturgy to share the stage with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a> at a <i>New Yorker</i> festival. (Or, earlier this year, to play MoMA on their own merits, and not as part of a Banks Violette black metal-themed installation.) There will always be an underground, but these days, once you are outside of it, the opportunities are bigger. More important than scene cred and these crossovers, though, is the  fact that American black-metal bands-- no longer the punchline of  Scandinavian lifers-- are making truly staggering music.</p>
<p>Wolves in the Throne Room sit somewhere between the crossovers and the kvlt. Since forming in 2004, brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver (and the occasional rotating bandmate) have tied early-90s Northern European sounds (especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"" target=""_blank"">Burzum</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"" target=""_blank"">Ulver</a>) and the progressive reach of San Francisco forebears Weakling to the Pacific Northwest, pushing  the genre into new places without sacrificing its core. (Outspoken environmentalists, they live on a self-sufficient farm in Washington state.) To the chagrin of many of the band's later fans, they followed their biggest moment, 2007's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10956-two-hunters/"" target=""_blank"">Two Hunters</a></i>, with 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13030-black-cascade-malevolent-grain-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Black Cascade</a></i>, a collection of less-penetrable, 10-plus minute, stripped back, droning, unrelenting time-stretchers. Despite the running time, it was a pure, concise collection-- the sound that remains after the last log turns to ash in your campfire.<i> Celestial Lineage</i>, on the other hand, gains power via accumulation. (Press materials reference Popul Vuh, the Grateful Dead, Neurosis, and ""Theosophists, beatniks… the back-to-the-land movement, satanic hippies, tree-spiking anarchist punks."") It takes the blisteringly insistent, gorgeously rousing, hypnotic  repetitions on <i>Black Cascade</i> and jams them back into the more sylvan earlier records, 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9074-diadem-of-12-stars/"" target=""_blank"">Diadem of 12 Stars</a></i> and the aforementioned <i>Two Hunters</i>.</p>
<p>Where the past two albums each had four songs of longer duration, <i>Celestial</i> gives us seven, spacing out the mammoths with briefer interludes. Vocalist Jessika Kenney, who first surfaced on <i>Two Hunters</i> and has also worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3979-sun-city-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Sun City Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24526-asva/"" target=""_blank"">Asva</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26804-mamiffer/"" target=""_blank"">Mamiffer</a>, sings on three tracks. Former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a> howler (and current Mamiffer member) Aaron Turner contributes atmospheric chanting of the two-minute ""Permanent Changes in Consciousness"". ""Rainbow Illness"" introduces noisy synth washes, and  the dramatic, goth-liturgical chimes of the female-fronted, six-minute ""Woodland Cathedral"", feels like a continuation of <i>Two Hunter</i>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tTd25Pv6Cs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dea Artio</a>"".</p>
<p>It probably is. Wolves in the Throne Room consider <i>Celestial Lineage</i> the last installment in a trilogy that started with <i>Two Hunters</i>, and perhaps their last album as a band (at least in its current form)-- this is the climactic, colossal finale. In that regard, the epic, more metallic outpourings are the best they've done. We've posted the ethereal, harsh, 12-minute opener ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12323-thuja-magus-imperium/"">Thuja Magus Imperium</a>"", with its psychedelic guitar freakouts, chiming bells, female choirs, field recordings, endless guitar/synth sustain, buzzing shoegaze, and monster dynamics. The seven-minute ""Subterranean Initiation"", in turn, spirals into infinity, layering in keyboards that come off like a celestial choir amid the frantic drums and levitating guitars. They locate a harsher, more earthly feel on ""Astral Blood"", a song with an anthemic, post-punk vibe that surfaces after a windy, gently pastoral acoustic interlude. The 11-minute closing track, ""Prayer of Transformation"", works as a synth-entwinted instrumental for 5 minutes before Weaver screams: ""Lay your corpse upon a nest of oak leaves/ Wrapped in a star shroud repent your flesh/ A shadow child dissolves/  Meditate in a den of skins and straight poles... A vessel awaits built from owl feathers and moss,"" among other things. It's rare for a black-metal song to choke you up.</p>
<p>Despite being relative latecomers to the game, and even though they're fucking with  the template more than purists would like, <i>Celestial Lineage</i> feels like the contemporary American scene's defining statement after San Francisco group Weakling's seminal 2000 offering <i>Dead As Dreams</i>. Since their early days, Wolves have grown assured, but haven't overstepped. The sound is enormous, but remains organic (at times, you can almost hear leaves rustling). It's true black metal creating its own rules, and a testament to the band that it can tweak something this much and still sound like it's sticking to the script. That said, though it's not the purest version, it's also not the most  eccentric. In some ways <i>Celestial</i> feels like a throwback when compared to the  claustrophobic experimentation of some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan</a>'s headier pieces or the genre-shifting hyper-speed ""occult  metal"" of contemporary Absu. Thing is, though, unlike a lot of that other stuff, it also feels like a classic.</p></div>"|15835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15835-celestial-lineage/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

His smarmy 1970s hooks, new-wave crooning, and AM-radio aura aren't so much recycled as regurgitated, the sound of internalized pop culture projected back out, with many original qualities still intact. As his discography has grown, though, his songs have seemed less about other people's work than his own. His first big studio album, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14324-before-today/"">Before Today</a></i>, had its share of retro references but was most interesting for how it furthered his own history.</p>
<p>Pink's older days have returned via a ""one-off digital single,"" the 16-minute ""Witchhunt Suite for WWII"". He started the piece in 2001, right after the terrorist attacks of September 11 (eventually selling a CD-R of it at shows in 2007). This is a recently re-recorded version, but it retains his early penchant for cultural collage. Samples of George Bush speeches and news reports mix with lyrics that rhyme ""Bin Laden"" with ""Sodom"" and dadaist war chants like ""Building big bomb/ Building the bombs/ Building bombs."" The song's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43957-ariel-pink-remembers-911-with-new-video-witch-hunt-suite-for-world-iii/"">video</a> offers even more retro spew, hacking together 9/11 imagery, random ads, and tons of VHS debris, with Pink and his crew (including forefather <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2930-r-stevie-moore/"">R. Stevie Moore</a>) occasionally keyed over the montage, echoing cable-access parodists <a href=""http://www.timanderic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim and Eric.</a></p>
<p>It's all pretty fun, both as postmodern patchwork and nostalgia trip. But, at least at first, the only point seems to be the thrill of randomly tossing historically-charged words and images against the wall. It's tempting to let the point just be the great music-- ""Witchhunt Suite"" is intensely catchy, and its length allows Pink to stretch good ideas into better ones, moving from tight jamming to slow keyboard meditations to freaked-out climaxes. Still, you'd hope there'd be more to a 9/11 concept piece than awesome tuneage.</p>
<p>On further listens, there are points where ""Witchhunt Suite"" transcends the sum of its hooks. Take a moment when Pink moans, ""the human race is an invention of the West,"" over a cycling keyboard. The obvious dig is that the first world has marginalized the rest of the planet, but Pink's bigger point seems to be that everything is a construct. Whether art is random memories or finely tuned narrative, it's all fiction, a way of artificially ordering things that in reality are much messier. He's also implying that cheesy retro-pop, especially when it's done this well, can be as political as folk or punk. After all, if the whole human race is an invention, certainly genres are, too.</p>
<p>Having shot that conceptual hole into ""Witchhunt Suite"", Pink fills it with a chorus that's ironic and yet somehow beyond irony: ""Gonna get 'em/ We got 'em/ We gotta!"" He's clearly taunting the childishness of treating world politics like pro wrestling, but there's something joyful in the way he dives into that isolated slogan, freed from the baggage of its specific context. Afterward, Pink quickly drops back into 9/11 collage, randomly rapping about burning bras, ""mass deception,"" and U.S. domination. But at its peaks, ""Witchhunt Suite for World War III"" is more complicated than that.</p></div>"|15848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15848-witchhunt-suite-for-wwiii/|7.8|Marc Masters

Word had spread that the folklorist Alan Lomax (traveling with the English singer Shirley Collins and a 26-pound, two-track reel-to-reel tape machine) was hunting local artists to record for Atlantic Records. McDowell, who was born around 1904 in Rossville, Tennessee, had grown up imitating the still-nascent sound of the Delta blues, using an old pocketknife (and then a whittled-down bovine rib bone, and finally the squat neck of a Gibson's gin bottle) as a rudimentary slide. By the time McDowell, then 55, cornered Lomax on Young's porch, his scope (and his skill) had broadened, and the sound he made-- a mesmerizing, groove-based blues that both nodded to and defied his Delta predecessors-- instantly captivated Lomax, and eventually the world.</p>
<p><i>Fred McDowell: The Alan Lomax Recordings</i> (available as a download through Global Jukebox, the Alan Lomax Archive's digital imprint, and on LP via Mississippi Records) opens with Bukka White's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjCXIdLrD58"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shake 'Em on Down</a>"", a song that McDowell appears to enjoy playing more than he enjoys breathing or eating or maybe doing anything else at all.  Following Lomax's prompt-- ""1, 2, 3, go,"" he commands in his high, nasal voice-- McDowell locks into a heavy, propulsive groove, while his sister, Fanny Davis, blows into a homemade kazoo that Lomax, in <i>The Land Where the Blues Began</i>, described as ""a fine-toothed comb wrapped in toilet paper"" (it sure is loud). ""Shake 'Em on Down"" is a bracing introduction to the cadence of North Mississippi Hill Country blues: McDowell's guitar is disorienting and relentless, so rhythmic and mind-bending that if you were to, say, listen to it while driving down a dark road in the rain, you'd likely veer off into a ditch (and then feel relieved). Davis' kazooing-- itself vaguely lawless-- provides a welcome counterpoint (it's like staring at a fixed point on the horizon while trying not to vomit over the side of a boat), while Miles Pratcher (of the excellent local square dance band the Pratcher Brothers) assaults a second guitar. The result is mystifying and spectacular.</p>
<p>McDowell's rendition of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L2aUSSfO38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Good Morning Little Schoolgirl</a>"" (a deeply fucked-up-- if not particularly uncommon-- ode to little girls, made famous, first, by Sonny Boy Williamson, and then again by the Grateful Dead) is more of a showcase for his nimble guitar work than any rogue sexual proclivities. McDowell's muted delivery of the lyrics (""Good mornin' 'lil school girl/ Can I go home, can I go home with you?/ Tell your mama and your papa/ Lord, I'm a little school boy, too"") is merciful; he's politely disinterested, if not fully disengaged. McDowell reserves his howls of longing for slightly less uncouth fare, like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECcQPqfrRII"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Worried Mind Blues</a>"", an unrequited love song he imbues with legitimate anguish (""You make me weak and you make me moan,"" he groans, sounding broken). Mostly, though, the rhythm is the thing: With his twangy, piercing strums, McDowell establishes himself as a singular player, infinitely more interested in the transcendental than the germane. Somehow, he manages to make the acoustic guitar-- that purveyor of sweet lullabies!-- sound menacing, not familiar.</p>
<p>After McDowell was featured on one of Lomax's <i>Sounds of the South</i> compilations, he enjoyed considerable acclaim outside of north Mississippi (the timing was right with the folk revival of the 1960s gathering steam) and more than a dozen solo LPs, although none approaches the looseness of his first session for Lomax. In 1971, the Rolling Stones <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUCoQryE7-k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered</a> McDowell's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtlVSedpIRU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Got to Move</a>"" for <i>Sticky Fingers</i>; it's a sluggish and deliberate rendition, and Jagger's approximation of McDowell's worn, scratchy voice feels both flat and affected. A year later, McDowell died of stomach cancer; his body, swaddled in a silver lamé suit (a gift from the Stones), is buried at the Hammond Hill Baptist Church, near Como, Miss. Supposedly, Bonnie Raitt-- a guitar student of McDowell's-- paid for a new headstone after the original misspelled his name.</p>
<p>It's awfully easy to approach archival releases-- and field recordings, especially-- with a detached reverence, at least in part because they were rendered spontaneously on front porches and in backyards, miles from the formal, self-conscious fussing of the recording studio. Consequently, any and all fidelity issues tend to be heard as sepia-toned, ""atmospheric"" snafus (oh, crickets!); judgment is clouded by access, and we feel lucky-- embarrassed, even-- to be privy to these odd little moments at all. Accordingly, what's most remarkable about <i>The Alan Lomax Recordings</i> is its spectacular re-mastering job (per the Portland-based engineer Timothy Stollenwerk); now, it's possible to divorce these songs from their contexts long enough to be properly flabbergasted by McDowell's hypnotic, eager performance (although, should you get curious, the collection is also beautifully annotated by Arhoolie Records' Adam Machado and the Lomax Archive's Nathan Salsburg). None of these tracks was previously unreleased (all have appeared, in one form or another, on various compilations, many long out of print), but <i>The Alan Lomax Recordings</i> still feels revelatory-- and for his part, McDowell still sounds spectacularly alive.</p></div>"|15801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15801-the-alan-lomax-recordings/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

A onetime member of Memphis stalwarts the Compulsive Gamblers and the Oblivians, he's also recorded a handful of albums under a variety of aliases, plying a mid-fi, R&amp;B-tinged boogie rock that has more in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a> or how you wish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4889-new-york-dolls/"" target=""_blank"">New York Dolls</a> sounded than with his former projects. <i>Rat City</i>, released under the Jack Oblivian moniker, is a solo record in the truest sense, with Yarber playing almost all the instruments himself and only occasionally outsourcing to local musicians like librarian/badass Ross Johnson and local guitarist John Paul Keith. These songs are Camaro'ed out, streamlined for headlong tempos and seedy urgency.</p>
<p><i>Rat City</i> is not ironic cock rock: Oblivian betrays no smirk, just a coolly stoic expression capped with dark sunglasses. What should be limiting, however, is instead a blueprint for a stylistically diverse album, one that changes shape and direction almost with every song. <i>Rat City</i> is a bustling, ungentrified metropolis: Memphis standing in for 1970s New York City. With its disco-derived bassline and close-to-the chest drumming, ""Crime of Love"" wields a mirrorball as a murder weapon, and Yarber's cover of ""Moses &amp; Me"" mugs the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYs35KgbHQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tommy James original</a>, drenching it in distortion but maintaining the original blues-pop energy. His greatest reach may be the album's greatest payoff: Local indie-pop outfit Star &amp; Micey back him on ""Girl on the Beach"", which sounds like boardwalk-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Springsteen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1189-dexys-midnight-runners/"" target=""_blank"">Dexys Midnight Runners</a> kicking over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>' sandcastle. It's an adult summer anthem with a fall release, a discrepancy that more or less sums up the song's sense of wistful frustration with unattainable people and unreachable places.</p>
<p>The downside of this rambling aesthetic is that Yarber occasionally comes across as a cipher, too cool and detached to maintain a specific perspective from one song to the next. Instead, what threads the album together isn't his vocals or even the songwriting, but the guitars. Yarber is a slyly inventive player, deploying concise riffs in a variety of styles and changing them subtly with each repetition. By himself, he's a commanding presence, but he's even better when he can bounce off a second guitarist, like Keith or Jake Vest. They bluster bluesily through ""Mass Confusion"" and roll out Bakersfield variants on ""Kidnapper"", simultaneously enabling the stylistic digressions to cohere into a focused record. They lend <i>Rat City</i> its punk shrewdness and endow these songs with a prickly intelligence that makes what could have been dumb rock sound seriously smart.</p></div>"|15841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15841-rat-city/|7.5|Stephen M.

Because of a relative formlessness and a lack of narrative-building lyrics, many of the ways artists assert themselves are via extra-musical details like album art, liner notes, or artist bios on the far wonky side of the spectrum. Think, for instance, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s genre-defining essays to the nature-worshipping or the botanically-themed titles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/354-biosphere/"" target=""_blank"">Biosphere</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28302-brock-van-wey/"" target=""_blank"">Brock Van Wey</a>, aka <a href=""http://bvdub.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bvdub</a>, offers another good example. Van Wey is a hyper-prolific ambient producer-- six full-length releases this year alone, counting one collaboration with Ian Hagwood-- whose deeply sentimental titles (""This Place Had Known Only Sadnes"", ""There Was Nothing But Beauty in My Heart"") and cover art of cold, lonely landscapes lit from within by a heavenly glow, place him in a corner one might term ""emo-ambient.""</p>
<p>It's a minor niche, maybe, but bvdub is hardly alone. Ghostly International artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26580-the-sight-below/"" target=""_blank"">the Sight Below</a> has leveraged similarly sad-sack song titles-- ""Feeling Lost Forever"", ""Burn Me Out From the Inside""-- to evoke goth's mope and shoegaze's introversion. (The Sight Below's also gone so far as to record an actual <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> cover, making the leap from mere signposting to straight-up homage). A certain type of music fan  might be disposed to see these weepy  marble-notebook poetry headings as kind of a flipside to the playful and  potty-mouthed wordiness that helped distinguished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2504-the-locust/"" target=""_blank"">the Locust</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2279-kid606/"" target=""_blank"">Kid  606</a> as abrasive sonic pranksters rather than faceless avant noisemakers.</p>
<p>The songs on bvdub's newest, <i>I Remember,</i> tend to follow a standard ambient formula, one made most familiar to indie audiences via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Voigt</a>'s masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a> albums for Kompakt, on whose Pop Ambient series Van Wey has also appeared: a wash of sound builds-- layers of white noise, echo, and submerged melodies-- gradually reaching a climax sustained and minutely varied for minutes on end. Out of these slowly shifting clouds, any number of distinct elements (massed choral voices, the metallic pluck of an individual guitar string, echoing finger snaps) might emerge before being swirled back into the fog. Which is not to say the songs are mere static-- a single track (all but one of which on the 78-minute album clocks in at 13 minutes or more) might subtly evolve through multiple movements before you realize they've passed. There are also slight but noticeable deviations from the ambient template: ""Would It Be the Same"" begins as a piano played in a bottomless well of reverb but gives way to the album's lone beat-driven passage, full of prickly, brittle-sounding hi-hat skitter.</p>
<p>Personality is a different concern from mood, of course, and <i>I Remember</i> would be thick with mood even without the handy reference points of track names and album covers.

Seldom does such wonderful music sound so comically awful when you try to describe it to someone. ""Man, he's amazing, like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BITaKu5Pm1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neil Sedaka</a> with a bit of a head cold singing over the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_wFEB4Oxlo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Boat</i> theme song</a>."" By the time you get that far, dude is already backing away slowly. A Swedish indie-pop dramatist who introduces sarcastic modernity to the most gloriously moribund styles of the 20<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">th</span> century-- from orientalist world music to suburban exotica-- Lekman guides an enthusiastic tour through the dustiest yard-sale record collections, conjuring obscure shades of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBupII3LH_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Henry Mancini</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4r5C6MUqO4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harry Belafonte</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bobby McFerrin</a>. Smooth saxes and indigenous flutes jostle against some of the most quotable one-liners this side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a>. Listening to him gives me strange urges, like downloading the latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a> discography.</p>
<p>With such an approach, it would be easy to slip into actual decadence or mere parody. Lekman, a slippery character, avoids both because of his rich, alloyed personality, which can sop up any amount of pink champagne. He whisks us out of the authenticity-obsessed house that punk built into provinces where music more openly embraces the attributes of the actor, taking a stance of ebullient knowingness toward the abundant variety and complex artifice on the fringes of pop. He's very clever with frames, using vocal inflections and contextual cues to pack whole ways of life into deceptively simple lines. On his previous full-length record, 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10620-night-falls-over-kortedala/"">Night Falls Over Kortedala</a></i>, he sang, ""I was slicing up an avocado/ When you came up behind me."" Not much on paper, but when activated by Lekman's exaggeratedly tony diction and cozy music, it captured the texture of a contemporary bourgeois existence in one gnomic stroke. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2550-the-lucksmiths/"">The Lucksmiths</a> were great at this same kind of evocative shorthand, though Lekman brings to it a slightly more jaundiced eye.</p>
<p>Lekman's new <i>An Argument with Myself</i> <span> </span>EP is a compact gem. It tilts this way and that to show different facets of the singer: his  ruminative side, his topical side, his devotional side, his wicked  humor, skewed insight, and flawless banality. At less than 18 minutes, there isn't a wasted moment. Each song does something distinct both sonically and lyrically, filtering one rarified but relatable sensibility through guise after revealing guise. We meet Lekman the flâneur, the desultory anecdotalist, the affable trickster. You can practically see the emotions mugging on his face as he gets into character, the startled eyes or the lopsided grin. There are elements of droll pastiche, like how the goofy horns on ""New Directions"" take a seamless turn to resemble the augustly rational <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVUJjPzRb2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jean-Joseph Mouret music</a> made famous by <i>Masterpiece Theater</i>. But Lekman is equally a throwback to songwriters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"">Paul Simon</a>; gifted raconteurs who weren't afraid to try just about anything and trusted their sweet, creamy voices to make it work.</p>
<p>If Lekman owes Simon any debt, it's paid in full on the title track, a sparkling Afro-Caribbean whirl that sounds like a 21st-century European's answer to <i>Graceland</i>. The elliptically conversational lyrics, the clotted backing harmonies, the thin line between singing and mellifluous speech, the existential undertow of Lekman's self-interrogation while wandering through Melbourne, his new home-- Simon probably would’ve stopped short of crying ""Why ya' hitting yourself? Why ya' hitting yourself?"" but otherwise they're totally simpatico. Lekman's thoughts meander with his footsteps, which lead him in surprising but just-right directions. There's a song about stalking Kirsten Dunst while she filmed <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzD0U841LRM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melancholia</a></i> in Lekman's native Gothenburg that works overtime as both an ode to provincialism and a protracted joke, complete with a droopy slide-whistle punchline. And whenever we find our own feet in a song, Lekman pulls the rug out from under us. He uses key changes to signal transitions between social criticism and personal pledges on the convalescence card ""A Promise"", and switches narrative perspective midstream on the plush reggae closer so that what we initially heard as snarky small talk is suddenly bathed in a touching romantic glow.</p>
<p>There's a lot to be said for exploring the nuances of clichés in songwriting, and most of it has been said. Listening to Lekman makes me sharply aware of how the generic and the cryptic have come to dominate pop lyrics, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Lady Gaga</a> on down to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"">Girls</a>. The modern lingua franca is an abstract slipstream of memories, slogans, admonitions, and impressions, as if emotional states were free-floating entities, unmoored from specific experiences. This mode is ideal for self-projection and introspection, both valuable quantities. But Lekman's music makes me think more about other people than myself. For all of their polished mannerisms, his songs are uncommonly free of pretenses-- they're about people, places, and things that happened or could happen in the world; about how we spend our time and how we talk to each other. Against a backdrop of enigmatic universalism, musicians who undertake the ticklish business of pinning down the minutiae of human affairs are very dear. Alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Dan Bejar</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a>, Jens Lekman stands tall among them.</p></div>"|15850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15850-an-argument-with-myself/|7.9|Brian Howe

It wasn't long after his collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a> on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/"" target=""_blank"">Ys</a>.</i> brought him some fresh headlines, but I mostly  asked about his long, itinerant career as arranger for three decades of rock musicians, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"" target=""_blank"">the Byrds</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright/"" target=""_blank"">Rufus Wainwright</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/381-frank-black/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Black</a>. After amiably answering my questions, he signed off, semi-sardonically, with ""Thank you, Jayson, for celebrating a position that perhaps serves best in its anonymity.""</p>
<p>The remark seemed half self-deprecating jab, half mission statement: Parks has a career-long acquaintance with anonymity.  His most well-known association is with a record that, for thirty-odd years, was famous for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/"" target=""_blank"">never coming out</a>. His solo records, starting with 1968's confounding Harry Nilsson-meets-Charles Ives opus <i>Song Cycle</i>, are subjects of fervent cult adoration but known to few.  His arranging work, meanwhile, has put an inimitable stamp on American pop, though the vast majority of music fans have no idea when they are listening to his work. He is the quintessential liner-notes hero, in other words, which makes the overview of <i>Arrangements, Vol. 1</i>, on his own label Bananastan, that much more gratifying.</p>
<p>The compilation is curated by Parks himself, drawing on what he calls ""my earliest studio adventures in the 60s."" The roster of collaborators represented here is dizzying-- Little Feat, Arlo Guthrie, Sal Valentino, Bonnie Raitt singing calypso-- and hearing Parks' unifying hand presiding over this collision of styles makes for a wonderful way to experience the art of his arrangements; their lushness, their invention, how they provide the texture and teeth to a composition. He opens with an arrangement ripped off the bones of the song it was meant to accompany: a mono single mix of Donovan's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqkS5dVMbNc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Donovan's Colours</a>"". It's a gently instructive focusing tool for the rest of the album, training our ears to go to the margins, to pay attention to the filigree.</p>
<p>Not that Parks' arrangements need much prompting to be noticed. They don't exactly fade demurely into the background; they jostle and blurt, intruding brazenly into the songs they support. His arrangement for Sal Valentino's goofy zydeco number ""Alligator Man"" boasts not  one vigorously sawing fiddle, but two-- on top of twinkling mandolins,  a seasick tuba groaning low notes, snatches of saloon piano,  and a piping saxophone. It sounds horrendously overcrowded on paper, but Parks has an uncanny instinct for how to densely populate a composition's every corner without choking it. The instruments are spaced evenly in the mix, and the result feels like a bustling table of gregarious friends instead of a crazy-making riot.</p>
<p>All of these embellishments, of course, were obsessively layered and re-layered onto increasingly overworked analog tape, and <i>Arrangements</i>, which kicks off with the sound of a rickety reel-to-reel firing up, is also partly a tale told by that tape. Parks' arrangements come through intriguingly warped, as if all the instruments on the track had been fished from a flooded studio floor, and the wobbly, dazed sound world that results, however accidental, is crucial to the record's appeal. The sumptuous string orchestra Parks supplies to Arlo Guthrie's take on the Appalachian standard ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGL97ahYii0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Valley to Pray</a>"", sounds gelatinous, a symphony viewed through a fish-bowl.  The Mojo Men's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-e3-yeWxV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sit Down I Think I Love  You</a>"" would be a standard-issue mod-pop song in a simpler context, but Parks' arrangement sends the song stumbling through a haze of slide guitar and bandoneón that feels like linoleum curling in real time. It's nearly impossible to pick out every individual instrument from the soup on these songs (is that a harp? a celesta? a  zither?), but the sound world is wonderfully dense and liquid, and it fills headphones like sunlight flooding a window.</p>
<p>The songs selected on <i>Arrangements</i> are uniformly fantastic. Bonnie Raitt's cover of Calypso Rose's racy ""Wah She Go Do"" is hilarious and startling, and Jimmy Cliff's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRoJyaZW6SA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sitting in Limbo</a>"" gets an improbably gorgeous reading by Dean Martin's son Dino. But trying to imagine them without Parks' additions, as the compilation encourages you to, is illuminating. Pop-song arrangements tend to hide in plain sight, and are usually practiced by spotlight-averse eccentrics who fit comfortably into neither the classical or the pop worlds. But the pop universe would be drained of color without them-- try to hear the Delfonics' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=375vwVZ7uAs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La-La (Means I Love You)</a>"" without its nimbus of strings, or, for that matter, the Beach  Boys' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_wBbS7I08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surf's Up</a>"" without the distant horns and chimes. <i>Arrangements</i> is a joy to spend time with, but it also amounts to a pretty forceful argument for the lost art of arrangement itself, and for Parks as one of its unrivaled masters.</p></div>"|15840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15840-van-dyke-parks-arrangements-vol-1/|8.6|Jayson Greene

He's a producer from London, a designation that, these days, might bring to mind dubstep and UK bass-- but despite some enthusiastic co-signs from publications that orbit around that scene, White ain't part of it. He works in sticky, abstracted hip-hop rhythms coated in THC resin; 2009's <i>The Strange Dreams of Paul White</i>, one of his earlier full-lengths (all of which can be heard on <a href=""http://paulwhite.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Bandcamp page</a>) found Captain Beefheart bumping up against weirded-out boom-bap.</p>
<p>Those previous releases felt homemade and somewhat amateurish, a distinction which makes <i>Rapping With Paul White</i> a bit of a coming-out party: there's equal parts mutant funk and dusty beats here, but it sounds like White's first true statement of purpose, his own preferred introduction to new listeners. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also his first LP that largely features guest vocals (this is where the <i>Rapping</i> comes in); White's gathered names both recognizable (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>, Homeboy Sandman, frequent past collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5639-guilty-simpson/"" target=""_blank"">Guilty Simpson</a>) and not-so-recognizable (Marv Won, Moe Pope, Tranqill).</p>
<p>So this is a record that depends as much on what the spitters bring to the table as what White cooks up in the lab-- and, unfortunately, the rappers don't exactly come correct. Considering how he and White have a past history of collaborating, you'd think that Guilty Simpson and White would be firing on all cylinders by now; instead, the Detroit hardhead unfurls cliché after cliché and drops vague, autobiographical teases that don't reveal much in particular. (Though he gets points for the ""murdering mic's like Conrad Murray"" line in ""Dirty Slang"".) His performances are uninspiring enough to think that of last year's full-length collab with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>, the cleverly titled <i>OJ Simpson</i>, relied solely on 'Lib's beatcraft.</p>
<p>Fellow Motor City spitter Marv Won rides the chant-knock of ""Run Shit"" ably, but spoils the broth by getting corny about Heath Ledger; Queens native Homeboy Sandman, on the other hand, basically recounts a trip to England on ""A Weird Day"", which is about as thrilling as it sounds. Even Danny Brown, another Detroit rapper that is having a very good year with his excellent, audacious <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"" target=""_blank"">XXX</a></i> mixtape, is smothered by the spiraling carnival melodies and game-show filth of ""One of Life's Pleasures"", his trademark excitability barely registering. The only rapper that comes out of this unscathed is White's labelmate Tranqill, whose cadences on ""Rotten Apples"" match well with White's searing, void-creating beat.</p>
<p>There are instrumental versions of <i>Rapping With Paul White</i> out there and I strongly suggest seeking out those versions, if only to feel the blunt impact of White's strongest moves (the spooky claps of ""Trust"" and ""Indigo Glow"", in particular). You could take a rap-less version of this LP and convince your friends that it's a beat tape from Madlib or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no/"" target=""_blank"">Oh No</a>, a quality that speaks as much to White's influences as it does his lack of a specific identity. Thing is, copping to Stones Throw influences almost seems quaint these days, as anyone with an ear to the ground has noticed that much of the underground hip-hop that's in vogue relies on quiet introspection, stronger drugs, and ambient, eerie beats made by people who inexplicably refer to themselves as Friendzone. The fact that <i>Rapping With Paul White</i> sounds so old-head suggests that the ""Stones Throw sound,"" made most popular by the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J. Dilla</a>'s inimitable <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank"">Donuts</a></i>, is on the verge of transitioning from old school to just plain old.</p></div>"|15852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15852-rapping-with-paul-white/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

She appeared in a handful of films and worked with a street theater troupe but really found her calling later, when she took up the guitar and started writing songs. Born in Cote d'Ivoire and raised in southern Mali, Diawara grew up hearing Wassoulou music, a song style that's thought by some ethnomusiclogists to be one of the main pre-colonial ancestors of blues. The Wassoulou cultural area is now split between three countries, but it has a history that extends back centuries, and Diawara merges that long, traditional history with a modern, globalized sensibility on her debut album.</p>
<p>Diawara has honed her performing and recording craft through work with AfroCubism, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27357-orchestre-poly-rythmo-de-cotonou/"" target=""_blank"">Orchestre Poly-Rythmo</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/"" target=""_blank"">Herbie Hancock</a>, among others, so really the big step here is to recording her own songs with her own arrangements. She has a voice with a naturally sensual glide to it that sometimes reminds me a little of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>. Unlike many of her peers, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28081-oumou-sangare/"" target=""_blank"">Oumou Sangaré</a>, power is not really a part of her style-- she keeps her singing even and steady to complement the hypnotic, cycling guitar parts of her arrangements. The album is quietly intense, rarely rising above the volume of ordinary conversation.</p>
<p>Diawara sings in her native Wassoulou language, but understanding the exact content of the songs isn't necessary to enjoy them. There's plenty of information in the melodies and rhythms, and inventive musicianship as well. Diawara locks in with the simmering funk backdrop of ""Bissa"" by playing harmonics on her guitar instead of full chords. The electric leads seem to float up out of the patterns; several times over the course of the album, I found myself caught up in a flowing solo that I didn't even notice when it started. This is how the whole record works. There's no fanfare, nothing is announced. It simply surrounds you with its atmosphere.</p>
<p>It is an ultimately beguiling album because of this. Even in its most demonstrative moments, such as the shivering lead guitar line that opens ""Bakonoba"", it's a record you can sink into and enjoy for its sonics as well as its songwriting. ""Bakonoba"" is among the songs with the strongest West African character, and that guitar is a big part of it-- it's reminiscent of the type of lead Malian guitarists Djelimady Tounkara or Kant<span>é</span> Manfila might have once laid down for the Rail Band. Otherwise, Diawara is one of a growing number of musicians working on a sort of pan-folk sound that incorporates influences from across a broad Afro-Western cultural spectrum. It's an approach that may be a better fit for the ""world music"" label than any of the highly localized sounds that tag's often applied to.</p></div>"|15838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15838-fatou/|7.6|Joe Tangari

Ward demonstrates an impressive sensitivity in picking out elements of these genres and styles that can be pieced together in ways that are texturally satisfying and often beautiful.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, what is he building? That's the question that gets Ward stuck at times throughout the album. For the most part Ward wants to make pop music here, albeit a pop that's refracted through layers of wistful haze and humidity. Ward sings on most of these tracks, yet while his voice does have a pleasantly boyish, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a>-esque quality at times, little-to-zero effort is invested in making the vocals anything more than another quietly pretty element floating through the mix. So it's up to Ward's soundscapes to communicate any sort of urgency or momentum or drive. When they do, the results are both intoxicating and memorably tuneful. <i>Parodia Flare</i>'s first proper song, ""Mouves"", features a pretty affectless vocal turn, but fortunately gets carried by thrumming bass and steady drums to a neat little hook of pulsing tones. In this context, the track's decorative elements, all its chimes and soupy synths, don't have to worry about carrying the song and can serve their ideal function as colorful embellishment.</p>
<p>Ward's real saving grace on <i>Parodia Flare</i> is the guitar, which he utilizes in unexpectedly welcome ways to propel his compositions, keeping them from dissolving into murky keyboard washes. In particular, the title track, ""Playgrounds"", and ""After Visiting"" draw delicate, glinting melodies from the instrument. You spend those songs listening to the guitars then waiting for them to come back-- they lends the tracks a logic and tension that don't exist in some of Ward's other efforts, where less-distinctive sonic elements wander in then bleed away without conveying the sense that they're intrinsic to some greater whole. Ward has already proven he knows how to paint really lovely scenes through sound. Now he just needs to figure out how to best set those scenes in motion.</p></div>"|15849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15849-parodia-flare/|6.7|Joshua Love

Hebden listened without prejudice, a value prized by both the post-rock and DJ communities he came out of at the tail end of the 1990s. Even as eclecticism took a beating in the early 2000s, with mash-up acts and bedroom DJs turning the whole idea into a one-note joke or a cheap way to get noticed, Hebden never shied away from mixing it all up, provided the whole felt greater than the trick of joining seemingly incompatible parts.</p>
<p>Fabric has made a point of flagging Hebden's new mix for its sonic and conceptual unity. Certainly it does feel all of a piece compared to his last commercially released mix, a 2006 installment for the DJ-Kicks series that swerved from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/42-akufen/"" target=""_blank"">Akufen</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>. By contrast, <i>Fabriclive 59</i> sticks pretty consistently to one scene. But it's a restless scene built on a premise of constant reinvention: UK garage, which from the late 1990s to the early 2000s mutated from a simultaneously roughed-up and opulent take on house music to the fierce and rap-derived clang-and-bang of grime.</p>
<p>So already we've got the promise and surprise inherent in a famously eclectic selector bringing a freshness and fearlessness to music usually only spun by purist DJs sticking to music from within the scene. On that level, Hebden doesn't disappoint. For one thing, he includes ringers from way outside late-90s London, like Ricardo Villalobos. And despite their modern, weirdo-techno palette of sounds, these left-field inclusions fit perfectly with the vibe of the old-school tunes, especially the way someone like Villalobos treats his own heavily syncopated drums. As usual, it's to Hebden's credit as a DJ that he hears ways to join old and new that others might not.</p>
<p>But this is also a pretty unexpected and exciting way to tackle a big-time commission from Fabric, especially considering the <i>Fabriclive</i> series tends to focus on up-to-the-minute dance sounds rather than the archival impulse. UK garage as an inventive and real-time underground phenomenon already seems a distant part of dance history, despite being only about a decade gone. So for longtime garage heads, Hebden's obsessive crate-digging will provide them with lots of unfamiliar and almost lost-to-history moments of genius. I've spent more time tracking this stuff down than I care to admit, and I recognize only a couple of the vintage tunes here. But <i>Fabriclive 59</i> will also expose Four Tet fans who come from entirely different worlds (indie, IDM) to some truly luscious and forward-thinking dance music that's otherwise available only on out-of-print vinyl singles and even-more-out-of-print CD comps.</p>
<p>Despite his rep as a boundary-crosser not beholden to any one scene, Hebden has deep roots here as an engaged fan. The B-side to one of his first Four Tet singles, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xJ_wjKn8JA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Calamine</a>"", was an avant take on UK garage when almost no one in the rock or electronic worlds seemed to be paying attention. It's easy to see what appealed to him. UKG fulfilled dance music's no. 1 rule (keep it funky) while also sticking to a less-often-followed guideline (make that funk feel new again). Few producers at the time were doing as much to reinvent the art of beatmaking without trying for something expressly ""experimental"" and alienating clubbers along the way.</p>
<p>So if you're a fan of those moments in rap or dance when baffling syncopations become an art in themselves, when drum patterns feel like they couldn't possibly be played by a human with just two arms, you'll find a lot to love here. And if you like your mixes to have the smooth bump and ingratiating warmness of house, amazingly, this music also fits the bill. After all, the earliest UK garage cuts, like Persian's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tP1OLUK6dg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feel da Vibe</a>"", weren't so far from house's more steady sense of groove. It just had a lot more swing. Making broken-sounding rhythms swing was actually the primary goal of the best garage DJs, and Hebden proves himself very attuned to making all these not always mix-friendly rhythms flow together. So much so that, when he drops Musical Mob's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bMQTU2iI1E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pulse X</a>""-- the stomping and snarling and totally blunt track that announced grime as a new thing-- it seems to fit naturally with all these super-subtle syncopations.</p>
<p>But true to Hebden's status-- insider fan trying to rekindle the UKG vibe and outsider after-the-fact archivist not beholden to the scene's rules-- <i>Fabriclive 59</i> doesn't really play out like a true vintage garage mix would have. For one thing, our DJ has some formalist fun with the disc's structure. After building a stretch of groove, he lets things simmer down, bridging the sections with sampled crowd noise from the Fabric club itself, less breaking the mix's momentum than allowing a breather before things bubble back to life. The effect is like catching a pirate radio DJ in the mix, only to dial across the airwaves and find another just-as-good set on a different station. Keeping listeners on their toes while also mimicking the way this music was often heard by fans-- it's an odd but effective approach, especially considering the usual keep-the-party-going  <i>Fabriclive</i> style. <i>Fabriclive 59</i> feels more like a mixtape in the handcrafted sense, one friend making another a tape of special moments they may have missed. But of course few of us have a friend with the mixing skills or deep record collection of Kieran Hebden.</p></div>"|15830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15830-fabriclive-59/|8.0|Jess Harvell

As bassist and singer for the Moonhearts (formerly Charle &amp; the Moonhearts), he spent his dorm-dwelling years releasing a sporadic string of fuzz-infused surf-rock tunes. More notably, he's the Waylon Jennings to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a>'s Buddy Holly-- a collaborator and sideman who sometimes fills the bass chair in the psych-rock upstart's live band. Friends since high school, they've released a split LP, <i>Reverse Shark Attack</i>, and a handful of singles. But it's Segall-- among the most prolific voices in the thoroughly prolific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7951-positive-destruction-san-franciscos-new-garage-rock/"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco garage scene</a>-- who tends to get the top billing.</p>
<p>On his eponymous debut, Mikal Cronin proves he can hold his own. It's an album of wistful, psychedelic pop that pits lush and layered arrangements against needle-pinning power chords. Like Segall's latest, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/"" target=""_blank"">Goodbye Bread</a></i>, Cronin's solo turn finds him dialing back his thrashier impulses in order to clear space for singer-songwriter-style introspection. But when the curtain of lysergic gristle is pulled aside, it turns out that they're not the same person, after all. Even when he goes all <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>, Segall still retains an affable beach-dude demeanor. Cronin turns out to be the more vulnerable voice-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a> in throwback dress, minus the self-loathing. And, like Smith, he has an ear for arrangements.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Is It Alright"" pivots from Beach Boys-worthy harmonies to chugging chords to jangling acoustic guitars before, finally, spinning off into an outro that sounds like Jethro Tull gone hardcore punk. It's no so much that Cronin knows how to effectively layer instruments (though he does) or collage disparate ideas together (though he does), but that he knows how to use dynamics to his advantage. On ""Gone"" he works soft-to-loud changes, dropping the bridge down to a whisper before bounding back up for a final, climactic freak-out. At the end of ""Again and Again"", Cronin drops out the rhythm section, rebuilding the song over a gentle falsetto melody.</p>
<p>Cronin's music owes a heavy debt to 1960s pop, mostly T. Rex and the Beatles (the sax outro on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12268-apathy/"" target=""_blank"">Apathy</a>"" is weirdly reminiscent of the Beatles ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD3ovfZXO5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hey Jude</a>""), but his tunes aren't precious period reconstructions. They're delivered with the gritty, gnarly abandon of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> fan trying to come to terms with their parents' record collection. Like Segall, Cronin brings a young energy to classic rock sounds because, well, he's actually young.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://positivedestruction.com/2011/08/15/mikal-cronin/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, Cronin has explained that the bulk of the album was written during the twilight months of his college career, when he was lonely and stressed and taking refuge in his tape recorder. Not exactly as trying a set of circumstances as, say, Tupac recording ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l47TcmPy1wA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Me Against the World</a>"", but a sensitive time, for sure. It's a transition that marks the end of structured life and the onset of a long-postponed adulthood, when you're too young and too old at the same time. Cronin nails that mood perfectly, with songs that are frustrated and energetic but flagged with uncertainty and doubt. The songs kick hardest when those melancholy sentiments collide with his crunching, chugging psychedelic urges-- when the volume is blasting in both the amps and the emotions.</p></div>"|15844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15844-mikal-cronin/|8.1|Aaron Leitko

While so many other lo-fi acts were still messing around with balmy haze and <i>Nuggets</i> jangle, these guys took the sound down darker, more aggressive paths. The album's marriage of squall and melody wasn't really anything new, but just by channeling a different set of influences-- post-punk, shoegaze, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a>-- Weekend's music felt so much more visceral than their peers'. At the same time, <i>Sports</i>' charm boiled down to one idea executed very well, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to worry if they had the depth to do that again.</p>
<p>So it's encouraging to hear Weekend making significant alterations to their formula on the <i>Red</i> EP. Offered as a teaser for an as-yet-untitled, upcoming LP, <i>Red</i> finds the band operating in a much cleaner, dreamier mode and mostly pulling it off. In addition to cutting back on the background screech that dominated <i>Sports</i> and drawing out more melody, the big difference is how the band treats frontman Shaun Durkan's voice. Previously a croaky drone used as an accent, Durkan's vox is richer, recorded higher in the mix, and able to carry a song on its own.</p>
<p>The best place to hear Weekend's more direct approach is on standout ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16226-hazel/"" target=""_blank"">Hazel</a>"", a killer shoegaze-pop number that has a lot in common with swirling 1990s classics like Catherine Wheel's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcrj-FFK4MM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Metallic</a>"". Set over an insistent, post-punk drumbeat and throbbing bass, the track becomes nicely un-tethered, letting guitars spin in and out of focus. There's great dark/light tension between its tight construction and looser elements, and Durkan's vocal strings it all together with a warm pop hook. The band hits similar high notes on ""Sweet Sixteen"" and ""The One You Want"". The cool thing about these songs is that while they aren't as threatening as some of the <i>Sports</i> stuff, they're no less dark-- it's just a more pensive and mysterious kind of noir.</p>
<p><i>Red</i> is only five tracks long, and two of the cuts-- ""Your Own Nothing"" and the weirdly titled ""Golfers""-- are a little slight, so there's only so much you can take away from it. But it's an important release for Weekend, one of those classic transitional EPs-- Deerhunter's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12991-rainwater-cassette-exchange/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i></a> and Abe Vigoda's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12728-reviver-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reviver</i></a> spring to mind as recent examples-- where a band takes stock of its strengths and starts to pivot in a new direction. Maybe even more important is that it shows this band as much more agile and nuanced than some previously thought, able to make noise one part of its attack instead of the primary focus.</p></div>"|15843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15843-red-ep/|7.4|Joe Colly

Hollon, better known by the <a href=""http://boombip.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boom Bip</a> moniker he's recorded under for more than a decade, had already covered vastly territory in 2008 through his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5679-neon-neon/"">Neon Neon</a> project with Super Furry Animals singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3657-gruff-rhys/"">Gruff Rhys</a>. But his work there and as Boom Bip has been characterized by a restless desire to keep his sound in flux, to constantly seek out fresh collaborators and remixers, to help pull away from any set patterns he may be settling into. Even Neon Neon, which bustled with future potential, quickly went quiet after <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11267-stainless-style/"">Stainless Style</a></i> was released.</p>
<p>Hollon's work as Boom Bip has also fallen into protracted periods of silence-- this is the first full-length release under that name since the 2005 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/860-blue-eyed-in-the-red-room/"">Blue Eyed in the Red Room</a></i>. The fastidious arrangements that proliferate throughout <i>Zig Zaj</i> suggest he's spent much of that time laboring over these tunes, getting everything just right and slotting new collaborators into the fold. Hollon is primarily a producer of instrumental electronic works that grab from a range of disparate influences in that field. But he's also well known for the collaborators he brings into the fold. Rhys and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3003-nina-nastasia/"">Nina Nastasia</a> featured on <i>Blue Eyed</i>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1605-franz-ferdinand/"">Alex Kapranos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2811-money-mark/"">Money Mark</a>, and Josh Klinghoffer from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> all worked on <i>Zig Zaj</i>.</p>
<p>This one lacks a cohesive narrative in the same way that last Boom Bip full-length release did-- that's to be expected from an album with such a diverse crew on board. It's a world that takes some adjusting to, especially when you get a great lurch from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a>-like, chain-gang grind of ""All Hands"" to the broody noir-esque pop moves of the Kapranos-fronted ""Goodbye Lovers and Friends"". In fact, casual listeners could be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled onto an outright indie rock record at certain points, especially after a cursory listen to the verse-chorus-verse structure (complete with grinding guitars) of the latter song. On ""New Order"" Klinghoffer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27152-empire-of-the-sun/"">Empire of the Sun</a> vocalist Luke Steele garishly clash to push the Boom Bip sound closer to the kind of pop-metal-techno hybrid the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"">Prodigy</a> were practicing in their heyday.</p>
<p>""New Order"" is particularly jarring here and is likely to be a divisive and confounding track for Hollon's fans. It's a shame he found the need to bludgeon us so hard, as his real forte comes from gradually layering on elements, either in subtle, slow-build movements (""Reveal"") or through steely, Ladytron-esque grooves (""Automation""). It would be wrong to complain that Hollon doesn't know what he wants Boom Bip to be, as he's always operated in this manner. But <i>Zig Zaj</i> feels like he's straining a little too hard to make every song different from the last, where he’s actually become pinned down by the ""eclectic"" reputation he's accrued, forcing him to make unwise decisions just to keep a certain degree of diversity afloat in his work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there aren't too many other clangers in the vein of ""New Order"". The Boom Bip sound really flourishes when Hollon happens upon a suitable meshing of his dual interests in indie rock and electronica-- on <i>Zig Zaj</i> that point occurs on the wonderful ""Pele"", which bears a heavy load of austere electronics that are gradually flipped out of the picture by some distinctly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>-like flanged guitar riffing. It's got that refined power of suggestion the higher quality Boom Bip tracks possess, which makes it doubly mystifying that he's occasionally happy to swap all that out and resort to sheer brute strength. But the individual songs on this record will find more color when extracted from the constraints of the album. It's not hard to see ""Goodbye Lovers and Friends"" getting a decent lease of life as a pop single, whereas here it feels like a malformed part of the puzzle that won't quite slot into place. No doubt Hollon wouldn't have it any other way.</p></div>"|15829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15829-zig-zaj/|6.6|Nick Neyland

This was S.C.U.M.'s first handy hook for the <i>NME</i>-- not only because bassist Huw Webb is the younger brother of the Horrors' Rhys Webb, but also because the bands share traits on the musical and magazine-ready haircuts-and-cheekbones levels. This seems like the sort of tag the younger quintet would be eager to shake off, the better to stand on their own feet, but it's a lineage S.C.U.M. can't entirely lose on debut album <i>Again Into Eyes</i>.</p>
<p>In the two years since their formation, S.C.U.M. have followed a strikingly similar path to that of their elders: Both began as brash, noisy outfits-- the Horrors as goth garage shriekers, S.C.U.M. with a reputation for no-wave noise-making live shows-- and have arrived in 2011 at an atmosphere-heavy, 1980s-influenced rock sound that's less abrasive and vastly more ambitious than those origins might've predicted. That tends to mean impeccably produced moody, mid-tempo rock songs, swaddled in vaporous synth textures, and led by seductively fainting singing. In S.C.U.M., the singing's done by Thomas Cohen, whose breathy, soft moaning smears across the rhythms on ""Summon the Sound"", drifting over the edge of the beat as it fades into the distance. It's a familiar effect, but Cohen's singing sounds less affected and more skillful than that of the Horrors' Faris Badwan.</p>
<p>Another important distinction: While the Horrors recently rounded off the edges of their guitar tones (to the point of largely obscuring the instrument's original sound), S.C.U.M. have done away with guitars almost entirely in favor of keyboards and synthesizers. (A less commonly mentioned but perhaps more interesting family tie is that S.C.U.M. keyboardist Samuel Kilcoyne is the son of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21-add-n-to-x/"" target=""_blank"">Add N to (X)</a>'s Barry Smith-- one imagines him inheriting a pile of pristine-condition Moog synthesizers for his 16th birthday.) One six-string features on single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15981-amber-hands/"" target=""_blank"">Amber Hands</a>"", and there may be some more deep in the mix elsewhere (band member Bradley Baker is credited with ""machines, press,"" which leaves room for some ambiguity). Either way, the band relies less on sharp, mix-piercing leads than on amorphous washes from which the melodies gently emerge-- it's an accomplished sound, one that may not immediately dispense with the comparisons that have dogged the band, but one that does suggest a group more than capable of outgrowing the associations.</p></div>"|15828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15828-scum-again-into-eyes/|6.7|Eric Grandy

There's a certain logic at work there, considering the emotionally charged material on his debut full-length, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14433-cerulean/"">Cerulean</a></i>, from last year, but it's still not a move that most beat-obsessed bedroom producers would have the balls to try out. Wiesenfeld's post-<i>Cerulean</i> career has partially been shaped by a series of left turns, whether it's through his desire to work in piano balladry and on his more passive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29364-geotic/"">Geotic</a> project, or in his affable banter with audiences during his live shows. During the Pitchfork Music Festival in July, he seemed to spend most of his non-stage time wandering among the crowds with his shirt off. Wiesenfeld clearly doesn't care to be bracketed, either personally or professionally, and <i>Pop Music / False B-Sides</i> is his latest attempt to crush all those competing sides of his personality into song.</p>
<p>What's most impressive about Baths is how that all-embracing approach never devolves into sloppiness or identity loss. Wiesenfeld is always careful to string recognizable, Baths-like traits through his sound so that the listener never comes completely unshackled from his world. Sometimes it's through those stringy beats that he's so adept at constructing (""Seaside Town""); at others it's when he drenches a song in bathos via a few twists of his immaculate falsetto (""Iniuria Palace""). Frequently both of those elements are deployed, such as on the standout ""Pop Song"". This isn't supposed to be a proper follow-up to <i>Cerulean</i>-- it's a collection of tracks Wiesenfeld has worked on since that album was released, originally made available to fans who attended a tour from earlier this year-- which illustrates the strength in depth he has at his fingertips when something as appealingly frail as ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Pop_Song.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Pop Song</a>"" is buried here.</p>
<p>If this is an indication of where Wiesenfeld is heading, it feels like a spot somewhere between Geotic and Baths, with a greater emphasis on traditional instrumentation. Strangely, it's often reminiscent of work by artists who have walked backwards into the electronic world and assimilated some of its elements after wringing all the inspiration out of the guitar-bass-drums format. ""Somerset"", for instance, skews close to the kind of dolorous studio experimentation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a> were tooling around with on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/831-13/"">13</a></i>, all tied to a looping, post-rock bassline that could have been uprooted from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>'s <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i>. That material points to Baths' future, although there are still a few ties to the <i>Cerulean</i> comfort zone (on the jumpy ""Seaside Town"" and the fuzzed-out ""Damnation"") that make <i>Pop Music / False B-Sides </i>feel like a passing of the baton from old to new.</p>
<p>That could be how this album is viewed in the Baths' discography in future years, depending on where Wiesenfeld heads next, which is another testament to his sequencing skills. There are no huge stylistic leaps here, just a subtle testing ground laid out so new ideas can be unwrapped and worked into the sound. It's clear that Wiesenfeld has progressed as a lyricist too, with tracks like ""Nordic Laurel"" and ""Iniuria Palace"" easily among the best song-oriented works he's produced. There are occasional misfires, particularly when Wiesenfeld channels his inner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Robert Smith</a> on ""Tatami"", but in the context of this release he can be cut a little more slack than if this were Baths' actual second album. For most of this record, he's still wrapped up in those sci-fi lullabies that made his name, while also gently prodding his surprisingly malleable aesthetic into welcome new territories.</p></div>"|15837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15837-pop-music-false-b-sides/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Frontman Eric Earley has explained that the album was inspired by the ""inescapable past"" and the eternal call of the open road-- the latter a specifically American idea that is almost necessarily soundtracked with American music.</p>
<p>To their considerable credit, Blitzen Trapper eschew the spray-on grit of contemporaries like Dawes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5492-deer-tick/"" target=""_blank"">Deer Tick</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1250-dr-dog/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dog</a>.

After signing with Sub Pop, however, Blitzen Trapper have been whittling all of those possibilities down to a not-so-sharp point. <i>Goldwing</i> rides the same familiar roads we've been down so many times before, yet even a decade into their career, Blitzen Trapper sound less like denizens of the road than tourists snapping pictures of rock-historical monuments.</p>
<p>After a brief but promising burst of squealing distortion, ""Fletcher"" settles into a genial ramble, sketching out a hitchhiking character ""drinking whiskey from a jar through his teeth"" and randomly shooting pistols for fun. These are concrete details, but never pertain to anyone found on the actual road. Instead, the title character comes across as an over-romanticized archetype, a stand-in for the band's infatuation with the America of classic rock rather than the America of 2011. That impression is only reinforced by the ramshackle sound, which is cribbed almost wholesale from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Band</a>-- not from their <i>Big Pink</i> days, but from their less fruitful California period.</p>
<p>In other words, we've been down this road before, with Blitzen Trapper and with so many acts before them. There's no adventure here, no real wanderlust. Even when they try to change things up, it never comes across especially well. The hoedown that opens ""Your Crying Eyes"" segues abruptly into an ascending riff not too dissimilar to Big Star's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT8ihOjOf1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the Street</a>"". While it's a relief that Trapper don't follow that coda through to its logical nu-old-time conclusion, the transition sounds jarring and overthought.</p>
<p>Still, songs like ""Your Crying Eyes"" and ""Street Fighting Sun"", with their muscle-car guitars and passing-lane momentum, at least rev up <i>American Goldwing</i> a bit. The album stalls during midtempo numbers ""My Home Town"" and ""Girl in a Coat"", which showcase Earley's hangdog vocals and roadside imagery. Ultimately, the trip they're taking us on isn't into America, but into the past, and they show too much reverence for their forebears.</p></div>"|15825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15825-american-goldwing/|5.4|Stephen M.

In the context of the monochrome, fuck-all noise of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavvves</a></i>, it was easier to stomach an attitude that hovered somewhere between high, hungover, and hateful. What pissed off a lot of people was the way he could broaden his sonic palette and galvanize his songwriting without even the slightest attitude adjustment: The world would have to start taking him seriously, and it was abundantly clear he had no plans to return the favor. So do you think the tsk-tsking of some critics or <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/marnie-sterns-t-shirts-wavves-best-coast-feud"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marnie Stern</a> is gonna stop him? In case you missed the point of <i>King of the Beach</i>'s opening salvo, here's Williams on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12293-i-wanna-meet-dave-grohl/"" target=""_blank"">I Wanna Meet Dave Grohl</a>"": ""You're <i>still </i> never gonna stop me."" As such, his follow-up EP is titled <i>Life Sux</i>, it features some of his more famous friends cheering him on, and Williams treats the inaugural release on his <a href=""http://www.ghostramp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Ramp</a> label like a 24-year old's first apartment: Maybe you'd only want to spend 15 minutes tops in this ramshackle mess, but hey, he's enjoying his freedom.</p>
<p>At the very least, you know where you stand with Wavves: If you're not referenced by name or actually appear on <i>Life Sux</i>, there's a good shot you're a target of Williams' limitless disdain. So then, ""Bug"": He's cool with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>, whether he's paying homage with some of his mostly instantly catchy fuzz guitar leads, or just pissing in the wind about the futility of relying on other people. Meanwhile, ""I Wanna Meet Dave Grohl"" follows in the grand tradition of Local H's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOmRhOKhkOI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eddie Vedder</a>"" (if not ""I Had Mark Arm"") in terms of grunge fan fiction fueled by overblown ego and non-existent self-esteem.<span> </span>He switches ""meet"" with ""be"" during the brainwash of a chorus, which brings out this strange humanizing quality even though the premise doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense: Whose life ambition is it to meet or even be Dave Grohl when he's quite possibly the squarest dude that qualifies as an actual rock star? Is it because ""Krist Novoselic"" has too many syllables and doesn't rhyme with anything?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when his tributes to the Buzz Bin become less overt but no less pervasive, Side B of <i>Life Sux</i>, well, kinda sux: The title of ""Poor Lenore"" is the first time Williams has implied he's ever picked up a book in his life, but the turgid, 3rd-gen grunge suggests he found that Poe anthology right next to a used copy of <i>Frogstomp</i>. And though ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12398-victory-ft-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Destroy</a>"" is a well-intentioned collaboration in the name of break-shit punk, once Pink Eyes' vocals give Williams the bum's rush, it ceases to have the ability to be heard as anything other than a lo-fi <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> track. If you ever wondered if those dozens of guitar overdubs were really necessary on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/"" target=""_blank"">David Comes to Life</a></i>, ""Destroy"" emphatically answers in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Despite its reduced scope, <i>Life Sux </i> is actually pretty versatile depending on where <i>you</i> stand with Wavves-- take it as further confirmation of his permanent immaturity, or a sign that rattling off rudimentary but undeniably hooky punk-pop comes fairly easy to him. Still, with an LP supposedly on its way by the end of the year, you don't have to wonder quite yet if using the brat factor as something of a crutch means that he already reached his ceiling and <i>King of the Beach</i> is the record he was put on this earth to make: one that Weezer couldn't make after they'd discovered branding, Blink-182 couldn't after they thought owning Cure albums meant they had to be taken seriously as <i>artistes</i>, and Green Day couldn't after Billie Joe picked up a copy of <i>No Logo</i>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the track that gets him out of the artistic cul-de-sac is by far the best thing here: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14472-crazy-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">Crazy for You</a></i> and <i>King of the Beach</i> coyly flirted with addressing the real-life relationship of its creators, and Williams' collaboration with Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12347-nodding-off-ft-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Nodding Off</a>"" doesn't get much into detail either. Still, it threatens to make even the most jaded Hipster Runoff devotee actually root for them: think Best Coast with more power, Wavves with more pop, or just a more reckless, less cerebral New Pornographers. Of course, even if the heart of <i>Life Sux </i> is a gooey escape fantasy featuring his girlfriend, if he still wants to describe the EP as something you'll probably like ""if you hate yourself and other people""... well, you're never gonna stop him.</p></div>"|15827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15827-life-sux-ep/|6.7|Ian Cohen

""Had a blown-out day off listening to demos and new music with brother Yan,"" reads <a href=""http://megafaun.com/post/4528501351/had-a-blown-out-day-off-listening-to-demos-and-new"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a months-old dispatch</a> on their website. ""Then we watched <i>Pineapple Express</i> and <i>Knocked Up</i> back to back. Then I fell asleep for 9 hours and awoke to Marty’s famous pasta breakfast."" In a roundabout way, that sums up the North Carolinian trio pretty well: attempting the familiar, arriving at the unexpected. Though their latest LP, the sanguine, self-titled <i>Megafaun</i>, dials back on the clawhammer outbursts and and out-from-nowhere harmonic blasts that peppered their earlier work, they're still reliably surprising, their sleepily shapeshifting folk-rock quietly but confidently winding its way through the annals of American music.</p>
<p>That the sinewy Zappa-esque whirlaway of ""Isadora"" and the twinkly Horsnby-esque exhalation ""Hope You Know"" (very nearly the Bruce nod their former DeYarmond Edison bandmate Bon Iver's ""Beth/Rest"" was) sit comfortably next to each other on <i>Megafaun</i> should tell you a lot about just how expansive their outlook is these days. Outliers abound, but they downplay the rustic instrumentation of their earlier LPs for a more traditional, country-rock setup. The overarching sound's got more than a little bit in common with the Grateful Dead's more pastoral moments, all manners of harmony-kissed American beauty that never quite land where you thought they might. From the patiently unfurling opener ""Real Slow"" to rousing gospel closer ""Everything"", Megafaun trudge over a terrific amount of sonic ground here without restlessness.</p>
<p>This serene, settled-in sound mostly feels like a trade-up; they manage a consistency of tone and texture here they've never shown before. As singers, alone and apart, they've never sounded better, and the  record's subtler, less showy instrumentation and more reeled-in  compositions suggest a newfound maturity that they wear exceptionally  well. Hints of Southern smoke, Laurel Canyon folk, and hippie-country still inform their sound, but in their easygoing way, it never feels as if you're being led through a tour of the touchstones; the band's drowsy melodies and taut songcraft keep individual moments arresting, while their knack for slippery sonic detail (guitar twinkle, field recordings, the occasional banjo), the record's languid pacing, and its surplus of strange, striking melodies holds its hour-long expanse together.</p>
<p>That generous runtime does prove to be <i>Megafaun</i>'s only real downside; save ""Everything"", <i>Megafaun</i>'s standout moments seem to come in its first half, excising Delta moaner ""Scorned"" and a few of the wispier, late-LP country-rockers probably would've further boosted cohesion. Minor complaints, really; here, Megafaun have quietly completed the smart, sizable stylistic shift they started on last fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14658-heretofore-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heretofore</i> EP</a>, drawing back on the burly backwoods weirdness of their earlier work while widening their stylistic scope and pushing compositional delicacy to the forefront. And <i>Megafaun</i> may be their most immediately ingratiating, rewarding LP yet, as well-suited for a night strapped into headphones as it is a lazy Sunday morning, dancing around the bedroom, munching casually on a pasta breakfast.</p></div>"|15834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15834-megafaun/|7.8|Paul Thompson

Given indie rock's recent jangle-pop overload, and the comments that Veronica Falls have made in the press (""people like to romanticize about C86 [but] there were lots of rubbish bands associated with it...""), it's tempting to wonder aloud: is ""Bad Feeling"" the C86 version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diYAc7gB-0A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that video</a> where George Michael goes iconoclastic on us and sets his own leather jacket ablaze?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not, but at the very least it's a decent visual metaphor for the band's sound: expertly stagy revivalism with the slightest hint of mutiny. You could have said the same thing of Slumberland labelmates and fellow fresh-faced indie poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> when they first burst out the gates with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/"" target=""_blank"">Pastels</a> badges on their sleeves-- the quartet's self-titled debut hits with the same sort of immediacy that that first Pains LP did. Both records do familiar things so well that, occasionally, momentarily, they actually trick you into thinking you've never heard anything like them before.</p>
<p>But, of course, you have. In fact, if you've been paying any attention to Glasgow/London hybrid Veronica Falls, you've actually heard some of these very songs before: The single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13212-found-love-in-a-graveyard/"" target=""_blank"">Found Love in a Graveyard</a>"" made the rounds almost two years ago, and then came ""Beachy Head"", ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16206-bad-feeling/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Feeling</a>"", and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16039-come-on-over/"" target=""_blank"">Come on Over</a>"" earlier this year. But after a run of strong 7""'s, their self-titled debut finally confirms that Veronica Falls are more than a singles band. Though they operate with a pretty limited sonic palette (boy/girl harmonies; dueling, reverb-drenched guitars; lots of tambourine), there's a sustained momentum over these 12 tracks that even manages to bring in some unexpected influences-- ""Beachy Head"" sounds like a zombified Mamas and the Papas thrashing at surf-punk guitars with shards of glass.</p>
<p>Given the group's penchant for ghosts and reverb, it's tempting to grab for a familiar collection of low-hanging adjectives: dreamy, ethereal, haunting-- except that, actually, <i>Veronica Falls</i> is none of these things. There's a striking physicality to these songs, and Guy Fixsen and Ash Workman's production makes every tambourine beat hit with the clarity of a shattering window. The guitar sound is immaculate: Clifford and James Hoare's strings don't jangle so much as bristle-- taut chords that dart restlessly in and out of each other's way. There's a clarity of texture-- a specificity even-- to every element of the band's sound. Which makes it something of an anomaly: shoegaze that looks you square in the eye.</p>
<p>Thematically speaking, shit's dark. There's a song called ""Misery"", there are not one but <i>two</i> songs in which the narrator's lover might be a ghost (""Graveyard"", ""Bad Feeling""), and though ""Beachy Head"" might sound like a carefree postcard from indie rock's current backdrop of choice, it's actually about jumping off a cliff and drowning yourself. Thankfully, the record ends on a high in every sense: ""Come on Over"" is perhaps the most hopeful-- and best-- track the band's got to their name. ""Crimson and clover, I'll touch your shoulder,"" Clifford sings over the mounting tension of a furiously strummed guitar. It's the Veronica Falls aesthetic in miniature: the ghosts of pop past conjured convincingly and intimately enough to feel like flesh and blood.</p></div>"|15818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15818-veronica-falls-veronica-falls/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Someone should remind <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/reginaxxx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regina</a>. The front cover of the Finnish indie pop band's fourth proper album, <i>Soita Mulle</i> (Finnish for ""Call me""), is adorned with a beautiful black-and-white photo (taken by <a href=""http://www.meganmcisaac.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Megan Kathleen McIsaac</a>) of two people lying down in a pastoral setting. Unfortunately, the ugly and carelessly placed typeface obscures and, in effect, blunts the image's aesthetic beauty. Obviously, the band has a need to claim ownership for the album's contents, but the image on its own so excellently represents <i>Soita Mulle</i>'s sensual, arresting feel that it functions strongly as a statement of purpose. Largely, Regina are working within what many listeners will instantly recognize as the dreamy, limitless confines of shoegaze-- only, their take on it is less staticky and obscured than the way today's younger bands have approached the genre. <i>Soita Mulle</i>'s most impressionistic moments sound clean and deep-- an approach similar to what stateside shoegazers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"" target=""_blank"">School of Seven Bells</a> did on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14453-disconnect-from-desire/"" target=""_blank"">Disconnect From Desire</a></i>-- providing space to wrap yourself within their compositions, rather than attempt to smother you with blistering, fuzzy noise.</p>
<p>This sound fits Regina like a glove, and the new look largely makes <i>Soita Mulle</i> their best record yet-- admittedly, an easy feat. Since 2005's <i>Katso Maisemaa</i>, the band's toyed with various genres and sounds just close enough to occasionally mix and mingle-- the cool allure of French yé-yé, snatches of downtempo dance music, Stereolab's bouncy warmth. 2009's U.S. debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14527-puutarhatrilogia/"" target=""_blank"">Puutarhatrilogia</a></i>, marked their most consistent effort at that point, but Iisa Pykäri's thin, power-bereft voice resulted in her surroundings sounding occasionally chintzy and under-produced. On <i>Soita Mulle</i>, multi-instrumentalist/principal songwriter Mikko Pykäri's production hand is heavy on the lushness, resulting in something more full-bodied and robust in sound. And, the improvements that Iisa's made as a vocalist are not to be overlooked: the album's highlights find her dipping in and out of melodies, filling the air with her voice, and effortlessly unleashing torrents of Finnish syllables. When she lets out a sweet melodic sigh near the end of ""Haluan Sinut"", you breathe with her, and that's a good thing.</p>
<p>Of course, Regina being Regina, the band still does a bit of outside-the-lines genre exploration, and as on previous efforts, it doesn't always come out well. On one hand, the piping synths of ""Ui Mun Luo"" gel with the song's cosmopolitan shuffle; on the other, ""Harjun Takaa"" seems an attempt to embrace upwards-moving anthemic melodic structures, ending stuck on the tarmac instead. The misses scattered between <i>Soita Mulle</i>'s hits make the album drag as a front-to-back listening experience-- and this record is nine tracks in under 35 minutes. Forget the cover art: the real tragedy about <i>Soita Mulle</i> is that Regina grab the brass ring of consistency for the first time in their career, and with excellent results-- they just can't seem to hold on the entire time.</p></div>"|15833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15833-souta-mulle/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

A style so reliant on self-reference and continuity doesn't appear to leave much to coincidence, so I'm wondering what to make of my suspicions regarding a line that appeared on both of their completely free mixtapes, but not their first commercially available release: ""You should probably buy it."" This isn't wholly unexpected-- Heems, Kool AD, and Dapwell can appear unimpressed to a fault, and <i>Relax </i>draws from a rich tradition of antisocial reactions to newfound fame: at times, it's a sour demystification that seeks to define its own backlash à la <i>De La Soul Is Dead</i>, at others a simplified CliffsNotes for people still playing catch up, and a lot of times it simply wants to be <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/66-bazooka-tooth/"" target=""_blank"">Bazooka Tooth</a>. </i>But even as jaded as they sound toward show promoters, industry types, your band, and white dudes on the internet, <i>Relax </i>is a frustrating, occasionally thrilling record that saves its most pervasive indifference for a far more troubling target: itself.</p>
<p>Though they've had plenty of laughs at backpacker indie rap's expense, <i>Relax </i>comes alive whenever it strives for an honorary Def Jux badge. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> are the most notable appearances, and what's initially jarring is how much the otherwise impermeable Das Racist universe accommodates a sound that caters more toward its guests' respective dystopian styles, forsaking the weeded-out levity of <i>Sit Down </i>and <i>Shut Up </i>for industrial grind fueled by cheap coke and battery acid. At the outset, they keep up as the brittle title track finds Heems adopting a rawer style to spit a bracing, strikingly plainspoken verse about his upbringing. Meanwhile, ""Michael Jackson"" pays homage to the Chinese fire drill productions of Heatmakerz and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>, its brainwashing hook reminiscent of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cb0h4Jlx70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dipset (Santana's Town)</a>""'s infamous ""like Kurt Cobain was here!"" in terms of chantable celebrity nonsense. When <i>Relax </i>revisits this sort of bludgeoning approach (""Selena"", ""Punjabi Song""), you sense the incomplete framework of a record meant to be aesthetically unified and audience-dividing: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43947-video-das-racist-michael-jackson/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a>"" and the other initially punishing tracks shuttle from ""I absolutely cannot stand this song"" to ""I absolutely cannot get this song out of my head"" in about the same amount of time ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ8ViYIeH04"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell</a>"" did.</p>
<p>While it would be fascinating to see how their style translates with a mainstream feature (a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>'s guest spots with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"" target=""_blank"">the Game</a>), the retrenchment into their inner circle for inspiration rarely feels reactionary here: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"" target=""_blank"">Yeasayer</a>'s Anand Wilder and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Rostam Batmanglij produce, but without credit, you'd have no idea which tracks are theirs. Likewise, their exercise in total lyrical abstraction with El-P comes more naturally than <i>Sit Down, Man</i>'s title track, and ""Power"" is maybe the one track here that can stand up to jaw-dropping quote machines like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11982-hahahaha-jk/"" target=""_blank"">hahahaha jk?</a>"" or ""Return to Innocence"" thanks to show-stealing verses from Danny Brown and Despot.</p>
<p>And yet, it's the hook from ""Power"" that gets to the discomforting center of <i>Relax</i>: ""It's too easy. Even if I told you about it, you probably wouldn't even believe me."" Like many highly intelligent people who can succeed in any number of pursuits, Das Racist sound unimpressed by their own staggering ability (Heems' much-quoted ""<i>I'm fucking great at rapping!"" </i>from ""Michael Jackson"" notwithstanding), as if they got to this point just to see if they could do it, and all of a sudden the actual process of making <i>Relax</i> didn't turn out to be as exciting as planning it.  Adopting the same over-it tone they've taken during any number of clueless ""hey, these funny guys are <i>really smart</i>!"" interviews, hooks like ""give us all your money... love everybody"" from ""Brand New Dance"" are the sound of their losing interest in real time. If they're kidding, it's an entry-level joke aimed at...I dunno, proactive behavior in hip-hop? But the disengaged tone starts to wear when it becomes unclear whether Kool AD and Heems are still interested in <i>making </i>rap music anymore as opposed to merely listening to it, rattling off disconnected thoughts not too different from the avalanche of their Twitter feeds-- stray jokes, pan-cultural namedrops, the occasional astute observation, and a slew of repurposed praise, but no real context to prove broader points. After delivering some of the sharpest cultural criticism in any field on <i>Sit Down </i>and <i>Shut Up</i>, when they swipe at low-hanging fruit like ""rapgenius.com is white devil sophistry/ Urban Dictionary is for demons with college degrees,"" there's little insight, just the whiff of audience/performer codependence.</p>
<p>So then what's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14376-shut-up-dude/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shut Up, Dude</i></a>'s ""Rainbow in the Dark"" doing here? It's still a mindblowing piece of work and welcome in any form, but the fit couldn't be more strange-- both the beat and the lyrics have a generosity in spirit that sheds light on an issue that you can lose sight of while focusing on its attitude or production choices: <i>they're hardly rapping at all here. </i>And when they do, it's almost like 10th-season <i>The Simpsons</i>, where the sheer dropoff in quotability is actually uncomfortable to endure. It's understandable that they'd want to move beyond mere applause for being as handy with Marina Abramovic as they are with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcxI3D-sdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">9 Piece</a>"", but they've thrown out their entirely unique point of view-- still their greatest resource-- with it.</p>
<p>While they've made great use of deconstructive syntax, repetition, gibberish, and in-jokes in the past, too much of <i>Relax </i>simply feels like dead air: the clock-watching countdown of ""Happy Rappy"", the last minute and a half of the title track that sounds like a cackling Autotune meeting its death in a food processor, ""Celebration"" and ""The Trick""'s listless singing, and ""Punjabi Song"" tripping over its drunk reiteration all merely pass time during tracks already stripped to the bone on a very short record. And while I won't begrudge Das Racist for wanting to make straight-up dance tracks like ""Girl"" or ""Booty in the Air"", compared to ""Shorty Said"", ""Irresponsible"", or the many other songs they've made that worked as well in Gchat nerd-out sessions as they did in house parties, it's tough to give these one-note riffs the benefit of the doubt. They can do better, but do they even want to?</p>
<p>To this point, they've answered the question of ""are they really serious?"" in the affirmative or made it a moot point-- whether you just liked the Big Punisher quotes, casually accepted being called a white demon for the greater good, or both, their work could be enjoyed on any number of levels. But <i>Relax </i>feels like it's hovering over a more pernicious escape clause-- ""<i>you don't get it</i>."" Interpreted through telling lyrics like ""when you see me on the streets, don't bother me,"" ""I don't know why people think we give a fuck so often,"" or, as the closing argument in ""Celebration"" goes, ""you could ask what it is, but I still wouldn't tell you,"" the title of <i>Relax </i>feels more like a statement of aggression, Das Racist shifting the blame to the listener for their own lack of commitment.</p></div>"|15822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15822-relax/|6.3|Ian Cohen

At the tail end of 2010, guitarist Adam Kessler left the band under circumstances that were clearly less than amicable; the band's website stated that the remaining members were ""devastated"" and were ""keeping to themselves and friends at this time."" Two weeks later, lead singer Jonathan Pierce told <i>NME</i> that the band had composed ""the best song we've ever written"" the day after Kessler's departure. It was only a few months' time before Pierce was referring to Kessler's departure as a ""blessing in disguise"" in UK newspaper <i>The Independent</i>: ""We don't know what he's doing or anything. I'm not interested in knowing what he's up to.""</p>
<p>In the leadup to the release of the Drums' second album, <i>Portamento</i>, Pierce has sounded dismissive of the band's general career trajectory, claiming that they don't ""have a very long shelf life as a band"" and that they came close to breaking up this past June following ""a lot of shouting matches."" Accordingly, that grim outlook is reflected in their most recent work. Throughout <i>Portamento</i>'s 12 songs, there are 11 references to death or dying, the most notable arriving on ""Days"" when Pierce testifies to his past devotion to a broken relationship by casually tossing out the revelation that he ""killed myself."" Obsessing over mortality is nothing new in indie pop, let alone within the Drums' catalog thus far. Remember, this is a band whose first album kicked off with a song called ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpm4eJ6l1n4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Best Friend</a>"" that started like this: ""You were my best friend/ And then you died.""</p>
<p>Clearly, Pierce's ego has been well-fed-- his recent quote-worthy nature in the press reflects that of the leader of a prototypical British buzz band (fittingly, despite Brooklyn ties, the UK has welcomed the band with open arms, more so than the States). Which is why it's surprising that <i>Portamento</i> sounds and feels like a smaller, more intimate album than last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14333-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled predecessor</a>. After all, it's not like they did anything drastically different this time around-- like <i>The Drums</i>, <i>Portamento</i> was largely recorded in a band member's apartment (Pierce's), as well as a few studios in NYC and upstate Woodstock. (For those who bemoaned the production value of the first LP, be warned: <i>Portamento</i> very much sounds like it was recorded in someone's apartment.)</p>
<p>The lack of ""bigness"" on <i>Portamento</i> most likely owes to the fact that the Drums aren't on a major label anymore (in the U.S., anyway). Here in the States, they've gone to Frenchkiss, a more suitable home considering its strong roster of bands-that-sound-like-a-lot-of-bands. In case you haven't noticed by now, the Drums do sound like a lot of bands, taking in everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beach Boys</a>' controlled falsettos to the loving cloyingness of late Swedish indie-pop greats <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5554-the-honeydrips/"" target=""_blank"">the Honeydrips</a>. As it turns out, the new surroundings are more beneficial for them: There's not as much pressure to be extroverted for the sake of courting a larger audience. This means that there's no ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4xWnON25Ok"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Me and the Moon</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T_arHUAJfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forever and Ever Amen</a>""-- two big, great songs that would sound too anthemic and overblown if they were on this record. In the place of anthems, though, are carefully constructed gems making up a sequencing run so solid it takes a few listens to pick out the exact drop-off point (""In the Cold"", in case you were wondering). From the saxes and Theremin-like squeal in ""What You Were"" to the heart-tugging kickoff of ""Hard to Love"", it's the small, detailed moments that take you by surprise here-- kind of like life, really.</p>
<p>And, despite all the drama and tortured sentiments, that's what the Drums are all about: real life, and the pains and pleasures (mostly pains) that come along with loving while you still have fresh breath in your lungs. Yes, Pierce talks about selling a gun in ""Money"", but the song is basically about how he doesn't have enough money to buy a lover a nice present. Being broke (and feeling inadequate because of that) is something we can all relate to, no matter how embarrassing it might be for a bunch of major-label refugees to admit. It's time to stop begrudging these guys for being stylish and faddish, because real emotions like the ones they work in are ugly and petty and hard to bear in public. You can get as many haircuts and buy as many trendy outfits as you want, but you're not going to change the fact that it'll never be cool to feel upset, angry, and alone.</p></div>"|15807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15807-portamento/|7.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

We'd shown up early to an afterparty for the Movement Electronic Music Festival, Detroit's big-for-America electronic-music showcase. On arrival there were 15 old heads dancing to a pre-Omar set on a still coffee-shop-y dance floor, tables and chairs tucked neatly into corners. The booze, we were told, was in the back, and we were led by an elderly woman past the employees-only area, behind the DJ booth to a folding table with three handles of Popov, four cartons of orange juice, and a donations shoebox (these somewhat unofficial venues being legally unable to charge for drinks).</p>
<p>Omar (Alex O. Smith) probably wasn't intimately involved in that night's planning, but he could've been. Everything about the long-running house producer feels local and homemade (to wit: when his self-run label <a href=""http://www.omarsdetroit.us/shirts.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FXHE Records finally released t-shirts last year</a>, the design was a ""D""-- for Detroit, presumably-- fashioned out of 12"" labels; he wore one at that coffee shop). <i>It Can Be Done, But Only I Can Do It</i> is Omar's second full-length for FXHE; his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12824-fabric-45/"" target=""_blank"">profile-raising mix for London's Fabric club</a> and his recent (free) <a href=""http://www.scionav.com/collection/753/Scion0A/V0Presents:0Omar0S.0-0High0School0Graffiti"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>High School Graffiti</i> EP</a> for, of all companies, Scion (last time he bothered talking to the press, Omar worked for Ford) notwithstanding, he still prefers to release his music at his pace, for his label.</p>
<p>Omar's style remains his own: construction-paper house, dance music in which the materials seem crude but the product is crafty and confident. He operates differently from most producers, worrying little about mood or architecture. Omar remains refreshingly uninterested in the unspoken pissing contest that is every producer's attempt to make the ""deepest"" record in the DJ crate. The core elements of any given Omar track-- modest, cymbal-heavy rhythms, orbital synth lines-- are those necessary to inspire them most movement with the least cognitive interference. His music isn't soulful by way of signifiers-- though he does feature the occasional Motown sample or muffled diva-- it's soulful via its hardscrabble grooves and undeniable mettle. He isn't interested in replication, in tuning knobs until he has the finest approximation of a Rhodes piano or sawing strings; every element here is slightly indelicate, remnants of its synthesis scattered about. You aren't meant to recognize the elements of Omar's music; you're meant to dance to them.</p>
<p>Though obviously indebted to artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a> (a frequent collaborator) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>, one of the greatest achievements of <i>It Can Be Done</i> is how easily it avoids feeling retro. Nor, though, does it imagine the future; <i>It Can Be Done</i> is the rare techno/house album that feels inimitably of its own time. This is born of Omar's indelible style, the way he dials rhythms into his sequences and lets trace hints of melody come to him. They always do, too: the title track finds a vaguely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>-ian groove-hook, while ""Supported Solely"" casually alternates between prickly treble and roiling bass. When he does offer a transparent genre plug-- ""Here's Your Trance Now Dance""-- he does so with verve and enthusiasm: ""Trance"" is 10-plus minutes of uncharacteristically major-key sunshine.</p>
<p>It's all too simple to tie Omar's sound to his native city (if not necessarily its trad dystopian techno sound): both offer utility in the face of style and a shabbiness that's easy to love for those of the right disposition. Maybe he likes it this way-- he certainly seems smart enough to change this perception (though whether he is aware enough is up for debate). <i>It Can Be Done </i>won't increase Omar's stature or change the landscape of electronic music; he is a cantankerous, secluded (by choice) artist, arrogant enough to make music for himself but expecting you to dance to you it. Those patient enough to play by his rules probably will.</p>
<p>(Note: Omar's distribution is notoriously spotty; the best place to find his music, especially on CD, is through the <a href=""http://www.omarsdetroit.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FXHE website</a>.)</p></div>"|15821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15821-it-can-be-done-but-only-i-can-do-it/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

The Sheffield, England duo could have kept going in that direction indefinitely with potentially great commercial rewards, but instead they've opted to make a second album, <i>Paradise</i>, which dials down their perky sweetness and emphasizes rhythm and atmosphere with lyrics confronting more emotionally complicated subject matter.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Slow Club have become unrecognizable. One of the most impressive things about <i>Paradise</i> is the way the band have retained so much of their character while shifting their tone considerably. A few of the songs here-- the rollicking ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16262-where-im-waking/"" target=""_blank"">Where I'm Waking</a>"" and the wistful ""Hackney Marsh""-- would have made sense on <i>Yeah So</i>, but for the most part, the melodic and lyrical sensibility of that record has been filtered through a different set of influences. There is still a sweetness to their sound, but it's balanced out with a range of more difficult emotions and a darker tonal palette.</p>
<p>The most drastic difference between <i>Yeah So</i> and <i>Paradise</i> is that Charles Watson and Rebecca Taylor have largely abandoned close harmonies. Instead, Taylor has asserted herself as the dominant vocalist, with her voice taking the lead on nearly every track, while Watson provides complementary harmonies or focuses on his guitar. This was a brilliant decision on their part. Watson has a pleasant tenor, but Taylor's voice is much more colorful and expressive. Though she supplied the high points of previous singles ""Trophy Room"" and ""Giving Up on Love"", her vocal performances through <i>Paradise</i> are a revelation: Her phrasing is consistently thoughtful and surprising, full of subtle cues that invest her straightforward lyrics with remarkable depth much in the same way a great actress can draw rich character detail out of a threadbare script.</p>
<p>Taylor's best performances-- and not coincidentally, <i>Paradise</i>'s two best songs-- take her voice in very different directions.  The ballad ""You, Earth, or Ash"" is so stark and delicate that her voice often seems naked, barely accompanied by the minimal plucking of Watson's guitar. She sounds wounded and fragile, but her tone is very adult and dignified; she gracefully transitions from moments of self-assured beauty to sounding as though she could spontaneously break down into tears. She is more girlish on ""Two Cousins"", the set's percussion-heavy opener, leaning hard on her upper register and reaching up further still to underscore particularly anguished lines. The song, about a pair of estranged family members, cycles through two choruses-- the first one carried by a trebly, diagonal synthesizer part and the second more focused on her voice, which rings out with heart-breaking clarity as she sings the tune's gutting conclusion: ""I look into your eyes/ You don't know who I am.""</p>
<p>In both songs, and throughout <i>Paradise</i>, Slow Club display remarkable skill in tugging at heartstrings, but they do it without being particularly manipulative or overly saccharine. Led along by Taylor's confident voice, the duo has evolved from being among the best of an indie pop field overcrowded with cutesy duos to carving out a distinct niche for itself that opens up further opportunities for creative growth.</p></div>"|15823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15823-paradise/|7.8|Matthew Perpetua

This is not to say they're sheet-reading music theory nerds worshipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a>, but you do get the feeling that the members of this particular trio-- none of them old enough to legally buy cigarettes in America-- are well beyond their years. Of course, they're teenagers in the 21st century: They've had far greater access to underground music than older fans. Regardless, it's not a stretch to say a group that got together in their preteens and who credit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21083-13th-floor-elevators/"" target=""_blank"">13th Floor Elevators</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6984-and-the-mysterians/"" target=""_blank"">? and the Mysterians</a> as influences should rightfully be considered as having advanced tastes.</p>
<p>Since forming, the Texans have shared stages with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28696-hunx-and-his-punx/"" target=""_blank"">Hunx and his Punx</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>. They've recorded ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aayzY3JrxyQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dream of Oz</a>"", the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a> song since Liars' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZscEMxFfEg8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Freak Out</a>"". They've garnered praise from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7067-psychedelic-horseshit/"" target=""_blank"">Psychedelic Horseshit</a>'s Matt Whitehurst-- a man far more generous with insults than he is with compliments. It's easy to see why: Their debut LP, <i>Seafaring Pyramids</i>, was an infectious blast of noisy effects-pedal-rock, shoegaze for people who wear the same pair of holey, filthy Vans every day. Interestingly, the straightforward garage of sophomore collection <i>Some Easy Magic</i> serves as a complete stylistic overhaul.</p>
<p>Instrumental opener ""Sabana Breeze"" and vintage toe-tapper ""Honey Face"" are good enough songs, but the album doesn't really kick into gear until about 12 seconds into the title track, where the descending chords and boundless energy is reminiscent of the threadbare, hanging-off-the-hinges rock of garage punk legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>. Only, where most bands (Thee Oh Sees included) would use a song like this to fulfill every garage-rock frontman's desire to howl at the moon and spit beer all over the microphone, vocalist Jacob Bruce sings an addictive melody in his best inside voice, turning what would normally be a chaotically fun moment into a tightly wound ball of nervous tension.</p>
<p>As a singer, Bruce never really goes for the jugular on the record: Each song is marked by his calmly and effortlessly spouting off brilliantly simple melody after brilliantly simple melody, employing vocal restraint where you'd least expect it. Like most well-adjusted small-town teenagers, his lyrics are often about boredom (""nothing to do"" is a combination of words used more than once on the album), and he aptly delivers them with a disaffected croon, bored to the point of numbness. This would normally be a red-flag, but Bruce has such a natural flair for melody that the songs quickly burrow into your head. When he steps away from the mic for the album's instrumentals, there's a vibe-heavy presence-- like entering a dive bar where folks go because it has cheap pitchers and a functioning jukebox.</p>
<p>Garage-rock is the province of the young and the young-at-heart. How else can you explain the slovenly strummed chords that feel like a sloppy, drunken kiss? Or the barreling drums not as concerned with fancy fills as they are the simple task of sorta keeping tempo? Or the romance of sweat, spilled beer, spitting in the air, and catching it with your mouth? Garage has always been a genre that's gotten by on fuck-all primitivism and giddy demolition. (There's a reason Shayde Sartin of the Fresh &amp; Onlys <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/articles/7951-positive-destruction-san-franciscos-new-garage-rock/"">cites</a> Personal and the Pizzas as the platonic ideal of garage-rock bands.)</p>
<p>The peculiar thing about <i>Some Easy Magic</i> is how efficiently it's delivered, how its players work through their songs like a trio of cool session players rather than pack of bloodthirsty punk kids-- especially when considering that most of the wilder bands they've played shows with are easily double their age. But their natural introvertedness doesn't hinder their ability to play simple but exhaustively catchy tunes, nor does it take away from the fact that <i>Some Easy Magic</i> is one of the most enjoyable garage albums of the year, a pure-pop record for the Terminal Boredom set. With as much promise as this record exhibits, it's scary to ponder how good they'll be once they're old enough to drink in the bars they've played in.</p></div>"|15799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15799-some-easy-magic/|7.3|Martin Douglas

But Alan Palomo is an exception. In 2009, the Texas-raised musician's <a href=""http://neonindian.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a> project debuted with the excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13510-psychic-chasms/"" target=""_blank"">Psychic Chasms</a></i>. Like a lot of young musicians, the then-21-year-old Palomo was inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>, and he certainly shared that art-pop oddball's sense of irreverence. Below the static and sneakily intricate synth patterns, <i>Psychic Chasms</i> was a funny, playful record, with goofy, drugged-out moments exemplified by song titles like ""Laughing Gas"".</p>
<p>As the buzz around <i>Psychic Chasms</i> increased, the narrative shifted. Neon Indian attained a surprising level of popularity that was bolstered by a rocking, party-ready live show, drawing in fans of populist acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>. After that raised profile, Neon Indian's second album, <i>Era Extraña</i>, shows a commitment to tighter, wide-reaching songcraft and appeal. The production value is at a higher level, with additional mixing by big-name studio guy Dave Fridmann (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">the Flaming Lips</a>, MGMT), who forgoes his usual noise-bombing style for a more subtle approach. Those drawn to <i>Psychic Chasms</i>' warped view of pop or outré work like the difficult, abstract EP with the Flaming Lips last year may be disappointed; <i>Era Extraña</i> instead builds on Neon Indian's one-off single with Green Label Sound last year, the straightforward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11845-sleep-paralysist/"" target=""_blank"">""Sleep Paralysist""</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting the shift, there's an increased focus on streamlined melodies; the vocal gasps and moans that streaked previous highs like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13076-terminally-chill/"" target=""_blank"">Terminally Chill</a>"" are still here, just not as suffocating. The wordless chorus of ""Hex Girlfriend"" is all but set to rock a festival stage or two, while ""Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)"" is a rush of life-affirming, upwards-moving melodic optimism. The music itself is intricate and accomplished, with dizzying layers of synth arrangements and stray sounds crammed into even the most big-tent cuts-- we're talking rocket-ship noises, phone conversations, lasers, and visceral video-game samples. Despite the kitchen-sink arrangements, the results are taut and defined. Palomo is anything but sloppy and he seems focused on the album as a unified whole: one of his finest songs yet, the melancholy, remix-ready ""Arcade Blues"", was given bonus-track status because he felt it didn't fit in with <i>Era Extraña</i>'s overriding themes.</p>
<p><i> Era Extraña</i> is partly about love. It may not be ""breakup album,"" in the strictest sense, but the record sounds romantic and lovesick and looks toward sounds that bring these feelings to mind, from the sugary crunch of <i>Isn't Anything</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a> (""The Blindside Kiss"") to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/"" target=""_blank"">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</a> (""Fallout""). The feel of <i>Era Extraña</i> is expansive and lonely, like someone staring at the night sky in solitude (he recorded the bulk of it solo in Helsinki, Finland during the dead of winter, where, according to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8664-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">recent Pitchfork interview</a>, he was often on the verge of losing his shit mentally.)</p>
<p>Another topic touched on in that interview was the album's sense of longing, and ""Future Sick"" conveys the feeling of growing older in a world that's growing faster than you are. Palomo bemoans having to look towards past the present under seasick synths, singing mid-volume under his own creation's drunken abstraction and promising to ""wake when things start to get peculiar"".</p>
<p>Palomo feels more comfortable when looking to the past than turning his gaze to the uncertain future. While <i>Era Extraña</i> still contains the familiar warm glow of old television sets and half-remembered memories of the 1980s, Palomo is more than adept when utilizing short-term memory to evoke some of modern indie's more memorable 2000s-era fashions. The insistent pulse of ""Suns Irrupt"" is reminiscent of LCD Soundsystem's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwoLACv_srQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Someone Great</a>"", ""Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)"" is the near-double of M83's teenage epic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abqy3DdAzHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kim and Jessie</a>"", and the sweetly lackadaisical verse structure of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12394-polish-girl/"" target=""_blank"">Polish Girl</a>"" recalls the similarly unspooling inner monologue that runs through Stars' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4lUHnwwNYc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reunion</a>"". Coincidentally, those three songs of the not-so-distant past all deal with the loss of something-- a friend, youth, and irresponsible love, respectively. Amidst the bleepy synths and swooning melodies, Palomo's simply attempting not to lose <i>himself</i>, as he sighs through processed vocal effects on ""Suns Irrupt"": ""Gone/ But I'm waiting to be someone."" Two albums in, he remains a compelling songwriter. The scrappy charm of <i>Psychic Chasms</i> was hugely appealing from the jump and its brilliant initial flash faded just slightly over time. This is a far more <i>serious</i> record than its predecessor, but Palomo isn't always as assured in rendering the darker material.</p></div>"|15817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15817-era-extrana/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

The excitement surrounding their 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> and its DIY success was certainly warranted, but two years later, blogs were still grasping at straws for the sake of ""firsties,"" bands still wanted to get signed, and CYHSY's wildly uneven follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9820-some-loud-thunder/"" target=""_blank"">Some Loud Thunder</a></i> all but acknowledged its impending backlash as a given. It was an alternately awkward and rewarding record, but at the very least, a heartening show of artistic gumption in light of hype-bubble peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4802-sound-team/"" target=""_blank"">Sound Team</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4894-birdmonster/"" target=""_blank"">Birdmonster</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4538-voxtrot/"" target=""_blank"">Voxtrot</a> essentially turning tail upon encountering the slightest bit of real scrutiny. And yet, after a five-year, self-imposed hiatus that's been described as something of a fact-finding mission for their true identity, <i>Hysterical</i> freely casts Clap Your Hands Say Yeah as the very thing their detractors inaccurately claimed them to be so long ago: a band whose story is the most interesting thing about them.</p>
<p>Truth is, <i>Hysterical</i> feels self-conscious from the moment you press play. In that inimitable avian squawk of his, Alec Ounsworth crows, ""we'll make the same mistakes,"" and it's hard not to see it as winking irony since they're doing the exact opposite: Unlike their previous two records, <i>Hysterical</i>'s opener doesn't boast some sort of abrasive production tactic meant to trigger instant buyer's remorse. In fact, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42844-new-clap-your-hands-say-yeah-same-mistake/"" target=""_blank"">Same Mistake</a>"" actually sounds <i>fantastic</i> and emphasizes the elements of their sneaky anthemic streak-- Ounsworth's broad vocal strokes, a brisk rhythm of splashy, 16th-note hi-hats and insistently strummed guitars, all coated in a wash of synthesized strings that soothes like aftershave. It's instantly likeable, it can also just as easily be tuned out completely, and there are 11 others of its kind here.</p>
<p>As hard as it is to believe that anything featuring a vocalist of Ounsworth's piercing timbre can be considered background music, <i>Hysterical</i> is almost hypnotic in its unerring consistency. You hire John Congleton as a producer, and you're all but guaranteed to sound amazing, but compared to his some of his well-known charges (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a>, <a href=""Shearwater"" target=""_blank"">Shearwater</a>), CYHSY work within a far narrower range of dynamics, tone, tempo, and instrumentation-- they sound like a more high-rent version of themselves, revealing how much ramshackle charm played a part in their debut, and that even the most jarring experiments from <i>Some Loud Thunder</i> were for their own good. If you've got a jones for no-qualifiers-necessary indie rock ca. 2005, you can get a proper fix from the title track, ""Idiot"", and ""Yesterday, Never"", where snares snap in double time, chords resolve in the most predictable fashion, and Ounsworth's melodies stride and stutter-step through familiar patterns. Still, it's tough to tell whether they impress on their own merits or whether they obtain some sort of halo effect due to their hard proximity to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKdspWe-KdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth</a>"".</p>
<p>So you're left to grasp for trimming: the horn charts on ""Maniac"" that shed <i>Hysterical</i>'s rhythmic straitjacket and hearken to Ounsworth's New Orleans fetish from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13582-skin-and-bones-mo-beauty/"" target=""_blank"">Mo Beauty</a></i>, the humid Mellotron strings and puzzling melody on the lonely ""In a Motel"", the gnarled guitar that corkscrews it way through the middle of ""Into Your Alien Arms"". But if you cut <i>Hysterical</i>, what does it bleed? At the very least, you'd think ""Ketamine and Ecstasy"" or ""Misspent Youth"" would offer some sort of insight based on titles alone, and judging by a teasing Eurythmics quote or a stray line about ""trading sex for drugs,"" maybe they do. But the words themselves rarely linger for effect, instead getting smeared over by Ounsworth's oily melismatics and distended diction.</p>
<p>Look, even those who fell hard for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6mRyZw6Wbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In This Home on Ice</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_kBDgEKbgc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Is This Love?</a>"" wouldn't be too surprised by the way things would turn out by 2011-- Clap Your Hands Say Yeah may have a confrontational edge about them, but outside of straight-up indie rock, they're not the types you'd confuse for firebrands. The disappointment is in how it sounds like their years apart have needlessly chastened them into fast-forwarding through the idiosyncratic streak they showed on <i>Some Loud Thunder</i> instead of embracing it, coming out of the wilderness only to end up smack dab in the middle of the road.</p></div>"|15805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15805-hysterical/|5.6|Ian Cohen

This isn't a bad thing-- a lot of times, it's what makes keeping up with hip-hop so exciting. But confident artists, artists with a strong sense of self, <i>should </i>be celebrated for adhering to modest ambitions. If anything, in order to have a career that lasts these days, this kind of long-term consistency will become a necessity to combat the hype-backlash loop. Bay Area rapper <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/davinci415"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DaVinci</a>'s new <i>Feast or Famine</i> EP, which follows last year's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14167-the-day-the-turf-stood-still/"" target=""_blank""><i> The Day the Turf Stood Still</i></a> debut, is a release that refines an existing formula, relying on a distinctively wistful production aesthetic and the kind of rapping that feels like a labor of love, from an artist who sees hip-hop as a career.</p>
<p>Party-rap single ""Beer, Bitches, &amp; Bullshit"" is an immediate standout, although atypical of the record's sound: Over chugging production, DaVinci is joined by scene-stealing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29012-roach-gigz/"" target=""_blank"">Roach Gigz</a> and rapper C-Plus for a song about drunken misadventures. But the bulk of the record has a glossy, carefully-crafted professional sheen. As on his previous record, his vocals are proficiently musical. He has a sixth sense for rhythm and rhyme patterns, which largely overcomes a vocal style that otherwise operates as a detached flatline. As on <i>The Day the Turf Stood Still</i>, his lyrics offer a lot to close reading, if you're that type of rap fan. His worldview is thoughtful and nostalgic, affecting a nuanced sense of melancholy one moment balanced with hopefulness the next.</p>
<p>This is a step up from his previous release primarily because of the production. Where <i>The Day</i> leaned on the predictable reliability (and ideological baggage) of classic boom-bap to frame DaVinci's lyrics, <i>Feast or Famine</i> has a more consistent, unique production style. In keeping with the relaxed pace of his music, the beats are svelte, all smoothed edges and rolling momentum. It conveys the immersive thrill of speeding down the highway with the windows up, the same feel of comfort and control, observing the passing images of an inescapable world outside. The record has a warm, welcoming feel but doesn't shy away from the kinds of real-world dilemmas of the thoughtful street rap archetype. It's an introspective, therapeutic quality, like the internal monologue of a person reflecting privately on the tangled problems he's been forced to confront.</p>
<p>The album's climactic moment epitomizes this contradiction between lush comfort and the ugliness of the outside world. With a propulsive bassline and muted trumpet samples, the incredible ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12299-paying-for-my-past-ft-tenille/"" target=""_blank"">Paying for my Past</a>"" refers briefly to a life of drug dealing (""I used to hide my bundle in a laundromat lint trap..."") but primarily zooms in on the uglier side of drug addiction, a world where you most viscerally confront your past decisions on a regular basis. DaVinci's expressionless vocals help balance the emotive content of his words and the immediacy of the production, packing a wistful emotional punch.</p></div>"|15819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15819-feast-or-famine-ep/|8.0|David Drake

Could a couple of guys with a couple of keyboards become a pop group without ever really writing pop songs? Should a house or techno act even bother releasing an album aimed at a general audience? There was no real evidence that the answer to any of these questions was ""yes,"" but 808, along with a handful of other ambitious crossover types, persisted anyway. Thanks to a mixture of luck, timing, and skill, 808 actually succeeded. And more than an any other crossover 1990s dance act, they stayed true to both their club and avant-electronic roots. The career-spanning <i>Blueprint</i> proves that 808 did have a certain commercial instinct almost from the start. What's more surprising is how big they scored with the stuff on <i>Blueprint</i> that sounds the <i>least</i> commercial.</p>
<p>808 came up in the early days of British rave by making intense and dense compositions that represented club music at its furthest-out, anticipating the kind of abstract hardcore electronica that didn't quite exist just yet. It's a thrillingly manic and claustrophobic sound, enough so that it inspired more than a few future IDM tyros. On the other hand, it's unsurprising that the caustic acid maximalism of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49P4GUA4AIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flow Coma</a>"" never charted. 808's next single, however, hit in the biggest possible way. Relaxing a bit, like rave as a whole for a brief second, they scored massively with the platonically placid ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxDRePUwEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pacific State</a>"". The tune that helped to enshrine both the saxophone and the birdcall as part of the softer side of dance music's vocabulary, ""Pacific"" still has enough of techno's antic bounce to make it seem like a great lost direction for pop, where hippie relaxation vibes and bright video game funk are not incompatible.</p>
<p>An accountant probably would have told them to ride their status as chill-out pioneers until it stopped being profitable, which could have lasted at least until <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/"" target=""_blank"">Moby</a> smothered the trend stone-dead with the success of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/"" target=""_blank"">Play</a></i>. Instead 808 released a few charmingly clunky takes on hip-house that are left out on <i>Blueprint</i>. That certainly helps the collection's flow, even if it does underline why the group calls this their ""greatest bits"" rather than a complete overview. When they finally rebounded, creatively, it once again paid off commercially. ""Pacific"" and their Brit-rap adventures had clearly given them an appreciation for ideas of beauty and fun that conformed to 99 percent of humanity's. But they never quite lost their taste for the robots-in-meltdown fierceness of ""Flow Coma"". ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRlZQRRGD8o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cubik</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIA2ddd8Bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In Yer Face</a>"" were among the 808's biggest non-""Pacific"" hits, but they were also among their rawest tunes. The difference is that the intensity now felt brash and joyful rather than hermetic and kinda creepy.</p>
<p>But the fact that one of 808's albums was called <i>Gorgeous</i> should give you an indication that their sympathies ultimately lay more with ""Pacific State"" than ""In Yer Face"". Gorgeousness as an end in itself sometimes led 808 to slick and forgettable tracks like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9B2ybeAX2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plan 9</a>"", which has as much passion and inventiveness as the house-as-high-end-hotel-muzak they unfortunately helped inspire. But even ""Plan 9"" doesn't outstay its welcome. Early adopters of the ""radio edit"" approach to taking electronic dance into the mainstream, even 808's opulent ambient stuff almost always has an instrumental earworm to get you humming. So, in addition to being just damn listenable, front to back, <i>Blueprint</i>'s also fascinating as a look at one group's answer to Brit dance culture's warring impulses in the 90s. 808's most memorable music is never split between opulent ambiance designed for the laid-back appreciation of connoisseurs and rugged slabs of computer madness to pump the adrenaline of young folks juiced on rave's novelty. The two are almost always mixed up into the same tunes, the wild beat constructions complimented by a real musical richness. That's probably why they've endured, while so many one-note singles from 808's peers have faded away.</p></div>"|15824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15824-blueprint-the-best-of-808-state/|7.5|Jess Harvell

Weingarten</a> suggested that New York City was in the midst of a ""pigfuck"" renaissance. The colorful term was first coined by critic Robert Christgau as a way to describe the misanthropic ruckus created by mid-1980s indie rock progenitors like Sonic Youth, Big Black, and the Butthole Surfers, among others.  Weingarten revived the term in honor of a handful of like-minded New York area groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"">the Men</a> and White Suns. Brooklyn-based Vaz are another fine band in this sphere, but a couple of things separate them from their name-checked contemporaries.  For one, the group has been around for over a decade, though <i>Bull</i> marks both their first album in five years and their first album as a trio.  Second, before Vaz was formed, its members were part of a musical institution that helped shape the sound that's slowly coming back into vogue.</p>
<p>Back in the 1990s, members of Vaz were in North Dakota trio Hammerhead. While they weren't able to cash in for big bucks like Helmet, or stick around long enough to achieve elder-statesmen status like the Melvins, Hammerhead did carve out their own neglected little niche, albeit in a fashion that had more in common with their Touch and Go contemporaries-- Shellac, Jesus Lizard, etc.-- than any of their kissing cousins on AmRep.</p>
<p>When two-thirds of Hammerhead--  vocalist/guitarist Paul Erickson and drummer Jeff Moordian-- went on to form Vaz following the former's break-up, they hit the ground running on 2001's <i>Demonstrations in Micronesia</i>.  Displaying a melodic knack that Hammerhead only hinted at, and managing to punch even harder despite not having a bassist, the album found the duo nearly matching the ferocity and focus of their Load Records labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>, all while barbing their hooks with just the right amount of paranoia and menace (thanks to Erickson's reverb-and-doom-laden vocal stylings). Such an accomplishment, coming when it did, earned them the adoration of a passionate few and, sadly, little else. Their subsequent releases, prior to <i>Bull</i>, didn't pack nearly the same punch, exchanging the stylistic precision of their first album for a hit-and-miss see-what-happens wanderlust that, while enjoyable in its own right, wasn't nearly as effective-- check out ""Give Us the Creeps"", from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8513-dying-to-meet-you/"" target=""_blank"">Dying to Meet You</a></i>, for one such oddball digression.</p>
<p>If the raucous and raunchy <i>Bull</i> takes after any previous Vaz record, it's thankfully <i>Micronesia</i><i>. </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">With second guitarist Tyler Nolan as its third member, the band muddies up their sound in the best possible way. The album comes off like it was recorded for a cassette release, but that sonic crudeness is a plus in this scenario.  Nolan and Erickson don't complement each other as guitar players so much as antagonize or taunt.  When Moordian enters the fray, he does so with reckless abandon, setting a breakneck pace that he's seemingly perpetually in danger of losing.  Yet despite of all these chaotic collisions, Vaz never veers off-course, instead banging out no-hold-barred rock tunes that mete their righteous fury with a sense of song. They're still nowhere near being the Next Big Thing, but with this record getting slightly more exposure, and with a slew of like-minded contemporaries banging the same drum, there's a good chance another Vaz album might come a little quicker next time.</span></p></div>"|15804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15804-vaz-chartreuse-bull/|7.6|David Raposa

She repeats the question three times in succession, each one increasingly maniacal, as if to illustrate her own point: Art can evolve only when it pushes forward, provokes, and leaves bruises. Alas, in the five years since Sleater-Kinney fell silent, nostalgia has become such a pervasive condition in pop culture that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8010-paper-trail-simon-reynolds/"" target=""_blank"">entire books are now devoted to analyzing the phenomenon</a>. But Brownstein has not relented in demanding her black-and-blue, whether using her NPR Monitor Mix blog to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/the_end_of_the_decade_skidding.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lament the preponderance of sensitive, soft-rockin' beardos in contemporary indie</a>, or skewering hipster fauxhemia alongside <i>SNL</i>'s Fred Armisen on the IFC comedy show <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmq9dq6Nsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portlandia</a></i>. So for a vocal cultural critic-- and shit-hot guitar player-- like Brownstein, the act of forming a new band isn't a simple matter of course; it's a declaration of war. But rather than point fingers from the sidelines, with <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/wildflag"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wild Flag</a> she's leading by example.</p>
<p>The name Wild Flag amounts to more than just a distant echo of similarly imposing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GE4xI3xYF0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/"" target=""_blank"">Pink</a> varieties; it represents something to rally around, at a time when the internet has broken down traditional musical allegiances in favor of all-you-can-eat consumption. As per its members' pedigrees (Brownstein is joined by fellow S-K veteran Janet Weiss on drums, ex-Helium front-woman Mary Timony on second guitar, and Rebecca Cole of Elephant Six affiliates the Minders on organ), Wild Flag variously invoke first-wave punk, post-hardcore indie rock, 1960s girl-group pop, <i>Nuggets</i>-vintage garage, Stonesy FM-radio raunch, and even flashes of proggy psychedelia. But Wild Flag aren't so much trying to relive a particular era or movement as re-stoke the kind of passion, commitment, and fandom in listeners that allowed those movements to coalesce and flourish in the first place.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Timony previously collaborated in late-1990s side project <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2008/11/the_spells_bat_vs_bird.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Spells</a>, but where their voices tended to blend together within that band's lo-tech indie-rock sound, here their personalities are much more pronounced and distinct. For much of Sleater-Kinney's existence, Brownstein played the more mild-mannered foil to lead shrieker Corin Tucker, before asserting herself more forcefully on 2002's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7237-one-beat/"" target=""_blank"">One Beat</a></i> and 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7240-the-woods/"" target=""_blank"">The Woods</a></i>; on <i>Wild Flag</i>, she essentially picks up right where she left off on ""Entertain"", pushing her voice toward more brash, flamboyant extremes. Timony, meanwhile, sounds as if she's still immersed in the fantastical reveries of Helium's 1997 swan song <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9iK1q-0xKI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Magic City</a></i>, her familiarly conversational tone having an infectiously calming effect on the band.</p>
<p>But in their own peculiar ways, both singers strive to express their irrepressible awe for the power of music and the effect it has on them-- nearly every song here hinges on the connection between sound and movement, and the relationship between what happens between the ears and below the belt. Brownstein's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12238-wild-flag-romance/"" target=""_blank"">Romance</a>"" and ""Boom"" are impassioned testaments to rock'n'roll's sensuous allure, translating inner desire into public manifesto; Timony sings of music's essence in more mythic terms, equating it to a magical artifact (the psychedelic set piece ""Glass Tambourine"") or cult ritual (""Electric Band"", as in: ""Come on, join our…"") as if she were the friendly fairy godmother on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDpt9iicEow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some subversively trippy Saturday-morning kids' TV show</a>.</p>
<p>The considerable contrast between the two singers gives Wild Flag a somewhat predictable ebb and flow, with a song-by-song trade-off between Brownstein's rambunctious, locomotive rockers and Timony's more quirky, complex compositions. Credit Weiss and Cole for effectively mediating between these disparate sensibilities: Wild Flag never sound more together than when they're being led off the rails by Weiss' Keith Moon-worthy breakdowns and Cole's wandering ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDtqbS7DK2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sister Ray</a>""-style organ lines, as they push the wiry ""Short Version"" and charmingly cheeky ""Racehorse"" into joyous full-band jams and sing-along chants.

Since his 2010 breakout <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14474-pilot-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Pilot Talk</a></i>, the New Orleans rapper has reliably released a high-quality new mixtape or full-length album every couple of months, but he's remained perplexingly easy to overlook: as  befits a rapper heavily indebted to weed culture, he seems less young-and-hungry and more like the guy who was always just <i>around</i> somehow. Committed, in a noncommittal sort of way.</p>
<p>But don't let the hangdog pose fool you: it takes ferocious inner steel to put out this much consistently good music in so little time, and the fact that he's done so without disrupting the heavy-lidded calm of his pose only makes it more impressive. His latest release, the DJ Drama mixtape <i>Verde Terrace</i>, isn't his best work this year, or even in the last six months: that would be last June's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15591-weekend-at-burnies/"" target=""_blank"">Weekend at Burnie's</a></i>. Like many recent DJ Drama mixtapes, it sags beneath some lazy or obvious beat selections. The boilerplate, rushed-feeling song titles reflect minutes of thought: ""My Life is a Movie"", ""Run Dat Shit"", ""High Tunes"". It contains the world's most unnecessary remake of  Biggie's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihPOTDxMfE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ten Crack Commandments</a>"", delivered entirely by Curren$y's Russian-doll miniature sidekick Young Roddy.</p>
<p>And yet Curren$y has burnished his star to such a warm, hazy glow that whenever he appears on it, things snap immediately into focus. His weed talk has grown so metaphorically florid that it's entered its own realm: If you're a rapper who writes about getting high and you hear Curren$y say he gets ""lifted like sanctions,"" how do you even begin to respond? His puns and double entendres continue to boast sneaky layers, à la ""She puts the phone in her lap and when I call she comin'."" <i>Verde Terrace</i> boasts fewer of these quotables than recent performances, but he still proves he can spin your head with startling ease a dozen or more times.</p>
<p>Indeed, what often gets shortchanged in Curren$y's ""weed rapper"" label is the compelling slipperiness of his mind: ""Nonchalant, but I'm very aware of what's going on,"" he assures us on ""Pinifarina"". His default mode is ""easily unimpressed,"" an attitude surely honed from doing time in shifting rap regimes from No Limit to Cash Money. ""I'm from New Orleans, I stunt/ In a blue moon once... But I don't be doin' too much,"" he raps on ""Ways to Kill Em"", a side-note observation that indicates the warily careful philosophy behind the bored facade: keep your head down, keep rapping.</p>
<p><i>Verde Terrace</i> doesn't break any new territory for Curren$y, but ""new territory""  isn't really part of his M.O.-- he is digging a groove, one into which he settles more comfortably each year. It's a technique he might have soaked up from his one-time mentor Lil Wayne, who chased the same six metaphors single-mindedly until they yielded delirium. Like Wayne, Curren$y is refining the contours of his tiny universe so that it resembles no one else's. The point is driven home on <i>Verde Terrace</i>'s outro ""Smoke Sum n"", when Wayne appears for a guest verse. It's the first time the two have collaborated since parting ways four years ago, and the ships-passing-in-the-night moment is telling: Wayne very much sounds like a visitor in  Curren$y's territory now. And Curren$y sounds like no one's idea of a sidekick.</p></div>"|15820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15820-curreny-verde-terrace/|7.3|Jayson Greene

The Liverpool mainstay's fifth album is titled <i>Gravity the Seducer</i>, but Newton's discovery clearly struggles to seal the deal throughout. During their dozen-year career, the band's refused to outright repeat themselves-- 2002's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4631-light-magic/"" target=""_blank"">Light &amp; Magic</a></i> was a glossier, more robust update on the toy-store analog work of the previous year's debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4633-604/"" target=""_blank"">604</a></i>, while 2008's underrated, overstuffed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11551-velocifero/"" target=""_blank"">Velocifero</a></i> added a menacing stare and at-times mismatched experimentation to the void-creating shoegaze synths of 2005's game-changing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4635-the-witching-hour/"" target=""_blank"">The Witching Hour</a></i>. For <i>Gravity the Seducer</i>, they've taken off the cinder block that <i>Velocifero</i> applied to the gas pedal, opting for a floatier, airy feel that often sounds as if its creators' feet are barely touching the ground. Hired gun Alessandro Cortini (Nine Inch Nails) returns to lend an extra hand, but his touch is less heavily felt than on <i>Velocifero</i>, where, more often than not, throttling industrial rhythms prevailed.</p>
<p>Change is good, right? Well, here's the rub: Ladytron aren't quite content to let go of the since-perfected <i>Witching Hour</i> sound that won them attention beyond the Cobrasnake crowd, so the push-and-pull between their new-look sound and the blank-eyed electrogaze of the past creates an unfortunate tension. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41717-video-ladytron-ace-of-hz/"" target=""_blank"">Ace of Hz</a>"" and ""Mirage"" are boilerplate, late-aughts Ladytron, right down to the charging synth melodies and vague political-naturalistic lyricism, and the former's shoulders-shrugged ordinariness is driven home when its melody is redone on the instrumental LP closer ""Aces High"". Earlier on the album, another sorta-instrumental rears its head in the form of ""Ritual"", a limp faux-rocker that, if nothing else, makes for an easy ""Roxy Elevator Music"" joke.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the weightless pomp of <i>Gravity the Seducer</i>'s fresher material is more impressive. Opener ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42526-new-ladytron-white-elephants/"" target=""_blank"">White Elephant</a>"" is a sneaky-good song with a swaying melody that belongs in the Great Ladytron Songs canon, while the drum machine-kissed ballad ""Ambulances"" bucks the band's trend for blush-worthy, Tolkien-esque lyricism in favor of a worrying plea in the name of lost love. Still, even when Ladytron attempt to fully escape the past, it haunts them: the melodic structure of album highlight ""90 Degrees"", in all its glistening beauty, can't help but recall <i>Witching Hour</i> closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWKSSl_Xm-U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">All the Way...</a>"", a song that's of the band's most directly affecting works to date and certainly more substantial than the majority of what's here.</p>
<p>So <i>Gravity the Seducer</i> is a transitional album bearing the growing pains and separation anxiety that we usually associate with bands that are in between periods of true inspiration. It's not a <i>bad</i> record, but it is an upsettingly uneven one, especially considering the flashes of greatness that Ladytron are still capable of. I'm tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt, though, based on their longevity alone. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15377-best-of-00-10/"" target=""_blank"">his review</a> of last year's greatest hits collection, <i>Best of 00-10</i>, ex-Pitchfork editor Scott Plagenhoef made an excellent case for why Ladytron demand more than a light dismissal-- and, let's face it, considering the flash-in-the-pan electroclash ""movement"" that first gave them recognition, it's a pleasant shock that they've stuck around this long and still manage to evolve. ""Points for showing up"" usually carries negative connotations, so how about we give Ladytron ""points for surviving."" After all, simply sticking around without growing totally stale is a feat that's not easily pulled off these days.</p></div>"|15803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15803-gravity-the-seducer/|6.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Which isn't a bad thing. Wiltzie makes sonorous and droning music with static harmonies in Stars of the Lid (and has played in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4653-windsor-for-the-derby/"" target=""_blank"">Windsor for the Derby</a>); O'Halloran writes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx6gr_Ch9x8%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">melancholy piano music</a> built around the repetition of chords and phrases. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/awvfts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Winged Victory for the Sullen</a>, it turns out, is an exact halfway point between the two.</p>
<p>What's interesting about the sound they've hit on isn't so much what the two musicians bring to each other's styles, as it is what each sacrifices from his own. In Stars of the Lid, Wiltzie and Brian McBride have a particular way of massing instruments into a big, pulmonary drone-- the individual timbres of the instruments rarely rise out of the overall shape. You can hear him do some of this on <i>A Winged Victory for the Sullen</i>, making new sounds out of many sub-sounds, but he also lets certain individual tones take over. It creates small, noticeable details in otherwise large, fairly monolithic compositions.</p>
<p>O'Halloran is a synesthete, and I wonder what this music looks like to  him. Certainly, it has different colors from his own work, though his  usual palette is present. He's used to the repetitive harmonic structures favored by Wiltzie, but in his own music there is typically more movement. When his music includes more than piano, he's usually chosen those  instruments for their unique timbres. Here, he's giving a bit of that  away to Wiltzie. The strings-- and even to some extent the piano-- move  in and out of focus. The duo did some of the principle recording at  Berlin's Grunewald Church and overdubbed  some of the strings in East Germany's old state radio studios, so some  of this blurring and refocusing can be attributed to acoustic spaces in  which the recordings were made-- like Wiltzie's other duo, A Winged  Victory creates all these otherworldly sounds using only traditional  instruments.</p>
<p>The band was named in reference to a Greek statue in the Louvre called ""<a href=""http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674098115&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674098163&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674098163&amp;bmLocale=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winged Victory of Samothrace</a>,"" a long-beheaded depiction of Nike, the winged goddess of victory, found on the Greek island of Samothrace. It portrays the striding, triumphant figure, an image of arrested motion that ties nicely to this record: A Winged Victory's music, more active than drone and thicker than minimalism, captures movement and freezes it.</p></div>"|15809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15809-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen/|7.3|Joe Tangari

The duo of Julian Grefe and Justin Geller had finely honed senses of rhythm, tone, and humor from the get-go; they didn't resort to words very often, but when they did, they were pretty funny.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> (The previous two Pink Skull albums were called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13699-endless-bummer/"" target=""_blank"">Endless Bummer</a></i> and <i>Zeppelin 3</i>-- both classic-rock references, notably.)</span></p>
<p>Grefe and Geller added a guitarist, bassist, and drummer to the group's lineup a few years back (whereupon they became a solid live band), and they've thrown in a few more band members for <i>Psychic Welfare</i>. Somehow, though, a lot of their virtues have fallen away. There's nothing here with a beat as crisp and vigorous as <i>Zeppelin</i>'s ""Gonzo's Cointreau""-- another Zep joke!-- or <i>Bummer</i>'s ""Ritualistic Bug Use"". Nothing here clocks in at more than four-and-a-half minutes; none of these grooves could sustain themselves for much longer. (Of the 13 tracks, four are esssentially single-idea interludes.)</p>
<p>The most dubious change Pink Skull have undergone, though, is focusing much more on songs with vocals, which have never been their strong point. Grefe's not a particularly charismatic or compelling or assertive singer, and he doesn't have a lot to say lyrically, so his voice ends up being the least distinctive but most omnipresent tone on the album-- the equivalent of an overused keyboard preset from a band that would never otherwise dream of overusing a keyboard preset. ""Hot Bubblegum"" starts as a cute musical paraphrase of ABC's old synth-pop single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0RcHdbdIjc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Be Near Me</a>"", but Grefe's tuneless, why-am-I-doing-this vocal performance (""Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ Hot bubblegum/ It's all over me"") keeps it from going anywhere.</p>
<p>Pink Skull's gift for texture is inalienable: This isn't much of a dance record, but it's pretty neat as a headphone record. That's especially true of the one genuinely terrific song here, the dissonant instrumental stomp ""Bee Nose"", whose creepy, sidling synths come off like curdled Boards of Canada. Even the lesser tracks have cool little details in their arrangements, though, like the doubled bass lurch that drags ""Janine Aubergine"" across its foursquare snare-snap or the airy saxophone solo that pulls ""Mu"" together and explicitly recalls the way Ultramarine records toyed with prog-rock in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Still, this is a retreat from a group that was once much weirder and brasher. Where they used to feed both the hips and the head, this time they're settling for distracted pop songwriting and tone without groove. They're taking themselves more seriously than they ever have before, but what used to make them a pleasure to listen to was that they took nothing except their craft seriously.</p></div>"|15816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15816-pink-skull-psychic-welfare/|5.3|Douglas Wolk

But just when it looks like the two are going to consummate their affair, the husband is struck with a crisis of conscience and runs back home to his wife. The opening track on Annie Clark's third album as <a href=""http://www.ilovestvincent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a> is also called ""Chloe in the Afternoon"", and while Clark has acknowledged the influence of Rohmer's film on the song, she takes the story to a darker, more dominatrix-y place. In her telling, Chloe carries a ""black lacquered horse-hair whip,"" and, presumably, is paid to use it on white-collar exhibitionists looking for a sadistic tea-time fix. Clark's monstrously corroded guitar riff stands in for the bruised skin and wincing faces; it's hard to tell if she's singing as the person wearing heels or the person being stepped on with them, and that's most definitely the point.</p>
<p>Across three albums, the Dallas native has become a master of subverting her picture-perfectness with violence, rage, and mystery-- ""I'll make you sorry,"" sang Clark in creepy lullaby tones on the very first song on her debut album. The juxtaposition is naturally intriguing, a sophisticated twist on finding out that the horror-movie killer was actually the girl next door all along. ""Physically, I'm a very demure-looking person,"" Clark said in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8661-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">recent Pitchfork interview</a>, ""but I certainly have as much aggression or anger as the next person, and that's got to come out somehow."" On her fine, art-rocking debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10457-marry-me/"" target=""_blank"">Marry Me</a></i>, those feelings of hurt, loss, and bloodlust could translate a tad cutesy. (On new track ""Cheerleader"", the lines, ""I've played dumb when I knew better/ Tried too hard just to be clever,"" sound more self-consciously frank than usual.) Follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12985-actor/"" target=""_blank"">Actor</a></i> found Clark over-embellishing at times, adding superfluous strings and flutes that often muddied her message.</p>
<p>But Clark's recent live <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42604-report-our-band-could-be-your-concert/"" target=""_blank"">Big Black covers</a> saw her taking the pretty/ugly contrast to raw new levels: ""I think I fucked your girlfriend once, maybe twice,"" she sang, fervently, on ""Bad Penny"", ""I fucked all your friends' girlfriends-- now they hate you!"" And anyone who's seen the Berklee dropout do her seizured duckwalk in concert while soloing on unhinged tracks like <a href=""http://youtu.be/dakYYtuGPRI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Your Lips Are Red""</a> knows her not-so-secret weapon is a lurching guitar style somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Fripp</a>'s sheet-metal prog and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19422-tom-morello/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Morello</a>'s 10-ton riffage. On <i>Strange Mercy</i>, she ditches <i>Marry Me</i>'s naivety and <i>Actor</i>'s ostentatious arrangements, boosts the inventive guitar playing, and ends up with her most potent and cathartic release yet.</p>
<p>Some tracks build like a hot kettle, puffing out ragged smoke in the form of instrumental curlicues. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16094-surgeon/"" target=""_blank"">Surgeon</a>"" finds Clark zonked, despondent, paralyzed. ""Turn off the TV, wade in bed, a blue and a red, a little something to get along,"" she sings, ""best, finest surgeon, come cut me open."" And soon enough, the song revives itself with a bursting synth freak-out courtesy of gospel keyboardist Bobby Sparks. ""Cheerleader"" breaks on its enormous hook, with Clark singing, ""I, I, I, I, I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more,"" each ""I"" pounding down hard, emphatically stating its independence. And it's Clark's manic guitar-- sounding like exploding radio static-- that cuts through a relationship's indecisive fickleness on ""Northern Lights"". On that song, she sings, ""Gotta get young fast gotta get young quick/ Gotta make this last if it makes me sick,"" and the topic of aging and lost youth is brought up several times on the album.</p>
<p>At 28, Clark seems to be sorting through her own existential artistic dilemmas. A champagne year is supposed to be celebrated when you turn the same age as the day you were born, but ""Champagne Year"" finds the singer-- born September 28, 1982-- in a decidedly non-bottle-popping mood. Her voice takes on a gorgeous creak on the nebulous ballad, as she sings, ""I make a living telling people what they wanna hear/ It's not a killing but it's enough to keep the cobwebs clear."" An almost-30 indie musician's lament? Perhaps. Meanwhile, the galloping ""Hysterical Strength"" employs some magical thinking while dealing with death. When Clark isn't bulldozing through time and space with her fretwork, she's contemplating her place with care. The balance is something to behold.</p>
<p>While <i>Strange Mercy</i>'s more propulsive workouts-- including the single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12297-cruel/"" target=""_blank"">Cruel</a>"", Clark's purest pop song to date-- are quick to snag attention, the slow burners hit just as heavily. The playful ""Dilettante"" combines the mutant funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a>'s <a href=""http://youtu.be/GA27aQZCQMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fashion""</a> with the understated genius of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"" target=""_blank"">D'Angelo</a>'s <i>Voodoo</i>, and has Clark possibly propositioning a prophet: ""Oh, Elijah, don't make me wait/ What is so pressing that you can't undress me, anyway?"" Closer ""Year of the Tiger"" is a stark summation of end-times capitalism in a recession-stuck United States. Sounding like a Wall Street swindler, she slithers, ""Italian shoes like these rubes know the difference/ Suitcase of cash in the back of my stick-shift... Oh America, can I owe you one?"" And the delicate title track involves a child, a father stuck behind prison glass, and a breaking point in the form of a refrain: ""If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up, no I don't know what."" Her threat here is not a gimmick or a subversion; it's irrational, confused, and real.</p>
<p>Specific names (Chloe, Elijah) and times (""Year of the Tiger"", ""Champagne Year"") give <i></i>the sense that <i>Strange Mercy</i> exists in its own universe. As does its music, which skips through art-rock touchstones from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Gabriel</a> without relinquishing a bit of its originality. After all, those artists were trying to create new sounds, an ever-more-difficult task in a culture steeped in its own detritus. Here, Clark's role-playing is grounded in emotions that are as cryptic as they are genuine and affecting. And when her voice can't bear it, her guitar does the screaming.</p></div>"|15813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/|9.0|Ryan Dombal

The whole stock of it was lost, and because they had to re-press it, they couldn't offer it for pre-order on their website. Multiply that across thousands of releases, and you have a pretty good idea of the effect that fire had on the industry-- it gave a lot of people who were already struggling to make money off music a hell of a hard time.</p>
<p>All the more ironic, then, that <i>Earth Division</i> is among Mogwai's least fiery, least riotous recordings. The four songs, each averaging about four minutes long, mostly showcase the band's softest, most melancholy tendencies, tendencies that on the band's LPs are often set off by volume spikes, long crescendos, white noise, and the cumulative effects of repetition over long periods with subtle changes. Here, with one exception, they sound as though they're in soundtrack mode. The EP's bookend instrumentals especially have a cold and studied feel, mixing strings with piano and, on closer ""Does This Always Happen?"", a single repeated guitar phrase, to create static soundscapes. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43342-new-mogwai-get-to-france/"" target=""_blank"">Get to France</a>"" is gloomy and doomy, but feels almost like it would work best as an intro to something bigger.</p>
<p>The middle of the EP is given to the extremes of the band's sound. ""Hound of Winter"" is the only vocal track, and like many of the band's vocal tracks, it's instrumentally rich but melodically flat. Acoustic guitars and harmonicas don't seem to suit them quite as well as electric guitars. The real keeper is ""Drunk and Crazy"", which draws on Mogwai's experimental strengths to create a miniature that feels far more drawn-out and epic than it actually is. It begins in a morass of lunging static and cuts suddenly to a middle passage of gorgeously arranged strings. The intro isn't some kind of fake-out-- the static returns later to swallow everything-- but the dynamic shifts, from shuddering noise to traditional beauty and back again, give the song a strong, compelling form.</p>
<p>That kind of contrast, and mastery of it, has always been what defined Mogwai at their best, whether it was textural contrast or simple shifts in volume or rhythm. It's not present on the other three tracks here, though they are pleasant enough listening. At the risk of boxing the band in, though, ""pleasant"" has never been why I've come to Mogwai.</p></div>"|15810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15810-earth-division/|6.4|Joe Tangari

This includes better known crossovers like Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"" target=""_blank"">Nachtmystium</a> or Norway's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6873-enslaved/"" target=""_blank"">Enslaved</a>, bands who started by coloring within the lines but eventually shifted styles so radically, they basically invented their own genres. Usually in black metal-- a scene with an extremely rigid set of rules and regulations-- progression takes time (and balls). Now and then, though, a black metal group emerges fully weird. Some of these are eccentric oddities (see, for instance, Striborg); others have a larger universal vision in spite of their strangeness. One of the more compelling of the latter is <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/circleofouroborusfinland"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Circle of Ouroborus</a>, a Finnish duo that's been finding ways to straddle its love of Joy Division and corpse paint for a number of years. (If their intentions weren't explicit enough on a 2004 demo or an early, eerie split with Germany's Urfaust, their first full-length, 2006's <i>Shores</i>, included <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9OGm2TFeDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a cover of ""She's Lost Control""</a>.)</p>
<p>Since the beginning, CoO have continually tweaked and refined what they do, further establishing (and enmeshing themselves in) a very particular aesthetic, all without sounding samey. In 2010 they released, among other things, the Current 93-like <i>Cast to the Pits</i>, the droning, blackened Fall-esque depresso rock of <i>Unituli</i>, a split with the post-metal band Crooked Necks, and the Wold-scaped <i>MatterEther</i> EP. The fact that the group is just two guys-- multi-instrumentalist Atvar and vocalist/lyricist Antti Klemi-- gives them a kind of devil-may-care, ready-for-battle gameness. Or, to put in terms of prolific lo-fi peers from a different scene: Since 2004 they've put out records at a Guided by Voices pace. For instance, 2010 alone had close to 10 releases, including three full-lengths, a couple of EPs, a pair of demos, splits. Some are minor, some skippable, all of them pretty hard to track down.</p>
<p>Their newest, <i>Eleven Fingers</i>, is my favorite CoO to date, their best full-length since 2009's <i>Tree of Knowledge</i>, a collection released by Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions. This new one, mastered by James Plotkin, is out on Handmade Birds, the new imprint by R. Loren (Pyramids, Sailors With Wax Wings). It should also be easier to find than some of the others: The initial vinyl edition of 500 will be followed by a larger CD edition Loren says will likely be available ""well into next year,"" something you don't usually hear regarding a CoO record.</p>
<p>Beyond availability, it's the strongest, most concise example of what they do, a dark and depressive sort of blackened post-punk that also manages to be catchy and anthemic. (The lines, ""Now I drink the wine and swallow the shadow/ Now I take my knife and slash this landscape apart,"" on standout ""Shadows Lead"" should also give you an idea of the feel they're after.) Importantly, it's also a record that will appeal to people who don't care, at all, about black metal. As the previously posted ""<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/forkcast/16240-warpath/%20"">Warpath</a>"" suggested, <i>Eleven Fingers</i> spins a darkly cavernous, bizarrely buoyant sound that really is akin to Ian Curtis and mates delving into the kind of black metal that came along after <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Bloody-Satanic-Underground/dp/0922915946"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lords of Chaos</a></i>. It's raw but deep, and there's a lot folded into its layers: Pair it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>, and it's punk; play it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27827-amesoeurs/"" target=""_blank"">Amesoeurs</a>, and the more post-metal tendencies surface.</p>
<p>Even on the album's more stationary, droning rants, you get a sense of movement and release, something not always present in CoO's past material. They're better songwriters now, able to offer strong melodies and hooks, not just the originality of the aesthetic. In fact, the push and pull between these seven tracks feels impressively endless-- guitars buzz like synthesizers, drums pull you in with their wobbling rolls. More than on other recent offerings, they've found a  way to re-introduce some of the black metal elements first associated  with them: On opener ""The Prayer"", that deadened Curtis bellow is repeatedly interrupted by a full-on growl. Speaking of which, the most integral part of <i>Eleven</i>'s upgrade are Klemi's vocals: The submerged, sadsack Mark E. Smith-patterned rantings are tuneful and (surprisingly) emotional. Overall, there's less distance. In the  past you sometimes got the sense he was singing to himself in the next  room; here, there's a weird connectivity, even if you have no idea what he's howling beneath all the fuzz.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise, and greatest pleasure, though, is that Circle of Ouroborus no longer seem all that weird. Sure, one of the things that's always made CoO interesting is that  dogged adherence to their original, obsessively personal aesthetic. (The ""Ouroboros"" is the symbol that  shows a serpent forming a circle by swallowing its own tail. Or, as  Klemi bellows in ""Warpath"": ""My pulse is my mantra."") But if you didn't know the history, and didn't follow the timeline, <i>Eleven Fingers</i> would hit you like a great, haunting, moving post-punk record, not the culmination  of a march inward by a couple of Finnish outsiders.</p></div>"|15815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15815-eleven-fingers/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

<p>It's impossible to talk about <i>Dreams</i> without taking a close look at the production. Taylor's done well to craft a particular in-house Terrible Records vibe, and with its abundant stylish synths and zoned-out bass textures, <i>Dreams</i> feels like a compelling mission statement for that sound. It's a distillation of the dusky, 1980s-leaning atmosphere Taylor carefully molded around Twin Shadow's pop songs on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14675-forget/"" target=""_blank"">Forget</a></i>. There are also elements of Grizzly Bear-- more the darkened alleys and left-turns that characterized 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"" target=""_blank"">Yellow House</a></i> than the fine-tuned engine of <i>Veckatimest</i>. At this point, though, it feels a bit clinical.</p>
<p>In some ways the sound's the logical opposite of the more lo-fi/bedroom projects of the past few years, but <i>Dreams</i> also suffers from similar problems in terms of depth and emotional connection. There's plenty of surface enjoyment on ""The Edge"" or ""BANG"", both showing an impressive attention to detail and easy-riding synths. The tracks' drawling slo-mo funk calls to mind some of Prince's more introverted moments, and Taylor's voice sounds great. But there's a nagging feeling that the aesthetic compositions, here and elsewhere on <i>Dreams</i>, are like bubbles-- they float by with solid-looking, effervescent charm, but burst upon closer inspection.</p>
<p>The cold, surgical atmosphere comes off like something <i>American Psycho</i>'s Patrick Bateman might enjoy in 2011: Some of <i>Dreams</i> isn't far from the expensive-sounding Genesis of <i>Invisible Touch</i>, particularly the sterile gloss of that record's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz7bqxeVgNw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tonight, Tonight, Tonight</a>"". While Taylor is no Phil Collins-- and he errs more on the side of emotional nonchalance than Collins' tendency to over-sing-- they both share an unwavering seriousness. Set against the dense backdrops of the title track and songs like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16100-answer/"" target=""_blank"">Answer</a>"", that seriousness makes everything feel a bit overburdened, lacking in the coy naivety or light touch that made the Twin Shadow record a fun <i>and</i> interesting listen. (Really, <i>Dreams</i> too often sounds like a retread of <i>Forget</i> with the fun sucked out.)</p>
<p>The record is most gripping at its last breath: The end of ""Rises Silent"" and ""Bericht"" find Taylor alone with a piano, shorn of the stylistic trickery. The result is disarmingly tender, adding a few heartfelt minutes of warmth and personal connection, something lacking in the rest of <i>Dreams</i>' gloss.</p></div>"|15793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15793-cant-dreams-come-true/|6.1|Hari Ashurst

I don't mean ""timeless"" in the sense that people refer to, say, Adele or Duffy as timeless, when really they're really just evoking a very specific time that happens to be distant. Marling evokes other artists, too, but they're spread out over the past five decades of pop and rock, from Joni Mitchell, Fairport Convention, and Leonard Cohen to Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey. Still, her songs feel divorced from time, lacking clues or signposts to indicate whether her stories and scenes might be set 500 years ago or yesterday. Marling's first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12134-alas-i-cannot-swim/"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14075-i-speak-because-i-can/"" target=""_blank"">albums</a> were noteworthy in large part for their precociousness. Her newest is <i>A Creature I Don't Know</i>, and it's her first that can't benefit from stunning you with its level of maturity. This is simply who Marling is right now-- an artist deeply invested in archetypes, one who doesn't muck about with the details of 21st-century life in her explorations of desire, loss, and understanding.</p>
<p>Certainly it's a brave artistic approach, this notion of wrestling with only the most primal states of being and ignoring all the fleeting fads and noise that make up the rest of our world. At the same time, such a large part of songwriting is making human connections, and often with Marling it's not entirely clear whether these songs are springing forth from a 21-year-old Englishwoman or some deathless, wandering spirit. Her reliance on heavily symbolic language and lack of interest in putting more of her personality into her compositions creates frustrating paradoxes: Her music's intimate yet distant, earthy yet seemingly not of this earth.</p>
<p>That said, the success of each song on <i>A Creature I Don’t Know</i> hinges on how well Marling inhabits the role she's given herself. Fortunately, while she may not be a particularly revealing performer, she's an extremely commanding one. Marling's tendency is to be stark and direct, and her presence carries equal weight whether she's accompanied by little more than piano or guitar (the unnervingly hushed, death-obsessed ""Night After Night"") or a churning instrumental malestrom (the Neil Young-worthy ""The Beast""). On ""The Muse"", ""Salinas"", and the <i>Zeppelin III</i>-goes-hoedown single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16104-sophia/"" target=""_blank"">Sophia</a>"", Marling's scarily impressive self-possession actually spills over into a kind of wickedly controlling glee, as she adds domineering theatrical flourishes to certain words and phrases in a manner that comes reasonably close to matching Harvey during her mid-1990s reign. Marling may spend the majority of these songs and several others struggling to find wisdom and peace in the face of trials brought on by lust, money, and death, but she almost always sounds like she already has all the answers.</p></div>"|15808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15808-a-creature-i-dont-know/|7.6|Joshua Love

Critic Simon Reynolds' recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/8010-paper-trail-simon-reynolds/"" target=""_blank"">book</a> on the subject tapped into a feeling a lot of people had but couldn't quite pin down: In the age of the limitless archive, the relationship between new artists and their influences are changing. Since the retirement of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, San Francisco's <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/GIRLSsf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>, who return here after the terrific debut LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Album</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14870-broken-dreams-club-ep/"" target=""_blank"">an also-great follow-up EP</a>, just might be the band best making use of the current situation. Their music pilfers from the past without shame but also manages to sound like no one else.</p>
<p><span>The first listen to </span><i>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</i><span> brings with it an almost eerie sense of familiarity, like these are songs you've been hearing your whole life even when you can't place them, and it's sometimes startling just how specific the references can be. The opening ""Honey Bunny"" has a shuffling beat and riff that is close to Paul Simon's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpaNJqF4po"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kodachrome</a>""; ""Love Like a River"" has a verse structure, chord changes, and tinkling piano arrangement almost identical to the Beatles' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8-29i_Thp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oh! Darlin</a>"", which was itself a direct rip of songs like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQQCPrwKzdo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blueberry Hill</a>"". ""Magic"" has bouncy sunshine pop chords that bring to mind something from a <i>Have a Nice Day</i> comp, ""Die"" has almost the same melody as Deep Purple's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3o-fL4GC0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Highway Star</a>"". The arrangements throughout have whirring organ, guitar fills, solos, flutes, and backing vocals borrowed from classic rock and placed exactly where you would expect them to be. And tying it all together is the production from Doug Boehm and the band, which sounds ""old"" simply because it sounds so incredibly <i>good</i>. This is one of the best-sounding rock records in years, redolent of a time when there was more money to spend in getting the basic tracks perfect, better ears to figure out which microphone should be used and precisely where it should be placed, and no pressure to make the mix ultra-hot for digitally-driven radio.</span></p>
<p>But if <i>Father</i> were merely an exceptionally recorded album built on obvious nods to the past, it wouldn't add up to much. Instead, the record comes alive with color and personality largely thanks to Girls' singer and songwriter Christopher Owens. He has a preternatural gift for turning clichés into into deeply affecting songs, and as they jump from one style to the next, from delicate acoustic balladry to noisy rave-ups, Owens' voice and point of view ground the record and make it distinctive. He is the center. As long as he is writing and singing, no matter what else is going on and being referenced, the music will be utterly his.</p>
<p>A lot of that is up to the timbre of his voice. On <i>Album</i>, Owens often had the pinched, clogged-sinus tone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Costello</a> without the sneer, but here his vocals are warmer and softer, often bringing to mind the whispery tone of Elliott Smith. It's a testament to the care of the recording that even when he seems to be cooing into the microphone while the sometimes-thick arrangements grow around him, every word is clear and in balance. His voice exhibits both weariness and innocence and manages to convey hope and despair in equal measure. It also has an androgynous quality that fits the themes of Girls' music.</p>
<p>Owens' songs often seem to have an undefined and undirected desire for love and sex and friendship that exists outside of any one idea of sexuality. It's about feelings first, and the object of them second; who or what the singer wants is less important than the fact that the yearning is there, and it's unfulfilled, and that hurts. The lack of specificity can give Owens' songs a narcissistic slant, but it feels most like the self-obsession of early childhood, where lines between the self and the outside world aren't clear. ""I can see so much clearer when I just close my eyes,"" he sings at one point, and it feels like the work of someone who has done a lot of thinking in the dark.</p>
<p>Indeed, so much about Owens' lyrical outlook, from how he uses shopworn imagery to the disarming simplicity of his declarations, conveys the sense of a child feeling around, discovering for the first time things we all found and absorbed years ago. So when he sings ""My love is like a river/ She just keeps on rolling on"" and ""Lay my burden down by the river's edge"" in ""Love Like a River"", it sounds like someone starting from the simplest conventions of the pop song and working inward to see if life actually functions the way that the songs tell us it does. Not since Jonathan Richman has there been a songwriter so willing to convey honest and deep feelings through the most basic pop syntax, and Owens also shares Richman's desire to use familiar song forms to get these essential messages across.</p>
<p>On <i>Album</i>, it was easy to hear the words and focus on Owens' backstory, which included being raised in a cult whose belief system contributed to the premature death of his brother. But these songs feel too essential and relatable to connect it to Owens' life alone. It's more about what we make of it as listeners and less about the damage of his early years. There's also a layer of awareness in his delivery, and he's able to tweak his own naïvteté in interesting ways. On the opening song, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12287-honey-bunny/"" target=""_blank"">Honey Bunny</a>"", he sings about how his mother loved and accepted him and told him that ""everything will be all right"" and then follows by saying, ""I need a woman who loves me! me! me! me!""</p>
<p>This lyrical simplicity shouldn't obscure the fact that these are sharply constructed songs that take unusual turns. One of Girls' specialities is their willingness to go completely over the top but somehow keep us right there with them. Early single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12265-vomit/"" target=""_blank"">Vomit</a>"" is one such epic, folding in soulful organ and the kind of wailing gospel-like vocals that signified ""authenticity"" when the Stones and Floyd ruled the world; but, with Owens' wounded voice in the middle of it all, even this bombastic song feels personal and even intimate. ""Just a Song"" begins with a gorgeously basic nylon string guitar figure and slowly drifts into a whispered refrain that stretches endlessly, Owens intoning, ""Love, it's just a song,"" in his softest way as flutes swirl around him. He seems to be slipping into a widening hole that's half oceanic bliss and half fade-out death, and that combination nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a>, an influence that was there on <i>Album</i> and is sometimes present here, particularly in the way Girls don't shy away from repetition and mix sonic decadence with wide-eyed spiritual yearning.</p>
<p>The largest canvas of all stretches across ""Forgiveness"", the eight-minute song that serves as the album's emotionally exhausting peak. It builds slowly and winds around in circles as Owens offers homilies about love and fear and redemption, and then it explodes into a melodic and moving guitar solo that releases the considerable tension. It's a big moment on an album that has so many they're almost hard to pick out, and it also happens to contain some of Owens' most straightforward writing: ""You'll have to forgive me brother/ You'll have to forgive me sister/ And I'll have to forgive you if we're ever going to move on/ No one's going to find any answers/ If you're looking in the dark/ And looking for a reason to give up."" He's right, but while there's nothing remotely new here, somehow the way Owens sings these words makes it feel like we're hearing them for the first time too.</p></div>"|15811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15811-father-son-holy-ghost/|9.3|Mark Richardson

The word has come to mean a specific style-- glowing electronic pop that calls to mind faded photographs. But what initially drew comparisons between such groups as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27948-memory-tapes/"" target=""_blank"">Memory Tapes</a> wasn't such an easily identifiable set of musical signifiers. As with most category names that stick, chillwave was a <i>feeling</i>.</p>
<p>There's no better example of the genre's catholic origins than <a href=""http://toroymoi.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a> mastermind Chaz Bundick. Last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/"" target=""_blank"">Causers of This</a></i> established Toro Y Moi as one of the mini-scene's leading figures, with the post-crash economic reality of lead single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11375-blessa/"" target=""_blank"">Blessa</a>"" (""I found a job, I do it fine/ Not what I want, but still I try"") aligning the album with Neon Indian's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11394-deadbeat-summer/"" target=""_blank"">Deadbeat Summer</a>"" and Washed Out's <i>High Times</i>-- and Bundick's full-length debut had a warmly nostalgic electro-R&amp;B aesthetic, to boot. But by then he had already released 2009's <i>Body Angles</i> tape, which, yeah, presaged <i>Causers</i> with synthy closer ""Timed Pleasure"", but mostly emphasized scuzzy guitars. And Bundick has said he actually recorded this year's garage-pop ""Leave Everywhere"" single in 2006. In the meantime, he's given us straight-up dance (his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29197-les-sins/"" target=""_blank"">Les Sins</a> project) and an album that expands on the atmospheric funk of <i>Causers</i> using a lusher, more organic instrumental palette (this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/"" target=""_blank"">Underneath the Pine</a></i>).</p>
<p>The definition of chillwave may have to expand yet again. Memory Tapes' solid if disappointing follow-up to 2009's zeitgeist-capturing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13451-seek-magic/"" target=""_blank"">Seek Magic</a></i> had more in common than with the sound of this Internet-born subset, but Bundick, along with Neon Indian and Washed Out, continues to embody its spirit, which was always more body-oriented than detractors would care to admit. With the <i>Freaking Out</i> EP, Bundick moves from vaguely funky 1980s-tinged makeout jams to more explicitly funky 80s-tinged dancefloor jams-- think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>. The change isn't as successful as his best work, but it still makes for a plenty rewarding between-albums EP.</p>
<p>Advance mp3 ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43164-toro-y-moi-is-ifreaking-outi-on-new-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Saturday Love</a>""-- a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuNBJC-lDL8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of a 1985 Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production for R&amp;B singers Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal-- is the highlight here, with its sweetly catchy days-of-the-week hook, tinkling two-finger piano, and thwacking neo-new jack swing drum programming. Yearning, bass-limber opener ""All Alone"" and finger-snapping dance finale ""I Can Get Love"" even share the strobe-like keyboards present on much of <i>Causers</i>-- the last song has that post-Dilla crackle, too. And ""Sweet"" applies the chopped up vocals and hazy incandescence of that album to further 80s-style R&amp;B. ""Take it easy,"" Bundick soothes on the title track, another uptempo floor-filler. ""Don't worry anymore... Calm down."" I mean, how much more chillwave can you get, right?</p></div>"|15785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15785-freaking-out-ep/|8.0|Marc Hogan

The Sacramento-bred spazz-rock duo's done the OutKast split-solo album thing (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11757-church-gone-wildchirpin-hard/"" target=""_blank""><i>Church Gone Wild</i>/<i>Chirpin' Hard</i></a>), given its songs the coffee-shop open-mike treatment (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9403-acoustics/"" target=""_blank"">Acoustics</a></i>), and revamped itself into a five-piece supergroup (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9828-theres-no-666-in-outer-space/"" target=""_blank"">There's No 666 In Outer Space</a></i>). Yet through all of these rearrangements and reinventions, the band has rarely deviated from its staple schtick: shreddy guitars, frenetic drumming, and hooks scavenged from the Power Glove era of Nintendo gaming. Sometimes it was hard to tell if they were dedicated to a singular vision or stuck within one.</p>
<p>Following a four-year hiatus, <i>Tripper</i> finds Hella back to their original two-piece incarnation, with founding members Spencer Seim and Zach Hill on guitar and drums. It's business as usual: spastic pounding, warp-speed scalar runs, and various math-rock feats of strength. <i>Tripper </i> is a more focused effort, but only in comparison to the wanton schizophrenia of other Hella records. On ""Long Hair"" Seim gets more melody out of fewer notes, sticking to single riffs for longer stretches of time. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16177-yubacore/"" target=""_blank"">Yubacore</a>"" Hill plays with dynamics, interrupting his constant stream of abstract fills with a few simple, spacious grooves. Hella are never relaxed, but they no longer sound like they're sprinting to get to the end of the record.</p>
<p>For all of the sweaty battering and calculated sloppiness, Hella's music always retained an inorganic feel. They make high volume but emotionally distant music. The band's main muse, in spirit if not in sound, is Devo. That hasn't changed on <i>Tripper</i>. Hella's peers-- art-school shredders like Mick Barr (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3220-orthrelm/"" target=""_blank"">Orthrelm</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>-- found their inspiration in hardcore punk and more extreme strains of metal. Though their playing is repetitive and mechanical, it's framed as a quasi-spiritual pursuit and, in Lighting Bolt's case, done in the hopes of producing a sweaty moshpit meltdown. Hella's intent is more arch. The song titles-- ""Kid Life Crisis"", ""Psycho Bro""-- are meaningless goofs. The music's unpredictable and schizophrenic architecture subverts earnest headbanging. On <i>Tripper</i>, Hella's instrumental chops are better than ever, but riffs aside, there's not much to think about.</p></div>"|15806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15806-hella-tripper/|6.0|Aaron Leitko

David Geffen clearly didn't swell his already sizable bank balance by reissuing the band's second album <i>Odyshape</i>, as it quickly became as hard to find as the original 1981 Rough Trade version. It must be frustrating for the group to have their music fading in and out of time like this-- the preceding <i>The Raincoats</i> and the following <i>Moving</i> have been treated in the same manner-- but it helped cultivate a mystique around <i>Odyshape</i>. That feeling is partially shaped by the distinctly un-rock approach, with the core trio of the band (Ana Da Silva, Gina Birch, and Vicky Aspinall) occasionally utilizing African instruments including a balophone and a kalimba to get the job done.</p>
<p>A big part of <i>Odyshape</i>'s charm is derived from its backwards construction, with the band leaning away from the spikiness that made <i>The Raincoats</i> such an inviting listen, and writing many of the songs without percussion. The tribal drumming of original member Palmolive was forcibly removed from the mix-- she quit the band by the time of this record, causing percussion to be added after the fact by a variety of guest players including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"">This Heat</a>'s Charles Hayward. Coloring in the songs in that manner might sound like the band were shoving a square peg in a round hole, but it undoubtedly contributed to the uniquely disorienting air that <i>Odyshape</i> thrives on. It's from a place where the Raincoats' best ideas stem-- throwing orthodoxy out of the window, playing on instruments with which they weren't familiar, assembling all the parts back to front because the standard way of doing things held little or no interest.</p>
<p>As such, it fits into that basic post-punk tenet of rejecting everything that came before to test out new ways of doing things. This album has little in common with anything else around at the time, other than the feeling that you're hurtling relentlessly forward into a previously unmapped musical space. There may be a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti</a>-esque hue to the guitar scratch on the pushy ""Only Loves at Night"", but much of <i>Odyshape</i> is positioned in a peculiar place somewhere between the earth and the sky. Sometimes a discordant violin howl is pitted against dreamy vocal pining (""Dancing in My Head""), at others the relationship is reversed and the singing takes on an earthy tone while the instrumentation is positively otherworldly (""Shouting Out Loud""). Occasionally those two impulses are conjoined, such as on the title track, where Birch delves into body dysmorphia over stop-start rhythms that feel like two different songs colliding.</p>
<p>That schizoid shift can partly be explained by all the instrument swapping going on in the band, but it's also an escape and an embrace of the circumstances in which the band found themselves. Holed up in a squat in London, which Birch admitted (in Simon Reynolds' <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rip-Up-Start-Again-1978-1984/dp/0143036726"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rip It Up and Start Again</a></i>) had mushrooms growing out of the toilet wall, they found a release in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a> albums, and the transformative tones of the unconventional instruments that ended up being scattered all over this record. England wasn't a peaceful place during 1981; riots prevailed, the economy was in dire shape, and the rise of Thatcherism gained a stranglehold on the country. Fast-forward 30 years later and <i>Odyshape</i> is being released again, in much the same climate, acting like an acute reflection of all that hurt and the contrasting desire to block it out for a while.</p>
<p>That divide between the oblique and the real is what separates <i>Odyshape</i> from the ideas the Raincoats' post-punk peers were pushing toward, many of whom went one way or the other but rarely met in the middle. It's a very intimate recording, full of sounds they wisely never tried to recreate again, and vocal takes that are often inflected with a heart-crushing vulnerability. There's no easy category for this record to slip into; sure, you can sometimes hear hints of reggae, and at times there's a folky tinge to a few of the songs. The latter is particularly unusual in the post-punk scene, but makes sense here when you consider how these tracks were initially conceived, and the fact that Robert Wyatt (also a keen jazz fan and with a distinctly English folk-iness all of his own) was drafted in as a collaborator. It's telling that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Kim Gordon</a> was brought in to provide sleeve notes but doesn't say a single word about the album, and no demos, outtakes, or other ephemera are included. Despite living in an era where almost all music is available on tap, <i>Odyshape</i> still feels like a self-contained secret floating out there waiting to be uncovered.</p></div>"|15802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15802-odyshape/|8.0|Nick Neyland

Though I'm sure the word ""joycore"" was often stammered in justification, it actually made a lot of sense: There was an unmistakable DIY spirit to the band's earliest material. Husband-and-wife duo Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner's voices joined in imperfect, occasionally overripe harmony, and their songs were patchwork pieces with seams proudly showing (""We attach parts together until they make a whole song,"" they once confessed)-- all of which added to their debut record's unique and infectious charm. Unlike much of the impersonal, digitized pop that was emanating from the radio waves or your little sister's primitive, brick-sized mp3 player at the time, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5147-my-solo-project/"" target=""_blank"">My Solo Project</a></i> was pop music that felt transparently and exhilaratingly human.</p>
<p>A decade later, certain core facts remain: Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel are still happily married, they are still an organ-and-drums two-piece, and you'd still convulse in a fit of sugar shakes if you found a way to bite into one of their songs. But a funny thing happened somewhere between 2003's rollicking <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5145-team-boo/"" target=""_blank"">Team Boo</a></i> and the AM-gold glimmer of 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5148-bring-it-back/"" target=""_blank"">Bring It Back</a></i>: Gardner and Hammel became pretty great pop songwriters. Their harmonies got more technically sound, their songs moved more fluidly-- basically, the seams don't show anymore. <i>Bring It Back</i> proved that this wasn't necessarily a development for the worse. But the band's last effort, 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11499-re-arrange-us/"" target=""_blank"">Re-Arrange Us</a></i>, was a misstep, not just for the much-cited reason that Gardner traded in her electric organ for a bland-sounding piano, but because the record's overall energy was inert. And if the damn Mates of State can't muster the energy to sound enthusiastic about anything, heaven help the rest of us.</p>
<p><i>Mountaintops</i> brings on an immediate sigh of relief: Its opening minutes are not just a return to form, but one of the most zinging 1-2 punches in the band's catalogue to date. ""Palomino"" is celestial pop with a chorus as big as the sky, and the warped synth groove of ""Maracas"" is irresistibly catchy. Suffice to say that if you don't get ""Maracas"", you don't really get this band, because it manages to cram almost every single reason the Mates are such a perennially charming guilty pleasure into a single song: holler-along lyrics that don't make a lick of sense (""Wooo-oooh/ Syncopated breathing!""), posi-energy to burn, and even a totally gratuitous Queen Latifah reference for good measure (""I've got your back/ U-N-I-T-Y!""). But if you can see past its feel-good vibe, ""Maracas"" also hints at the record's overall thematic maturity.</p>
<p>Some more core facts about the Mates of State: Gardner and Hammel quit their day jobs 10 years ago (teacher and a medical researcher, respectively), they have spent the past decade in the record-tour-record state of eternal return, and they have been raising two children all the while. <i>Mountaintops</i> is the first of their records to grapple with the everyday tribulations and banality of spending your entire adult life in a band-- with your Mate, nonetheless. ""Basement Money"" is a surprisingly honest exploration of something few indie bands are brave enough to sing about: the necessity of making money off your art. ""At Least I Have You"" pulls the veil back even further. It's a song not just about feeling disconnected from old friends and familiar places, but the realization that the music you've devoted your life to playing is the only thing that can bring you release.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the Mates' cheerful music as a testament to how completely and adorably in love they are, but <i>Mountaintops</i> intrepidly explores themes of isolation, codependence, and the things lost from operating for years with-- to quote ""Basement Money""-- ""a doublemind."" The chords that play out final track ""Mistakes"" are bittersweet, and there's something unsettling about the lingering last words of its refrain: ""I need you/ But it's not normal if I refuse to be by myself.""</p>
<p><i>Mountaintops</i> is not without valleys: the breathy balladry of ""Unless I'm Led"" is a bit too maudlin even for the Mates, and the Motown-meets-glee-club sugar rush of ""Total Serendipity"" is divisive at best. But overall, <i>Mountaintops</i> finds the Mates taking the more nuanced emotional tenor of <i>Re-Arrange Us</i> and splaying it across the mural-sized pop canvases we've come to expect from them. Impervious to trends and refreshingly uncool, Mates of State have managed to progress and mature within the confines of their own self-made niche. All of which is pretty punk, when you get right down to it.</p></div>"|15787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15787-mates-of-state-mountaintops/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

He released two of the period's finest long players (<i>Alcachofa </i>and the still underrated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8507-the-au-harem-darchimede/"" target=""_blank"">Thè au Harem d'Archiméde</a></i>) but also established himself as an in-demand festival-packing DJ. Unlike his incredible run between 2004 and 2006 (when Ricardomania was so obvious that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9105-salvador/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Sherburne made note of it</a>, mid-review), his releases these days are thin on the ground, limited to a single here, a remix there. His work has grown more historical as it's grown scarcer. It's not his own history he's concerned with, but the varying strands of musical DNA comprising his ropey, winking techno. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FMl8QlB19w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Enfants (Chants)</a>"" featured communal chanting, while this year's excellent <i>Joli Chat EP</i> was conversational and punchdrunk. His last ""album"" was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10688-fabric-36/"" target=""_blank"">a pre-mixed LP of his own productions</a>. He's collaborating more. It's as if, having found his perfect beat, he's seeking its perfect context.</p>
<p><i>Re: ECM</i> sees Villalobos reach out to longtime experimentalist Max Loderbauer (who has a host of credits to his name; recently and notably he has played in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29566-moritz-von-oswald-trio/"" target=""_blank"">Moritz Von Oswald Trio</a>). At issue is the varied output of fabled Munich jazz/out music label ECM (Edition of Contemporary Music). The two artists were given full access to ECM's vast catalog, and label founder Manfred Eicher oversaw the mastering process. The ""Re:"" (""regarding"") in the work's title is important: These are not remixes but rather compositions that suggest and converse with ECM's history. Villalobos and Loderbauer make no attempt to tie the works to beat-driven techno. The catalog is a quarry of sounds from which the duo extract loops and beats that range from ornament to animal.</p>
<p>It's not necessary to be intimately familiar with ECM's catalog to enjoy <i>Re: ECM</i> (your reviewer is not); suffice to say that the label has housed most permutations of jazz and improvisational music since its inception in the late 1960s. Jazz and electronic music make natural partners; it's a pairing that many have explored previously, from Moodymann's dusty Black Mahogani releases to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1548-kieran-hebden/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet's work with drummer Steve Reid</a>. Both styles fascinate themselves with sustained textures and place a premium on sublimating the artist to the form (both also lack rock music's obscene physicality, which has allowed jazz musicians and electronic producers to stay creative late into their careers).</p>
<p>Villalobos and Loderbauer don't seem interested in jazz's harmonic infrastructure so much as the vast array of tones used to produce it. Hissing hi-hats, voluminous stand-up bass, and damp woodwinds are placed decoratively next to one another. If I'm feeling cynical I start to think of <i>Re: ECM</i> as aural feng shui, its 2xCD, two-hour structure better suited for inattentive mood-setting than true exploration. But there's nothing easy or simple here; the artists' restraint provides plenty of airy space, but between that air are sounds that are almost uniformly rich and complex. It feels minimal but unbalanced. If <i>Re: ECM</i> were to soundtrack a dinner party, it would have to be of the newfangled, slightly sadistic variety in which the chefs have lots of tattoos and serve mostly foie gras and bone marrow.</p>
<p><i>Re: ECM</i> stands out not just for its depth but for its variety, for the sheer number of musics it incorporates. Jazz is the primary focus-- it has been for the label-- but the duo also touches on tribal blues (""Reannounce""), choral (""Rekondakion""), Eastern drone (""Requote""), and lounge (""Recat""). If Villalobos has ported over one element from his techno work, it's an uncanny ability to fashion rhythms that are both crisp and deep; the sounds here will buzz and twitch with his unmistakable style, but they'll do so less predictably.</p>
<p>Applaud ECM for letting Villalobos and Loderbauer run amok; this album is a symptom of a process that has allowed ECM to remain relevant since its inception. For Villalobos, it's another tie, however oblique, to the musics that birthed his style. As a new generation of electronic producers-- notably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a>-- takes cues from his seminal works, Villalobos continues to reach backward. If he makes the past seem half as thrilling and rewarding as he once made the future seem, the next generation won't be the only one that owes him a debt.</p></div>"|15797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15797-re-ecm/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

It's easy to see why the group would be proud of such lustrous descendants, but it actually sells them short. What's interesting about Art of Noise-- certainly the first phase of their project, which culminated in this debut album-- isn't so much their children but their parents. This was a pop band named after a <a href=""http://120years.net/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1913 art manifesto</a>, deliberately aspiring to inherit the explosion of early 20th century conceptual creativity and make Futurists and Dadaists rub shoulders with b-boys and clubbers. The group's own arch-conceptualist, music writer Paul Morley, apparently planned an album that would be a grand collage of the century's sounds-- what he actually got was an acrimonious split.</p>
<p>Morley may, in his words, have only ""made the tea"" in Art of Noise, but he dominates the visual half of this reissue: introducing videos, reading out essays onstage, continually playing the ideas man and provocateur even if his incessant wordplay's an acquired taste. The group's videos are proof that this apparent pretension came with a smart payoff. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCyGdk23KNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beat Box</a>"" is recast as the soundtrack to a city with lively, evocative footage of 1980s London cut to its rhythm. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcmIhOesaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moments in Love</a>"" mixes dancers and tortoises, grace and absurdity. And most famously ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFK0-lcjGU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Close (to the Edit)</a>"", the dream-logic realization of the group's ideals, with a creepy punker kid commanding anonymous wreckers as they smash cellos and pianos to pieces.</p>
<p>""Close (to the Edit)"" reminds you that Art of Noise were trying to be funny and sometimes scary-- neither of them standard pop ambitions in 1984 or now. In fact, what's striking about this album is the range of moods and effects it musters, while remaining an intensely playful record. It follows the savage, martial arrangement of Cold War bricolage ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8k4yMOGrUE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Time for Fear (Who's Afraid)</a>"" with a teasing version of ""Beat Box"" where the track's purposeful electro keeps getting diverted by shiny new sounds. On the title track, a snooty voice asks, ""Can I say something?"" and the music refuses to let it even say that, gleefully slashing the sample to ribbons. The album flirts with annoyance and even boredom-- the way the stately, repetitive beauty of ""Moments in Love"" lulls you before unwinding itself into stranger places. But they could also be thrilling. Their immediate context was hip-hop, but their kind of funk-- best experienced on ""Close (to the Edit)""-- has a brash rigor to it, calling to mind tireless pistons and marching feet.</p>
<p>""This limited circle of pure sounds must be broken,"" Luigi Russolo wrote in the manifesto that inspired the band, ""and the infinite variety of noise-sound conquered."" But the technological limits to sampling in 1984 meant that Art of Noise were stuck with a very finite variety of noise-sound, constantly worrying at and reusing snippets of samples. The only problem with the many reissues of early Art of Noise is the group's endless recycling of its two key tracks. ""Beat Box""-- of which ""Close (to the Edit)"" is a cousin-- and ""Moments in Love"" were on their first EP, then issued as separate singles, appeared on every compilation, dominated this debut album, and now appear-- counting the DVD-- six times each on this reissue.</p>
<p>For diehard fans, the incessant tinkering is part of the fun-- for listeners less caught up in the band's process, it's easy to get a little weary with the radio sessions and alternate video edits collected here. Stick with the core album and videos, though, and you realize the reason Art of Noise kept returning to these songs: Both are superb, anchoring a record that's as sly, stirring, and occasionally infuriating now as it was on release.</p></div>"|15800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15800-whos-afraid-of-the-art-of-noise-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Tom Ewing

From there, it traveled to L.A.-- nearly 3,000 miles west of the attacks it commemorated-- before touching down in Carnegie Hall a month later. It was an oddly circuitous cross-country tiptoe for a work by a native New Yorker about the collapse of the towers he lived four blocks from, but it spoke to the fearsome difficulty in addressing 9/11 headlong. There is still, 10 years later, an instinctive flinch mechanism built into our communal central nervous system surrounding the  day, and it presents a forbidding hurdle for artists attempting to speak to it.</p>
<p>Reich, as unofficial American composer laureate and a quintessentially New York City figure, would seem more outwardly qualified than most, which only makes his failure all the more disheartening. <i>WTC 9/11 </i> takes the same form as Reich's <i>Different  Trains</i>, another piece that treated an atrocity-- in that  instance, the trains transporting Jews to concentration camps-- with a sorrowful Zen gaze. Like <i>Trains</i>, <i>WTC</i> pairs <a href=""http://www.kronosquartet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Kronos Quartet</a> with manipulated recorded voices, the strings accompanying the recordings to draw out the anxious unheard music in their intonation and rhythm. It's a spectacular compositional technique, bridging the invisible gap where words become music.</p>
<p>Within minutes, however, <i>WTC 9/11</i> rams up against an unavoidable problem: These raw materials are, well, simply too raw. The voices Reich highlights in his music are a mix emergency dispatches from 9/11 and interviews conducted in 2010 with his close friends. Much of what they say is nearly unbearable to hear, even a decade on. If there is a way to subsume a 9/11 survivor saying, ""Three thousand people were murdered. What's gonna happen here next?"" into a larger musical work, Reich didn't find it. The words burn through the music's fabric  like tissue paper, leaving you jarred but neither enlightened nor transformed.</p>
<p>The smaller moments in the piece, painting the texture of daily life on the morning of the attacks, ring true with tension and foreboding. The conversational, lilting swing of ""I was sitting in class. Four blocks north of Ground Zero"", for instance. A sobbing cello catches the falling note of plaint in the phrase ""Nobody knew what to do."" At the intonation of ""We all thought it was an accident"" (spoken by Reich’s  friend and colleague, Bang on a Can co-founder David Lang), the strings allow a brief glint of a major key to peak in, a moment of fugitive hope. Unfortunately, the moments that freeze you in place -- lines like ""debris engulfed everybody that was there,"" or a desperate shout of ""I'm trapped in the rubble""-- owe nothing at all to Reich's music; indeed, they all but erase your awareness of the music around them.</p>
<p>The Nonesuch recording of <i>WTC 9/11</i> is rounded out by other recent-vintage Reich pieces, and to spend time in their company  after the heightened, jagged <i>WTC</i> is a relief. His 2009 <i>Mallet Quartet</i> is a delicate and ringing interlocking of  marimbas that feels as cleansing as spring rain, while <i>Dance Patterns</i>, for a battery of vibraphones, xylophones, and pianos, plays like a glistening, fond medley of Reichisms. The framework of Reich's pieces feels well-worn by now-- his ""fast-slow-fast"" structure now has a ""loud-quiet-loud,"" ""verse-chorus-verse"" inevitability to it. The shifts in key midway through movements feel less like the blooming of an  unexpected thought now than slides in a ViewMaster clicking duly into  place. You smile and nod knowingly, but the goosebumps are gone.</p>
<p>These  low-key joys are reminiscent of latter-day Neil Young or Sonic Youth albums-- a master operating comfortably within his groove. They are modest, but they feel honest in their serene confidence. <i>WTC 9/11</i>, on the other hand, feels marred by miscalculation and overcompensation. This uneasiness found public expression when Nonesuch revealed the album's original cover art: a photo of the smoldering Towers, with the second plane zeroing in. The stark image was surrounded by a woefully cheap-looking graphical treatment, and prompted an immediate outcry. Nonesuch swiftly replaced the image, but the  episode made its impression. Unfortunately, it could stand in as a  diagnosis for the piece itself, a project conceived in noble intentions but hobbled by confused, muddled execution.</p></div>"|15796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15796-steve-reich-and-kronos-quartet-wtc-911/|7.0|Jayson Greene

That's 12 extra songs! All at the same low price! There is one catch: The Whatever Brains that's on those singles isn't the band you'll find on their eponymous full-length.</p>
<p>On the pre-album tracks, the band makes like they're randomly flipping through an indie-rock album guide, creating two-to-three-minute ruckuses that bring other groups to mind while never actually sounding like one particular precedent. Singer Rich Ivey, at times, evokes a very excitable (and young) Mac McCaughan, and there's a certain what-the-hell slapdash vibe that'll inspire folks to pair ""Pavement"" with the word ""slacker."" But pinning Whatever Brains down with a catch-all reference doesn't do them justice. And, anyway, that sort of stylistic hopscotch was merely a warm-up for the stunts they pull on their debut full-length.</p>
<p>The group doesn't go off in an entirely different direction, or even take an odd detour; they simply use a much bigger map. It's a fitting move for a band that paid homage to an equally iconoclastic group, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">Minutemen</a>, in the title of one of their early tracks, ""What Makes a Man Make 'What Makes a Man Start Fires?'"" The most noticeable, and potentially offputting addition to the arsenal is the synthesizer. It shows up on the album's first track, ""The Fisher"", and makes itself at home across most of the album. For folks hoping the group continued on their merry guitar/bass/drum way, this new member of the family might be unwelcome. But Whatever Brains prove to be adept at fitting it into their music, and tailoring their sound to make it work.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the shaggy, lo-fi vibe of their singles is replaced with a sharper, more precise sound, turning fuzz-covered tunes like ""Blues Lawyer"" and ""The Future of Porn"" into do-it-kinda-clean tracks that'd be right at home on records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/234-a-frames/"" target=""_blank"">A-Frames</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5746-cheveu/"" target=""_blank"">Cheveu</a>. If there's any genuflecting being done in the name of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>, it's solely in the direction of <i>Westing (By Musket or Sextant)</i>. By the sounds of ""Cousteau on a Crutch"", they might (as Pavement once did) also owe a tithing to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4016-swell-maps/"" target=""_blank"">Swell Maps</a>.  But then you listen to ""Bedsores"", and there's a chance Great Plains and Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments frontman Ron House is their personal Jesus. Whatever way the group prays, it's clear Whatever Brains practice the sort of all-inclusive musical polytheism that's all too rare in the world of indie rock.</p></div>"|15789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15789-whatever-brains-whatever-brains/|7.4|David Raposa

Instead, the ranks were populated by guys like Peter Gabriel, George Michael, and Hall &amp; Oates, who sang forcefully and made bold pop hits with intelligent, grown-up themes. Artists who also had broad sonic appetites and arty predilections, guaranteeing their work would sometimes frustrate, but would remain intriguing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On his last solo album, 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9896-like-drawing-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>Like Drawing Blood</i></a>, Gotye achieved the abstraction and restlessness of good art-pop, but failed to bring enough actual pop to the equation. The album was an inspired, dense blend of globe-spanning sounds, yet it meandered far too frequently. Many of the songs stretched between five and seven minutes long, and found him stitching together multiple sounds and ideas at the detriment of shape or focus, eschewing pop's vital sense of urgency. Fortunately, with his newest release, <i>Making Mirrors</i>, Gotye has figured out how to remain sonically voracious while still giving his listeners a sturdy foothold. He finds room here for psych-rock, soul, earnest balladeering, creepy retro-futurism, electronic and Tropicalia touches, and, yes, scads of serious-minded 1980s pop. It's in that last category that most of album's best moments reside. Without ever settling in one spot too slavishly or lengthily to come off like a mere imitator, Gotye deploys his sincere, powerfully expressive voice (under-utilized on <i>Like Drawing Blood</i>) in evoking those bombastic 80s pop architects referenced above. ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"" dramatically convey the acrimony and finality of a shattered relationship, while ""In Your Light"" and ""Save Me"" offer up the redemptive side of the coin.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">These declamatory studio-pop moves don't just represent many of <i>Making Mirrors</i>' highlights; their shared style and tone also really helps hold the album together, compensating for Gotye's scattershot attention span elsewhere. Admittedly, some of these one-offs are very good – the Cee-Lo/Jamie Lidell-approved retro-soul of ""I Feel Better"" is the kind of thing that actually works far better as an isolated detour than an organizing principle. The same is true for the guileless ""Giving Me a Chance"" (which somehow manages to favorably evoke Travis) and the ""Drive My Car""-styled acid-rock blast ""Easy Way Out"". Only occasionally does Gotye wander too far off the reservation, but by that point he's earned his quirks, and so the bizarrely pitch-shifted, suburbia-tech nightmare ""State of the Art"" and eerily whispered, Reznor-ish ""Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You"" feel more like an endearingly loopy sidebars than self-indulgent, momentum-derailing bores. Gotye's exemplary pop sense may be the big revelation of <i>Making Mirrors</i>, yet it's his arty restlessness that will continue to keep him interesting.</p></div>"|15749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15749-making-mirrors/|7.7|Joshua Love

Nash (aka The-Dream) released it for free on his website on August 31, with the begrudged blessing of his bosses at Def Jam. It's his fourth solo album, but his first released in this manner, and it raises the question of whether or not we are supposed to alter our expectations. Is this a tossed-off re-packaging of demos? Is he merely trying to satiate a fanbase waiting for an album that he promised to drop this past June? We don't know the answers to those questions (although my guesses would be ""no"" and ""maybe""), but it would seem foolish to hold <i>1977</i> to a lower standard. It's no longer unusual-- especially in the world of rap, and to a lesser extent R&amp;B-- to put a full album on the Internet for free. If Nash had included a way for fans to pay what they wanted for the album, he would've been adopting a strategy utilized in previous years by Radiohead and Girl Talk.</p>
<p>And yet, Nash <i>is</i> asking us to adjust our expectations. Crucially though, he's not asking that we alter our notions of what we expect of him, just what we expect from him. <i>1977</i> represents not a conscious change in quality, but a conscious change in style and sound, at least for the time being. A few days before he released the album, he <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/MrTeriusNash/status/107915451056660480"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, ""When I'm 40 ill write Myself a Pop Smash just so I can Perform on National TV. Not that hard to do. But that's not who I am right now."" True to his word, <i>1977</i> often strays far from Nash's few solo pop smashes. Instead, it is a deeply personal and presumably therapeutic album. It's one that he fought with his label to release, that he's putting out under his birth name and titled for his birth year, and for which he has put the lyrics of every song up on his website. Though he was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43886-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">predictably coy</a> about the subject, the specter of his divorce from singer Christina Milian looms over it.</p>
<p>In its sparseness and unrelenting directness, the album's most recent precedent is Kanye West's break up opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank"">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i>, and much like that record, it's already proven to be a divisive if misunderstood album. It showcases a bitter and angry Nash, and though he has previously dabbled in acidic and unflinching break-up songs, <i>1977</i> is his first album to largely focus on something other than his sexual prowess. Like West, his vitriol is mostly spewed outward, with seemingly little regard for the feelings or reputation of whoever is on the other side. There is Spanish guitar, as if Nash imagines himself readying for a duel. There is acoustic guitar, as if to accentuate his confessionals. And there is guitar feedback, as if his heart were screaming out.</p>
<p>As a portrayal of a broken relationship, <i>1977</i> at its best is as vivid as it is one-sided. ""Wake Me When It's Over"", which effectively utilizes the glacial R&amp;B of Drake and his producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, opens the album with a wrenching portrait of a romance falling apart in plain view of friends and the public. As Nash coos the chorus we find him frozen in amber, unable to shake a break up for which he claims he would've taken bullets. Even tracks like ""Rolex"" and ""Wish You Were Mine"", which don't hew as close to the theme as others, have a spitefulness that hint at an intense desire to throw your recovery in your ex's face.</p>
<p>But of course, writing songs from this point of view presents some problems. Mainly, one has to be able to stomach the one-sided bile and Nash's likely half-truths. To that end, <i>1977</i>, like West's <i>808s</i>, functions best as a look inside the mind of a man wrecked by a trying relationship and a worse break up. His failings should not be excused, but the feelings exist, and have likely existed inside most of us at some point (regardless of gender), and to that end, they're understandable even if they're not completely acceptable.</p>
<p>There are also essential moments on the album where Nash perhaps unwittingly reveals the more aggressively resentful songs to be a sort of Pyrrhic victory. One is on ""Form of Flattery"", where he addresses the ex he hates and seethes, ""I'm not better than that."" Another is ""Wedding Crasher"", the absolute standout here, wherein Nash shows up at his ex's wedding and admits, once and for all, that his attempts to replace her have been futile. Sonically, it recalls the buoyant lightness of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14449-love-king/"" target=""_blank"">Love King</a></i>'s ""Florida University"", though it's less cloying, and this time he's basically saying, ""fuck you"" back at himself.</p>
<p>All that said, Nash still misses a huge opportunity. One of the legitimate criticisms of <i>808s</i> was that West's ex had no forum to respond to the album. While it's obviously impossible to expect Nash to cede space on <i>1977</i> to Milian (or whomever), there is a critical difference between himself and West. Nash is a songwriter by trade who made his name writing from the perspective of people (mostly women) other than himself, including what may be <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY&amp;ob=av3e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the biggest female empowerment single of the past decade</a>. When Nash does give the floor completely to a female voice, it's for the relatively unknown Casha to sing a cover of Deniece Williams' 1981 hit ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcPiip-xkyw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Silly</a>"". As a tune, the song itself is fine, but framed by Nash's wrath it sadly comes off as pleading and passive. How great would it have been for Nash to use that spot on the album to turn the pen on himself, if only for one song?</p>
<p>Still, <i>1977</i> itself is a success, even if it doesn't stand up completely to his three previous releases. As a standalone depiction of a deteriorating relationship and miserable break up, it's engrossing and, even to a fault, extremely honest. As a piece of music, it eschews the richness and lushness of those albums, a sound that's felt on the verge of becoming stale. <i>1977</i> could be called a palate cleanser, but it's way too torn-up to be that. It's more like a shot (or three) of whisky. Sometimes that feels like exactly what you need.</p></div>"|15792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15792-1977/|7.9|Jordan Sargent

From associated instruments to target demographics, several factors unite those niches, not least of which is the propensity to indulge a sound, solo, or song for minutes on end. As it is with High on Fire, so it is with Hawkwind, and as it is with Earth, so it is with Eyehategod: When a band latches onto something it loves, be prepared to go the distance.</p>
<p>YOB, it seems, is no different: ""The Great Cessation"", the title track of the trio's previous album, was a colossal 21-minute closer that took its time snaking through several obsessions, from the twinkling introduction and a throbbing mid-tempo midsection to a monolithic coda that felt like a great, malevolent sigh. Similarly, ""Adrift in the Ocean"" ends the band's latest LP <i>Atma</i> with a magnificent 16-minute rise: Middle Eastern-influenced guitars tessellate over teased cymbals until the full trio of Scheidt, drummer Travis Foster, and bassist Aaron Reiseberg lurches forward, rising and collapsing in thick, deliberate bursts for about eight minutes. Like its predecessor, <i>Atma</i> closes in a glorious burnout, Scheidt's post-rock-sized guitar solo ultimately smearing into a drone over a mangled drum limp.</p>
<p>One of YOB's chief accomplishments here and throughout much of its discography has been its sterling ability to maintain a sense of momentum, whether the track ends after five minutes or pushes into the teens. The shortest of <i>Atma</i>'s five tunes, ""Upon the Sight of the Other Shore"", nears the eight-minute mark thanks to several Geezer Butler-gone-Godflesh verses and a handful of guitar solos. Its sense of constant movement, though, isn't unlike that of the preceding ""Before We Dreamed of Two"", the album's 16-minute, three-part marathon: In spite of languid riffs and an occasional absence of drums, ""Dreamed"" never sits anywhere for too long and, more important, never bores.</p>
<p>In several Eastern religions, <i>atma</i> means a more complete aware version of the self. Scheidt uses that word during the refrain (or mantra, maybe?) of ""Dreamed"", singing ""Self reaching outward/ Toward within"" at the apogee of the riff’s power. The bulk of <i>Atma</i> seems to be about some human realization that's more meaningful than the mundane, where change and finality and death and loss actually work toward something important. ""Burning within from what must be/ The desire of the one to be witnessed,"" he howls as if caught in mid-strangulation at the end of the title track, a menacing swirl of drums and distortion at his back. You can hear those ideas throughout <i>Atma</i>, a record that never takes the space it's been given for granted. Each passing second feels like a chance for a new thought, a happy diversion. That's not what you expect from the stasis and slow shifts of doom metal or anything with which YOB is generally associated. It's exactly what makes every bit of <i>Atma</i> so very powerful.</p>
<p>If you were a novice forming a metal band in 2011, YOB's psychedelic heaviness might not be a bad place to start. It can, after all, be played at length with a basic riff, a drummer with some stamina and heavy hands, and a bassist that can find the roots of chords. It doesn’t require the speed of black metal, the equipment of drone, or the skill of death and technical metal. You don't even need an especially great singer: Scheidt is more communicative and versatile than dominating. What's more, it's a sound that's proven ripe for crossover into both indie rock and mainstream rock circles during the last decade. So why not? Indeed, there's a glut of bands currently mining post-Sabbath, after-Sleep stoner metal, playing lean, distorted riffs over clattering china. In that crowded lot, YOB should serve as a reminder that, even in more common forms, there are simply those who do it better-- through more experience, better conceits or, as is the case with <i>Atma</i>, a compelling mix of both. Scheidt's guitar tone is unimpeachable here, and he uses it as an unwavering guide for the trio: His riffs control the pushes and the pulls, the rises and the falls, the stops and the starts. And with YOB, a doom-stoner-sludge-psych band with too much thrust to fit into any of those holes for very long, that's the deciding, divining factor.</p></div>"|15724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15724-atma/|8.3|Grayson Currin

Even when they use humor and irony, the material shades dark. <i>Winter Family</i> had a track called ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WtYvgesHAU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Auschwitz</a>"" that found singer Ruth Rosenthal describing, in a sing-song little-girl's voice, a magical snowglobe containing a tiny replica of the concentration camp, complete with starving prisoners and an iron gate saying that work is the key to liberation. The duo's songs typically combine her exceedingly strong, deep, yet wounded voice with Xavier Klaine's keyboards, which veer from the heavy drone of the harmonium to impossibly delicate piano chords. She is originally from Israel, and Klaine is from Paris, though both are now based in Brooklyn; she sometimes sings but often speaks her lyrics, mostly in English but sometimes in Hebrew or French. Given the presence of her rich and heavily accented vocals and the harmonium, one obvious reference point is Nico, particularly the style of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHoDKuRB9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gothic cabaret</a> she perfected on <i>The Marble Index</i>. Winter Family's songs are are ""heavy"" in every sense of the word, to the point where they sometimes threaten to become claustrophobic. And their second full-length, <i>Red Sugar</i>, is, if anything, even more bleak than its predecessor. But they also have a way of leavening the nightmare with glimmers of beauty, just enough to keep the music from getting too oppressive.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Red Sugar</i> tend to alternate moments of everyday life-- lovers falling into open arms, the sound of families getting drunk, birds shaking the water off their bodies, cats asleep in arms-- with impressionistic images of war and pain. You get the feeling of small lives being lived as a larger world of misery rages outside. ""Dancing in the Sun"", a nearly 14-minute track that serves as this album's centerpiece, shows  their skillful use of contrast. The first half is a tense and jittery mix of minimalist piano, crashing cymbals, and assorted creaks and groans, a grisly sound above which Rosenthal muses on industrialism, global warming, and fear of the future. But halfway through, the track fades into a long stretch of silence and then explodes into a field recording of a demonstration: It's a rally in Jerusalem featuring John Hagee and his group Christians United for Israel, and they're praising the country because of the role it will play in end-times Biblical prophesy. The juxtaposition of the menacing music with the at-first cheerful but eventually more frightening sounds of the mob is striking, and the words hint at the group's focus on the politics, religion, power struggles, and prejudice that bring people into conflict.</p>
<p>The prickly burst of crowd noise in ""Dancing in the Sun"" exemplifies another terrific thing about this project: Winter Family's willingness to make unusual choices. ""Omaha"" is a creaking, harmonium-driven ballad whose lyrics (""Why did you go, my boy, to fight in a war that is not yours?"") seem to describe the Normandy landings in WWII. But then Rosenthal punctuates her spoken words with the mouthed sound of mortar shells exploding-- ""Ka-bough! Ka-bough!"" It's the kind of thing that looks questionable on paper and that most would have been embarrassed to try in the studio, but it winds up working brilliantly, evoking a child storyteller's description of a horror. Another surprising turn comes during ""Shooting Stars"",  an achingly slow, mournful, and ultimately gorgeous piano ballad, when Rosenthal moans and wails wordlessly at the end of every stanza, her vocalizations expressing what her words cannot.</p>
<p>As moving as I find this record, it's not an easy sell. It's such a <i>weighty</i> thing, exerting a constant pressure that is only occasionally relieved. But as harsh and despairing as <i>Red Sugar</i> can be, there's also a yearning for warmth and humanity, a desire to be lifted into the light. The key to it all is in how completely Rosenthal and Klaine inhabit this music: We never wonder for a second if they are really feeling it, and that makes it easier for us to feel.

It's no news that the indie rap spectrum is beginning to widen and mutate, allowing the agit-prop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> to beam into the eyeballs of 12.4 million viewers on VMA night, wiggling polarizing avant-weirdos like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> and (more notably) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a> into the mainstream consciousness, ramping up demand for astrally fogged bedroom producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>'s beats and grabbing up page space for up-and-coming outsiders like Harlem's <a href=""http://liveloveasap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ASAP Rocky</a>. It's no surprise then that Main Attrakionz are being lumped into the same discussions (after all, they've worked with the latter three aforementioned artists), and in turn are well on their way to gaining the similar levels of notoriety. At the end of last month-- hot off their new mixtape <a href=""http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>808s &amp; Dark Grapes II</i></a>-- the pair headed East and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43834-photos-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">rocked Manhattan's New Museum</a> as part of its <a href=""http://www.newmuseum.org/event_series/get_weird"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Weird"" series</a>, a notable but fittingly offbeat inauguration.</p>
<p>""Weird,"" however, seems a tad ill-fitting when describing Main Attrakionz's music: While unconventional in the sense that if you stripped away those titular 808s, you'd be left with glassy synths and watery textures that one could easily classify as ambient, rappers Squadda B and MondreM.A.N. seem simply to be products of their environment. And we're not necessarily talking about Oakland. While as prolific, as unafraid to integrate leftfield influences into their music, and as happy to keep things subwoofer-friendly as their Bay Area peers, most of their success and musical inspirations call cyberspace home. And in the case of <i>808s</i>-- the fourth <a href=""http://greenovamusic.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">freebie mixtape</a> full-length that these barely 20-year-olds have released in the past year (not including their solo efforts)-- Main Attrakionz seem to be neither the rule nor the exception, but rather a well-meaning, well-balanced rap act that has a sound that's both very ""now"" yet convincingly true-to-self.</p>
<p>As rappers, Squadda and Mondre at first seem unremarkable. Thematically, it's weed, women, and ambition, mixed with some mild introspection and broad sloganeering (""Ain't shit gon' change, but yo' ass can,"" goes the hook on ""Nothin' Gonna Change""). So while some might write the two off in the rhyme department, it's important to note that the rhymes aren't really the draw here. Instead, the simplistic approach reads like a mantra of self-disciplining restraint (or as Mondre explains on ""Paperwork"", ""I keep the music simple so any nigga can see""). Though lacking Lil B's bizarro free-associative style, it becomes pretty clear that, if their work ethic and output wasn't evidence enough, these guys are just <i>constantly rapping</i>: You can almost imagine them rhyming their way out of a speeding ticket or through a city council meeting (see: ""Rap Junkies""). Which is to say, it blends perfectly with the zoned-out production. And the fact that Squadda and Mondre aren't exactly foils-- I wouldn't have noticed that each rapper takes a solo cut here had I not had the tracklist glowing back at me-- everything on <i>808s</i> seems to emulsify almost effortlessly.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, this is music that will have you scrolling through your contacts to see if anyone's holding. Tracks like the new age-y ""Perfect Skies"" and the excellent ""Chuch"" spread out with a Zen-like grace that, coupled with Squadda and Mondre's fluid back-and-forth, invites you to melt into it. So, no, Main Attrakionz won't be spared the ridicule of jockeying the hipster zeitgeist-- after all, opener ""Bossalinis &amp; Fooliyones Pt. 2"" samples <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">Glasser</a>'s ""Treasury of We""-- but these idiosyncratic pairings offer insight into where these guys are coming from.</p>
<p>Main Attrakionz have often been described as ""lo-fi rap,"" and while <i>808s &amp; Dark Grapes II </i>itself is sonically tight and clean, it reeks of homemade qualities. Just because you can't hear the vocals reverberating off the tacky wood paneling in some basement doesn't mean you don't get a feel for how it was made. These guys are very much of the digital age and clearly feel most comfortable between the hinges of their laptops-- never mind that when the two are backed by more traditional, blocky programmings, they come off as average at best. Thanks to having such a wealth of music at their fingertips, Main Attrakionz synthesize their influences and source material uniquely and offer an endearing voice where others simply troll. Or, to paraphrase another popular internet parlance: They're doing it right.</p></div>"|15784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15784-main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii/|7.5|Zach Kelly

And CSS were more than happy to seize the moment, making music with no regard for tomorrow, filling their hipster-embraced debut album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9175-cansei-de-ser-sexy/"" target=""_blank"">Cansei de Ser Sexy</a></i> with trashy tributes to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7agPOt1XZz8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indie-rock favorites of the day</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4LpfVrfl8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">15-minute celebrities du jour</a>.</p>
<p>However, after their 2008 downer of a  sophomore album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12016-donkey/"" target=""_blank"">Donkey</a></i>, failed to generate the same amount of dancefloor traction-- and following a subsequent split from their North American boosters at Sub Pop-- CSS know it's going to take a lot more than a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1234-death-from-above-1979/"" target=""_blank"">Death From Above 1979</a> reunion tour to make them relevant again. And so on <i>La Liberación</i>, they attempt something of a maturation process. If, as Pitchfork's Eric Harvey said in his review of <i>Donkey</i>, CSS' disco-punk found its life source in Blondie's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_WLw_0DFQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atomic</a>"", then <i>La Liberación</i> finds them uncoiling that tightly wound sound to absorb ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppYgrdJ0pWk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Tide Is High</a>"" island vibes and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rapture</a>""-style inner-city funk.</p>
<p>Musically speaking, CSS can evolve only as much as lightning-rod frontwoman Lovefoxxx allows, and on <i>La Liberación</i>, she's only game to break from her potty-mouthed party-girl persona about half the time. That Lovefoxxx is aware of her own vacuity doesn't make it easier to take-- the remedial, call-and-response chorus of ""I Love You"" (all together now: ""I love you/ I love you, too"") may very well be a comment on the transactional nature of relationships, but, in the absence of a proper hook, it feels more like lazy songwriting. And the would-be empowerment anthem ""City Grrrl""-- an unapologetic celebration of revealing outfits and one-night stands-- feels like a forced attempt to fly the freak flag for club kids sick of dancing to ""Born This Way"".</p>
<p>And yet as much as these songs play right into well-worn CSS themes of vanity and self-gratification, on <i>La Liberación</i>, the band sounds genuinely torn between pandering to the sort of hopped-up hedonists who want to rip off Lovefoxxx’s clothes when she does a stage dive, and a desire to dial down the crassness and redefine their character. Their experiments don't always yield useful results-- the downcast, acoustic-guitar-powered ""Partners in Crime"" comes awkwardly decorated with free-form piano rolls that trip up rather than propel the song's momentum. But there are moments when CSS find a way to successfully evolve without alienating their base, particularly on the playful, Afro-funk-inflected pop of ""Echo of Love"" and the ""Paper Planes""-fashioned, tropical slow-burner ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42931-new-css-hits-me-like-a-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Hits Me Like a Rock</a>"", a winning duet with Bobby Gillespie (returning the favor after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V5jyZf5foc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lovefoxxx's guest appearance</a> on Primal Scream's 2008 release <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12024-beautiful-future/"" target=""_blank"">Beautiful Future</a></i>). In light of these developments, the sax-squawked nihilism of the closing ""Fuck Everything"" feels all the more empty: There's enough evidence on <i>La Liberación</i> to suggest CSS actually do care about being a band you'll still respect in the morning.</p></div>"|15794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15794-la-liberacion/|5.2|Stuart Berman

Especially after he strayed, with only intermittent success, from his instantly recognizable template on his 2009 sophomore record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13142-yesterday-today/"" target=""_blank"">Yesterday and Today</a></i>. After all, at its simplest, techno is music that can be built with just a few loops. And Willner's first few records certainly made effective use of the form, layering shimmering loops of voice and synth and guitar on each track until he'd built a fluffy and infinitely soothing wall of sound.</p>
<p>Immersive and repetitive, the Field's first singles and 2007 debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/"" target=""_blank"">From Here We Go Sublime</a></i>, were like ambient records disguised as both experimental techno and luscious pop. So is <i>Looping State of Mind</i> a return to that sound, the one that made the Field a crossover favorite with rock kids a few years back? Not exactly. In a few instances it's barely recognizable as ""the Field"" at all. It may be still be built from loops, but Willner's never orchestrated so many of them so artfully into such dense and infinitely listenable soundscapes.</p>
<p>Good thing, too, because the last few years have seen a lot of bedroom producers become briefly famous for ambient records disguised as pop, for amorphous electronic doodles disguised as songs. Instead of coasting, as one of the inadvertent models for the current ""chill"" thing, a producer who'd probably earn infinite props just for repeating himself, Willner decided to put 99 percent of his acolytes to shame here. True, there are still tracks, like ""It's Up There"", that recall Willner's best-loved stuff, but even they feel richer, like the early Field in 3D and high-def. ""Arpeggiated Love"" is on the one hand a dead-ringer for the propulsive, ecstatic sound-wash of <i>From Here We Go Sublime</i>. But Willner now fleshes it out with shiver-inducing soul music harmonies that owe less to sleek German techno than gospel-tinged American house. True, he was quoting classic soul group the Flamingos as early as <i>Sublime</i>, but he's never been so overt in dipping into dance music's global history.</p>
<p>As that might suggest, <i>Looping</i> often strays far from the Field we know, into territory that recalls deep house, post-punk, shoegaze, noise-rock, and cosmic techno. And he manages to swirl them all together in a way that makes his earliest attempts to fuse ambient and trance feel like gorgeous apprentice work. <i>Yesterday and Today</i> sometimes sounded hesitant, as if Willner didn't quite know how to make his music fresh for a second time. On <i>Looping</i> he packs all seven tracks with curveballs, and each new direction feel successful, vital, surprising.</p>
<p>At one point on opener ""Is This Power"", everything drops away except for an eerie bass twang that recalls Joy Division or the Cure circa ""A Forest"", but when the boogie bass finally drops back in, you're not only reminded that this is dance music, it's easily the funkiest Field tune you've probably yet heard. The rhythms on <i>Looping</i> are more varied than anything the Willner's done before. Though he hasn't entirely abandoned that programmed motorik pulse that drove <i>Sublime</i>, his work with live bands over the last few years has clearly fed into <i>Looping</i>. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12338-then-its-white/"" target=""_blank"">Then It's White</a>"" summons a Yorke-less Radiohead, with the way the drums subtly mesh human fluency and digital tech. And that's not even counting the <i>Amnesiac</i>-like mix of pensive piano and mournful, computer-warped vocals.</p>
<p>Despite the sometimes winning simplicity of his music, Willner was no slouch as a producer before. Yet listening to this album, there's no doubt he's grown way more assured and inventive over the last two years. And he's brought all his skill to bear on <i>Looping</i>, as composer and arranger and texturologist, in order to build something this simultaneously sweeping and subtle, deep and immediate. It could still alienate those perpetually pining for copies of ""A Paw in My Face"" or ""Sun and Ice"". But if they listen more deeply, they might just hear Willner’s masterpiece-to-date.</p></div>"|15790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/|8.5|Jess Harvell

Which isn't all that surprising-- these things happen when the ""next step"" involves signing to a label, hiring a venerated producer (John Agnello, who also worked this year with alt-revivalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28096-male-bonding/"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a>), turning over half of your personnel, and releasing an 8 1/2-minute song as the ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43072-cymbals-eat-guitars-share-new-track-tour/"" target=""_blank"">first single</a>."" Here's the thing: <i>Lenses Alien </i><span>doesn't really <i>sound</i> all that different from <i>Why There Are Mountains</i>, which is a tribute to how fully formed and musically tight CEG were right out of the gate.</span> Perhaps the most challenging thing about <i>Lenses Alien </i><span>is how it makes what it sounds like fairly unimportant: Like last time, almost none of its sonic touchstones exist outside of the Clinton administration, but Joseph D'Agostino takes an enormous leap of faith by doubling down on his brick-thick verbiage during a lyrics-first record that puts more confidence in the listener's attention span than pretty much anything else I've heard this year.</span></p>
<p>It's become something of a cliché to praise an ""<i>album</i> in the mp3 age,"" and while <i>Lenses Alien</i> certainly isn't intended to be strip-mined for singles, it's meant to be experienced on a remarkably micro level. It's actually more ambitious than the already grand <i>Mountains</i>, but it doesn't manifest in Byzantine song structure or far-flung sonic touches. While there's a peripheral shift from the more blue-collar, populist likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wrens/"" target=""_blank"">the Wrens</a> into the deconstructive and unfairly less celebrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/677-capn-jazz/"" target=""_blank"">Cap'n Jazz</a> (when it's loud) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/118-the-appleseed-cast/"" target=""_blank"">the Appleseed Cast</a> (when it's quiet), the craft is evident in how every lyric and riff is exactingly honed to be of near equal importance.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Lenses Alien </i><span>doesn't take after the sprawl of ""Rifle Eyesight (Proper Name)""-- it's about twice as long as anything else-- but it lays out the record's rules of engagement. I've talked with others who consider its flow to be somewhat clunky, which is understandable considering what listeners typically expect from a song of that length, particularly an opener. There's not an epic build or a cataclysmic blowout: D'Agostino occupies the mind of an unstable, possibly predatory narrator, changing perspective and mood from verse to verse, the extended floods of physically punishing guitar feedback acting as outbursts of mental anguish linking unorthodox yet accessible and sprightly vocal lines. I'll call it anticlimactic as a compliment: Over an ugly, gnarled cluster of notes, D'Agostino asks, ""What former police sits at the bus stop offering rides?” and the song ends abruptly like a stunning reveal. After eight minutes of psychodrama played out in his head, the camera pans out for you to imagine the yellowed teeth or cold, vacant stare of its main character.</span></p>
<p>So many of <i>Lenses Alien</i>'s enduring moments come from these mergers of sensation-- the chorus of ""oh-whoas"" from tired passengers on the cunningly catchy ""Shore Points"" underlining an abrupt change of plans along the Jersey coastline; a picture of motorboats and Styrofoam coolers amidst the burst of crowd-pleasing guitars during ""Keep Me Waiting"". Then there's the liquid, unsteady near-instrumental of ""The Current"" stopping to make a brief and lucid prayer for a universe free of physical suffering, while ""Gary Condit"" offers the record's final grasp at understanding: ""Is it teeth-shaking polyphony, grace, and completion or nothing?"" delivered as an unholy, desperate cry for help.</p>
<p>The need for release runs throughout <i>Lenses Alien</i>, as it condenses the spacious travelogues of <i>Mountains </i> into claustrophobic ruminations on the metaphysical, moving cars, and D'Agostino's mind existing as purgatories. ""Plainclothes"" opens suggesting a True Crime story, but it's a passing thought during a paranoid drive up a New York highway interspersed with startling, vivid details-- the tricks cops pull on unsuspecting drivers during initiation season, the sensation of being haunted by ghosts of past partiers in a guest house. This unsettling otherworldliness continues through ""Definite Darkness"", a mysterious police investigation causing a sleepless night that fades out on a coda of wearied sighs.</p>
<p>Considering all the paranoia and fleeting revelations, drugs unsurprisingly play a big role here, particularly psychedelics whose side effects are less about hedonism than discovery. D'Agostino and friends have relatable freak outs and puke in sand dunes, pass out with their shoes on, roll down hills on skateboards, and remark upon how ""dried mushrooms taste a lot like communion wafers."" They’re disarmingly naïve about worlds opening up to them, seeing gas leaks, air force bases, and the suburban and rural expanses of the northeast United States as reflections of celestial significance.</p>
<p>The downside is how the music occasionally buckles under the weight of its own restlessness and D'Agostino’s words-- a slightly skewed ratio of visceral immediacy to cerebral satisfaction making it a slight notch below <i>Why There Are Mountains</i>. While packed with forceful riffs and quirky melodic turns, ""Another Tunguska"" and ""Secret Family"" are such slippery compositions that D'Agostino's backing can sometimes feel incidental. But once you stop looking for the hooks and choruses as they might be defined traditionally, dozens of inventive melodies emerge: Is the elegant, Elliott Smith-esque melody of ""Shore Points"" less sticky because there’s no chorus? Do the soulfully swooping harmonies of ""Wavelengths"" constitute a chorus even though the lyrics don’t repeat?</p>
<p>I suppose it's indicative of <i>Lenses Alien</i>'s strange magnetism that it raises as many questions when it's catchy as it does when it's inscrutable. After all, it's so thick with overlapping images, memories, stray thoughts, and second guessing that I sense D'Agostino's asking us throughout: How real are our own emotions? Are you guessing at your own feelings? It's heavy stuff, never answered in an easy way, and can really feel out of step with their peers who treat lyrics as placeholders and thoughts as fact. More than the sound of the 90s, <i>Lenses Alien</i> recalls, at least to these ears, the way we might’ve interacted with those records at the time: poring over the lyrics sheet, having a real sense of investment.</p>
<p>It's no slight to say <i>Lenses Alien </i> isn't at the level of <i>Perfect From Now On</i> or <i>The Moon and Antarctica </i><span>-- it's not a masterpiece. But while <i>Why There Are Mountains </i> reminded me of what those records <i>sounded </i> like, <i>Lenses Alien </i> does something more difficult by reminding what it felt like once they were over and you were left to wonder if you just stumbled upon a cosmic, philosophical treatise disguised as an indie rock record.</span></p></div>"|15757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15757-lenses-alien/|8.0|Ian Cohen

As someone smitten with the original and <a href=""http://www.memoryhou.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Memoryhouse</a>'s ""ambient shoegaze,"" I was hoping the update would be a promised ""new and improved"" version. To be clear, the EP is technically all new material: Three tracks from the old EP (""Sleep Patterns"", ""Lately (Deuxième)"", ""To The Lighthouse"") were re-recorded and the pleasant interlude ""The Waves"" is replaced with two song-like tracks, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15945-modern-normal/"" target=""_blank"">Modern, Normal</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16205-quiet-america/"" target=""_blank"">Quiet America</a>"".</p>
<p>The new tracks-- the hook for folks that have the original <i>The Years</i>-- are pleasant, if unsurprising.  Other than the appearance of live drums on ""Modern, Normal"", they offer a slightly different variation on what Evan Abeele and Denise Nouvion have done previously.  Ironically, it's on the old/new tracks where <i>The Years</i> shows the group spreading its wings, though not necessarily in a becoming manner.</p>
<p>Of the three returnees, only ""Sleep Patterns"" comes through sounding like its previous version.  There are small yet noticeable changes made to the arrangement-- the addition of strings (or string-like sounds) being the most apparent. The track sounds more robust, but it's otherwise about the same.  While ""Lately"" loses the cassette-tape ambiance that dovetailed nicely with its <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> score sample, it's also not unrecognizable. That said, the exchange of that home-recording coziness for some bright and shiny opulence is a bit disconcerting. Then there's ""To the Lighthouse"", which undergoes an extreme makeover:  The group swaps out the original's shimmering intro and its relaxed yet propulsive trip-hop-like gait for some kids-at-play found-sound samples and a decidedly less jaunty pace.  As a result, the track that stood out for the change of pace it offered now falls in line with Memoryhouse's primary M.O.</p>
<p>Despite my own misgivings about these re-recordings, these new versions aren't bad by any stretch-- they just seem unnecessary. While it's nice to hear what Memoryhouse would've done with these older tracks if they were produced  in a proper studio, the end result is akin to a more famous attempt at an after-the-fact fine-tuning: filmmaker George Lucas' seemingly endless tweaking and CGI-ing of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy.  The band makes mention of Lucas on its blog, while promising that this EP isn't on the same level as Lucas' compulsive tinkering. But the question that  <i>Star Wars</i> fans continually ask themselves is a question that some fans of <i>The Years</i> might also have: Why go back and fix something that wasn't broken?</p>
<p>To fuss over those old tracks, especially in light of how little the band has actually recorded, seems regressive.  The overall intent of this release-- to put an actual, physical copy of <i> The Years</i> out into the world for folks who aren't up to speed on their online music research-- is understandable, and even justifiable, on many levels.  But for folks who have been living with these songs for over a year, offering two passable new tracks next to these three remakes isn't nearly good enough.</p></div>"|15788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15788-memoryhouse-the-years-ep/|6.3|David Raposa

""The music of my childhood was really diverse because I had access to everything,"" she said, and this omnivorousness is apparent in her eccentric, dreamy sound, which draws upon everything from dubstep to disco, Eastern music to 1990s R&amp;B.</p>
<p>Even before that interview, it was clear Grimes knew her way around a web browser. She first attracted an audience outside Montreal's DIY art and music scene when she put her earliest recordings online for free, and since then she's cultivated an online presence that makes equal room for her music and haunting visual art. She's even issued preemptive strikes against critics' misguided games of Spot the Influence (""I don't listen to Kate Bush, nor have I ever,"" she <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/grimezsz/status/95918353834713088"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> a few weeks ago-- a delightful bit of sacrilege from an artist who's probably never read an article about herself that didn't contain the word ""weirdo""). Whatever she’s doing, it's working: at the beginning of last year she was uploading to her MySpace the DIY bedroom recordings that would comprise her debut album, and now she and her art school haircut are posing in couture for <i>Times</i> online subscribers. (Just ask <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/gifted-salem/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>-- shit doesn't get more post-Internet than that.)</p>
<p>Now that debut album, <i>Geidi Primes</i>, is getting a good old fashioned CD/LP rerelease on the UK-based label No Pain in Pop. (Previously its only physical release was a limited-run cassette on Montreal’s flourishing experimental pop imprint Arbutus.) Coming on the heels of her terrific material on the tantalizingly brief <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15439-darkbloom-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Darkbloom</a></i> split EP, the <i>Geidi Primes</i>' re-release is a wisely timed holdover for the months before her next LP comes out early next year. But <i>Geidi Primes</i> is much more than a quaint indicator of how far Grimes has come in the past year and a half. Despite its modest production values and relative simplicity, it's a cohesive, enchanting, and surprisingly assured debut.</p>
<p>Even though it clocks in at a slight 30 minutes, <i>Geidi Primes</i> is a wholly immersive listen. The melodies are hooky and sweet, but each track has a throbbing undercurrent of menace that pulls you in like a riptide. It's hard to pinpoint exactly from where this pervading element of darkness springs-- especially since, on paper, most of the lyrics read like valentines. (Pretty much every discernable chorus revolves around the word ""heart."") The hypnotic standout ""Feyd Rautha Dark Heart"" begins with a simple Casio-style beat and an ostensibly sugary hook-- ""I won't break your heart in the dark""-- but the track builds into something decidedly eerie: chilly synth hits, zombified vocals, and percussion that sounds like rattling bones. By the end, even the sweet refrain sounds less like an expression of devotion and more like a chant meant to put you under some kind of spell. Which, you come to realize, is <i>Geidi Primes</i>' main objective.</p>
<p>Perhaps <i>Geidi Primes</i>' greatest virtue is its resourcefulness: It excels at crafting evocative moods from deceivingly simple sonic materials and song structures. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the simple, looping bassline of ""Rosa"", the brightest and most unabashedly straightforward song on the record, and also the one most likely to stay lodged in your head for days. Then there’s the brief, wordless ""Gambang"" making utter gorgeousness from nothing more than a slightly warped sample and breathy falsetto curlicues.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, Grimes knows how to work her range. Though she's become known for her impressive falsetto (which she pushes to rapturous, Donna Summer-like heights on the <i>Darkbloom</i> single ""Vanessa"") and she can occasionally pull of a spooky low tone that's faintly reminiscent of Karin Dreijer Andersson, she spends much <i>of Geidi Primes</i> in mid-range, tuneful deadpan, which lends wry humor to the lines she coos to a lover on ""Zoal, Face Dancer"": ""Everybody thinks that I'm boring/ Many people think I've got no clue."" Just because she's spacey-- yes, nerds, those <i>are</i> <i>Dune</i> references scattered throughout the track listing-- doesn't mean she's without earthly wit. It takes a pretty good sense of humor to write an utterly gorgeous closer and call it ""Beast Infection"".</p>
<p>Given her restlessly prolific creativity (she followed up <i>Geidi Primes</i> with another solid 2010 release, <i>Halfaxa</i>) and the bounding artistic strides she's displayed with her recent singles, Grimes could very well be poised for a meteoric rise with the release of her next full length. But <i>Geidi Primes</i> shows that even her earliest recordings displayed a distinct point of view and an oddly mesmerizing quality. There’s something refreshingly ""post-Internet"" about that too-- a dreamy soundscape that invites an escape from the glitchy universe, a brief provocation to let go and just bliss out.</p></div>"|15751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15751-geidi-primes/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Then, the Minneapolis duo played 100 shows in a six-month span and-- with ""a new-found footing of confidence and experimentation,"" according to the press release-- sat down and recorded <i>Garden of Arms</i>. The confidence in their new record is clear, if only because their vocals sound more boisterous than ever, but for the most part, the experimentation is the problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that ""experimentation"" for Peter Wolf Crier doesn't mean a Steve Reich or some dense soundscape. Instead, they needlessly streamlined their sound, creating the feel of a locationless, generic rock band. They've effectively replaced the old radio warmth of <i>Inter-Be</i>'s ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Peter%20Wolf%20Crier%20-%20Crutch%20And%20Cane.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Crutch &amp; Cane</a>"" with an emotionless electric guitar on ""Beach"" that brings to mind Audioslave-era Tom Morello. For percussion, they've opted for a militaristic snare that does little more than distract from every other layer. And while the vocals are more confident, the melodies are interchangeable.</p>
<p>The opener, ""Right Away"", sets the tone with its repetitive, claustrophobic vocal treatment. The lyrics offer a collage of emotions that never seem to connect: Lines like ""All the inches flow"" and ""Right away you are the one"" hint at something meaningful, but never taking the time to provide actual meaning. Even when the emotions are clear, Pisano's melodramatic belting detracts from the weight of the heartbreak. High drama seems to be the aim of <i>Garden of Arms</i>, especially when you consider the majority of the lyrics are comprised of over-the-top emotional imagery like ""Lonely gardener it is time you woke the knight/ Kiss divine and hold his lips to your own light."" (Song titles like ""Haunt You"" don't help.)</p>
<p>There are some welcome turns. ""Beach"" features an overarching percussion that sounds like swishing water, and the most satisfying moment on the track ""Hard Heart"" comes at the end, where a chorus of ethereal vocals serve as percussive accents. ""Cut a Hand"" makes a return to the muffled guitar warmth of their debut, and Pisano's vocals are markedly toned down, but again, the song is covered in Moen's heavy snares. Conversely, one of the best songs, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16174-settling-it-off/"" target=""_blank"">Settling It Off</a>"",  tempers the melodrama of the lyrics with quiet percussion, tender vocals, and a simple fingerpicked guitar.</p>
<p>It isn't until the final two tracks that their departure from <i>Inter-Be</i> pays off. On ""Never Meant to Love You"", Pisano sounds exhausted, perhaps from all the belting. There are still poetic analogies-- dead leaves and drought to evoke the end of a relationship-- but the instruments gradually get quieter. His vocals fade, and his regret turns to silence. The final track ""Wheel"" features even fewer instruments: The song's mainly backed by ghostly moans, the album devolving into a quiet static shuffle. It's a far cry from the clutter of ""Right Away"" and a welcome respite from the melodrama, making clear that the band is capable of great things in its new form.</p></div>"|15791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15791-garden-of-arms/|6.0|Evan Minsker

They never seemed like a good bet to break dance music to the mainstream audiences, though, no matter how hard iTunes insists that the closing track on my copy of 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9399-pieces-of-the-people-we-love/"" target=""_blank"">Pieces of the People We Love</a></i> is titled ""Best Buy Exclusive."" Pan-pop conspiracy theorists might note that the Rapture reached fever-pitch in New York in 2003, or right around the time that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a> was enrolling at NYU, but if the Rapture hadn't stopped their own momentum, someone would have stopped it for them: likely labelmate/mentor/producer James Murphy, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> offered the same funk-punk grooves but had better jokes (well, had jokes period) and a more explosive live presence, with pathos to boot. The Rapture were too nervy and out-of-sync to ascend the ranks.</p>
<p>None of that changes the fact that the Rapture return, minus a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8656-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">surly</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw3miE1AN48"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Youtube non-sensation</a>, at a time when house and disco are more fashionable than at any time since the early 1980s. See Gaga, see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules and Love Affair</a>, see <a href=""http://www.coolcats.fr/friends/daft-punk-1000-kubrick-set.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">couture Daft Punk Lego dolls</a>, see the fact that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Beat-Explicit-David-Guetta/dp/B0052YAKS6/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314974741&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Brown knows a French guy</a>. The Rapture, always medium opportunists, aren't interested in taking advantage of this. They've become what they've always threatened to become: an art-rock band with predilections for boogie and dippy lyrics. <i>Grace</i> sounds like the Rapture without retreading past successes, a nifty trick that underscores the band's hard-won identity.</p>
<p>The Rapture are a pretty good art-rock band, too: <i>Grace</i> is fleshier than its predecessors, with horns, needlework guitar, and Jenner's brash voice filling the negative space the band used to gift to the dance floor. They deftly respond to choral background vocals, funky synth slabs, and tasteful guitar fills. A group that was once a combustible ball of energy is now a functioning nervous system with a keen sense of pace and texture. You can hear notes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>'s propulsive anthems (""Sail Away""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a>' agitated funk (""Can You Find a Way""), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"" target=""_blank"">XTC</a>'s ballast pop (""Rollercoaster""). You can forgive them for envying Cut Copy's hot-knife-through-butter crowd uniters (""Children"").</p>
<p><i>Grace</i> is the band's mature album, by their own reckoning: Press for the record has almost unanimously focused on the members' stroller-pushing benders, how frontman Luke Jenner spent time playing softball, attending church, and coping with the loss of his mother. Stability and love dominate its themes, the title cutting think-pieces off at the pass by invoking grace directly: This album is about sustained, earned love, as well as the forgiveness inherent in it.</p>
<p>When it clicks, it's triumphant. My two favorite songs are two of the most explicitly groove-oriented, ramped to tempos at which Jenner's alkaline voice can't help but cast hooks. ""Miss You"" attempts to reconcile with his mother, while ""Never Die Again"" pleads for a healthy relationship, topics flung far from dance music's typical fare. Of course, if the songs were about Lunchables or macroeconomics, I'd love them just them same; such is the draw when Jenner turns his nasal pipes to siren.</p>
<p>Therein lies the fallacy of the Rapture's maturity: Jenner has always played peek-a-boo with God and serenity (previous albums included songs titled ""Love Is All"", ""Live in the Sunshine"", and ""Open Up Your Heart"", not forgetting that the name of the band is <i>the Rapture</i>). On <i>Grace</i> he does so with more explicit inspiration, but he's a fumbling lyricist, better suited for tunneling into our Nikes than our hearts.</p>
<p>Jenner used to scrap and cluck for our attention more often; he's had better luck wrangling sentiment out of a yelp than a platitude (the best disco singers handle both). His finest moment is on lead single ""How Deep Is Your Love?"", the galloping, piano-driven tour de force that so many Chicago house revivalists have failed to nail. Here, the rollicking pianos match his devotional pitch, the wilding sax echoing his hallelujahs. Still, Jenner can feel like a man without a country. He doesn't have the pipes for the sustained howling of ""Sail Away"", ""Blue Bird"", or the title track (a misplaced, tedious centerpiece). Nor does the sentiment of soul-sided closer ""It Takes Time to Be a Man"" lend itself to his tonal irreverence and pizzazz. Of all the naughties indie giants thinking hard about domesticity (LCD, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>), the Rapture's medium is least primed for the message.</p>
<p>This isn't the Rapture's fault, necessarily. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HP04nfUi4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">House of Jealous Lovers</a>"" is such a totem amid the last decade of indie that it's easy to forget they began as a somewhat (no pun) catholic punk band. <i>In the Grace of Your Love</i> takes two large steps back from ""dance punk."" Nearly a decade after ""Jealous Lovers"", they're a patient, skilled rock band unafraid to look uncool. If they sound extra comfy here it's probably because discomfort pervaded their best work so completely. The band's personal choices-- to abandon rock iconography for smaller, more fulfilling family units-- will be <i>Grace</i>'s fate as well: a record without broader narratives, meant for those who grew up with the Rapture, or want to.</p></div>"|15783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15783-in-the-grace-of-your-love/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Just as developments in recording and broadcasting technologies drove 20th-century pop, the Internet and accessible music software are driving something new in the 21st century. Its contours are getting clearer as the first generation to grow up with it comes of age. These musicians are sweeping away the vestiges of generic lineage and regional identity. Unselfconsciously mingling the prefab, the pilfered, and the original, they have none of their elders' qualms about samples and virtual instruments. Many live outside of major culture centers, and thrive online rather than onstage, working with sophisticated editing tools in relative isolation to construct their idiosyncratic visions.</p>
<p>The production duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"">Elite Gymnastics</a> is a perfect example of this diaspora of younger musicians. James Brooks and Josh Clancy live in Minneapolis, but this tells us little about them-- the Internet is their habitat, not a conduit. Their music is proudly unaffiliated, cobbling together influences that will probably strike older listeners as disparate and younger ones as perfectly concordant. The band's name comes from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK-MclL_1WY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a song</a> by power electronics pioneers Whitehouse, and noise terrorism is latent in their churning tone and freighted lyrics (which are barely audible but have an evil vibe). The drum breaks come from jungle and hip-hop, the radiantly smeared textures from shoegaze and drone-rock, the samples from video games. They're comfortable <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EICDO51PKEg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mixing Waka Flocka Flame</a> or <a href=""http://fortyounce.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=143"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, chopping <i>Final Fantasy</i> theme music into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11909-is-this-on-me/"">Balearic house</a> or tending to ghostly, blackened whirrs.<a href=""http://www.citypages.com/2010-07-14/music/elite-gymnastics-ride-the-chillwave/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> According to the band</a>, they used chillwave to Trojan Horse these diverse sounds into complacent earbuds.</p>
<p>Whether or not you buy that line, the only chillwave thing about <i>RUIN 1</i> is how miscellaneous listening habits dissolve in a solution of over-stimulated memory and prodigious sonic options. There's nothing slackened or balmy about it, no pink Christmas lights or plastic palm trees. It's a rugged, mercurial terrain with heatwaves blasting off it. Jungle drums slice through dark, grainy atmospheres flashing with techno synths (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12270-so-close-to-paradise/"">So Close to Paradise</a>""), and the only thing separating throbbing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>-style rock (""Little Things"") and gentle vintage shoegaze (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12291-omamori/"">Omamori</a>"") is the fizzy electro of ""Here, in Heaven"". The through-line is a pitched, exciting contest between aggressive percussion and emotive melody. The drums are often taut and frantic, but great floating swaths of texture provide a nebulous weight. Besides the frequently inconsequential vocals, the only downside is some murky mixing, with lots of uncompressed clutter. Blurry but lucid is a very tricky sound to nail, and Elite Gymnastics are getting good mileage out of raw energy while they work it out.</p>
<p>That's why <i>RUIN 2</i>-- which basically borrows the idea of chopped and screwed remix discs from rap-- is more than a supplement. It actually improves some of the original mixes by clearing out the dense thatching, letting them breathe. The original version of ""Here, in Heaven"" sounds flat compared to the second, a yawning chasm that evokes the ambient dub of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28302-brock-van-wey/"">Brock Van Wey</a>. ""Little Things"" also gains distinction with its vocal hung between huge, skeletal pulses and silvery curls of ambiance. But this isn't to say that Elite Gymnastics should only make cored-out dub: ""Minneapolis Belongs to You"" lets some light and air into <i>RUIN 1 </i>with refreshing results. And do you also detect a tacit ""(But Not to Me)"" after that title? If folk music's domain was regional and pop's was global, this music lives beyond the world, where ideas floating through waves and wires take on an independent, hermetic life.</p></div>"|15779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15779-r-u-i-n-1-2/|7.8|Brian Howe

The band was founded after its figurehead, guitarist Rory McClure, binged on old performance footage of the Everly Brothers. The swaying melodies and dippy, falsetto-speckled vocals on the band's debut LP, <i>Violent Hearts</i>, are the marks of that influence. But as the title suggests, though, this stuff veers from swooning romanticism. They make pleas for self-medication and express vague emotional confusion throughout. One of the album's most optimistic songs, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14313-im-gonna-try/"" target=""_blank"">I'm Gonna Try</a>"", begins: ""Walking down the street/ And I wanna kill everyone I meet."" Later, when Shimmering Stars complain about ""Dancing to Music I Hate"", it seems like a comparatively uncomplicated personal problem.</p>
<p>Like a lot of young bands lately, Shimmering Stars' affectations can be easily traced back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>, another group that filters experience through sounds and textures plucked from music's past. And if Shimmering Stars don't quite reach the same level of noisy euphoria anywhere on <i>Violent Hearts</i>, the surprising consistency of the record as a whole-- if you're a sucker for one song on here, you're a sucker for all of 'em-- is more than enough to make up for any lack of assertiveness.</p>
<p>As a full-length listening experience, <i>Violent Hearts</i> is a little much-- it runs just under a lean half-hour, but the relative lack of stylistic breadth covered makes a front-to-back spin feel longer. Another issue is the production value; <i>Violent Hearts</i> was self-recorded by McClure in his parents' garage (cheekily referred to in the album's liner notes as ""The Garage Mahal""). While the homespun charm adds some ghostly distance to these songs, it's frustrating to imagine what they would sound like with some better mics (and maybe a real recording studio, too). There's no shortage of emotional bloodshed here, but any horror geek will tell you that blood just doesn't look as good in black-and-white.</p></div>"|15782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15782-violent-hearts/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

She landed on her head and lost a lot of blood. When she was recovering in the hospital she started, for the first time, to hear songs-- ""sonic hauntings,"" as she called them in her 2010 memoir, <i>Rat Girl</i>. Initially humming, mechanical tones, they quickly organized themselves into the familiar grammar of guitar chords, drum beats, basslines, and surreal melodies. She didn't feel quite right until she got them out of her head: ""As soon as I give a song a body in the real world, it stops playing and I breathe a sigh of relief, in precious silence."" She played the chords herself and taught the other parts to her friends Dave Narcizo and Leslie Langston and her stepsister Tanya Donelly, and they became the earliest material recorded by their band, Throwing Muses.</p>
<p>It's a hell of a creation myth, but an easy one to believe: pretty much every song Throwing Muses ever recorded sounds like an exorcism. Though indebted to punk's passion, fury, and occasional goofiness, the Muses were punks only in the spiritual sense of the word: Even by their teens, the original four were all accomplished musicians well-versed enough in music theory to create the weird, irregular chords and erratic time signatures that would become hallmarks of their sound. There was something almost Zen-like about the band's approach: Dump the contents of your busy brain out onto the street, and see what sounds they make on impact. The offspring of hippie idealism (Hersh grew up living on a commune and calling her dad ""Dude"") and post-punk disillusionment, the Muses' rhetoric was not about breaking the rules so much as transcending them completely. In a recent interview, Hersh said of her earliest days in the band, ""I realized that in order to play with the voice you would have if you grew up on a desert island without a radio you need to forget rules.""</p>
<p><i>Anthology</i>, the first retrospective collection of Throwing Muses material, comes to us on the 25th anniversary of their (first) self-titled record, a stammering, brutal masterpiece that managed to capture both late adolescent angst and feelings well beyond its years. Producer Gil Norton made Hersh's most intimate moments of near-delirium sound epic: like portions of someone's diary blown up to billboard size. Ever wary of commercial appeal, the band said it didn’t want to make anthems, so before its next record its label 4AD passed Norton onto the opening act on the Muses' European tour, fellow Bostonian scenesters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a>, who were looking for someone to record their next album, <i>Doolittle</i>. Though the histories of the two bands are deeply, famously entwined, the Muses have enjoyed a fate harder to identify than the burden of being hugely influential (even though they were in certain corners: It's almost impossible to imagine the visceral bleats of singers like Corin Tucker or Marissa Paternoster without Kristin Hersh). This moment of reunions, reissues, and boundless nostalgia seems a good time to ask: where did Throwing Muses fit in?</p>
<p><i>Anthology</i> doesn't quite answer this question. Neither an exhaustive box set nor a greatest-hits collection, <i>Anthology</i> is more like mixtape personally compiled by the band, making a very characteristically Muses argument for the personal over the canonical, for a song’s appeal as something that's more subjective than objective. Though it eschews chronology and omits some of their most popular tracks (there’s only one song on here from 1991’s <i>The Real Ramona</i>-- and it’s the deep cut ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BkfNL2Diq0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Step</a>""), <i>Anthology</i> is still an accessible entry point to the band’s formidably deep catalogue-- for the already initiated, it’s a relatively taut refresher.</p>
<p>The first disc is 21 tracks culled from major Muses releases, skewing heaviest on their late-80s output-- over half of the material comes from a three-year run that spanned the exquisitely dank <i>Chains Changed</i> EP to the somewhat brighter <i>Hunkpapa</i> in 1989. There are classics (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJFm8-g0Bg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fish</a>"", ""Hate My Way"", ""Marriage Tree"", ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAj2DEOcpxQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bright Yellow Gun</a>"") and a few surprises (""Mr. Bones"", ""Two Step"", ""Pretty or Not""), but there’s a remarkable cohesion to the collection’s flow. When the band released its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8046-throwing-muses/"" target=""_blank"">2003 self-titled album</a> after a long absence, even its biggest fans were kind of astonished at how well the group had been able to capture the sound and spirit of its earliest recordings. Two songs from that ""reunion"" album made the cut here: I'd bet anything that <i>Anthology</i> listeners coming to the band for the first time wouldn't be able to pick them out of the bunch without peeking at the liner notes.</p>
<p>Naturally, the B-sides and rarities disc is spottier-- I could live comfortably in a world without the tepid version of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJlOdJqxnz8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazing Grace</a>"" or the instrumental ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwOyCAqUzxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manic Depression</a>"", which could pass for the interstitial music on an old Ken Griffey baseball video game. But once you get to the material from the <i>Firepile</i> EPs, it offers a killer middle stretch: ""Snailhead"" (featuring one of the most blistering Hersh vocals on the whole collection) segues into the smoldering slow-burner ""City of the Dead"". I’ve actually found myself spinning Disc 2 more than Disc 1, probably just because most of the material is fresher to my ears. It's not the most essential entry in their discography, but it's solid.</p>
<p>To some people, the word <i>Anthology</i> might promise something bigger or more definitive than what the Muses have given us here, but most fans will appreciate the personal flourishes all over this collection (especially Hersh's always poetic liner notes). <i>Anthology</i> isn't exactly a totemic bookend to Throwing Muses' long and lively career, but as the band’s 2003 record and upcoming reunion tour suggest, maybe there’s still too much life in them for a definitive ending.</p></div>"|15781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15781-throwing-muses-anthology/|8.0|Lindsay Zoladz

Of course, you run a greater risk of repeating yourself in the future, but by and large the hardest part is already out of the way. <a href=""http://www.yourcomicbookfantasy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTRK</a> (pronounced ""Hate Rock"") aren't what you would normally consider lucky, both professionally and personally. Formed in 2003, the trio's no wave-leaning art noise found them playing alongside deities like Alan Vega and Lydia Lunch. In 2009, their debut LP, <i>Marry Me Tonight</i> (co-produced by ex-Birthday Party member Roland S. Howard), landed them a few high-profile opening slots for the likes of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Liars.</p>
<p>And it made sense: <i>Marry Me</i> is doomy and romantically languid, with a pop-smart crispness that spoke of potentially good things to come. But when bassist Sean Stewart took his own life in March of last year, vocalist Jonnine Standish and guitarist Nigel Yang were  left to pick up the pieces and push forward with their second full length, <i>Work (work, work)</i>. While dark and otherworldly, much of <i>Work</i> doesn't feel like it has much to do with death, but everything to do with sex. But they've shifted their sound, and in the current climate they come over as zeitgeist chasers without much character.</p>
<p>The music of the past year or so has been hot for dark and moody sounds, from the fleeting pulses of the witch house craze to the dread-stoked, depressive underpinnings that pervade various electronic and R&amp;B offshoots. HTRK also seem to have noticed, inflecting their sound with creepy, crawling signifiers that feel currently cool or just past their expiration date. The crucial distinction is that HTRK have a noticeably minimal sound, funneling  their groaning and clanking through no wave and coldwave instead of the viscous twitch-and-bounce of witch house proper (though the drum  programming suggests the Three 6 Mafia presets came stock) or the lurid, lukewarm comeliness of jj or the xx (though both of these artists are good for a name-check at just about any moment on the album).</p>
<p>So needless to say, <i>Work</i> is heavy on atmosphere, and while  the attention paid to those aforementioned post punk totems could have set them apart (at times it feels as if HTRK could pull off a lounge-y  mix-up of Sade and Suicide), there simply isn't enough to sink your teeth into. Occasionally constructed of some interesting parts (the  processional G-funk organ squiggles on single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15968-eat-yr-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Eat Yr Heart</a>"", the pressure-crunched submarine hull moans of ""Slo Glo""), nothing seems properly supported. The music feels unappetizingly narcotized and drab,  not to mention uncomfortably claustrophobic despite all of the aimless sprawling and spreading the music does. The pair seems to have been so focused on  creating a mood that they forgot to attach any songs along the way.</p>
<p>Perhaps most anesthetizing of all is Standish, whose coquettish, layered vocals make all the chic disaffection feel even more purposefully (and problematically) clouded. There's nothing especially bad here, but once the smoke clears from their bland, bassed-out ambiance, HTRK are another band without a sound to call their own.</p></div>"|15776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15776-work-work-work/|5.7|Zach Kelly

After all, it's not every day that you find a record that simultaneously recalls the laid-back sprawl of Erykah Badu's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14095-new-amerykah-part-two-return-of-the-ankh/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return of the Ankh</i></a> and the bustling mania of Mouse on Mars' <i>Iaora Tahiti</i>, the slick jazz futurism of Herbie Hancock's <i>Headhunters</i> and the gentle homespun soul of Bill Withers' <i>Just As I Am</i>. This is the sort of densely layered, expertly played, genre-crossing marvel that could easily turn bloated or excessive, or come off like a display of pure skill with little heart behind it. But Stephen ""<a href=""http://thundercattheamazing.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thundercat</a>"" Bruner seems more interested in using his well-honed chops to turn out sunny (if bogglingly detailed) ear-candy than he is in crafting big statements (despite the album's portentous title).</p>
<p>Co-produced with Brainfeeder major domo (and Thundercat pal) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, <i>Apocalypse</i> has the digital sheen of many FlyLo productions. But Bruner’s experience as an in-demand rock and soul bassist gives the album a live band's freedom of movement, one that's closer to the fusion records that reared him than the sequenced rhythms that have come to define dance music, even at its most out-there. After a silly and nostalgia-inducing sample from the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088631/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1980s cartoon</a> that gave Bruner his pseudonym, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12222-daylight/"" target=""_blank"">Daylight</a>"" is the album's true opener, another in Brainfeeder’s line of shouldn't-work-but-does experimental beat confections. It merges the bustling energy of 21st-century left-field electronic music (crunchy mutant techno rhythms, a mix saturated with whimsical sound effects) with the floating-on-a-cloud airiness of 1970s soul (vaporous falsetto vocals, bright-but-wistful melodies). It really does feel like a long lost Mouse on Mars track, as if that most playful of German electronic acts had called up a member of the Soulquarians camp at the same time that Common decided to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwMoYKJr5nI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaborate with Stereolab</a>.</p>
<p>That's all a bit of bait-and-switch, though. There's no doubt plenty of Brainfeeder's psychedelic and IDM-like attention to sonic detail at various points on <i>Apocalypse</i>, along with nods to the fractured rhythms of London's broken beat scene and the earlier West Coast post-rap experimentation of Stones Throw. But like the latter L.A. pioneers, Thundercat takes avant electronic music's futuristic sound-sculpting and reconnects it with the history of African-American pop. He's particularly smitten with that moment in the 70s when soul music got looser and smoother and more electronic, and electric jazz started taming the wildness of improvisation with the slickness and structure of the pop song. Bruner's not beholden to the days of fusion past, of course. He takes detours into smoothly gliding 80s synth-funk (""Walkin'"") and queasy prog ambience (""Mystery Machine [The Golden Age of Apocalypse]""). But still, know that this is more of a jazz album than an electronic music album, and more of a soul album than either.</p>
<p>And it's on the third track, ""Fleer Ultra"", that Bruner's true loves finally leaps to the fore, because that's the first time the bass really goes bananas. Bruner is undoubtedly what was once called a ""musician's musician,"" a practice-space hound who reveres good playing. He's unashamed of his talent, but he also knows it's better put to use making hooks. And throughout <i>Apocalypse</i> it's Bruner’s exceptionally fluid bass work that ties together the new millennium computer madness and the cuts that feel like they could have been laid down in the analog days of 1974. Even the drowsiest songs here pop with super-animated basslines. His already justly lauded cover of George Duke’s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12206-for-love-i-come/"" target=""_blank"">For Love I Come</a>"" turns the tempo of the original down a few notches, letting most the of song play out as an amorphous but silky swirl of electric keyboard and his echo-warped voice-- he makes sure to bring out those bass chops for the climax. As a singer, Bruner is much better than he has to be, considering his musical inventiveness is already plenty attention-grabbing, but while his fluttery, heartsick vocals lend <i>Apocalypse</i> much of its charm and memorability, it's those basslines that are the real earworms.</p>
<p>So this isn't really a song album, at least not in the sense that it’ll give rock or even R&amp;B fans looking for verse-chorus-verse much to chew on. As with FlyLo, it's still best to approach <i>Apocalypse</i> as instrumental head-trip, albeit one that's occasionally got tunes you can hum. But like his fusion heroes, Bruner wants it all: the future shock of electronics, the tightly edited pleasures of pop, the love-sick opulence of quiet-storm soul, and the show-stopper instrumental breaks of jazz. The fact that he's mostly pulled it off, with a record that's serious in intent while playful in execution, is pretty astounding.</p></div>"|15758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15758-the-golden-age-of-apocalypse/|8.1|Jess Harvell

But Azari &amp; III's music fits in with a contemporary context more readily: They are pastiche artists. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules and Love Affair</a>, Azari &amp; III have become an album act who are occasional dancefloor producers, incorporating signifiers of a certain era-- in this case, late-1980s and early-90s house and rave music-- and tying them together with a distinctive production aesthetic and saleable personalities. In contrast with Hercules and Love Affair, Azari &amp; III's music moves the timeline forward, stretching into early-90s pop house and shifting the overarching sound from the sparser, restrained mastering of <span class=""st"">Andy </span>Butler and company into a harsher, big-room aesthetic with a technoid edge.</p>
<p>This approach to the past puts them firmly in the lineage of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>. Although the latter deal primarily with vocal-heavy 1980s funk and R&amp;B, Azari &amp; III have a similar sense of lighthearted irreverence balanced with a genuine interest in capturing the fun spirit of the source material, and their enthusiasm for camp can also be a hit or miss proposition. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6T3I_Zskfs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reckless (With Your Love)</a>""-- by far the greatest song Azari &amp; III have produced-- transcends its reference-heavy approach, establishing itself as an anthem for any generation. Its strength is in its contradictions: A muscular groove is at once assertive and vulnerable, a context at once hyper-specific (one can't help but envision the specter of AIDS in its thematic DNA) and universally immediate.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the bulk of the LP moves in a different direction. Rather than focus on pop-house, the group gestures toward the kinds of instrumental house and techno sounds that were big as the 90s began. The most successful of these instrumental moments front-load the LP: ""Tunnel Vision"" has a tense acid-house edge, and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14880-indigo/"" target=""_blank"">Indigo</a>"" feels like a euphoric journey into rave past. These tracks emulate the overall vibe of the era effectively, providing a guided tour through some of the music's more interesting aesthetic ideas.</p>
<p>The album's more forgettable tracks fill the album's second part: They might have been more effective if they'd lunged for the pop jugular. ""Infiniti""-- a spacey instrumental similar to those rediscovered, recreated, and re-edited throughout the past few years of cosmic disco revival-- does little to leave a mark. The same could be said for ""Change of Heart""'s well-executed dreaminess; it sounds nice while playing, but aside from retaining the overall production aesthetic, it doesn't cohere much. One exception is the maximal industrial cacophony of ""Undecided"", which is a decidedly unique look for the group. Its abrasive ambition recalls some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"" target=""_blank"">Basement Jaxx</a>'s more kitchen-sink productions.</p>
<p>Unlike ""Reckless (With Your Love)"", the group's second big single, ""Hungry for the Power"", shows the weakness of their methodology. There's a comical underpinning to the menace that feels a bit like playing early-90s pop radio dress-up. There's also a bit of an M.C. Escher quality to irreverence for music that was already irreverently dramatic. But it is still a fresh enough aesthetic move to feel novel now, and after the record's weaker second half, it's a refreshing move towards pop immediacy. Really, though, its the earlier track ""Lost in Time"" that best sums up the record's appeal-- on one level, it's about the dancefloor as an escape, while on another, it winks at the group's time travels.</p></div>"|15774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15774-azari-iii/|7.3|David Drake

The quartet-- split evenly between Washington, D.C. and Brooklyn-- leavened moody tunes about addiction and faith with dreamy sonics and a sweetly self-effacing sense of humor. On the album's redemptive, reverb-drenched climax, ""Get Your Shit Together for the Holidays"", they even managed to pull off some classic Christmas mixtape fare: ""Cheer up, take some medication/ Keep your shit together for a couple days,"" sang songwriter/guitarist Dan Scheuerman, offering warbly comfort to anybody who's had to scrub-up and head back home from a life where things aren’t exactly up to mom’s smell test.</p>
<p>Two years later, the follow up, <i>Young People's Church of the Air</i>, proves an even fuzzier-headed happening. It's a lyrically honest but sonically self-conscious record. Scheuerman lays out the bumps and bruises while the band obscures his confessions in a haze of white noise. Everything sounds faded, far away, and lightheaded. But, deep down beneath the digital grot, the album strikes an undeniably redemptive tone.</p>
<p>That said, it kicks off with a song about death, the rumbling, double-kick drum driven ""A Litany for Ms. T"". It's a song about making peace with the passing of friends and family off to what is, from Deleted Scenes' perspective, a better place. ""Hallelujah, I'm home,"" Scheuerman wails, just before the song explodes with woozy synthesizer samples in an indie rock approximation of absolution.</p>
<p><span>But the guy who needs the spiritual leg up may be Scheuerman himself. Even more than <i>Birdseed Shirt</i>, <i>Church of the Air</i> struggles with issues surrounding recovery. Drugs-- prescription or recreational-- are woven into the gauzy textures of the music as well as the lyrics. On ""Nassau"", </span>Scheuerman<span> wearily recalls an island vacation, singing, ""Got a long day to recall, the drug deal, the alcohol."" His childhood nostalgia isn't over the counter, either. On ""The Days of Adderall"" he yearns for adolescence, where the ADD medication is conflated with ""dad and mom, certainty.""</span></p>
<p>Though the subject matter is often highly personal, Deleted Scenes  never come off self-absorbed. Scheuerman has a gift for distilling  complex thoughts into everyday language. The narrative-- be it drugs,  god, love, or apocalypse-- is exotic, but comes off universal. On ""A Bunch of People Who Love You Like Crazy"", the narrator ponders a final ultimatum from his family, arriving at the conclusion, ""Nobody here is gonna get your back/ If you turn it down/ They want to see you on the ground."" It’s the album's noisiest turn, the words rendered nearly unrecognizable amidst churning digital distortion.</p>
<p>Not all of the material is dour. Many of <i>Church of the Air</i>'s most affecting moments are love songs. Scheuerman-- who addresses his then-fiancée, now wife, on “Bedbedbedbedbed""-- approaches intimacy with wide-eyed innocence, rather than syrupy sentimentality. ""Say please what are we gonna be, if it takes five minutes, waste five minutes with me,"" he sings on ""Burglarizing the Deaf"", convincing himself and his significant other to resist over-thinking things.</p>
<p>When the community that surrounded Dischord started to fade during the mid 2000s, D.C. hit a transitional moment. Outside of the hardcore and metal scenes, new groups started to look beyond the beltway for sonic cues. And mostly, they looked toward Brooklyn. Deleted Scenes did, too. On <i>Birdseed Shirt</i> it seemed like the beltway was still embedded into their DNA, from the off-kilter approach to rhythm (Q and Not U) to the self-effacing sense of humor and bendy hooks (the Dismemberment Plan).</p>
<p>On <i>Church of the Air</i>, the band gets some distance from its hometown-- amping up the atmosphere, playing pitch-shifted guitar arpeggios, and using a heavy-metal double kick to create stuttering rhythms. Sometimes, the heavily affected production of the Spinto Band frontman Nick Krill and longtime producer L. Skell can be off-putting, defusing what would otherwise be big, fist-pump moments. But mostly, <i>Church of the Air</i> squats a unique ground between pop and experimental impulses. It doesn't belong wholly to either world. It's an album that seeks to transcend ugliness, both personal and aural. More often than not, it succeeds on both counts.</p></div>"|15778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15778-deleted-scenes/|7.8|Aaron Leitko

Yuck’s songs, rooted in 1990s slackerisms, mostly coast by on a haze of fuzzy riffs and major keys. But despite those fun vibes there have been hints at another more pensive side to the band, particularly ""<a href=""http://vimeo.com/12365065"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Automatic</a>"", a cut released last year under the Yu(c)k banner. That alias has since been fleshed out and given the name Oupa, serving essentially as a side-project for Yuck bandleader Daniel Blumberg.</p>
<p>He strikes a different pose on <i>Forget</i>, planting mostly solo piano songs in an orb of bare, sensitive melancholy. At its best, as on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15525-forget/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, Blumberg shows he has an ear for a big ballad, cutting a tender and compelling figure backed by a sparse, percussive piano. Rather than telling a story, Blumberg uses disconnected snatches like ""I’ll be natural"" and ""She can’t forget me now"" to evoke the feeling of trying to recall a faded memory. The song ends up feeling bigger than its minimal parts, capturing a particular emotion and letting it hang in the air for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The problem in the context of the rest of the record is that the particular mood Blumberg captures so well on ""Forget"", or ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16209-windows/"" target=""_blank"">Windows</a>"" later on, is repeated over and over on the record and with very little extra instrumentation to hide behind-- save a few electronic touches on ""Waiting for the Car"" and ""New Home""-- the record becomes a bit of a drag. The slightly concealed narratives don't help either; with no big lyrical gut punches the emotional heft feels a bit too vague to really invest yourself in. The 10+ minutes of closing track ""Those Are the Senses"" epitomizes this, starting with a particularly cloying, wet chord progression and an obscured vocal. Those first few minutes are a chore, but the song eventually unravels quite nicely as layers of guitar and delay submerge the vocal and keys.</p>
<p>If nothing else <i>Forget</i> allows Blumberg to follow breadcrumb trails he might not get the chance to explore in Yuck, and even though the result is probably too overwrought and serious, it still feels like a worthwhile endeavor. Blumberg is obviously an exciting young songwriter, but it's hard not to feel that there are just too many other people doing the sensitive-songwriter thing in more inventive, resonant ways right now for Oupa to truly stand out on its own.</p></div>"|15765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15765-forget/|6.3|Hari Ashurst

Scuzzbucket strum and teenage truth will always fare far better as short, sharp shocks; then as now, the impact of a song like the Seeds' mighty ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ASjq7iaDQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pushin' Too Hard</a>"" is dulled by the half-dozen soundalikes on the LP from whence it came. Good as many of them are, that this new crop has yet to produce a truly classic LP isn't terribly surprising-- the song's the thing, cohesion's almost antithetical. So it is with Floridian up-and-comers <a href=""http://jacuzziboys.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jacuzzi Boys</a>' sophomore set, <i>Glazin'</i>: five fine 45s masquerading as a fun, slight 10-song LP.</p>
<p>Between their sweetly shopworn lyrics, their not-quite-frenetic pacing, and all those ooh-augmented choruses, there's nothing new under the <i>Glazin'</i> sun. The Boys have settled down some since their last LP, 2009's <i>No Seasons</i>: volumes mostly steer clear of the red zone; the songcraft's less rollicking, more measured; and the occasional glint of pop sheen flickers at its surface. Singer/guitarist Gabriel Alcala's maintained the snide edge in his voice, but he doesn't have the fire in his belly he did a couple of years ago. At this point, these teenaged kicks of their work feel less lived than lived-in, lacking the manic edge and the neuron-branding melodies of the genre's leading lights. The songs go down easy but, with a few exceptions, leave little aftertaste. When you're constantly flipping a 45, that's a good problem to have; when you're talking an LP-- even a shortie like <i>Glazin</i>'-- the amnesiac feel foregrounds what's lacking.</p>
<p>Opener ""Vizcaya"" is a blast, a rallying cry of ascending melody and youthful insouciance that gets it done in record time. And the one-two punch of closers ""Los Angeles"" and ""Koo Koo With You""-- the first, a half-affectionate, half-dismissive take on left coast life, and the second, a shapeshifting half-nonsensical come-on-- are far and away the album's best. Brimming with personality and oddly pitched humor, they're really the only tracks on <i>Glazin'</i> that don't sound like covers of songs you can't quite place. (They would've made for a killer single.) Elsewhere, ""Silver Spheres"" throws a little Detroit thunder in there to fine effect, and the bouncy ""Libras and Zebras"" feels especially effortless. As for the rest? Carefully crafted, smartly executed, and  reasonably lively garage-rock that's all just a little too on-the-nose to inspire much beyond agreeable indifference.</p>
<p>In an era when the surfeit of garage-rock bands need to push personality and melody harder than ever, <i>Glazin</i>'s got a bit of both, an abundance of neither. The beefy but slightly sterile production buffs out some of the gnarl of their earlier work, which doesn't do them many favors. And the once-raucous band's performances seem a bit reeled in, too. More than anything, though, <i>Glazin</i>'s sneer'n'strut is just too much of a pretty good thing: One or two at a time, these songs work wonders, but over half an hour, the Boys' retrograde sneer and strut proves a bit too safe and samey.</p></div>"|15775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15775-jacuzzi-boys-glazin/|6.2|Paul Thompson

That 1999 set is justifiably viewed as a watershed-- it brought the Magnetic Fields a much larger audience-- but it's also slightly overrated, unfairly eclipsing his smaller, darker, especially affecting earlier work. Outside 2004's underwhelming ""me""-centric <i>i</i>, Merritt is  strongest when he has precise space limits and when he's applying his volumes of ideas to intimate, less showy canvases. Think of the 10 lonesome road songs populating 1994's excellent <i>The Charm of the Highway Strip</i>. Or, more than a decade later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11049-distortion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Distortion</i></a>'s take on Jesus and Mary Chain-style fuzz. His deep baritone was made for the stage, but it does something special when coming quietly through an old cassette player, a crackling turntable, or a pair of well-worn headphones.</p>
<p>Plus, the frames aren't always necessary: Merritt's aesthetic is distinctive enough that songs that aren't connected with a conceptual thread still sound like chapters in a larger book-- or, better yet, a diary. See, for instance, <i>Obscurities</i>, the Merge-imprinted collection of odds, ends, side projects, and B-sides. It features material recorded prior to <i>69 Love Songs</i>-- much of it Merge-associated-- from 1991's Susan Anway-sung synthesized pastoral <i>Distant Plastic Trees</i> to 1995's <i>Get Lost</i>. The compilation is attributed to Merritt, not the Magnetic Fields-- it features work from a variety of monikers (the 6ths, Gothic Archies, Buffalo Rome), and he's the only constant. But the 14 tracks, pulled together from all corners, come together like a lost Magnetic Fields studio album from the early golden era, not an after-the-fact miscellany.</p>
<p>Longtime fans will likely be interested in <i>Obscurities</i> for the previously unreleased material. The set has three songs from the <i>Song From Venus</i> era, the unfinished sci-fi musical Merritt was writing with Lemony Snicket (""Forever and a Day"", ""The Song From Venus"", and ""When You're Young and in Love""), a lovely, dour unused <i>69 Love Songs</i> outtake ""The Sun and the Sea and the Sky"", and the self-described ""heavy metal"" curiosity ""Scream (Till You Make the Scene)"". But it's the old, partially forgotten favorites that give <i>Obscurities</i> its heart. It feels like tracks were selected based on tone and narrative arc, not availability-- they're sequenced by sound rather than year or affiliation.</p>
<p>Because memory's imperfect, it's occasionally difficult to tell if you're hearing the original version or a different take, forcing you to pull out those old records and check. The way <i>Obscurities</i> is arranged, you only get two ""new"" songs in a row once, so these ""a-ha"" moments keep popping up, the first via the ambling, Cure-inspired homemade new wave of ""Rats in the Garbage of the Western World"" the B-Side to 1995's ""All the Umbrellas in London"" single. It's followed by the lush, busy 1998 7"" version of ""I Don't Believe You"", a driving track that's recast on <i>i</i>. You also get the quirky kitchen sink ballad ""When I'm Not Looking, You're Not There"" from that same single. Later its the rollicking ""Beach-a-Boop-Boop"", a spry B-Side from Harriet Records' 1993 ""Long Vermont Roads"" single.</p>
<p>It's great to hear early Magnetic Fields vocalist Susan Anway emerge from the shadows. She leaves her mark on ""Take Ecstasy With Me"", the classic Merritt love song that closes 1994's <i>Holiday</i>. As far as other singers, we hear Shirley Simms doing an alternate, quieter, less countrified spin on <i>Distant Plastic Trees</i>' ""Plant White Roses"". Merritt sang a version on Merge's 1994 <i>Rows of Teeth</i> compilation, but this take is better. There's also Young Marble Giants' Stuart Moxham on ""Yet Another Girl"", the upbeat, but moody pop song from the 6ths <i>Wasps' Nests</i>. The 6ths are famously known as Merritt's rotating-vocalist project, but he handles things himself on ""Rot in the Sun"", the crooning B-side to 1993's ""Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket"".</p>
<p><i>Obscurities</i> ends with ""You Are Not My Mother and I Want to Go Home"", a song you'll also find on the audio book for Neil Gaiman's horror/fantasy novella <i>Coraline</i>. Merritt later wrote an Off-Broadway musical for the young-adult book, but you're left with a crisper, sharper impression hearing this one swirling, 3-minute bit of outer-space exploration. <i>Obscurities</i> itself is over in less than 40 minutes: It's understated, personal, insular, oddball, and often gorgeous, an unexpectedly coherent collection from an important band.</p></div>"|15773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15773-obscurities/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

No shit, right? It's a point worth repeating because not only is it the most important thing about <i>I'm With You</i>, it's the <i>only </i>important thing about <i>I'm With You</i>. None of the actively recording Peppers-level elite-- not Metallica, not Coldplay, not U2, not Green Day-- have been more consistently and richly rewarded for simply showing up and being themselves. Since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6709-californication/"" target=""_blank"">Californication</a> </i>kickstarted a second sustained run of monster popularity, the Peppers have not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5250-st-anger/"" target=""_blank"">bitterly divided their fanbase over the way their drums were recorded</a>, nor have they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11621-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends/"" target=""_blank"">gone outside their inner circle for a bold sonic reconstruction</a>. None of their albums were <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12730-no-line-on-the-horizon/"" target=""_blank"">considered kinda hitless duds</a>, and even their samey double-LP wasn't scoffed at as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13045-21st-century-breakdown/"" target=""_blank"">ambitious but more of the same</a>. They've released nearly identical, bittersweet songs about California, sex, and, increasingly, nothing. These songs chart the same and appear on albums that perform nearly identically. All the while, the band continues to sell a ton of copies as the rest of us openly mock Anthony Kiedis (simply by quoting Anthony Kiedis) and find some nice things to say about John Frusciante.</p>
<p>But <i>I'm With You </i>is their first record without Frusciante since 1995's turgid, Dave Navarro-helmed <i>One Hot Minute</i>. A former tour understudy for Frusciante, new axeman Josh Klinghoffer blends in with a slightly more textural and less chopsy style, and he thankfully doesn't impose his will on the Peppers like the glam-metal narcissist Navarro did. But in the grand scheme of things, it means nothing. Tremendously dumb lead single ""The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie"" picks up where prior tremendously dumb lead single ""Dani California"" left off-- which is to say, totally within PeppersWorld, a place where an incorporeal female is a prop for Kiedis to drop happy-go-lucky jewels about cockblocking, rockin' like the 1980s, and god knows what else. Over the past decade, the band's had incredible instincts about their choice of singles, the deep cuts rightfully forgotten by all but the dieheards. But while ""Maggie"" is by a large measure the worst thing here, it foreshadows <i>I'm With You</i>'s paucity of overtly choice options, ""good Chili Peppers"" and ""bad Chili Peppers"" coming ever closer to a horizon point.</p>
<p>More than ever, three extremely talented musicians are all in servitude to Kiedis, the single most irreplaceable frontman in rock history: Seriously, there are plenty of singers who can do a passable Bono or Ozzy or Robert Plant in a pinch, but who's fuckin' with Kiedis' sixteens? Granted, they've never been a source of much food for thought, but at least it worked when the band appeared to be riffing from the reptile brain that craved women, drugs, and party plans, ""uplift mofo"" or otherwise. Here, unless Kiedis is being totally explicit about his subject matter (""Annie Wants a Baby"", ""Police Station""), <i>I'm With You </i>is simply a continuously futile pursuit to figure out what the fuck he's actually talking about.</p>
<p>On ""Factory of Faith"", spiritual intransigence is described as such: ""All my life, I was swingin' for the fence/ Always lookin' for the triple/ Never playing good defense."" Then, before you know it, he's quoting Dirk Diggler (""feast on this""). He falls in love with a stripper on ""Look Around"", explaining ""Hustle here/ Hustle there/ Hustle me bitch and you best beware/ It's <i>emotional</i>/ And I <i>told you so.</i>"" (This is before Fayetteville-- North Carolina? Arkansas?-- gets a shout out… because it rhymes with ""say it will."") The tricky funk rhythm of ""Ethiopia"" stoically withstands Kiedis singing a scat version of ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"", while on ""Even You Brutus?"" he yawps like David Byrne and courts a young lady by namedropping Steve Miller and Stevie Wonder in the span of fifteen seconds.</p>
<p>Thing is, he can shut off that Funky Monk mode in time for the choruses, and if <i>I'm With You </i>proves anything for the Peppers, it's that a one-step solution to making this a better, even enjoyable record is to cut out the verses entirely. Sounds like a good enough idea, but it'd only make it more obvious that they've been writing minor variations of the same exact (admittedly effective) chorus for the past decade: four repeating chords boxing in Kiedis' maxed-out soul croon as Flea and Chad Smith dutifully swing, wondering when they'll finally have a chance to let loose. (When they do during the frenetic coda of ""Brendan's Death Song"", it's a damn revelation.)</p>
<p>Some of us will be making “Sir Psycho Sexy” jokes to our grave, but many still have a soft spot for the wild abandon of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik </i>because it found space for rock songs that rocked, funk songs that were funky, and ballads that were truly affecting. But they've become so stuck in their Peppers-Mk-II ways that 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6710-stadium-arcadium/"" target=""_blank"">Stadium Arcadium</a> </i>turned out to be possibly the least adventurous double album ever, and <i>I'm With You </i>does even less to pursue sonic diversity<i>. </i>Much of the blame lies with Rick Rubin: As with <i>Stadium </i>and 2002's <i>By the Way</i>, he produces <i>I'm With You</i> entirely without nuance or dynamics. Whether it's the midtempo acoustic ballads (""Brendan's Death Song""), the midtempo piano masher (""Happiness Loves Company""), or the midtempo rockers (nearly everything else), they're all equally loud and flat. As a result, the sequencing of the 14 tracks feels arbitrary, the hour-long runtime intentionally superfluous: It feels as if even they don't think anyone will play this in its intended order after the first listen.</p>
<p>As far as arena-dominating radio rock goes, you could do worse: Even as they soften in old age, the Peppers can still remind you that a lot of people discovered Gang of Four, the Minutemen, and George Clinton through them. And occasionally, the punk-funk still rings true: I'd love to see an intrepid mashup junkie lay Luke Jenner's vocals from <i>In the Grace of Your Love </i>over these instrumentals and vice versa. After all, Flea sounded great in Thom Yorke's <a href=""http://atomsforpeace.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atoms For Peace</a> project while actually playing <i>more </i>slap-bass than he does here, and we learned from John Frusciante's troubled but occasionally fascinating solo albums that these guys would probably be far more interesting outside the scope of their main gig. Until then, <i>I'm With You</i>'s hip thrusts and gyrations simply go through the motions, the work of a band with all kinds of capital to blow but no incentive to do anything differently. After all, it's a Red Hot Chili Peppers album.</p></div>"|15761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15761-im-with-you/|4.0|Ian Cohen

But if you gaze back a little further, Jesse Lortz's obsession with pistols, poisons, drownings, and all-consuming spiritual darkness is part of a great tradition; the <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i> has a notoriously high body count. Even though nobody dies during <i>The Night</i>, it flickers with a constant barrage of unsettling images: knives being sharpened on hearts, blood mixing with saliva mid-kiss, and an address to a lover that begins, ""You lifted up your skirt and took a piss right in the street/ You shook it off your thigh and your eyes said, 'I know you're watching.'"" And that's the<i> love </i>song on the record.</p>
<p>None of this macabre humor should come as a huge surprise to those familiar with Lortz's old band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9212-the-dutchess-and-the-duke/"" target=""_blank"">the Dutchess and the Duke</a>-- especially if you've seen the video for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_GBnk45IYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mary</a>"", at the end of which he and bandmate Kimberly Morrison become rather gleeful-looking cannibals. After the Seattle duo's 2010 break-up, Lortz's first solo effort under the name Case Studies is unremittingly bleak. As far as contemporary kindred spirits go, Lortz's human-sized expressions of cosmic loneliness call to mind Bill Callahan's recent <i>Apocalypse</i>, while his penchant for raw, naturalistic guitar tones evoke the Tallest Man on Earth. Lortz is blessed with neither Callahan's God-sized baritone nor Kristian Matsson's ambulance siren bleat, but what he lacks in an immediately identifiable vocal signature he makes up for with the distinctness of his sparse, evocative songwriting.</p>
<p>Right from the start, <i>The Night</i> is a portrait of people's fumbles toward connection. (Spoiler, though all the minor chords provide some clues: they are often totally futile.) Quietly haunting opener ""From the Blade of My Love"" begins with an image of Lortz awake and restless while the girl beside him sleeps contentedly-- the first suggestion of the insurmountable chasm that's sprung up between them. Things go from bad to worse on the terrific post-break-up ballad ""My Silver Hand"", on which he confesses, ""I'd like to still be in your bed/ But I would settle for your life instead,"" with the shattering plaintiveness of somebody who knows that even the lesser of those two things probably won't happen. Beneath Lortz's pleas, a backing female vocalist provides tepid consolation with a few ""la-la-la""s, but she even sounds chillingly distant, as though she's singing from another room.</p>
<p><i>The World is Just a Shape to Fill the Night</i> is preoccupied with both the surface of things and the ugly disorder that lurks beneath them. On ""From the Blade of My Love"", the smoothness of his lover's skin belies the ""war inside raging,"" while the electric twang of ""Lies"" spells out a lengthy itemized list of things you're better off never bothering to ask your lover (""How many days will I love you?"" ""Will I ever hurt you again?"") because the truth deep down ""will only make you cry."" But believe it or not, there's respite-- of sorts. After the slight lag of ""California Ghost Story"", the closer ""The Day We Met""-- a starkly recorded guitar and vocal track-- is  a dark and strangely tender love story between two outsiders that ends with this pontification: ""It's the way of the world/ People come, people go/ People mark each other up and sometimes get to love awhile."" Which, coming off the weighty darkness of the previous 10 tracks, doesn't sound like such a bad fate after all.</p>
<p><i>The Night</i> was recorded by Greg Ashley of the psych rock band Gris Gris, and he and Lortz are certainly not the first 21st-century folkies who have tried to conjure the ghosts of Harry Smith's America. But the textured and purposefully naturalistic production on <i>The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night</i> never feels like an affect; it's a fitting sonic reinforcement for the record's musings on detachment, distance and isolation. <i>The Night</i> is a record uncomfortable with all the trappings of the corporeal world-- time, words, its own skin-- and occasionally, improbably, it actually breaks free of them all.</p></div>"|15764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15764-the-world-is-just-a-shape-to-fill-the-night/|7.3|Lindsay Zoladz

Between their duo <a href=""http://quietevenings.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quiet Evenings</a>, Grant's <a href=""http://novascotianarms.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nova Scotian Arms</a>, and Rachel's  <a href=""http://motionsicknessoftimetravel.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Motion Sickness of Time Travel</a>, they've spun reams of drone, mostly on small-run cassettes and CD-Rs. Of the three projects, MSOTT leans most toward song-like structures.</p>
<p>Though her work is often meditative and abstract, filled with busy synths and widescreen reverb, Evans has a knack for shaping subtle rhythms, slow crescendos, and the wordless phrasings of her own voice.  That voice is more prominent than ever before on <i>Luminaries &amp; Synastry</i>, the best MSOTT effort to date. It's not quite right to say Evans' singing is the center of these songs-- each piece is too unified to let any element dominate. But there's something uncanny about the way her voice melts with her drifting tones, as if it's both responding to the music and spawning it. (That effect is mirrored in the fluid visual montages Evans made for ""<a href=""http://vimeo.com/25482530"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Day Glow</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://vimeo.com/26324567"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Late Day Sun Silhouettes</a>""). Such circular motion produces the feel of a sonic Möbius strip, with each song looping in on itself until time seems to stand still.</p>
<p>This illusion of timelessness might suggest that the name Motion Sickness of Time Travel (taken from William Burroughs' novel <i>The Soft Machine</i>) is inappropriate, but in fact it's quite apt. Though her soothing atmospheres are never exactly queasy, Evans' way of making time elastic-- unpredictably stretching and shrinking it-- produces a kind of mesmerizing disorientation. Often it feels like she's re-enacting the fuzzy, time-defying boundary between consciousness and sleep: Drift into her music, and you might feel like you’re drowsily blinking to make out figures in the dark, or waking from a nap-long dream that seemed to last a day.</p>
<p>Which might be why, despite being relatively short for drone pieces, the songs on <i>Luminaries &amp; Synastry</i> feel as long and developed as those of any previous MSOTT work. So a track like ""<a href=""http://digitalisrecordings.bandcamp.com/track/ascendant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ascendant</a>"", with its misty tones that cast even dewier shadows, can come as close to infinity in six minutes as, say, Spacemen 3's epic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7-61FEHhAA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music</a>"" can in 45. It might seem like a stretch to place MSOTT in such lofty company so soon, but <i>Luminaries &amp; Synastry</i> sounds ready and willing to stand the test of timelessness Evans made for it.</p></div>"|15777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15777-luminaries-synastry/|7.8|Marc Masters

Quite a bit, actually: his name (from TRG to Cosmin TRG), his home base (from Romania to Berlin), his label(s), and most notably, his sound. Since 2007, his run of singles for A-list labels like Hessle Audio, Hotflush, Tempa, and Rush Hour has made it impossible to pin him to a specific scene or style. This isn't a sin in and of itself, but amidst the shifting sands of electronic music, it's helpful to have reference points: ""Aphex Twin makes IDM"" is easy to remember, and even if it's only partly true, it's simpler to sort the details out later. Cosmin's constant shapeshifting has made it difficult to identify him with a scene or sound, and his career has seemed diffuse as a result.</p>
<p>The first time I heard Nicolae's debut full-length, <i>Simulat</i>, I gave myself a signpost: dubstep. Nicolae's label history warranted the nonchalant tagging, and, moreover, the album's thickly dug bass grooves were what stuck with me. Nicolae, perpetually in motion, is exactly the type of artist who makes these quick-hit bindings unwise. <i>Simulat</i> certainly borrows the rich, tonal bass of dubstep-- as well as its tendency to drift off when not explicitly pushing forward-- but its grooves are more straightforward, shuffling instead of circling, the work of an artist who has internalized the narratives of modern dance without bending to them. Nicolae instead looks to the recent history of Berlin techno-- Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock-- and further back to Detroit-- Robert Hood and especially Richie Hawtin-- for <i>Simulat</i>'s roadmap.</p>
<p>What this means: linear grooves, prickly synth arpeggios, and sweeping strings/organs or fake-strings/fake-organs. Never a producer of marathon tracks, Nicolae is smart to keep his compositions in the manageable 4-to-5-minute range: <i>Simulat</i> clocks in at a lean, replayable 47 minutes. He stitches it together with moments of meditation and calm, his keyboards seeping through the floorboards to inhabit ghostlier environs and tempos.  I like tracks like ""Want You to Be"" and ""Form Over Function"" most: They offer easy-to-tap rhythms and mallet-simple keyboard thwacks, manageable menace that makes me want to bob and weave in my headphones instead of sinking into them. The album's lead single ""Fizic"" gallops along on the type of UFO-on-cruise-control futurism Juan Atkins pioneered.</p>
<p>Nicolae's tracks don't evolve, so much; they arrive, mature quickly, and exit. <i>Simulat</i> is an album concerned with suggested mood instead of sustained groove, but it uses the building blocks of rhythm-- four-on-the-floor drum kicks, bass pulses-- to construct those moods. At his best Nicolae offers the dystopic vistas of techno with an off-center hint of warmth: I've never really wanted to dance to a Plastikman track, but I find it hard to sit still during ""Ritmat""'s tricky home-appliance palpitations. This distinguishes <i>Simulat</i> from a legion of too-serious Berlin techno stalwarts and renders snap judgments about Nicolae's present-- or future-- silly.</p></div>"|15772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15772-simulat/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

Some slot machines at a racetrack in Delaware stopped working, and a little after midnight, an alarm at a nuclear power plant in Onagawa, Japan went off in the dark.</p>
<p>I remember how in 1999 <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/grandaddy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grandaddy</a> were like a lot of other decent underdog indie bands that I had an indefensible soft spot for: mopey and withdrawn, with a few mixtape-worthy songs. Then they released <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> in early 2000, and all of a sudden they sounded like they had a particular perspective, a particular <i>substance</i>. Their gift is that they still managed to sound insubstantial. The sadness that sounded like passivity on 1997's <i>Under the Western Freeway</i> turned into philosophy on <i>The Sophtware Slump</i>: nonchalance as a way of isolating yourself from what bothers you. Not that <i>The Sophtware Slump </i>is in any way major-- being major is the work of <i>artistes</i>, and part of Grandaddy's appeal was that they just seemed like low-key guys from central California tooling around in the basement.</p>
<p>Most of the album sounds like countryish Neil Young songs coated in synthesizer gloss-- a style that borrows a little of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVi0UvFu8Yo&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young's  earthy tenderness</a>, a little of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egS5AjIZbzo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pavement's studied indifference</a>, and a little of the switched-on melancholy of an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRJQLzc-bco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ELO ballad</a>. They sang about national forests filled with broken appliances and robot friends who woke up drunk in parks. The text on the cover of the CD booklet was spelled out in letters from an old PC keyboard over a grassy meadow with mountains in the background. Flip through to the last page, and you'll see a cowboy walking into the sunset with a Casio under his arm.</p>
<p>Basically, <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> is the point where the deflated myth of the American West met the deflated myth of technological salvation. The fear isn't that computers would destroy us, it's that we'd end up living in a futuristic world but still have the same old problems. It's like how David Bowie released ""Space Oddity"" 10 days before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon: Somehow, he knew people would get lonely up there, because people get lonely no matter where they go. If Radiohead captured a feeling of pre-millenial tension, <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> captured the feeling of disappointment that came afterward-- the feeling that life was going to be more or less the same as it had been, only now we'd have to live with the fact that we once thought it'd be so different: the feeling of January 2, 2000.</p>
<p>At the time, Grandaddy weren't the only band that played sparkly, cinematic indie music: Mercury Rev's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Deserter</i>'<i>s Songs</i></a> had come out in 1998, and the Flaming Lips' <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> came out in 1999. The difference is in both scale and character: Unlike the Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev, Grandaddy were a five-person band that sounded like five people playing together in a room, not five people using the studio to make the sound of a hundred. Even when they use synthesizers to replicate orchestral instruments, it has a miniaturistic quality, like the grandeur of early Hollywood trapped inside a snowglobe.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the album is just as contained. Instead of singing about the grand and tearful breakup between man and nature, Jason Lytle sings about wanting to lie down and sleep under a single tree. Fluffy, abstract lyrics like, ""I dream at night of going home some day,"" are grounded by concrete ones: ""Tire scraps on federal roads look like crash-landed crows,"" a metaphor that uses one tactile, breakable thing to describe another.</p>
<p>Does the album sound quaint now? Sure. It sounded quaint then, too. Grandaddy's image-- crunchy guys with trucker hats and beards-- was instantly rustic. Their sound was irrelevant. Blowing minds and challenging conventions takes hard work and ego, and Grandaddy never seemed like they had a real capacity for either. But being as essentially easygoing as they are is also what makes all the thematic material here so approachable, if you buy into it at all: Most of the time, it just doesn't sound like they're trying to prove a point-- a sense of modesty that made them feel more seductive and appealing to me than artists who showed up with grand statement in hand.</p>
<p>It's funny to me that this album is being given the deluxe reissue treatment only 10 years after first being released, but I guess nostalgia is kicking in sooner these days. <i>Deserter</i>'<i>s Songs</i> was reissued recently too, along with records by Sebadoh and Archers of Loaf-- records that don't feel like they were gone all that long. The sound is clearer and better delineated here than it was on the initial release, and the bonus material-- which includes demos and a couple of EPs released around the same time-- is interesting to listen to once or twice but never gives me the feeling that they could've made <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> any more focused and consistent than it is.</p>
<p>And sad, too. What a sad, sad album. There's not a happy song on it, really. But there's no angst or despair either, because angst and despair are exhausting emotions. Most of the time, Lytle sounds like the archetypal 90s slacker: observant, slow-moving, dulled by a suburban kind of pain he can't shake. Beck in 1994, without panache or a flair for Art. Beck comes up once, actually, in ""Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)"", a lyric supposedly written by their robot friend, Jed: ""I try to sing it funny like Beck/ But it's bringin' me down."" Cheer up: It didn't get better, but it didn't get much worse, either.</p></div>"|15723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15723-the-sophtware-slump/|8.5|Mike Powell

It's the first utter non-release K.R.I.T. has allowed his name to touch in a career otherwise built on  stringent quality control. His handsome, still-resonant full-length mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15312-return-of-4eva/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return of 4eva</i></a> came out just last April, and his high-profile Def Jam debut <i>Live From the Underground</i> lies just around the corner.  <i>God</i>'<i>s Machine</i> adds almost nothing worthwhile to this conversation, except to introduce the first noticeable wobble in what has otherwise been a flawless slow-burn brand-building campaign.</p>
<p>Worse, the mixtape presents K.R.I.T. in his weakest, most anonymous light: as a rapper on other people's songs. While he's ferociously talented, K.R.I.T. just isn't the type of rapper to muscle his way aggressively into another rapper's universe: he's best left to himself, where he can settle into a rich background of his own nostalgia-steeped production like sitting back in a rocking chair. <i>God</i>'<i>s Machine</i> paints him, unfairly, as just another serviceable, UGK-biting rapper currently clogging up Southern rap-blog feeds. The song choices are mystifying: no one in the world needed to hear K.R.I.T.'s tacked-on verse to Berner's ""Yoko"", rapping alongside Chris Brown, but here it is. No one needed to hear him sharing air time with Cyhi Da Prince. But here that is too (""Hometeam"").</p>
<p>There are a few genuine sparklers strewn throughout-- ""Fulla Shit"", a perverse boasting session with Yelawolf and fellow trailer-trash white speed-rapper Rittz, is one of the year's most satisfying rap songs.  K.R.I.T. acquits himself admirably while still, lamentably, getting out-shined by the flamboyant personalities flanking him. The same goes for the chunky rap-rock crossover number ""Born on the Block""-- after Killer Mike lays waste to the track, there's not much left for K.R.I.T. to do but show up and stay in the pocket. The humidly bluesy ""The Big Payback"", which opens the mixtape, is the most characteristically K.R.I.T. thing here, consisting of nothing but K.R.I.T.'s agreeably platitudinous raps laid over electric organ and some looped voices. It's over in less than two minutes, but it's the most reassuring reminder of his artistic imprint to be found on <i>God</i>'<i>s Machine</i>.</p>
<p>On ""The Big Payback"", K.R.I.T. self-importantly reminds us that his name  is an acronym for ""King Remembered In Time."" The name doesn't jibe --  there's nothing particularly pharaonic about his presence-- but  the touch of self-mythology  is a reminder of the fascinating transition  K.R.I.T. is undergoing. Over the past year or so, he has been slowly  embracing his role as the savior of the conscious-rap underground. It  shows signs of suiting him nicely, but the transformation has been  fitful: on <i>Return of 4eva</i>,  generic country-rap-tune bangers about candy paint and mentions of  pimping split time awkwardly with powerful, impassioned treatises like  ""Another Naive Individual Glorifying Greed and Encouraging Racism"". The  impression was of an artist stranded in uncertainly between the UGK  revivalism he started with and the early-era Common figure he might become. A  more combustible on-record personality might be able to fuse  these strands, but K.R.I.T., an affable, low-key guy, mostly sounds  confused. <i>God</i>'<i>s Machine</i> feels like a symptom of that confusion, which will hopefully clear up in time for <i>Live From the Underground</i>'s main event.</p></div>"|15763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15763-the-last-king-2-gods-machine/|6.4|Jayson Greene

They were leaders with, at first, few followers. But as anticon.'s own recombinant styles began to calcify-- as Why? became more of a straightforward indie rock band, say, or Themselves increasingly spiraled up their own archly-inflected, hyper-syllabic ass-- the label began to seem less like leaders and more like merely idiosyncratic outliers.</p>
<p>Even as one of anticon.'s founding members, <a href=""http://www.anticon.com/index.php?section=artist&amp;target=Alias&amp;js=yes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alias</a> has always maintained a decidedly low profile on the adventurous label: just a guy and his drum machines holed up in the home studio in Maine. And that's not only compared to big personality MCs like Doseone or Why?'s Yoni Wolf, but even to other in-house producers, such as the relatively flash, TV Carnage-abetted analog screwball Tobacco. Alias seems to relish a certain hermitic anonymity-- right down to the blank-faced moniker-- and it's an attitude reflected in his beats: moody, introspective tracks whose athletic drumming and melancholy melodies make for heavy head-nodders but that can begin to feel a bit faceless.</p>
<p>Latest album <i>Fever Dream</i> aims to disrupt Alias' comfortable patterns as a producer-- the one sheet talks of being ""reborn""-- but it doesn't succeed in making the artist any more familiar, and the change of course feels less like a visionary renewal than it does a well-played catch-up. From the first beat drop, <i>Fever Dream</i> is obviously informed by the vaporized, off-kilter instrumentals of Flying Lotus and likeminded contemporaries: beats shuffle and scatter, bass hits low and leaves space in its wake, samples hiss and dissipate like the air is being sucked out of them, synth lines falter and wobble. This is most true of the album’s opening tracks ""Goinswimmin"" and ""Wanna Let it Go"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Deeper into the album, amidst the adaptation, Alias teases out some of his typically thick grooves and understated but staying melodies-- culminating with the one-two combination of the in-the-pocket acoustic drum break that lights up the latter half of ""Dahorses"" and gives way to the dreamy ""la-di-da"" vocal echoes of ""Lady Lambin'"". Elsewhere, and to lesser effect, Alias calls in fellow anticon. collaborators Why? (whose starring turn in ""Well Water Black"" gave 2008 LP <i>Resurgam</i> an unlikely single) and Subtle's Dax Pierson. The former contributes a stretched, monosyllabic nasal wail to the chunky beat routine of ""Boom Boom Boom"", while Pierson plays keys and sings lead on the bloodless R&amp;B drift of ""Talk in Technicolor"".</p>
<p>So, no, <i>Fever Dream</i>'s new direction doesn't quite recapture the genre-dissolving days of anticon.'s youth or remake Alias into a soon-to-be household name. It does, however, stand as another fine, frequently very satisfying effort from a dependable producer and deft beat-maker.</p></div>"|15721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15721-fever-dream/|7.2|Eric Grandy

Before the disease grows worse, he decided to record one final album and launch one final tour, and while most celebrity retirements seem suspect (ahem, Jay-Z, Patrick Wolf, Ryan Adams, and on and on), this one really does feel permanent, which is tragic. Campbell has had one of those impossible careers that sound more like the stuff of outrageous fiction than rock biography: An Arkansas native and music prodigy of sorts, he moved to L.A. and played in a band called the Champs (Tequila!) and worked as a member of the infamous Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians who backed Elvis Presley and Simon &amp; Garfunkel and played on Phil Spector's infamous wall-of-sound recordings. That's him laying down licks on <i>Pet Sounds</i>, while he was a touring Beach Boy. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, he scored huge hits with ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" (both by Jimmy Webb, long overdue for a retrospective). Often dismissed as a practitioner of slick country-pop, he favored florid strings, stately vocals, and an interpretive approach most likely informed by his experience as a sideman. ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" pretty much sums up the contradictions of his music, which is simultaneously country but urbane, slick but still soulful.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he was a Nashville outsider but not a Nashville outlaw, <i>Ghost on the Canvas</i> sidesteps all the current conventions of country farewell albums, a growing subgenre that found its apotheosis in Johnny Cash's later recordings and Kris Kristofferson's recent pair of affairs-settling records. This is no tastefully solemn acoustic affair, with a hushed tone communicating a kind of easy-read mortal gravity. Instead, Campbell conveys a certain nostalgia for that defining sound of his prime-- or at least a nostalgia for a time when that sound was popular. ""It's Your Amazing Grace"" and ""A Thousand Lifetimes"" deploy the same tricks he's been using for decades-- those ornate string arrangements and prominent guitar themes that recall fellow Wrecking Crew member Jack Nitzsche-- but they sound fresh on these tracks, even at times adventurous. The short, instrumental interstitials are distracting as Campbell tries to cover every corner of his history, but the the presence of Billy Corgan, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, and all the Dandy Warhols on <i>Ghost</i> suggests that the influence of this style has been, at the very least, broad.</p>
<p>Campbell is still taking stock of his life and career (""Sometimes I get confused, Lord/ My past gets in my way""), and that sounds odd only because it's not something he has not historically been inclined to do: He's more renowned as a sensitive vocalist than as a confessional songwriter. So songs like ""A Better Place"" and ""There's No Me… Without You"", both co-penned with producer Julian Raymond, sound perhaps a bit too direct for Campbell, although his voice remains strong enough that he doesn't need your pity to put these songs across, no matter how silly some of their sentiments. Anchoring <i>Ghost </i>is a handful of covers that are perhaps only slightly less adventurous than those on his 2008 album, <i>Meet Glen Campbell</i>. The title track and ""Any Trouble"" are lesser Westerberg, but they fit the album's theme all too well. Likewise, ""Hold on Hope"" is an obvious GBV choice (what, you expected ""Tractor Rape Chain""?), but Campbell owns its schmaltz as well as its simple optimism, suggesting that Bob Pollard wrote the line ""there hides the cowboy"" with Campbell in mind. <i>Ghost</i> is nowhere near his best, most consistent, or most durable album, but that's ultimately not even the right way to measure its modest accomplishment. Instead, it's a surprisingly upbeat retirement album, one that never stoops to self-pity and very modestly reminds you of past triumphs.</p></div>"|15769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15769-ghost-on-the-canvas/|6.5|Stephen M.

On <i>Romans</i>,  Stallones continues rendering colossal structures in sound, dialing the  scale of its predecessor back ever-so-slightly while retaining both its  massive scope and its wide-eyed searcher's gaze.</p>
<p>With a touch more space between its sinewy guitars, warbly keyboards, and omnitextured bass thump, <i>Romans</i> doesn't immediately inspire the same awe  the impossibly grandiose, oppressively humid <i>On Patrol</i> did. Those slowly  mutating tunes, even when they tipped in at a quarter-hour, felt almost  immaculately composed, each craggy instrument and edge-of-perception  toneshift perched against the others just so. Though all of Stallones'  music is built around improv, <i>Romans</i> feels a mite looser, more  free-flowing than its predecessor, its individual movements less  choreographed, its overall mood a bit more relaxed. Yet Stallones maintains  his incredible compositional economy and precision; with all its moving  parts, <i>Ancient Romans</i> can sound a bit haphazard at first, but each gurgle and whirr  works in brilliant tandem, and one more element could tip any of its  scales. <i>Romans</i>' sandstorm soundscapes and Afrobeat-indebted underwater  funk are panoramic, deliriously detailed visions beamed in from some  untapped back-of-the-mind vista.</p>
<p><i>Romans</i> begins slowly, the reedy ""Lucretius"" rolling out like a fog.  ""Crown Shell"" matches its dubby bass nausea to flittery desert guitar,  with Stallones imparting illegible wisdom over top. What vocals do pop  up on Ancient <i>Romans</i> are used to enormous effect; whether it's  conspiratorial chants of indoctrination or chants of earthen ecstasy,  Stallones' populating of his sound world with these indecipherable  characters leaves them feeling at once more alien and more habitable.  You can almost make out the very edges of pop song structure in the  warped Zapp-and-Fela bootleg of ""Crown Shell"" and the snaky, sunbaked  gospel ""Lute and Lyre""; though Stallones' epic-length music resists  hurry, it doesn't skimp on form, and even with <i>Romans</i>' somewhat looser feel, he never lets his instrumental wandering take him too  far from the compositions.</p>
<p>It ends with ""Impluvium"", which flips the trance-like qualities of  Araw's eyelid-movie music into something else entirely. Easily the  danciest track in Araw's arsenal, ""Impluvium"" knocks, riding a  chant-laden, clanky 4/4 groove off into some equatorial sunset.  Up against the rest of <i>Romans</i>' slowmo dub-sludge, a track like  ""Impluvium"" could well be an overreach, but Stallones' vision for Sun  Araw is both so carefully controlled and so wide-- and ""Impluvium"", like  everything that precedes it, so roughshod and naturalistic-- the tune  becomes like an ideal disembarking point for <i>Romans</i>' steamy  night-on-the-river. It's one of Stallones' finest moments to date, yet  another reminder that there are few people making music either this  all-encompassing or this enveloping. The mighty <i>On Patrol</i> brought  together many of the disparate strands in Stallones' work (both as Sun  Araw and his stellar Magic Lantern) into a dazzling whole, and though <i> Romans</i>' textures are grittier and its gaze more inward, the ground it  surveys isn't too far afield from that of its predecessor. But if <i>Romans</i> is something of a lateral move where innovation's concerned, it's by no  means a step down in quality. In the last couple years, Stallones  continues to carve out what feels like uncharted territory; hard to  blame him for wanting to survey the scenery a little while longer.</p></div>"|15771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15771-ancient-romans/|7.9|Paul Thompson

""Thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with <i>Tha Carter IV</i>,"" huffs Busta Rhymes. ""It's important that you are more than welcome to <i>Tha Carter IV</i>, and y'all enjoy it,"" advises Andr<span class=""st"">é</span> 3000. ""Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss,"" reiterates Wayne's fellow ex-con Shyne. And it's Drake who provides the record's most impassioned verse about his mentor's 2010 prison stint for criminal gun possession: ""Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol/ But at least they had some bad bitches workin' in that shit hole."" The man born Dwayne Carter never needed to be propped up like this before. During his Untouchable Era-- from the December 2005 release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4997-tha-carter-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tha Carter II</i></a> through 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11608-tha-carter-iii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tha Carter III</i></a>, with several classic mixtapes in between-- Wayne was The Best Rapper Alive because he said he was, and then rhymed his brain off to prove it. He doesn't claim that world-beating title once on <i>Tha Carter IV</i>. And no one else claims it for him.</p>
<p>We accepted last year's duo of disappointments-- the aggravated rock turn <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rebirth</i></a> and the unfocused stop-gap collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14711-i-am-not-a-human-being/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am Not a Human Being</i></a>-- because they were mere anomalies or appetizers. This summer's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15663-sorry-4-the-wait/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sorry 4 the Wait</i></a> mixtape was passable, but slight compared to previous off-label bounties like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9148-dedication-2/"" target=""_blank"">Dedication 2</a>,</i> <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10229-da-drought-3/"" target=""_blank"">Da Drought 3</a>, </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13672-no-ceilings/"" target=""_blank"">No Ceilings</a></i>. So while there hasn't been much recorded evidence to support Wayne's hip-hop supremacy over the last three years, <i>Tha Carter IV</i> was always going to be the true test. As such, it's the rapper's most unfulfilling and worrisome move in a long while.</p>
<p>Almost everything about Wayne is relaxed, regurgitated, or regressing here. Most noticeable is his slowed-down flow, perhaps a capitulation to the booming arenas he now plays to regularly, where intelligibility often trumps quick wit. But whereas the only permanent aspect of Wayne's cadence used to be its shiftiness, his delivery has slackened, severely deadening his ferociousness in the process. The falloff is made more apparent by a couple of guest shots from two of rap's most exuberant fast talkers, Busta Rhymes and Kansas City cult hero Tech N9ne. It's as if Wayne dispatched the pair to provide the dexterity he won't (or can't) come up with himself anymore.</p>
<p>On ""Interlude"", Tech N9ne and an oddly uncredited Andr<span class=""st"">é</span> 3000 reel off two of the album's best verses, perfectly setting up its star for a clean-up finale. But Wayne never shows on that track, or the star-studded ""Outro"", as if he'd rather play curator than be the focus of some of the highlights on his own album. His trepidation is understandable considering how Drake and Rick Ross easily overshadow him on recent singles ""She Will"" and ""John"", respectively. In fact, one of Wayne's more spirited moments on the album comes when he forgoes a third verse on ""She Will"" and just hollers and mugs behind Drake's hook instead; he just sounds excited to be in the background.</p>
<p>After an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money. Because after you've been ""so motherfuckin' high, I can eat a star,"" as he claimed on <i>Da Drought 3</i>, being ""so high, I get star-struck"" just doesn't pack the same oomph. Elsewhere, he's found a new love for the type of faux-profundity he rarely had time or patience for before. ""I'm searching for today, instead I found tomorrow/ And I put that shit right back like, 'I'll see what I find tomorrow,'"" he blankly philosophizes on ""Nightmares of the Bottom"", itself a downgrade of <i>Tha Carter III</i>'s brilliantly soulful ""Let the Beat Build"". Once joyously freewheeling, <i>Tha Carter</i> series has gotten to the point where it comes with its own hip-hop tropes and rules: a combination of East Coast lyricism, West Coast violence, and a distinctly Southern rhythm and flair. That singular formula has served Wayne well in the past, but some of this album's most enjoyable moments do away with it altogether.</p>
<p>The squelching T-Pain duet ""How to Hate"" is a paradoxically gorgeous kiss-off that finds the pair heart-worn and a bit pissed. ""She used to always say, fuck my niggas/ And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas, well..."" laments Wayne in a coaxing purr. As usual, T-Pain plays a permanent resident of the friend zone, while Wayne lashes out in the most charming way possible; the track makes you wish the rumored T-Wayne project would actually get off the ground. Even softer is that song's R&amp;B rejoinder, ""How to Love"", Wayne's most mature song to date. And while it's a little jarring to hear the guy behind ""Lollipop"" and so many <i>Gremlins</i> references attempt a legitimate grown-up ballad, the 28 year old's tough love feels earned. Without a fierce beat or screaming guitars backing him, Wayne's sing-rap croak is caught out there on the track, and it results in one of the few <i>Carter IV</i> performances that doesn't sound like a canned retread.</p>
<p>Recently, Lil Wayne spoke out on the topic of retirement. ""I want to become a better father and a better man to my woman, and those things take time,"" he told MTV. ""And time takes away from [music]. So the honest answer to that [retirement] question is, I don't know. Maybe so."" Even back in his hallowed heyday, on <i>Dedication 2</i>, he had retirement on his mind. ""My career is my life, so I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping,"" he said in an interlude. ""Hopefully, I'm known for something different-- not different, but known for something else, also."" It's a nice thought. And, after all, this album's uncharacteristic R&amp;B anomalies stand out most. While <i>Tha Carter IV</i> isn't the first indication that Wayne's finest verses are behind him, it is the most glaring. Still, he seems smart enough to know that for every Jay-Z there are scores of rappers-- including several guests on this very album-- trying to relive past glories on a daily basis. Wayne has floated the notion that <i>Tha Carter IV</i> could be his last album. The threat makes sense.</p></div>"|15770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/|6.2|Ryan Dombal

The more you open yourself up, the greater the chance that you'll get yourself hurt. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/malebonding"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a> like to explore the tension between TMI and musical aggression. They kick up dust and make a lot of noise but then write of pain, jealousy, depression, and loss. The title of their fine Sub Pop debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14241-nothing-hurts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nothing Hurts</i></a>, was a succinct summary of their contradictions.</p>
<p>It took some time to get the whole picture on <i>Nothing Hurts</i>-- for one, you had to get past the heavy British accents (to say nothing of the album's trashcan production values). The band's songwriter, John Arthur Webb, and co-singer/bassist Kevin Hendrick had problems with speaking up, too, obscuring some of their scattered thoughts. Some have cited this unintelligibility as a telltale sign of Male Bonding's lack of personality; while that's an understandable conclusion to reach, their distance ultimately comes across as a self-defense mechanism-- emotional armor, if you will.</p>
<p>Considering the circumstances that surround Male Bonding's second album, <i>Endless Now</i>, you'd assume the stage for this self-hatred and confusion would be a little more well-lit. The record was produced by 1990s-throwback-indie producer du jour John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile) and recorded in Woodstock, New York's Dreamland Recording Studio, a converted 19th-century church. The results are (slightly) more polished, with more room for the band's bashing guitars to stretch their legs. As a songwriter, though, Webb hasn't changed-- if anything, the new sonic spread just provides more hiding places, the dense thickets of melodic hum that drive ""Can't Dream"" and early single ""<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/42787-male-bonding-return-with-second-album/"" target=""_blank"">Bones</a>"" functioning as curtains to sing behind. His cloudy outlook is still noticeable-- despite its title, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43447-new-male-bonding-tame-the-sun/"" target=""_blank"">Tame the Sun</a>"" is about <i>not</i> being able to tame the sun-- but it takes some digging through the sheets of noise in ""Bones"" to unearth its futile core: ""Be careful what you dream about/ There's not always ways out.""</p>
<p>Lest you think <i>Endless Now</i> sounds like one big pity party, it's not. <i>Nothing Hurts</i> had a big, beating pop heart underneath its scrapes and bruises, and here the hooks are plentiful, to the point where touring guitarist Nathan Hewitt was enlisted to handle the overflow of sweet, sticky stuff. The phrase ""pop-punk"" has been thrown around with these guys, and with good reason (besides those Rivers Cuomo recording sessions, that is); if you took the swaying chorus on ""Seems to Notice Now"" and plunked it in the middle of a pre-misery-and-maturity Blink-182 album, I'm not sure how many would know the difference. A possibly more apt comparison would be <i>Thirteen</i>-era Teenage Fanclub or even vintage Fountains of Wayne in terms of sparkly power-pop goodness, with just a little grit (fittingly, the band's been known to do a cover of FoW's ""Radiation Vibe"" every now and then).</p>
<p>Comparisons to such bastions of relative ""uncoolness"" is a surefire way to break out of the ""lo-fi"" holding cell that the band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41842-male-bonding-talk-bigger-sounding-new-lp/"" target=""_blank"">complained</a> to Pitchfork about earlier this year. Although the outgoing sonics of <i>Endless Now</i> represent a considerable leap in sound, it's those same qualities that could very well repel those drawn in by the burnt-ends glory of <i>Nothing Hurts</i>-- not because that previous record is necessarily <i>better</i>, though. It's just... different. And there's nothing wrong with that if you approach <i>Endless Now</i> with an open mind. Bands grow and evolve, and that means shedding some old habits for new ones-- even if they're not ready to drop all of their defense mechanisms just yet.</p></div>"|15756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15756-endless-now/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Lou Reed is maybe the only other figure of her kind and caliber, and Smith's a better writer than Reed, at least as far as words without music go.</p>
<p>Unlike Reed, though, Smith isn't the kind of pop musician whose work lends itself to anthologizing and cherry-picking. Her one real earlier stab at a retrospective, 2002's <i>Land (1975-2002)</i>, got over by supplementing its greatest hits with live stuff, demos, and outtakes-- the interstitial, idiosyncratic material that's a crucial part of Smith's weird gift. But now that she's won a National Book Award for her extraordinary memoir <i>Just Kids</i>, a just-give-us-the-<i>good­</i>-songs-<i>c'mon</i> one-disc thing was apparently called for.</p>
<p>Hence this straight-ahead, chronologically arranged collection of singles and standards. Thirteen of its 18 tracks appeared on the greatest-hits half of <i>Land</i>, and two of the others are lead-limbed covers of ""So You Want to Be a Rock N Roll Star"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". As Simon Reynolds points out in <i>Retromania</i>, Smith's declaration that ""I don't fuck much with the past but I fuck plenty with the future"" couldn't have been further from the truth: Very few artists from the punk wave have been so persistently, deeply devoted to a pre-punk idea of rock. (The A-side of her first single was a cover of ""Hey Joe"".) If she has an Achilles' heel as an artist, it's not that she overreaches (she does, but that means she grabs the stars occasionally), it's that she relies too much on what Spinal Tap called ""the majesty of rock, the mystery of roll.""</p>
<p>And when you strip away most of Smith's maddening and brilliant experiments, her passionate stumbles and ungainly glories-- when you reduce her to a greatest-hits entity-- what's left is a rock'n'roll throwback that's sturdy but not particularly flexible. She simply isn't a singles artist, ""Because the Night"" and maybe 1988's ""People Have the Power"" (with production that now makes it sound like a cousin of ""Don't You Forget About Me"") notwithstanding. To understand Smith's power, you have to take the tunes and the sprawling poetic gestures together; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Horses</i></a>' ""Free Money"" topples over unless it's got the nine-and-a-half minutes of ""Land"" near it.</p>
<p>For Smith's first four albums, <i>Outside Society</i> is an abridgement that doesn't really do her justice. For the six that followed them, it's a salvage job, and not a convincing one (2000's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcXUlOoUM3w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glitter in Their Eyes</a>"" still sounds pretty good, though). If the idea of a great poet fronting a rock band appeals to you, and you've somehow never heard ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRWSy3RhW0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dancing Barefoot</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxygqSTO1lQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gloria</a>"", make haste to do so, and be aware that they initially appeared on better albums than this. But when an artist famously begins her first album by bragging about how the old orthodoxies don't apply to her, it's not entirely surprising that some of her own work doesn't age well.</p></div>"|15762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15762-outside-society/|5.9|Douglas Wolk

Perched high above the streets of San Francisco in the group-house tower that serves as his bedroom and recording studio, the Fresh &amp; Onlys front-man whips off three-chord pop songs with the kind of habitude that normal people reserve for coffee drinking, prayer, and ""Law &amp; Order"" re-runs. With every change in the weather a new set of songs arrives, each collection pressed to limited edition vinyl and packaged in his trademark scary-clown/blood-weeping-eagle artwork.</p>
<p>Except, not this time. <i>The Glad Birth of Love</i> breaks the steady solo-record routine that Cohen has established over the last several years. Rather than a smattering of scruffy psych-pop cast-offs, it's a record of long-form suites-- four songs in 45 minutes. The fuzz guitars are, mostly, absent. Another change: It's billed under the name of his live backing band, Magic Trick, rather than his own.</p>
<p>In the past, Cohen's solo material has been raw and off the cuff-- a steady stream of downcast sing-alongs jammed out straight to tape and passed on to the world with minimal afterthought. But <i>The Glad Birth of Love</i> is more intricately arranged, slipping from baroque picking to mystical oud-fueled zone-outs. Cohen handles most of the instruments, but there are plenty of guests, including Jonas Reinhardt's Diego Gonzalez (droney stuff), the Sandwiches' Grace Cooper (vocals), and Thee Oh Sees' Jon Dwyer, now the Bay Area's go-to session flautist.</p>
<p>Between the multi-movement song cycles and the oboe overdubs, there's more than a hint of prog to <i>The Glad Birth of Love</i>. But Cohen's ambition skews closer to Skip Spence than Rick Wakeman. Though they're ornately embellished, Cohen's epic ballads are basically just a bunch of his regular songs, only strung together stream-of-conciousness style. On ""Clyde""-- a sort of surrealist father-and-son tale-- Cohen keeps the mood mellow, skipping through an endless series of finger style guitar figures, never looking back to a melody or motif once discarded. It peaks in the middle, with Clyde's sea-born demise, where Cohen-- who, despite his stoney demeanor, is strangely accomplished at channeling biblical wrath-- shouts, ""God's great everlasting realm is forever,"" over a single thundering chord. At 13 minutes, album opener ""Cherished One"" is just one really, really, really long love song.</p>
<p>In both his solo work and his songs with the Fresh &amp; Onlys, simplicity was key to Cohen's charm. He had a perfect grasp on just how many riffs it took to make a snack-size lo-fi garage rock song sound huge. Even in his solo work, there was always a chorus on the horizon. <i>The Glad Birth of Love</i> throws everything out on the table. It's a summation of Cohen's music-- his psych-rock output, but also the out-folk exercises of his old, unheralded band, Black Fiction. Sing-along moments are scarce, and sometimes the narrative gets foggy. But <i>The Glad Birth of Love</i>'s scale gives Cohen room to stretch, letting his weirdo lyrical ambitions run wild amid a jumble of pastoral plucking.</p></div>"|15768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15768-tim-cohen/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

Like that Providence duo, Big Business made busy music-- the sort of chaotic roiling thunder that can only happen when two expert musicians decide to make as much noise as possible. But unlike Lightning Bolt, Big Business put those gifts in service of burly bellowed hooks and the sorts of hammerhead riffs that would've impressed any high-school parking-lot hessian at any point over the past 40 years. Arriving just after band members Jared Warren and Coady Willis got the call to join Dale Crover as the Melvins' new rhythm section, 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9954-here-come-the-waterworks/"" target=""_blank"">Here Come the Waterworks</a> </i>was a piece of larger-than-life fists-up power-rock that would've nevertheless fit in just fine in any of the nation's finer dusty DIY noise-rock warehouses.</p>
<p>Since that album, Big Business have doubled their personnel-- one guitarist joined before 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13055-mind-the-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mind the Drift</i></a>; another jumped on board last year. But on both <i>Mind the Drift</i> and the new <i>Quadruple Single </i>EP, Big Business' mission remained admirably unchanged, its focus squarely on the thudding, juddering roar of that Warren/Willis attack. On <i>Quadruple Single</i>, the guitars seem to be largely extraneous-- tinny squiggles that only take away attention from the primordial scuzz that still anchors the mix. If anything, the new guys seem to be on board for backing-vocal duty more than anything else. And when opener ""Always Never Know When to Quit"" bursts into a gloriously hooky bridge, the extra voices succeed in making an already-huge sound even bigger.</p>
<p>On the first three tracks, though, those skyward melodies don't come quite often enough. Like recent tourmates Torche, Big Business know how to balance melody and sludge with aplomb, but sludge and strained time-signature gymnastics win out just a bit too often on the new tracks. It's still perfectly effective fuzz-metal, but it's coming from a group of guys who have done seriously indelible work with the same ingredients, so it comes off a bit too slight.</p>
<p>What really redeems the EP, though, is the elementally dumb final track, a platonic-ideal snarl anthem called ""Guns"". The entire lyrical content of ""Guns"" is as follows: ""Guns! Guns! Guns are better than everything else!,"" repeated over and over. If that sounds like a fun goof, it is, but it's also something more. The track starts out as a ferocious martial stomp and builds from there, slapping on layer after layer of scratchy, brutal rock-noise and building into a dizzy roar of directionless animosity. In the right context-- the end of a shitty day, say, when my car stereo is cranked all the way up-- you could convince me that ""Guns"" is the single greatest thing Big Business have ever recorded.</p></div>"|15740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15740-quadruple-single-ep/|7.0|Tom Breihan

Online communication creates a situation where young artists, separated by geography but brought together through the web, can share the same obsessions and quickly develop remarkably similar aesthetics. The umbrella of music sometimes called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7806-ghosts-in-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">witch house</a> is perhaps the most obvious example of this in the last few years, since it combined musical concerns (moody synths, slow tempos, warped vocals, allusions to Southern rap) with a specific visual aesthetic (anonymous producers shielded by hoodies, Christian imagery, deep knowledge of the computer keyboard's symbol keys), and so many artists with these exact qualities appeared simultaneously. Unusually, the bulk of the movement could be traced to precisely one source, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>, demonstrating how much sway that sometimes reviled outfit had over the minds of budding young producers who spend way too much time online.</p>
<p>Once a scene or sound crystalizes, you can bet that the most interesting artists to emerge from it will quickly set off on their own and develop an individual voice. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thebalamacab"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>, the project of 20-year-old Pennsylvanian Alec Koone, was rightly slotted with witch house when he released his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14548-see-birds-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>See Birds</i> EP</a> in 2010. He has the warped voices and the slow tempos, he was on the right label, and his IRL identity had a cultivated air of mystery. But the careful construction of <i>See Birds</i> hinted that his musical ear was a cut above, and now his excellent full-length debut, <i>Wander / Wonder</i>, confirms it. This is a personal and distinctive record with its share of current reference points that nonetheless doesn't need a scene to prop it up.</p>
<p>A few things set Balam Acab apart from the pack, first being the overall mood. The post-Salem ""dark and creepy"" crawl became a cliché in record time, but <i>Wander / Wonder</i>, despite the spectral voices that take the lead on every track, has no hints of nightmares or grim violence. Instead, its primary concern is simple aesthetic beauty, the way a small and specific combination of sounds, carefully arranged but given room to breathe, can have a deep emotional impact. It's <i>pretty</i>, in other words, but its prettiness never feels manipulative or overbearing. It's the sort of music that exists at the intersection between art and design, but it manages to avoid feeling sterile.</p>
<p>There are eight tracks here in 37 minutes, the perfect length given the consistent mood. They have vague titles like ""Apart"" and ""Now Time"" and ""Oh, Why"" that serve as a light tint but don't really point to anything in particular. In fact, differentiating between the tracks seems sort of beside the point, since so many of the same motifs pop up over and over again: The album feels very much like one sustained thing. The basic elements are twinkly keyboards and music-box chimes, dusty crackles floating on sounds of shifting liquid, and deep basslines bumping into the occasional drum machine clap. Floating above it all are the voices, pitched up to accentuate their delicacy and set loose in a cloud of echo. While the current vogue is for sampled vocals that allude to R&amp;B, Balam Acab's mostly have a classical feel, sounding like they are pulled from recordings of ancient hymns and airs. Accentuating the ""chamber dub"" qualities are liberal samples of orchestral sections and nylon string guitar. But the most important instrument of all is silence, which frames every note and brings it to the foreground.</p>
<p>Where the ghostly dubstep of Burial, an obvious antecedent, has a crucial connection to the urban street, <i>Wander / Wonder</i> is pastoral, more likely to bring to mind sunlight slanting through a window that overlooks a rural garden. And you can't have a garden without water. As anyone who has ever knocked over a cup next to a computer knows, water is the digital sphere's mortal enemy, the thing that can bring our precious electrical circuits down in an instant. In line with recent productions by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>, <i>Wander / Wonder</i> has has an obsession with the sound of the life force: Laced throughout are samples of lapping currents, slow drips, and light splashes. These accents reinforce both the bucolic feel and, with the complexity of the natural world that computers still envy, liberates the music from the computer grid. They also make <i>Wander / Wonder</i> an immersive experience, like something you lower yourself into, inch by inch. And in the end, that seems to be the overriding idea: This is functional music that highlights the simple pleasure of artfully arranged sound, the kind of gorgeous and evocative record that fills up the room and shifts your perception for 37 minutes and then brings you gently back to the surface.</p></div>"|15766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15766-wander-wonder/|8.2|Mark Richardson

He existed, so somebody needed to take care of him. That responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Interscope/Geffen tandem, who, like bad foster parents, decided to remedy their problems with him by throwing unseemly amounts of money in his direction. In theory it might make sense, as Game's career has long been based on a simple formula: Surround him with artists more talented and famous than him, provide him with an envious selection of beats, then get out of the way and hope for the best. Up until about 2009, you could actually tack ""profit"" onto the end of that list, but the last few years haven't been too kind to rap's foremost tragic clown.</p>
<p>Game last released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12123-lax/"" target=""_blank"">an album</a> three years ago, and like <i>The R.E.D. Album</i>, it seemed destined to be a commercial failure. But along came ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxZ9zkDzpo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Life</a>"", a Lil Wayne collaboration that became Game's biggest hit since 2005, and so the project, and his career, were salvaged. But that was a time when pretty much anything Wayne touched ended up making somebody some money, unless you were Brisco or Cassie. It was the Lil Wayne Feature Bubble of 2008, and unfortunately for Interscope, Game has turned out to be Pets.com.</p>
<p><i>The R.E.D. Album </i>arrives in stores as a monument to the twisted logic and dire business practices of the modern rap industry. It has <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/06/the_game_the_red_album_delays.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cycled through as many ""lead singles""</a> as the total number of radio hits that Biggie had in his whole career (yes, including posthumous releases). Its Wikipedia page could almost be printed and published as a 33 1/3 book. At a mere 21 tracks long, and featuring 17 different artists, the final product is one speedboat away from being a DJ Khaled album. Guests include Drake, Young Jeezy, Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne twice, Dr. Dre five times, and Nelly Furtado, who must've wandered into the wrong recording studio and froze up like George Costanza when she tried to find an excuse to leave. It's almost as if the rap and R&amp;B world got together to do a benefit album, although considering the state of Game's career, that might not be too far off.</p>
<p>On one side of the coin is a work that's an utter monstrosity, and whose best moments appear very sporadically. The other side is an album that is almost-- <i>almost--</i> too big to fail. Where some collaborations here feel like the result of Game spinning a prize wheel and taking his stuffed Lloyd, ""Heavy Artillery"" (featuring Ross and Beanie Sigel) and ""Speakers on Blast"" (with Big Boi and E-40) sound like they were conceived with consideration to how the artists might sound together and how the tracks would fit into Game's gritty aesthetic. In what might be the album's two greatest successes, ""Martians vs. Goblins"" finds Game putting on a worthy audition for Odd Future (complete with a hilarious Lil B crack) and ""Drug Test"" rides a beat that thrillingly turns the clock back to when G-Unit wasn't merely an investment firm.</p>
<p>The perverse thing about <i>The R.E.D. Album </i>is that amidst this unsightly storm of star power is the backbone of what could've been a coherent album. A number of tracks lean on soulful production that provides an appropriate (though maybe too on-the-nose) backdrop for Game's hyper-personal verses. Others dip into storytelling or flesh out a bit of Game's personal history. At the very worst the album wouldn't feel like one of those fake leaks that haphazardly packages together an artists' singles and random features into one large .rar file. But of course, Game's whole career is based on the hypothesis that he can't sell records on name or talent alone. So instead, the album smothers itself in R&amp;B choruses sung by people like Chris Brown and Mario, and nobody wants to hear that, including, surely, Chris Brown and Mario.<span> </span></p>
<p><i>The R.E.D. Album </i>will likely fade into obscurity immediately upon arrival, but if it doesn't raise some eyebrows around major label offices, then this is a failure of not just one person, but also of an entire industry. As <i>Watch the Throne</i> lords over the genre, its antithesis is here: a strategically and artistically directionless album, built around a desperate, forgotten MC, foisted upon a public that has made it very clear that it wants nothing to do with him. Game <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1611413/game-hes-rededicated-hiphop-on-red-album.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told MTV's Shaheem Reid</a> that the album's title referred to his re-dedication to hip-hop but, in a taunting, delicious bit of irony, it more appropriately reflects the project's balance sheet. We can pretend the album never existed, or better yet, joke about it for years to come. Jimmy Iovine, on the other hand, isn't so lucky.</p></div>"|15759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15759-the-red-album/|4.8|Jordan Sargent

It's close to the border with Libya, and years ago, in the 1980s and early 90s, it was a place of relatively safe passage for Kel Tamashek fighters moving between the refugee camps in Libya and the battlefront in northern Mali. To look at it in satellite images, you might think you were looking at he surface of some distant moon, long ago scarred by geologic activity but now barren and strangely beautiful. It wasn't always this way. Thousands of ancient cave and rock paintings dating from 8,000 to around 1,700 years ago depict a place of plenty that slowly dried to become the modern desert. There are lost religions and civilizations out there.</p>
<p>The Tassili N'Ajjer covers some 45,000 square miles. Near the southern rim of the plateau is a town called Djanet, and it's out in the rocky desert near this town that Tinariwen chose to record its fifth album. The group would have preferred to record near its homebase, Tessalit, in northern Mali, but the security situation was too precarious. The re-flaring of a conflict the group hoped was put to bed clouds some of the album they made-- the first couplet on the album, sung in weary Tamashek by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, translates to, ""What have you got to say, my friends, about this painful time we're living through?"" It's not only about the new conflict, though. From there, the song calls out to people who have given up the nomadic life of the desert, lamenting that they've left but seeming to understand why they have.</p>
<p>These complex emotions run through the album, and the predominant feeling that comes out of them is longing, for home, for peace, for old friends, for a way of life whose place in the modern world is uncertain. <a href=""http://www.tinariwen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tinariwen</a> have mostly put aside their electric guitars for this album and returned to the acoustics they first played together, backing the rhythmic playing with small hand drums and clapping. They've invited in a few friends as well. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"" target=""_blank"">Nels Cline</a> contributes a beautiful wash of ambient guitar to opener ""Imidiwan ma Tennam"", two members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band add rough, sonorous texture to ""Ya Messinagh"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe, who traveled out to the desert recording site, are on hand on five songs, adding subtle backing harmonies and even a bit of lead vocal on one song.</p>
<p>The invitation of outsiders into the songs is in one sense a measure of the confidence the band has in the integrity and singularity of its sound, and also a reflection of where they've been recently. Tinariwen has toured the world and will be in North America again this fall. Some of the longing for the desert in these songs undoubtedly stems from the band's travel schedule, and when Alhabib asks others why they left, he may in part be doing it to remind himself that it's worth the challenge of staying. Meanwhile, <i>Tassili </i>is a very different album from any Tinariwen have recorded before, and they're proving to be a band of considerable range as they build a catalog of varied and excellent albums. Only time will tell where they're able to record the next one, but their retreat to the Tassili seems to have left them creatively refreshed.</p></div>"|15767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15767-tassili/|7.8|Joe Tangari

He's got introspective druggy tunes and riff-heavy party songs, both of which romanticize the brilliance of a burnout. But that's not Polizze: He's a Philadelphia friend of Kurt Vile's-- he played guitar on the <i>Childish Prodigy</i> tour-- who started out in Birds of Maya and made scuzzy rock records as Purling Hiss for Permanent and Woodsist before putting out this EP on Mexican Summer. But ""burnout"" is as good a word as any to convey his brand of rock grit, which is slathered in cruddy production and with a hard emphasis on shredding.</p>
<p><i>Lounge Lizards</i>' six tracks serve as a logical follow up to the sound and feel of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14916-public-service-announcement/"" target=""_blank""><i>Public Service Announcement</i></a>, which was also a meeting of catchy hooks and awful production quality. Of course, the sound is presumably intentional and serves a few purposes on the EP: it dampen screams, accents enormous guitar solos, adds density to an already dark song, and muffles instruments' sounds so they bleed together. The effect defines Purling Hiss' sound. This time around, the production doesn't completely warp the tuning in the middle of a song like it did on <i>Public Service Announcement</i>; instead, he opts to make everything sound vaguely smothered.</p>
<p>Just past the muffled noise, there are some bold, well-executed tunes. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15954-the-hoodoo/"" target=""_blank"">The Hoodoo</a>"" serves as the instant earworm of the record, offering a power chord-driven hook, a far-away percussion stomp, a note-perfect guitar solo, and a stupidly catchy and simple melody of dudes singing ""HOODOO!"" between verses. On ""Karaoke Nite"", beneath completely unintelligible vocals, you can hear the muddy shouts of ""whoo whoo"" reminiscent of the ones on the Stones' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8MXiwmNIk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sympathy for the Devil</a>"" and a fluidly harmonizing guitar. There are dozens of well thought-out, off the cuff, immediately catchy elements like this on <i>Lounge Lizards</i>, and it's clear Polizze has become more than adept at crafting great rock songs.</p>
<p>There's also a lot in the way of mood-- like in the heavy, deliberately paced trudge of ""Voices"", a track that finds Polizze stoned and hearing voices in his head. He's not frantic or frightened-- he delivers the song with a lazy whine, which pushes forward one brand of actual, not-stereotypical stoner paranoia (""I don't want to be alone/ Don't want to be stoned""). Meanwhile ""City Special"" lets Polizze stretch out into doomier territory. He still throws dynamic guitar accents into the mix, but keeps most of the elements to a drone.</p>
<p>Sometimes Polizze gets overindulgent. On ""Midnight Man"", he offers an urgent riff and what sounds like an army of metalheads shout-singing, ""I am the midnight man."" And while the intimidation comes through, it wears thin halfway into the track. Ultimately, it's a shortcoming that's easy to overlook when it's sandwiched between two high-flying guitar monsters like ""The Hoodoo"" and ""Been Teased"". And really, ""Midnight Man"", both literally in track placement and in its ominous lyrical mantra, is the centerpiece of the burnout savant aesthetic that <i>Lounge Lizards</i> pushes. If you're stoned and hooked on a groove, sometimes you just keep going.</p></div>"|15748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15748-lounge-lizards-ep/|7.5|Evan Minsker

But it's important to remember that <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/psiloveyouband"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PS I Love You</a> essentially began life as a B-side: tucked away on the back half of a split 7"" with Diamond Rings' ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11470-all-yr-songs/"" target=""_blank"">All Yr Songs</a>"", PS I Love You's heart- and-face-melter ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11709-facelove/"" target=""_blank"">Facelove</a>"" proved to be every bit as affecting and addictive as its more celebrated A-side, and the heretofore unknown Kingston, Ontario, indie rock duo subsequently parlayed that momentum into a well-received full-length album (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14709-meet-me-at-the-muster-station/"" target=""_blank""><i>Meet Me at the Muster Station</i></a>) and a non-stop international touring itinerary. So the hasty appearance of <i>Figure It Out</i> represents more than just a stop-gap measure to maintain visibility in an increasingly crowded playing field; more than most bands, PS I Love You understand how a B-side can pave the way to the A-list, and how thin the line is between a forgotten song and a fondly remembered one.</p>
<p>The purpose of <i>Figure It Out</i> is ultimately two-fold: Its first side shines a light on the band's pre-<i>Muster Station</i> origins, while the second brings us up to date on what the band has been up to since the album's release. Though singer/guitarist Paul Saulnier and drummer Benjamin Nelson had previously played together in a Kingston quartet called Magic Jordan, PS I Love You initially began as Saulnier's one-man project, and the five solo demos collected here-- pulled from a CD-R sold at early shows-- stands in stark contrast to the boisterous noise-pop jams heard on <i>Muster</i>. On click-tracked confections like ""Subtle and Majestic"" and ""Actually (I Am a Monster Now)"", Saulnier plays with a delicacy that suggests he's being extra careful not to wake up his neighbors, laying off his distortion pedal and singing in an uncharacteristically soft tremble, while the Neil Youngian acoustic ditty ""Notes and Stuff"" suggests a few dues paid at coffeehouse open-mic nights. We also hear skeletal, drum-machined versions of two future <i>Muster Station</i> standards, which are ultimately more interesting as historical artifacts than stand-alone tracks-- though the instrumental arrangements for ""Facelove"" and ""Scattered"" are more or less mapped out already, you can hear Saulnier stretching the limits of his one-man-band set-up, and begging for a more bombastic treatment that he just can't achieve on his own.</p>
<p>Side two brings us back to familiar, present-tense territory. PS I Love You confidently navigate the spectrum from the ridiculous to the righteous, shifting between the endearingly stoopid Pixies karaoke of ""Starfield"" (which celebrates what is presumably the ultimate sci-fi geek fantasy of ""fuck-fuck-fucking on the back of a flying space lion"") and the gleaming, majestic Diamond Rings collaboration ""Leftovers"". In tandem, these songs reinforce what PS I Love You do so well: They handle the silly and serious stuff with equal conviction and drown them both in so much volume and distortion that you're not sure which side they're playing on anymore.</p>
<p><i>Figure It Out</i>'s two cover selections may seem unlikely, but they adhere to the same fuzzy logic. On a sandblasted makeover of Madonna's ""Where's the Party"" Saulnier yelps out the chorus with the creepy suggestiveness of someone who's probably been blocked from the Facebook invitation list. And though Rush's stern-faced, suburban-outcast portrait ""Subdivisions"" fits right into PS I Love You's thematic wheelhouse, their reasonably faithful version actually works best as a comedic exercise in how freakin' hard it is to cover a Rush song-- Saulnier and Nelson variously leave out certain changes altogether or add in extra bars as if they needed more time to catch their breath. Though <i>Figure It Out</i>'s title is taken from ""Starfield"", its sentiment rings most true here: Saulnier and Nelson know they're no Alex Lifeson or Neil Peart, but as their career up to this point has shown, they sure know how to make the most of their limited means.</p></div>"|15750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15750-figure-it-out/|6.9|Stuart Berman

Depending on the moment, he either resembles a Doberman whose paw has been stepped on or a cross between Jello Biafra and <i>South Park</i>'s Terrence &amp; Philip. For a rapper, choosing an abrasive honk like this as your instrument is an audacious move; it all but demands that you come well-equipped with compelling reasons for your listeners to hang on.</p>
<p>But Danny Brown is an unusually audacious rapper. He proudly rocks skinny jeans that, to hear him tell it, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43574-echo-chamber-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">cost him a G-Unit label deal all by themselves</a>, and he has lately settled on the kind of <a href=""http://www.freep.com/article/20110814/ENT04/108140328/Detroit-s-Danny-Brown-aims-hip-hop-stardom"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wildly asymmetrical haircut</a> that can invite savage beatings in certain areas.  He belongs, in other words, to a proud lineage of mangy underground-rap weirdos. There are many rappers vying to claim this spot, but none of them is as talented or as three-dimensional as Brown, and his latest mixtape, <i>XXX</i>, finds him transforming his quirks and jagged edges into a compelling and immersive universe.</p>
<p>That universe is haunted by drugs, both sold and consumed. <i>XXX</i>'s grubby production, laced with trashy electro, evokes a heart-pounding clamminess that will feel instantly familiar to anyone who's weathered a spiky high on cheap stimulants. Brown's voice is uniquely suited to conveying wild-eyed, loose-cannon  insanity, and the rising note of panic in it makes every mention  of snorting crushed Adderall hurt. To hear him tell it, he is a Hoover for illegal substances; on ""Die Like a Rock Star"", he catalogs the various undignified ends he expects to meet, invoking Keith Moon, Jimi Hendrix, and others and leering, ""Experimented so much it's a miracle I'm livin'.""</p>
<p>His penchant for depravity might remind listeners, at least initially, of Odd Future. But Brown's depravity, unlike OF's, comes burdened with real-life stakes;  at age 30 (the mixtape's title indicates Brown's age besides suggesting sex and drugs), Brown has lived through some genuinely awful-sounding shit. On ""Scrap or Die"", he flips the chorus of Jeezy's ""Trap or Die"" so that it becomes about stripping houses for scrap metal to sell to factories. He takes a perverse joy in grabbing your neck and shoving your face in some vividly unpleasant places: ""I done served fiends on they menstrual/ Ain't even had pads, stuff they panties with tissue!"" he yelps on ""Monopoly"". His shock rhymes on <i>XXX</i> are like horrorcore stripped of cartoon fantasy, and they carry the moral weight of experience. On ""Pac Blood"", he calls his lyrics ""shit so personal my mom can't listen to,"" and you believe him.</p>
<p>If <i>XXX</i> was nothing but debauchery and desperation, it would quickly devolve into an endless slog. Thankfully, Brown is also hilariously funny, an endlessly inventive rapper driven to cook up outrageous variations on standard rap boasts. At one point, he claims to be getting as much pussy as <i>Teen Wolf</i>-era Michael J. Fox; at another, he brags he can ""get pussy like loofahs."" On ""Adderall Admiral"", he tells a rapper he is ""softer than Flanders' son."" In a <a href=""http://cbrap.com/?p=6646"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview </a>with writer Andrew Nosnitsky of Cocaine Blunts, he revealed himself as an omnivorous rap nerd, the kind of guy who went through heavy No Limit <i>and</i> Def Jux phases, and his palpable joy in his craft is infectious. ""Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head,"" he raps on the title track, sounding astonished and grateful.  His gleeful love of words not only elevates some pretty heavy subject matter; it also helps distinguish <i>XXX</i> as one of the most compelling indie rap releases in an already strong year.</p></div>"|15753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/|8.2|Jayson Greene

Grossi's strong yet ethereal voice-- its corners neatly squared by a childhood spent in choirs-- masses and hovers, imparting an elevated piety to the music. The slick, timely aesthetic is appealing, but works at slight odds with the timelessness Grossi cultivates.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed how harps and beats entwined in a glittery haze on Active Child's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14301-curtis-lane-ep/"">Curtis Lane</a> </i>EP, you'll enjoy<i> You Are All I See</i>, which is similar but runs on finer gears. The EP's fairly rigid boundary between dance numbers and atmospheric ones has become much more porous, creating a subtler flow that carries us smoothly from the frosty soul and coiled percussion of ""Hanging On"" to the expansive art-pop of ""High Priestess"" and ""See Thru Eyes"", where jagged but spare synthetic drums and holographic tone colors make Grossi's voice seem to tower even higher. It all sounds like the work of someone whose computer expertise is catching up with his instrumental chops.</p>
<p>With this welcome refinement of style comes a minor downside, namely, that it feels overly familiar. This isn't to say that Grossi is ripping anyone off-- at a time when music is so instantly responsive to its own immediate context, his recombinant approach is routine. But on <i>You Are All I See</i>, craft edges out personality. The allusions to modern trends are so well-realized that it at least creates a slightly numbing impression of opportunistic pastiche, even if the similarities were unintentional. If you enjoyed the experimental soft-pop moods of Bon Iver's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"">recent album</a> and are looking for more spiritually glamorous music, step right up. Pacesetter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How to Dress Well</a>, who mines a vein similar to Grossi's but more ghostly, guests on the excellent ""Playing House"", while ""Hanging On"" sounds like a heartfelt synthesis of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsfGhEqnXE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lady Luck</a>"", ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va1Y6uAgNJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Boy Is Mine</a>"", and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVMKQP0K3a0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pony</a>"". To top it off, ""Way Too Fast"" and ""Shield &amp; Sword"" both have the prayerful, hollowed out turbulence of James Blake. With a figurative dugout like that, it's hard to go wrong in 2011.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with a low-stakes success if it sounds this good. But it's odd when a record that puts such a high premium on the personal feels so formal and emotionally opaque. Grossi's lyrics about longing and engulfing isolation have been polished to the point where they are immaculately vague, and sometimes, precious. They project plenty of emotional grandiosity. What's missed are more specific details, which might have led to something more relatable. As it stands, the sound of Grossi's voice is much more eloquent and moving than his words. Taken together, <i>You Are All I See</i> still can't help but feel like an old cathedral-- easy to admire in awe, but somehow cold and remote; hard to really make your own.</p></div>"|15745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15745-you-are-all-i-see/|7.2|Brian Howe

Since that group's demise, he's flashed surprising proclivities towards lush, orchestral-tinged folk-pop in the vein of Okkervil River with his solo project Lightspeed Champion. There have been growing pains at every step along the way, but they were always the result of Hynes admirably trying to do too much, trying to pour too many words and ideas and emotions into his compositions. So it's a real shock listening to <i>Coastal Grooves</i>, the debut LP released under Hynes' newest solo moniker, <a href=""http://bloodorangeforever.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blood Orange</a>. <i>Coastal Grooves</i> is all about what's missing-- it's a highly stylish album that frequently forgoes things like melodies, energy, and vocal choruses in favor of slinky, solitary guitar lines and seductively spare, post-punk atmospherics.</p>
<p>Most of the album's 10 tracks feel like promising skeletal demos of songs that are close to being truly great. Hynes is a gifted and voracious guitarist, displaying here particular predilections for sounds from Asia and the American West. Aside from a couple of purely moody pieces (""Can We Go Inside Now"", ""Complete Failure""), <i>Coastal Grooves</i> is also largely propelled by strong, strutting rhythmic foundations, while Hynes' vocals remain appealingly florid throughout.</p>
<p>The problem is there are almost no payoffs. Far too often, Hynes lays intriguing groundwork for a sexy, indie-funk jam or a sweetly kissed pop song, arrives at the chorus, and gives us only a stark guitar line or plinky little rhythm. I suppose this minimalist approach is in keeping with the album's artfully space-conscious post-punk leanings, and sometimes the device is evocative (particularly on first single ""Sutphin Boulevard""), but it gets to a point with <i>Coastal Grooves</i> that you halfway start expecting to hear Hynes mumble, ""Chorus goes here,"" during some of the seemingly placeholding moments. Subsequently, the few songs that have genuine vocal refrains-- like ""Forget It"" and ""The Complete Knock""-- end up feeling more fleshed out and dynamic than they really are.</p>
<p>Hynes is the type of demonstrative, emotionally engaging artist who definitely feels more at home being messily overambitious than coolly restrained. The sounds he pursues here as Blood Orange might be more hip than his work as Lightspeed Champion, but the end results are less satisfying. Ideally, a blend of the two styles would be best, the artfulness of one project with the human connection of the other. So which sounds better: Blood Champion, or Lightspeed Orange?</p></div>"|15722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15722-coastal-grooves/|5.9|Joshua Love

He started out fronting the psych-pop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4436-the-unicorns/"" target=""_blank"">the Unicorns</a>, moved on to the more ambitious and less combustible <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2148-islands/"" target=""_blank"">Islands</a>, and then came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5834-th-corn-gangg/"" target=""_blank"">Th' Corn Gangg</a>, his much maligned hip-hop project. After that, we received records from side projects including Reefer and Human Highway. At the moment he's headlining for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"" target=""_blank"">Mister Heavenly</a>, a recently announced supergroup that also includes members of Modest Mouse and Man Man, and Diamonds just released <i>I Am an Attic</i>, a solo album, by way of his Bandcamp page for a price of your choosing.</p>
<p>While it doesn't come with the pre-packaged, stylistic framework of, say, Human Highway (read: Young, Neil; 1970s folk and country), <i>I Am An Attic</i> does scan like pure Diamonds: whether he's trafficking in serpentine guitar licks or screwballing sound effects and synths, there's an unmistakable sneer to it all. That said, you're also hearing him here at his most muted and still, which doesn't make for as compelling a listen as that might promise on paper. This is an unusually reined-in record, one whose spartan arrangements tend to register more as scraps or free-floating ruminations than exercises in restraint. Take opener ""Attic"", with its plumes of Theremin, crystalline guitar work, croaked-up vocals, lightly-applied layers of keys and synth: It all seems to appear and then dissolve in just two very forgettable minutes. Diamonds, as it turns out, is most effective when spontaneous. Here, he's sleepwalking.</p>
<p>When he does work up some energy, the results are terrific. ""You Must Be Choking"" is an at-times majestic and unsettling highlight that, despite cribbing the vocal melody from ""Silent Night"", does well by working in a few unexpected jolts of volume. ""Used to Be Funny"" flirts with a ""Stairway to Heaven"" reference before erupting into a stormy mess of industrial oompah. Interestingly, the recording quality throughout is quite good, forsaking the sort of raw, flash-fried (see also: lo-fi) qualities that you might expect from a potentially free solo record. And though closer ""Fade Out"" plays to its title, what's there is ripe: a set of high-arching guitar melodies fan out over a creamy organ track, a sprinkling of bells that mirror at times the sound of Diamond harmonizing with himself. It sounds like an idea that could segue into something great.</p></div>"|15752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15752-i-am-an-attic/|6.4|David Bevan

He's still making muffled, eerie pop akin to the private visions of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence and the homemade pop of New Zealand artisans Alastair Galbraith and Graeme Jefferies. His voice is still central, filled with downbeat subtlety, and his songs still mix classic melody and fuzzy obscurity in a way that's both focused and loosely inspired.</p>
<p>There's something different about <i>Through Donkey Jaw</i>, though. Its 14 songs are sharper and fuller, with quicker access to your brain's pleasure center. The simple explanation would be that McMahon formed a band upon moving back to America from China after the release of <i>DIA</i>, which would iikely make his songs sound bigger. But my guess is his improvement comes from something even simpler-- just by keeping at it, McMahon naturally got better at what he already did well.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, <i>Through Donkey Jaw</i>'s forward steps are apparent immediately on hypnotic opener ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pNQArLbQXQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baba Yaga""</a>. Over a trembling guitar line and primitive drumming, McMahon moves gradually from a solemn moan to a possessed croon. ""You know that I, I lie,"" he howls, as if he's not so much admitting this to someone as figuring it out himself. Similar introspection recurs throughout the record. ""I don't knock on no doors/ I'm quietly shared/ I'm for people who know,"" he chants on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/1765-amen-dunes/2843-christopher/"" target=""_blank"">Christopher</a>"", over a wash of beat and reverb that's like a tangent to the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"".</p>
<p>A classic group that <i>Through Donkey Jaw </i>evokes even more often is the Velvet Underground. (The album ends with a 10-minute song actually called ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", but its wordless noise is more like a VU jam than the Beatles' original). There are a few specific instances to point to-- ""Gem Head"" sounds like a bedroom-recorded version of ""Run Run Run""-- but where McMahon most connects with the VU is in using repetitive rhythms and raw edges to turn hooks into mantras. Take ""Jill"", a shimmering jam that's somehow catchy, even when he closes with the desperate chant, ""I don't want to give in."" Again, introspection is key; McMahon catches your brain by inspecting his own. Think of <i>Through Donkey Jaw </i>as an out sound from deep within.</p></div>"|15760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15760-through-donkey-jaw/|7.5|Marc Masters

But not many artists, especially in the Internet era, show up with such a well-developed aesthetic (a very foggy, of-the-moment variation on mainstream radio's slow jams) and something as self-assured as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/""><i>House of Balloons</i></a> mixtape. And those that do probably don't have a Drake co-sign and such a carefully managed cloak of anonymity. Months later, all we really know about the Weeknd is that there's a singer named Abel Tesfaye with an earthy The-Dream-like voice and a lecherous persona that's both repellent and compelling. We've seen a few smoky, black and white photos disseminated via Tumblr that perfectly fit the music's bad vibes; there have been a couple of live dates; and apparently, the project has two associated producers helping to craft a sprawling, drugged-up R&amp;B sound: Doc McKinney, best known for Esthero's Breath From Another and another guy named Illangelo. Beyond that and a handful of ""unofficial"" but suspiciously high-budget videos, we have the music on these two mixtapes.</p>
<p>Though there's less breathing space on <i>Thursday</i>, and fewer melodic hooks, it still feels of a piece with <i>House of Balloons</i>. There's the same ineffably skeezy vibe and a genuine sense of the album-as-journey, brought upon by smart sequencing and Tesfaye's willingness to complicate his devilish, drug-addled Lothario persona. The production is slightly harsher and streaked with violence, befitting the lyrical content-- ""Life of the Party"", the best and most disturbing song here, is based around doom-like guitar riffs that suggest something truly terrible about to happen. The guitars burst forth during Tesfaye's mocking chorus (""you're the life of the party""), sung as he casually convinces a girl into a group-sex situation. Other songs are tinged with similarly abrasive sounds: drill'n'bass noises rattle around in the background of opening track ""Lonely Star""; ""Rolling Stone"" begins with a blustery chunk of heavily processed guitar; and the final track, ""Heaven or Las Vegas"" (not a Cocteau Twins cover) features a late-song interruption by screeching effects and heavy echo. For contrast , the only jarring touch to the production on the fairly one-note <i>House of Balloons</i> is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12148-house-of-balloons/"">title track</a>'s Siouxsie and the Banshees sample. So the world here, in addition to being more sonically varied, feels just a little darker and a little more dangerous.</p>
<p>Oh yeah-- and Drake shows up on this one. He delivers an end-of-song verse on ""The Zone"", very much in his ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12205-im-on-one-ft-drake-rick-ross-and-lil-wayne/"">I'm on One</a>"" mode. Which means he's full of confidence and rapping in a manner that lurches forward and then slows-up, teasing his melodic, every-dude croon but never giving into those R&amp;B impulses. The Weeknd and Drake have been linked for a while now, first through a series of blog and Twitter co-signs and now as proper collaborators, so it's interesting to finally hear the superstar step into this far more debauched world. Surprisingly, he remains himself, talking about not having fun at a strip club (""Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole"") and later on, advising a groupie to ""be you."" Even when Drake seemingly stumbles into an encounter in which he does indeed, fuck ""your girlfriend,"" he isn't devilishly smiling about it, and there's no question of consent as there often is on many of the Weeknd's drug-fueled seduction songs. The introduction of anything resembling an ethical point of view is jarring and underlines the stark differences between these collaborators.</p>
<p>Drake gets mileage out of being conflicted and in over his head, while Tesfaye sings from the perspective of an unabashed creep who doesn't care what people think, and waits for the moment when everything's at a tipping point and people's guards are down. Part of the odd appeal to the Weeknd's music is that by spending this much time with a predator, the vulnerable inconsistencies in an image trying hard to armor itself with coke, pills, and cynicism start to show through. Repeating the days of the week on ""Thursday"" slowly comes off as pretty pathetic, even a tad OCD, and ""Gone"", a hypnotic, purposefully stagnant epic, feels a lot like being at a party near a guy content to tell you how fucked up he is, over and over again. The gorgeous ""Rolling Stone"" contains meta references to Tesfaye ""smoking til' [he] can't hit another note"" and concerns that his mystery is fading. It's almost sympathetic, though it's just as likely that this is some new, more nefarious form of seduction by way of self-deprecation; after all, the last words crooned on the album are, ""I am God.""</p>
<p>When <i>Thursday</i> comes to an end, you have to wonder where the Weeknd go from here. This is the danger of anonymity and telling of the way Internet hype programs our cheapest impulses: We're ready to ask about the next thing before this other thing, even though it's quite good and rewarding, has come to an end. The Weeknd, however, know what they're doing, and so, in a few months, another new release, <i>Echoes of Silence</i>, is due to arrive, and our strange, dysfunctional relationship with their damaged R&amp;B will start all over again.</p></div>"|15754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/|7.9|Brandon Soderberg

Their debut LP, <i>Hearts</i>, does not. Late-period Smog-- and, by extension, Bill Callahan's solo albums-- are often built upon earthy instrumentation, understated vocals, emotional stoicism, and a wry sense of humor. All of these qualities are absent from <i>Hearts</i>. On <i>Hearts</i>, the Swedish duo of Maria Lindén and Fredrick Balck immerse themselves in homemade shoegaze, the kind that's made by computers for computers. It's an approach and sound that's crossed language barriers for the past 20 or so years as bands strive to approximate <i>Loveless</i> without the benefit of a label they can bankrupt in the process.</p>
<p>The form had something of a rebirth with M83's <i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</i>: At the time of its release, the beauty the album achieved with seemingly cheap synths felt shockingly novel. As Matt LeMay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5925-top-50-albums-of-2003/5/"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>: by 2003 ""a gorgeous wall of melodic guitar noise just [didn't] seem so impressive anymore."" I Break Horses can do this sort of pretty, and you'll view <i>Hearts </i> as frustrating or effortlessly pleasing depending on your ability to see doing only ""pretty"" as an admirable endgame. However, the album's first two tracks do provide a legitimately thrilling and visceral experience.</p>
<p>Opener ""Winter Beats"" fades in on a trebly arpeggio that spins like an LED pinwheel over sustained, 8-bit major chords: Until Lindén's heavy-lidded vocals enter, it's nearly a chiptune revival. Soon thereafter we get the anticipatory thwack of the first synth snare-- the part, toward the end, where it locks into a near-double-time beat. That, coupled with an echo of MBV's glide guitar, add up to an emulation of controlled flight that has me thinking of how roller coasters work on an elemental level, how meticulously engineers leave no hairpin turn or stomach-rattling drop to chance. It's a marvel of aerodynamic design. The title track, on the other hand, has more of a pulsating build, one that's no less overwhelming, Lindén and Balck swathing themselves in sumptuous sonic fabrics only to tear it all apart. It's not entirely without precedent--<i> </i>in addition to <i>Dead Cities</i>, there's the lo-fi abstraction of 4-track dream-pop projects like Astrobrite or the points on Fuck Buttons' <i>Tarot Sport </i> where the catharsis of noise and rave dovetailed. For about nine minutes, I Break Horses achieve a similarly fanged beauty.</p>
<p>Then there's the moment where ""Hearts"" fades out and ""Wired"" introduces itself with a guitar entirely shorn of processing. ""Wired""'s hardly a bum track-- it's got something of a roadhouse blues bump that's every bit as surprising as the sudden pitch-shifting that warps the final minute-- but it is a turning point. The rest of <i>Hearts</i> simply swims with the current using a kind of aerobicized take on shoegaze that streamlines the sawtooths into soft curves, and merges emotional polarity into a constant and generally pleasant buzz. It's music you might hear in a CB2 furniture store-- languorous and luxurious in tempos and tone, but without any sort of sentiment outside of the swooning used to implant the idea in your brain that you might have sex or do drugs on that reasonably priced but fashionable couch.</p>
<p>Lyrics rarely mean anything in this realm, but you can take titles like ""I Kill Your Love, Baby"", ""Pulse"", and ""Empty Bottles"" as guidelines. And, as if echoing the album title, a near-constant kick drum thump serves as a sonic equivalent of the heart at the center of these songs, tracks that pump steadily without being upset by much. The snare rattles that punctuate ""Cancer"" gives the impression that it's on the verge of some sort of breakthrough, but not enough tension builds to take it there. Later, as closer ""No Way Outro"" starts to ramp itself up with a minute of regal drum rolls, <i>Hearts </i>just fades out.</p>
<p>I'd hate to think that I Break Horses' capacity for magic is contained completely within their distortion pedals, but ""Winter Beats"" and ""Hearts"" sound marooned from the majority of the record, sort of like a pair of oddly placed remixes (as well as cruel reminders of heights never again achieved). Really, considering the majority of <i>Hearts</i>' unbothered lushness, I Break Horses' adoption of the name of one of Smog's most intense songs doesn't seem quite right. Judging from the material we get after those first two tracks, ""Butterflies Drowned in Wine"" would've been a more appropriate way to show their appreciation.</p></div>"|15747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15747-hearts/|7.2|Ian Cohen

On a certain level, that's inevitable. There's nothing new about what Wooden Shjips do, and we can hear the quotation marks in the band's music even if they didn't intend to put them there. All the bands named above, in one way or another, made visceral, forbidding rock that drew much of its power through stretching-to-infinity repetition. When I hear it, another name springs to mind: Lungfish, if the great Baltimore astral-punk band had made music for the Camaro-cruising goons in <i>Dazed and Confused</i> (and if they'd had a way less distinctive singer, but that's another story). Wooden Shjips turn the crunchy choogle of 1970s boogie-rock into isolation-chamber space-out fare. When it connects, that's a powerful formula, though it's still a formula.</p>
<p>For a band that thrives on eternal repetition, Wooden Shjips have made some impressive strides toward approachability from album to album, and <i>West</i> is by far their biggest leap yet. On previous records, the band would be content to ride a single chord long enough to turn your brain into goo. But the tracks on <i>West</i> are comparatively compact (the longest top out around seven minutes), and they often come equipped with riffs and melodies that don't sound too terribly far-removed from classic-rock radio fare. The recording itself is warmer and cleaner than anything they've done. Most of the songs blast off into glorious solos near the end. I'm pretty sure I heard a tambourine on at least one song. In short, it's the first Wooden Shjips record that your stoner uncle might not hate.</p>
<p>Still, the band is very much doing what it does on <i>West</i>. Even with its increased focus on classic-rock virtues, the album isn't really a collection of riffs and wails and choruses; it's more a muscular sort of vibe-out-- badass ambient music, if you will. As hard as the band can rock, expansive nod-out music is still its focus, and the album works best when you give yourself over entirely to its pounding grandeur. Frontman Ripley Johnson sings in a narcoleptic mutter that never displays the slightest bit of feeling, and his numbed monotone never disturbs the mood by leaping out of the mix to grab you. The band deserves credit for sticking to the simple purity of its own sound, but its music seems unlikely to cause the sort of life-changing epiphanies sometimes created by those bands I listed in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, the album might end with ""Flight"", its best and longest track, a deep fuzzed-out groove with a nagging organ line that builds to a cathartic guitar-solo flare-up. It's the track that most perfectly exemplifies the band's sound, and it works well enough to leave you dazed by the time it's over. But the album keeps going for two more songs-- the relatively sprightly ""Looking Out"" and the vaguely puzzling ""Rising"". Now, I'm not sure if all of ""Rising"" is played backward or if it's just the vocals and the drums. I'm guessing it's probably the whole thing. It's like the band challenged itself, not by varying its usual zone-out style but by seeing if it could achieve that same effect when the tape machine is running backward. And the weird thing is that they basically get there. ""Rising"" is by no means the best song on the album, but it won't cause you to jump up and turn it off when it comes on, either. So that's Wooden Shjips for you: a band more inclined to come by its signature sound through ridiculous means than to switch up that sound more than a little bit.</p></div>"|15714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15714-west/|7.3|Tom Breihan

In 2007, Olsen and fellow Seattle resident Sonya  Wescott released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10416-in-camera/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Camera</i></a> as Arthur &amp; Yu. The pair took cues from a  narrow set of influences-- the Velvet Underground's drowsy pop-leaning  moments, the sunglasses-cool work of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra--  but the results felt full and well executed. Four years later, Arthur &amp; Yu seem to be on a hiatus, and Olsen's got a new  gig: the hearty folk-pop project <a href=""http://hardlyart.com/goldleaves.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gold Leaves</a>, who, like A&amp;Y  before it, is releasing its debut LP, <i>The Ornament</i>, on the increasingly  reliable Sub Pop offshoot Hardly Art.</p>
<p>The label affiliation provides the opportunity  for a family affair, as Papercuts frontman Jason Quever lent a hand with  production and instrumental flourishes. As a result,  the record carries shades of Quever's own distant, faded brand of indie  pop-- only, Olsen's compositions sound rounder and warmer than anything  Papercuts have ever released. The fact that the album opens with the  immense, elliptical ""The Silver Lining"" only hints at the full-bellied  heat contained on the rest of the record. <i>In Camera</i> was a charming  effort, but also a relatively small-sounding one; <i>The Ornament</i> is the  exact opposite, with melodies that stretch across highways and drums so hollow you could live within them.</p>
<p><i>The Ornament</i>'s expansiveness owes a fair bit to  Olsen's voice, which sounds like it's been given an emotional B12 shot. His lyrics are prettily-- albeit somewhat emptily-- evocative, richly textured, and  his tonal pronunciation (the ""PO-lice cars"" of ""Hanging Window"") adds  temporal sentimentality to his words. Any narcotized simplicity  Olsen previously possessed as a vocalist is basically over and done: Honestly, he may have one of the most flat-out pretty voices in contemporary indie  rock.</p>
<p>Granted, the field for strong vocals in today's indie isn't exactly a crowded one, although the above  descriptions will likely remind many of another certain Sub Pop-signed  bearded belter (hint: rhymes with ""Bobbin Plecknold""). Like Fleet Foxes,  Gold Leaves are doing nothing new-- this sound is  comfortably familiar, like a rocking chair or stretch of well-trodden  road. It's remarkable how well Olsen wears this new sound, though, to  the point that the few cuts that reach back to his days in Arthur &amp; Yu  (""Honeymoon"", ""The Companion"") can't help but feel slight by  comparison. But there's a twist, as the swaying throb of ""Honeymoon""  yields a single sentiment besting the emotional distance of Olsen's  previous work, repeated like a mantra: ""Come back to me."" Take it how  you will-- me, I'm hoping it means we won't have to wait so long to hear  from him again.</p></div>"|15744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15744-the-ornament/|7.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

Working, as they put it, ""with no metronome,"" they went into <i>the Still Living</i> sessions to stretch out their limber melodies, tamp down their nervous energies, and wipe away some of the murk of their earlier work. That they did; the airy <i>Still Living</i> brings their gently unfurling, sunlit melodies and towering blasts of harmony into sharp focus. <i>Still Living</i>'s cross-section of Byrdsian folk-psych, loose-limbed 80s indie rock, and fizzy Beach Boys-derived harmonies in the nouveau <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">Fleet Foxes</a> mold finds the quietly confident Ganglians nimbly folding in one sliver of melody after another until their songs just glimmer. With an album's worth of agile tunes at their disposal and Dirty Projectors associate Robby Moncrieff behind the boards, <i>Still Living</i> slips by with an elegant ease that seemed beyond them even on their two fine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13305-ganglians-monster-head-room/"" target=""_blank"">2009 efforts</a>.</p>
<p>For all its musical poise, <i>Still Living</i> stumbles right out of the gate and-- vocally, anyway-- occasionally struggles to regain its footing. ""This is a sad sad song for all you sad sad people,"" Ryan Grubbs lets go at the album's onset, and this overeager announcement proves memorable in all the ways they didn't intend. What follows is, thankfully, a tad subtler, as Grubbs' lyrics recede more often than they pop, often buried in a sea of enunciation-divebombing harmony. Ganglians aren't alone in their fondness for the swelling, Beach Boys-derived vocal pileup, as filtered through the aforementioned animal bands. They're fine enough singers, but after a while, <i>Still Living</i>'s reliance  on ornate vocal kumbayas seem to weigh down its willowy music. The chorus of ""whoah-oh-ohs"" that sets off ""Jungle"" is close kin to Fleet Foxes' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-CEfY9CDLw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ragged Wood</a>"", and ""Evil Weave"" isn't the only number that breaks into a round; lovely stuff, but brought out this frequently, the distinctions between songs-- and, occasionally, syllables-- begin to blur</p>
<p>But if you can accuse Ganglians of anything after <i>Still Living</i>'s opening salvo, it's drowning in their own loveliness; not the worst problem to have, really. Though they may nick liberally from fairly familiar sources-- the clear-eyed but slightly sneaky melodies of the Feelies, R.E.M., and Galaxie 500, ornate symphonic-pop vocalisms of past and present greats, and an indie-popper's low-key mentality-- their crosshatching of influences has enough finesse to make easy comparisons seem beside the point. Ornate but never ostentatious, Moncrieff's production brings clarity and fluidity to the proceedings; even the occasional overreach does better on coherence than their earlier, more scattershot stuff. Even <i>Still Living</i>'s wealth of straight-up guitar-pop isn't quite so straight-up after a handful of listens, the bends in the road ahead becoming clear as day after a few passes. Though they could still stand to pull back on the vocal fanfares, brushing away some of the gunk that mottled up their earlier records and doubling down on melody each open up new avenues in their sound, and <i>Still Living</i> finds Ganglians delivering on their early promise while stepping confidently toward whatever's next.</p></div>"|15755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15755-still-living/|6.9|Paul Thompson

But while he has since emerged as the autonomous creative force behind the prog-pop ensemble Islands (tellingly, it was his face alone that graced the cover of 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13485-vapours/"" target=""_blank"">Vapours</a></i>) and recently released a low key solo album under the name Nick Diamonds (<a href=""http://nickdiamonds.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am an Attic</i></a>), Thorburn has not forgotten what made the Unicorns so special: the alternately cheeky and tense dynamic between himself and ex-bandmate Alden Penner. As such, Thorburn has never shied away from the opportunity to match wits with a creative foil, teaming up with Jim Guthrie for the countrified Human Highway detour and, now, squaring off against Ryan Kattner-- aka Honus Honus of Philly carnival barkers Man Man-- in Mister Heavenly.</p>
<p>Thorburn, of course, is no stranger to high-concept side projects (namely, his flirtations with hip-hop in Th' Corn Gangg and Reefer) and, on paper, Mister Heavenly initially reads like a similarly orchestrated lark. The band-- rounded out by Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer-- was reportedly devised around a self-explanatory sub-genre they dubbed ""doom wop."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40873-michael-cera-joins-mister-heavenly/"" target=""_blank"">The stunt-casting of actor Michael Cera</a> as the band's bassist during their spring 2011 tour reinforced the assumption that Mister Heavenly would be a casual, low-stakes endeavor with which Thorburn and Kattner could amuse themselves before returning to their main gigs. But Mister Heavenly's Sub Pop debut proves to be something far more lasting and rewarding: Rather than serve as an outlet for their well-documented eccentric streaks, Thorburn and Kattner's good-cop/bad-cop dynamic yields some of the most tightly focused, immediately engaging songs either principal has produced.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's Plummer's band that seems to wield the most influence on the outset, with Thorburn's ominously quiet verses on the opening ""Bronx Sniper"" yielding to an immodest, un-mousey grunge crunch and an especially Isaac Brock-ian howl from Kattner. But, as bracing an introduction as it is, the song's angst-rock ballast does not provide the best showcase of Mister Heavenly's charms. These are more readily revealed when the band settle down and put their modernist spin on early, pre-Beatles rock'n'roll balladry and 1960s tropical pop. Parallel-universe golden-oldies like ""I Am a Hologram"", ""Diddy Eyes"", and ""Hold My Hand"" may not fully live up to the transgressive promise of the ""doom wop"" descriptor but, like fellow 1950s-rock enthusiasts Black Lips and King Khan in their gentler moments, Mister Heavenly approach their AM-radio inspirations with just the right balance of devotion and deviance. (To wit, on the winsome title-track-cum-band-mission-statement ""Mister Heavenly"", Thorburn is not so much claiming to be the man of your dreams as resigning himself to the impossibility of living up to the matinee-idol ideal.)</p>
<p><i>Out of Love</i>'s playful spirit sometimes crosses the line into unnecessary indulgence-- the rocksteady rhythm of ""Reggae Pie"" sounds like it'd be fun to groove on in the practice space, but probably didn't need to be featured as the album's longest track (complete with false ending), while the 98-second song that actually bears the title ""Doom Wop"" doesn't even attempt to honor either half of the equation. (Oddly, its sludgy slop-rock sounds uncannily like a tossed-off Ty Segall demo.) However, at no point does it feel like the players are simply using Mister Heavenly as a dumping ground for leftover song scraps they couldn't work into their primary projects: Every song here comes off like a true, collaborative union of the singers' singular personalities, with Thorburn's calm, childlike voice and Kattner's wizened old-soul rasp trading verses and choruses in surprisingly complementary fashion. The effect is mutually corrupting-- by the time we reach the wonderfully warped pen-pal exchange ""Pineapple Girl"", Thorburn sounds like the creepy one while Kattner acts as the stabilizing force. Really, no one would ever accuse Islands or Man Man of lacking character and presence, but once Thorburn and Kattner return to their bands after this dalliance, you'll be excused for thinking they'll sound a little bit incomplete without one another.</p></div>"|15746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15746-out-of-love/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Here, the music's poignant rush came quickly: We're told their debut single ""Harsh Realm"" was recorded after the band played a total of six shows. The fatalistic croon of singer/songwriter Molly Hamilton has already garnered plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"">Hope Sandoval</a> comparisons. It would be remiss not to mention those here, as Hamilton's phrasing is often nearly identical to her most obvious influence, but there's enough variation in mood and texture to give this project a weight and balance all of its own.</p>
<p>Much of the credit is due to the versatile guitar lines traded between Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas. At times there's a hollowed-out starkness and foreboding to the playing reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Ennio Morricone</a>'s spaghetti western soundtracks (""Puritan""); at others there's a meshing of hippy idealism and influences extracted from bad-vibes garage rock not dissimilar to <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Love</a> at their peak (see the pleasingly atonal guitar solo that ripples through ""Nightcrawlers""). The latter even bears a moody 1950s tenor that sounds like Alex Zhang Hungtai of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"">Dirty Beaches</a> with the filth cleaned out of his fingernails. Anyone looking to wallow in 1990s nostalgia will find much to gorge on, too-- touchstones from that decade come thick and fast.  For instance, when Hamilton's not channeling Sandoval, and when the band crawls out of the doldrums into more upbeat territory (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12273-gun-shy/"">""Gun Shy""</a>, ""Half Awake""), she often resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2636-madder-rose/"">Madder Rose</a> singer Mary Lorson.</p>
<p>The skill with which Widowspeak assimilates those parts into alluring song structures is what prevents this from being an exercise in tributary. There's an ache to ""Harsh Realm"" that's all their own, the central vocal line (""I always think about you"") bearing a downplayed creepiness that suggests Hamilton knows a thing or two about the ill effects of obsessive love. The one-two punch of ""Gun Shy"" and ""Hard Times"" are where the band hits its peak, the former combining their natural wistfulness with bouts of polished-up <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Link+Wray"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link Wray</a> guitar twang that wouldn't sound out of place on the soundtrack to Tom DiCillo's <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104567/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Suede</a></i>. On ""Hard Times"" they bend everything around a featherlight pop framework that provides a perfectly melancholy backbone to Hamilton's naturally listless demeanor: It has the right amount of sun and shade much of <i>Widowspeak</i> possesses, the lightness of touch in the arrangement preventing the songwriting from toppling over into unpalatable sorrow.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don't get that balance right-- on ""Fir Coat"" it sounds like the song is racing away from Hamilton, and the closing ""Ghost Boy"" is built around the kind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Moe Tucker</a>-inspired drumming that feels tired in the wake of legions of Brooklyn bands mining the sound over the past few years. But this is clearly the work of a group still finding its way, hammering out the kinks in public view. There's a potential here that could lead to something with a great deal more gravity. It's to Widowspeak's credit that they do make this first taste a brief peak behind the curtain: Five of the 10 songs don't go over the three-minute mark, and the entire runtime's barely half an hour. The economical use of space makes <i>Widowspeak</i> feel like a chance meeting with a pining stranger, one who spills their guts then vanishes from sight just as they're beginning to make an impression.</p></div>"|15735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15735-widowspeak/|7.5|Nick Neyland

It's a remarkable song, hard-headed and unsentimental, and singer-songwriter Patterson Hood sings his throat ragged to convey Smalley's mortal fear as well as his mortal defiance. ""The Living Bubba"" is more about the musician than the music, so the Truckers play those last notes almost reluctantly, as if only the song were keeping Smalley alive. As an opener, it signals both the high stakes in the band's output as well as the general subject of <i>Ugly Buildings, Whores &amp; Politicians</i>: These are songs about the dedication, determination, integrity, and stubbornness it takes to be in a hard-working, hard-touring band.</p>
<p>If the Truckers were at all cynical, or if their songs lectured about their subjects, <i>Ugly Buildings</i> would be unbearable. But any lessons they impart in songs like ""Carl Perkins' Cadillac"" (about label/artist relations) or ""Outfit"" (about fatherly advice) sound more like notes to themselves-- milemarkers on what Hood might call ""the righteous path""-- and allow this collection to cohere into something more than a career retrospective. While the tracklist seems too short at a mere 16 songs, <i>Ugly Buildings</i> still attests to the breadth of the band's music, which ranges in style from gritty rock to Southern soul and ranges in subject from racial politics to recession worries (""The Righteous Path"" may be the best song ever written about class distinctions).</p>
<p>Their catalog is unique in American music, an almost literary endeavor with none of the pretensions such a description might entail. They give voice to the losers, tragic heroes, and everymen beaten down by hard circumstances, allowing each character his or her dignity. Most yuk-and-pluck alt-country bands of the 1990s would have approached a song like ""Bulldozers &amp; Dirt"" from 1999's <i>Pizza Deliverance</i> with a smirking irony, making a joke of its white-trash subject matter. It's sung, after all, from the perspective of a man clumsily flirting with his ex's teenage daughter. Hood paints him as a real and relatable person, rather than a cornpone lecher, leaving all his contradictions intact.</p>
<p>The Truckers approach these people with care and even respect, which is a crucial lesson for any storyteller. Another one: Write what you know. Hood, Mike Cooley, and Jason Isbell-- the three main songwriters, although Isbell has since gone solo-- pack these songs with well-observed details that don't just sell the songs but suggest a larger world where music might save your life or lead you further astray: ""Rock'n'roll means well but it can't help telling young boys lies,"" Cooley sings over the boogie guitar of ""Marry Me"". The Truckers have been trying to untangle all those lies and to tell some truths for 13 years now, which makes closer ""A World of Hurt"" sound better in this context than it ever did on 2006's lackluster <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2512-a-blessing-and-a-curse/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Blessing and a Curse</i></a>. ""Remember,"" Hood sings, ""it ain't too late to take a deep breath and throw yourself into it with everything you got."" Such a direct exhortation might sound a bit corny, but the best advice is often the simplest.</p></div>"|15742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15742-ugly-buildings-whores-politicians-greatest-hits-1998-2009/|8.2|Stephen M.

It's an apt image, because <i>Wigry</i>, like any live album, is at best an approximation of the original event it attempts to reproduce. The performance that lead to this recording looks particularly impressive. The dozen-strong European ensemble performed this music in a church in Poland, with each member given a separate loudspeaker and seated beside each other across a long table.  Participants include AMM guitarist Keith Rowe, IDM pioneer Christian Fennesz, Dutch improviser Gert Jan-Prins, Editions Mego founder Peter Rehberg (aka Pita), British electronic wizard Kaffe Matthews, and drone maestro Rafael Toral. Despite the busy schedules of the members' individual pursuits, this group has somehow worked together for 13 years, and the double-LP <i>Wigry</i> is their seventh release. Which probably explains why, even though the album consists of four side-long, presumably uncut pieces, very little here sounds like unfamiliar artists forced to grope and grasp at ways to listen and respond to each other.</p>
<p>That's not to say that every second is compelling. But the tones and moods are remarkably consistent, even when the activity lulls or the sounds are unsurprising. Perhaps the church's natural acoustics left an indelible stamp; if so, the musicians take good advantage of that, trusting that their actions will become interactions via the glue of the surroundings. Whatever the cause, all the sounds echo and bounce with an unfailing blue-grey hue, so that when the sparse cricket-chirp halfway through side three crests into a wall of hum, you can hear the original sonic raindrops inside the gathering storm.</p>
<p>There are some other identifiable crescendos spread around the album's four sides, but what makes <i>Wigry</i> most interesting is also what might frustrate some listeners. Sometimes the group's progress seems oddly arc-less, lacking in discernible momentum. Yet even when the album feels static, everything remains drenched in atmosphere and texture, like a storm cloud frozen in the sky. To me, MIMEO are best when they make motion feel like stasis and vice versa, and that paradox takes hold quite often here. But even if that part of the experience seems too abstract, simply getting to wet your head with <i>Wigry</i>'s misty ambiance makes it worth a dip.</p></div>"|15741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15741-wigry/|7.2|Marc Masters

Before Luke Temple self-recorded his murky, self-sampledelic 2009 debut as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12724-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Here We Go Magic</i></a> (the only release from the project thus far that features Temple all by his lonesome), he made two solo albums that mixed chamber-pop experimentation and singer/songwriter fare: 2005's <i>Hold a Match for a Gasoline World</i> and 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11113-snowbeast/"" target=""_blank""><i>Snowbeast</i></a>. While he was recording <i>Here We Go Magic</i>, he simultaneously made another solo album with a few friends helping him out, including future Here We Go Magic member Michael Bloch and Glass Ghost's Eliot Krimsky. When Here We Go Magic started gaining steam and turned into a full-band/full-time concern, Temple shelved the results, <i>Don't Act Like You Don't Care</i>, until the present day.</p>
<p>An early working title for the album was <i>The Country Record</i>, and that title speaks volumes. The majority of <i>Don't Act Like You Don't Care</i> is comprised of uncomplicated ditties, both jangly (""Ophelia"") and bummed out (""So Long, So Long""). Temple experimented plenty on <i>Gasoline World</i> (<i>Snowbeast</i>, too); there are fewer risks taken overall here, which makes the record a fascinating window into an alternate-- and, to me, not totally desirable-- route his music could have taken had Here We Go Magic not attracted attention in the first place.</p>
<p>It's especially likely that listeners approaching this album are the ones who were initially ensnared by HWGM's increased profile; for them, potential (albeit minor) revelations are in store. Although Here We Go Magic's fleshed-out second album, last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14318-pigeons/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pigeons</i></a>, was far from the gestation period at the time of this LP's recording, you can pick out strands of that album's wooly, gently weird genetic code in the mutant folk of ""More Than Muscle"" and the unsettling twists and turns of ""Weekend Warrior"". <i>Don't Act</i>'s sparse closing track, ""Luck Part"", slowly opens up with dark ambience and swaying unease. It'd be interesting to hear how these tracks would sound as played by Temple and his band now; they certainly fit in with his latest gig's M.O.</p>
<p><i>Don't Act Like You Don't Care</i> is enjoyable but fails in key respects. It's poorly sequenced-- sprightly cuts up front with the slow, samey stuff crammed in the rear-- and the four-tracked production means that a decent amount of the material sounds like it never quite made it past the ""basement demo"" phase. In the three years since the recording of this album, Temple's made considerable leaps as a songwriter; a bit of present-day woodshedding would have likely benefited this material, which was recorded in a pair of four-hour sessions. Instead, this odd and intermittently pleasurable artifact just kinda sits there, an unintentional rebuke to the artist that orphaned this poor thing.</p></div>"|15726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15726-dont-act-like-you-dont-care/|6.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

Ramblin'. Driftin'. Movin'. Strugglin'. <a href=""http://www.thewarondrugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The War on Drugs</a> frontman Adam Granduciel is all of these things on <i>Slave Ambient</i>, the Philly outfit's second full-length release. Given these professed feelings of restlessness and uneasiness, it's no surprise the band's hypno-roots-rock is all about forward motion and momentum, favoring steady, locomotive rhythms that rarely pause or waver-- elements that reinforce Granduciel's efforts to make his problems disappear in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p><i>Slave Ambient </i>shares several qualities with its 2008 predecessor, <i>Wagonwheel Blues</i>: a sense of open-freeway abandon and splendid isolation set against a glorious expanse; an unabashed admiration for FM-radio Americana icons of yore (Springsteen, Dylan, Petty); and a willingness to buff the band's gritty edges with serene, if randomly deployed, instrumentals and reprises. In other words, the War on Drugs still deal in ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11969-wagonwheel-blues/"" target=""_blank"">excellent road trip music</a>,"" as Pitchfork's Stephen Deusner described <i>Wagonwheel Blues</i>. However, this time Granduciel is less interested in documenting the environmental and economic travesties he sees unfolding outside his window as he is the internal dramas swirling around in his head. Nearly every song here expresses some desire to get outta town and start anew.</p>
<p>The band responds by amplifying the more textural qualities of their sound: dreamy synth drones, liquefied electric-guitar leads that linger and fade like raindrops rolling down the windshield, and the most tasteful use of smooth saxophone this side of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank"">Kaputt</a></i>. (Interestingly enough, <i>Slave Ambient</i> was recorded without founding member Kurt Vile, who applies a similarly lysergic approach on his latest solo release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Smoke Ring For My Halo</a></i>-- for fans of rustic rock'n'roll, the two albums collectively yield an  embarrassment of riches not experienced since Wilco and Son Volt  released <i>A.M.</i> and <i>Trace</i> in tandem.) When the band's wide-screened psychedelic flourishes are fused with Granduciel's well-worn Dylan- and Petty-isms, songs like ""Brothers"" and ""It's Your Destiny"" wondrously conjure nothing so much as the Traveling Wilburys recording for mid-1980s 4AD. Or in the case of the excitable ""Baby Missiles"" (a holdover from last year's stop-gap <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14803-future-weather-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Future Weather</a></i> EP), it's as if the Spiritualized and Springsteen albums filed alphabetically next to one another in your record collection had melted together on a hot August afternoon.</p>
<p>But as much as the War on Drugs make music to accompany an escape to something better, they're the sort of band that believes the journey is more important than the destination. The songs on <i>Slave Ambient</i> don't necessarily end in a place very different from where they began, but through subtle sonic manipulations and layering-- like in the last two minutes of opener ""Best Night"", where the guitars, piano, and melodica start to blur into the same blissful wavelength-- they give the impression that a great distance has been traveled. The really amazing thing about the album is how anthemic and affirming it feels despite the near total absence of proper sing-along choruses. Case in point, centerpiece track ""Come to the City"" is all about ascension, rising out of the miasmic haze of preceding interlude ""The Animator"" and gradually accruing all the confidence and verve of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHnXOSxka1Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live Aid-era U2</a>. But rather than work up a chest-thumping, Bono-worthy wail, Granduciel is happy to sit back and ride out the song's dense waves of sound, to prolong the euphoric feeling of anticipation-- the road trip he's soundtracking is very much his own, and he's as much a slave to the ambience as we are.</p></div>"|15733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15733-slave-ambient/|8.3|Stuart Berman

With Gucci frequently in and out of jail, keeping the Brick Squad name and label relevant has mostly fallen on Waka's shoulders, and he's done a more than adequate job, releasing a few legitimate radio hits as well as one of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank"">best rap albums</a> of last year. Waka has also gathered a host of new rappers under Brick Squad's wings-- most notably Slim Dunkin, who appears on <i>Ferrari Boyz </i>twice-- and while likely none of them will end up as stars, the brand extension certainly can't hurt. Waka, of course, was brought along for the ride as Gucci ascended upward, and his success was undoubtedly accelerated by his proximity to Gucci's budding stardom.</p>
<p>What made the partnership work artistically is that their styles are almost completely opposite. At the height of his profligacy, Gucci was penning colorful and singular verses that, from a writing and conceptual standpoint, put him in rap's upper tier. But he also had a keen ear for pop; his best hooks were almost impossibly intricate (arguably even unnecessarily so, considering how much music he gave away for free), and he managed to embed most of his ad-libs in the genre's collective consciousness. Standing in stark contrast, Waka's style is purposefully non-lyrical, and his choruses are often him just shouting a phrase or two-- no less catchy, but still an altogether different tactic. And where Gucci's beats were highly musical, Waka's are often loud and seemingly best fit for head banging. If Gucci painted pictures, Waka looks at a blank canvas and dumps a can of red paint on it. Then maybe breaks it over his knee.</p>
<p>But here's the dirty secret about Waka and Gucci: They've never worked well as collaborators. Though they've now been on dozens of songs together, none ranks in either artist's upper echelon, and many have been an outright bore. On paper, their styles do not mesh, and in practice they don't either. They both sound awkward and out of place on each other's tracks-- Gucci blunts Waka's raw emotion, and Waka leaves little room for Gucci's writerly leanings. That trend doesn't change on <i>Ferrari Boyz</i>, their official commercially released collaborative album.</p>
<p>Most of their collaborations arrived after Waka really blew up, and they've found Gucci heavily drawn to his aesthetic. That can probably be chalked to staying with the hot hand-- basically everyone in rap is flocking to the beats of producers Lex Luger and Southside (who partly owe their success to Waka's), so why go in a different direction? And truly, if you took Gucci's contributions off <i>Ferrari Boyz </i>and replaced them with Brick Squad underlings, you'd probably be looking at something close to <i>Flockaveli</i>'s follow-up.</p>
<p>But that raises another question: If Gucci is worlds better than guys like YG Hootie and Kebo Gotti, shouldn't <i>Ferrari Boyz </i>be as good, if not better, than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank""><i>Flockaveli</i></a>? Theoretically, yes, but it's missing most of the elements that made Waka's solo album so great and so invigorating. Namely, it lacks the manic energy that is Waka's calling card: If it's possible to go through the motions while still mostly shouting, <i>Ferrari Boyz </i>would be a prime example. The album can also get drearily monotonous-- though at times the beats will switch out of the album's minor key template,<i> Ferrari Boyz </i>desperately lacks the standout outliers like ""Fuck the Club Up"" or ""Grove St. Party"" that help buoy <i>Flockaveli</i>.</p>
<p>The album does pick up near the end: ""Too Loyal"" rides a blippy  beat that's maybe the record's most fun production, and it also finds  Gucci retaining some of the playfulness that's always been a part of his  music. ""So Many Things"", the real keeper, is a fluttery track that  finds Gucci singing the album's best hook with an endearingly amateur  whine. (It should come as no surprise as to who is behind both: Fatboi, a  frequent Gucci cohort.)</p>
<p>Though guys like Hootie couldn't hold Gucci's rhyme  book,  they fit perfectly into Waka's aesthetic-- even if they don't rock   anti-skill as a skill nearly as well as he does, they're at least   willing to sound animated. Gucci, in contrast, puts little effort into   his writing here, which is made all the worse by him sounding profoundly   bored, tired, stoned, or some combination of the three. It's a problem   that has plagued a lot of his music recently, but it's a bigger issue   now that he doesn't have the appropriate production to perk, or prop,   him up.

They had just lost a gig on a children's TV show in their native New Zealand because of their name. When they were booked for the performance they'd been called Shaky Hands, but a threat of legal action by the Portland band Shaky Hands forced them to change it. Their somewhat sarcastic choice of a new moniker cost them a payday. It either didn't phase them or motivated them, because when they got on stage, they were nearly out of control. Vocalist Nick Johnston likes to get into the crowd, and his performing style amounts to a cardio workout.</p>
<p>They've grown up quite a bit since then, and though I've heard they're still wild on stage, the music they make in the studio has moved on from their post-punk roots. <i>Hollow</i>, their second LP, sounds much closer to the late-1980s/early-1990s work of British rock bands in the vein of Kitchens of Distinction, the House of Love, and the Trash Can Sinatras. There's a distinctive, clear-toned chime to the guitars, an airy drum sound, and the occasional backing vocal joining Johnston in unison-- it all adds up to something with the feel of that era. It has a dash of classic punk-informed NZ pop like the Bats, too, and should be right in the wheelhouse of anyone who pines for the long-ago days of classic college rock (or simply likes indie rock with a little sweep to it).</p>
<p>The band opens the album deceptively, with a shuffling drum beat similar to the one from Sweet's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9jTnxv0RU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballroom Blitz</a>"". When the rest of the band comes in, it turns to be a soft-hued and propulsive bit of swooning jangle pop, not some kind of rave-up. ""Hollowed Out"" offers an idea of what Echo and the Bunnymen might have sounded like in the mid-80s if Ian McCulloch had taken a less operatic approach to singing, while the band as a whole is at its finest on the slightly psychedelic ""Nausea"": Johnston's slightly flat singing on the verse sets up the key change and lighter tone of the catchy chorus surprisingly well.</p>
<p>""Nausea""'s easy-moving rhythm highlights one of the band's strengths-- they never sound plodding or like they're struggling to push the songs along. The airy recording aids the band's light touch, too-- the album glides by like it's on skates, its 34 minutes whipping by in an instant. The songs on <i>Hollow</i> are modest-- there's no closing epic, and the choruses are catchy but don't aim to be anthems-- but the band seems to have found its true strength here in a sound that's pretty far removed from the implied violence of its name.</p></div>"|15738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15738-hollow/|7.3|Joe Tangari

On 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13350-the-ruminant-band/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Ruminant Band</i></a>, the quartet, lead by seasoned indie sideman Eric D. Johnson (Califone, Vetiver, the Shins), eked up the tempo-- sidelining folksier impulses in favor of gently driving guitar pop that channeled <i>Rumors</i>-era Fleetwood Mac. Two years later, they're back to being mellow.</p>
<p>With <i>Tripper</i>, the group's fifth album, Johnson dials Fruit Bats' pulse back down, favoring spacious and spacey songwriting that sets the lyrics front and center. It's a record full of stories, with Johnson centering most of the tunes around simple narratives and offbeat characters. On the record's opening track, ""Tony the Tripper"", Johnson dreams up a Kerouac-style road trip with a companion who comes across as one part railroad lifer and one part Burning Man refugee. There are troubles along the way-- schizoid episodes and punker crash pads-- but by the chorus, Johnson and his imagined companion usually have things sorted out: ""We was all under the date palm tree/ They left the rolling of one up to me/ Knowing the world might end tomorrow anyway.""</p>
<p>The only problem is that Johnson's tales aren't all that hooky. At least, not enough to buoy <i>Tripper</i>'s soft and moody music. Conflict, resolution, and character development often slip by unnoticed, eased in their passage by the woozy synths and atmospherics that function as the album's rough-spot-smoothing sonic hand lotion. On the reverb-soaked ""Wild Honey"", Johnson's lyrics are placed prominently in the mix-- ""Each empire who inherits the sea, rises and retreats into foam/ In the ash there stirs a seed, empty between what's unseen and unknown""-- but get lost in the woozy ambience. The imagery is rich but abstract, and there's not enough muscle in Johnson's plinking guitar to prop it up.</p>
<p>Johnson fares better when he takes a more casual tone, as on ""Tangie and Ray"", which follows a pair of hippies as they flee society for nature and, by the sound of it, certain doom. ""Now they're one with the dirt, and the mouldering bones and litter leaves,"" he yelps. It's one of <i>Tripper</i>'s more upbeat tunes, benefiting from the full band accompaniment and a driving drum beat. But while the rhythm section makes a difference, it  helps that Johnson is keeping a straightforward narrative. He's better with rogues and riffs than heady prose.</p></div>"|15743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15743-tripper/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

It's an exercise in writing what you know. The band is made up of 19-year-old girls who have known each other since they were six and have been making music together since they were 14. Razika recorded <i>Program 91</i> over the course of one year on weekends, to work around their school schedule. They've had the privilege not only of being compared to the Slits, but also of pointing out that the comparison's kind of sexist, since they sound nothing like the Slits. If you're the type who wonders why you weren't more proactive when you were younger, avoid this album.</p>
<p><i>Program 91</i>'s  basic makeup is spiky, sharp, post-punk-inflected pop, executed with laser-precise accuracy (and a re-contextualized cover of ""Why We Have to Wait"", a song by 1960s Norwegian pop group the Pussycats). In the record's back half, slight dub touches and ska-worthy rhythmic figures enter the mix; the former is squint-your-eyes noticeable, while the latter explicitly serves the band's unassailable sense of time-keeping. The interlocking syncopation is strong enough to suspect that Gorilla Glue plays a part in holding everything together-- that, or lead singer Marie Amdam, who hugs her syllables tightly and with added zest (on ""Vondt I Hjertet"", you can practically feel the spit from her inflected accent hitting your face).</p>
<p>Like a lot of indie-pop albums, <i>Program 91</i> is relatively quick and dirty. But despite its brevity, the album's second side drags a bit, as the skanked rhythms begin to bleed into each other with a lack of individual distinction. Stick around, though, for the album's gorgeous, windswept closer ""Walk in the Park"", an airy slice of melancholia that addresses an open-book relationship while closing out this band's first chapter. After all the peppy guitar lines and young-at-love-and-life razmatazz that one's heart could handle, <i>Program 91</i> melts down to gentle strums and layered ""ba-da-da""s, saying farewell in the ""we'll meet again"" way that only the best of friends do.</p></div>"|15730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15730-program-91/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Truthfully, their lack of studio polish was not a matter of laziness, ironic aesthetic, or poverty, but a coping mechanism for the unstoppable torrent of melodies, words, and ideas exploding from each songwriter's brain. No time for getting that song exactly right-- on to the next one.</p>
<p>That first-draft immediacy can fade with success, creative fatigue, or that demon ""maturity."" In the case of Malkmus, the transformation took the flavor of just wanting to play his damn guitar-- a mid-life crisis where sports cars were replaced with extended solos, ornate riffs, and long songs that felt even longer. But if the recent rash of alt-rock reunions were meant to cash in on audience nostalgia, perhaps some happy memories ricocheted back onto the bandleaders as they revisited their ragged, spontaneous greatest hits.  To put it plainly, <i>Mirror Traffic</i> is not the time travel back to Pavement's peak that is the futile wish of every 30-something indie dork, but it is a rewind to a less perfectionist Malkmus, packed with the most mischief and weirdness he's displayed since his eponymous solo debut. It also has the most songs since <i>Wowee Zowee</i>. Like that declaration of independence from the confines of a successful band, <i>Mirror Traffic</i> possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting his earlier days in NoCal.</p>
<p>Despite originally wanting to title the album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43534-stephen-malkmus-almost-named-his-new-album-ila-gunsi-thanks-to-silver-jews-david-berman/"" target=""_blank""><i>L.A. Guns</i></a> and putting the hard-rocking ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15875-senator/"" target=""_blank"">Senator</a>"" forward as the first single, Malkmus largely lays off the <i>Guitar Hero</i>: The fretboard theatrics are used more sparingly and deployed to much greater effect on ""Forever 28"" where a ""Mr. Blue Sky"" bounce is interrupted by Thin Lizzy runs, or in the thrilling summertime riff of ""Stick Figures in Love"". Only three songs break the five-minute barrier, and these feel far less claustrophobic than the extended tracks on the last three Jicks records. ""Share the Red""'s shambolic waltz, for instance, goes down easier than the 10-minute-long interlocking duets of ""Real Emotional Trash"".</p>
<p>Songs also move in unexpected directions, like the Go! Team-ish coda of ""No One Is (As I Are Be)"" or the slingshot tempo changes of ""Spazz"". Even a brief interstitial like ""Jumblegloss""-- with cosmic guitars and unidentifiable auditory objects whirring by-- is a refreshing bit of spontaneity to rinse after the album's most Jicks-like rocker, ""Brain Gallop"". The less serious vibe better suits Malkmus' still intact sense of humor and menagerie of oddballs (opening here with a nudist in Birkenstocks and ending 15 songs later with a cousin ""down with soft rap"").</p>
<p>Happily, celebrity producer Beck doesn't employ the heavy hand he showed earlier this year on Thurston Moore's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15474-demolished-thoughts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Demolished Thoughts</i></a>, which re-enacted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sea Change</i></a> with the Sonic Youth frontman on vocals. Here, Beck's fingerprints are lighter-- he plays enabler to Malkmus' quirks, leaving in mid-vocal laughs, adding subtle lap-steel on ""Tigers"" and ""Long Hard Book"", and fuzzing out the punkish ""Spazz"" and ""Tune Grief"".</p>
<p>Whether he likes it or not, Malkmus is the indie-rock version of a Dylan or Simon or U2, artists who will forever be blurbed as making ""their best album since ____."" Competing with his younger self is definitely not a priority for Malkmus, who went through Pavement's reunion tour like he was punching a clock. Any resemblance to earlier days is likely unintentional, but for the aging hipsters of the world, even an accidental flashback is a good contact high.<i> Mirror Traffic</i> tickles that nostalgia without sacrificing maturity, discovering that ""playfully relaxed"" is a valid third route between ""slacker"" and ""manic.""</p></div>"|15736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15736-mirror-traffic/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

Jokes aside, even if King Sunny Ade hasn't exactly surpassed Thurston Moore as a dominant post-2007 influence, those spindly leads, clean guitar tones, and assorted hand percussion are more primary colors at this point than elements that automatically set a band apart. They were certainly omnipresent on <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/foolsgold"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fool's Gold</a>'s 2009 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13494-fools-gold/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, but the Los Angeles collective distinguished itself from its peers (including guitarist/songwriter Lewis Pesacov's more straightforward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1649-foreign-born/"" target=""_blank"">Foreign Born</a>) with a rhythmic verve and a bewitching, enigmatic quality that wasn't entirely attributable to Luke Top singing primarily in Hebrew-- though that played a part. Now there's <i>Leave No Trace</i>, sung almost entirely in English, pointedly more conventional in song structure, and given a bright, crisp, electric sheen that uses its cover art as a guiding sonic principle. In other words, Fool's Gold made a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1649-foreign-born/"" target=""_blank"">Foreign Born</a> record.</p>
<p>But hey, Foreign Born albums are certainly enjoyable in their own right, and regardless of which band it came from, ""The Dive"" is the most immediately hooky song Pesacov's been involved with so far (unless you're counting his production with Best Coast). They skew more toward ""Brit-"" than ""Afro-"" in its pop, the galloping snare beat, briskly strummed acoustics, and high-fretboard arpeggios recalling a souped-up Smiths or Orange Juice. You might even hear it as a mixtape staple for a summer crush based on its most stressed lyric (""No I won't stop staring/ And I can't stop from watching""), even if it's meant as rubberneck commentary on a friend guided by their own destructive impulses. Nothing else is quite as instantly ingratiating, but ""The Dive"" does reveal a sonic attitude that <i>Leave No Trace</i> follows-- even if the pinging guitar lines, lolling vocals, and rhythms take their inspiration from any number of continents, it all maintain a casual affability of an Echo Park barbecue. Take a blind taste test of the slip-sliding bassline and group-hug harmonies on ""Wild Window"" or the quacking guitar effects of ""Street Clothes""-- none of it would sound too out of place between a Red Hot Chili Peppers or Sublime track on a KROQ superset.</p>
<p>Which is sort of a bummer, since <i>Leave No Trace </i>as a whole seems like a talented group of musicians perfectly alright with being the Red Stripe in a cooler of Budweisers, an enjoyable diversion distinguished by attractive packaging and a vague, ultimately unremarkable exoticism. Though prone to the occasional camp-Bowie affectation, like the similarly worldly Zach Condon, Top favors an elongated croon that pulls notes like taffy and works up to some sticky harmonies. But too many melodies take the same kind of angles, leaving the choral turns of ""Wild Window"", ""Narrow Sun"", and the title track to be sorted out by a matter of increment. And while Top's lyrics concerning the bothersome pace of modern life generally create friction against their serotonin-boosted arrangements, the words themselves give a whiff of just a little too much misplaced effort.</p>
<p>Likewise, the band's formidable live dynamics are canceled out by the sleek and beveled production, leaving the sort of things that should be integrated touches-- the bump and grind Bollywood rhythm of ""Balmy"", the contrast between the hard, guttural consonants of Hebrew and melismatic English on ""Tel Aviv"", ""Lantern""'s doo-wop affectations-- as the main focus. Having a name like Fool's Gold always felt like tempting fate, especially when working in a style that can be a battlefield for the Realness Wars. But this album title? On a record that aspires more to be sociable than remembered, they're really asking for it.</p></div>"|15731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15731-leave-no-trace/|6.2|Ian Cohen

For German avant gardists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>, it's practically impossible. The band was founded by Florian Fricke in 1969 and largely remained his vision throughout, albeit with useful accomplices picked up along the way. Popol Vuh are often slotted into krautrock/kosmische musik categories, but their work also variously edged close to prog, new age, and ambient. They are perhaps best known for providing the soundtracks to many of <a href=""http://www.wernerherzog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Werner Herzog</a>'s feature films, and this year the <a href=""http://www.spv.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SPV</a> label put out a box set gathering some of those. ""Florian was always able to create music I feel helps audiences visualize something hidden in the images onscreen, and in our own souls too,"" said the director in <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Herzog-Paul-Cronin/dp/0571207081"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Herzog on Herzog</a></i>. Here, SPV again pays tribute to Fricke on the 10th anniversary of his death, gathering strains of the band's original recordings and completing the package with a disc of remixes.</p>
<p>This is the kind of release that will have longstanding Popol Vuh followers raising an eyebrow at what's not included-- the monolithic drone piece ""Vuh"" from <i>In den Gärten Pharaos</i> is missing, and there's nothing from the classic 1972 release <i>Hosianna Mantra</i>. It's heavy on the soundtrack work and sequenced in non-chronological order, beginning with the stirring ""Aguirre I - Lacrima Di Rei"" from Herzog's 1972 feature <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a></i>. The synergy between Herzog and Fricke comes from a place where malevolence, beauty, and eminence are vying for equal space. ""Aguirre I"" features peals of artificial choir sound, played by Fricke on a mellotron-like device called a ""choir organ"" that triggered tiny loops of field recordings. It's a colossal sound that feels both daunting and alluring, something to fear and rejoice in at the same time, where the real and the unreal seem to seep into one another.</p>
<p>Fricke's <i>Aguirre</i> soundtrack is among the best work he produced in his career, but there's such scope to the Popol Vuh sound that it scarcely matters that the bar is raised so high so early. The lengthy title track from the band's debut record <i>Affenstunde</i> (1970) documents Fricke's fascination with folksy percussion and the mantra-like possibilities that emerged from sustaining single notes on a Moog. That space between artifice and actuality is where Popol Vuh's music finds its muscle, adding to the feeling of something arching across ancient and contemporary worlds, with Fricke jostling between earthy textures and the inter-planetary visions of his krautrock contemporaries. ""Affenstunde"" is paired with the similarly epic ""In den Gärten Pharaos"" on <i>Revisited &amp; Remixed</i>, which forms another placid divide between pulsing synth noise, primitive hand percussion, balmy Rhodes-like plinking, and sounds extracted from the natural world.</p>
<p>It might have been better to follow ""Affenstunde"" with the much darker ""Vuh"" instead of ""In den Gärten Pharaos"", just to show off the great surge of energy they were capable of summoning. But there are so many sides to Popol Vuh that it's no surprise some are missing on this release. Instead, a couple of superior cuts from the soundtrack to Herzog's <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079641/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nosferatu the Vampyre</a> </i>are among the highlights. Here Fricke again explores the dichotomy between the real and the unreal and the primitive and the present, through throaty voice manipulations, contemplative acoustic plucking, raga-like drones, and playful baroque arrangements. It's difficult to listen to Popol Vuh's career broken down in this way, dislocated from the strange trajectory they followed. Lurching from the ambient precursor ""Ich Mache Einen Spiegel"" to the sweeping drift of the <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094888/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cobra Verde</a></i> soundtrack feels messy and unfocused. Instead, this record is best seen as a jumping off point for the uninitiated, a way to point travelers in the right direction instead of a singular piece in its own right.</p>
<p>The second disc is an uneven selection of prosaic remixes, with few highlights. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Haswell+%26+Hecker"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haswell &amp; Hecker</a>'s reworking of ""Aguirre I/II"" taps into that extraordinary otherworldly quality of the original piece, building it into a towering wall of shifting noise then shattering it apart as though they've taken a hammer to glass. Elsewhere, too many of the artists sound like they're attempting to assimilate sounds into their own catalogs: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/"">Mouse on Mars</a>' version of ""Through Pain to Heaven"" is an incongruously heavy handed club jam, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s take on ""Hosianna Mantra"" papers over all the peculiar elements that make Popol Vuh such an alluring listen. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>'s version of ""Schnee"" works better, with its piston-like rhythm veering closer to Fricke's world. Perversely, what the remixes lack-- risk, pomposity, refinement, transformative power-- is everything Popol Vuh's original recordings feed off to find their mettle.</p></div>"|15732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15732-revisited-remixed-1970-1999/|7.8|Nick Neyland

It's been done, especially in dance music. But if you can't pull off that sneaky alchemical future-retroism, you can at least try to cast a broad net, paying homage to a lingering idea of a few distinct scenes and highlighting juxtaposition, if not actual cohesion. <a href=""http://www.toddlat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toddla T</a> was merely a preschooler during rave's late 1980s UK explosion, but by the end of the 90s he'd begun to DJ before he was old enough to drive. Another decade's worth of experience spinning other people's records meant he had his ear finely tuned when it came time to make his own-- so far his career's been a fair-minded exercise in consolidating a sprawl of electronic dance music history into a loosely-tied catchall that covers grime, dancehall, electro, and all points between.</p>
<p>Sophomore album <i>Watch Me Dance</i> is a by-the-book collection of eclectic throwbacks, hitting all the right sounds in a non-superficial fashion, but not advancing much further into unexplored territory. There's early single ""Take It Back"", and all the double-meaning that title implies-- lyrical nostalgia for the initial, now-faded rush of a young and happy relationship, paired with sonic nostalgia of a hip-house-inflected Soul II Soul homage. ""Badman Flu"" nods towards dawn-of-the-90s ragga/rave, driven by a charging 808 throb and a pitched-up stammer break worthy of old-school 'ardkore label Shut Up and Dance. On the other end of that decade, ""Streets So Warm"" filters digital dancehall through burbling dial-tone synths and finds a way to build emotional resonance off a bassline that consists solely of sparse, one-note ""WHOMP""'s. The opening title track's a tenuously Prince-ly 80s funk-rock cut that rides on live (or live-sounding) drums and slap bass-- and doesn't sound a damn thing like any of the other songs on the album.</p>
<p>There are also beats that seem bewilderingly, naggingly vague and detached from any chronologically or historically tangible movements, yet still clearly look backwards. ""Cruise Control"" and ""Cherry Picking"" are propulsive and hooky, and as good examples as any to point out how well Toddla T can assemble bass lines and breaks that, while intricate, never distract you from how danceable they are. But on an album that leans so heavily on acknowledging influences, they don't seem to have a distinct reference of their own-- they're not reminiscent of anything, whether it's a stylistic homage or a unique sonic identity the producer's still in the process of establishing.</p>
<p>That leaves the album's roster of guest vocalists to pick up the slack, and it does benefit from a wide cross-section of enduring veterans-- Roots Manuva casually murmuring laidback come-ons on the title track, Roisin Murphy doing her best enigmatic Annie Lennox on ""Cherry Picking"", Wayne Marshall giving ""Streets So Warm"" a piercing gut-punch pathos, and a warm turn from Ms. Dynamite on the vintage-reggae ""Fly"" that makes for another fine entry in her current comeback bid. Toddla T's ear for collaborators is matched by his sense of restraint: This is an album that aims for radio and clubs alike instead of shooting for the overload of songs geared strictly toward bassbins. <i>Watch Me Dance</i> doesn't reconcile the clash between retro and modernism, but at least it does the past a decent amount of justice.</p></div>"|15737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15737-watch-me-dance/|6.5|Nate Patrin

Sonically, the Canadian duo mine the same brand of nostalgia-flecked ecstasy as Air France or even the Avalanches, but the their choice of samples and propulsive rhythms trade in the lightheaded focus of those groups for something clubbier.</p>
<p>The summer mood of their <i>Atlantic</i> EP debut is largely carried on waves of optimistic major chord shifts, but there's an introspective, thoughtful quality to the production that lends enough depth to reward repeat trips. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12275-tangier-winds/"" target=""_blank"">Tangier Winds</a>"", for example, samples a grab bag of a cappella vocals-- including 1990s R&amp;B smoothies <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HTLpc5amsI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">U-Mnyd</a>-- each contributing a distinct sentiment to what eventually becomes a cluttered conversation. The lyrical snatches are just intangible enough to add a heavy feeling of romance to a bedrock of lush keys and drifting bass patterns. The resulting effect is a satisfying tangle of jammed frequencies.</p>
<p>""Night Is Young"" plays similar sampling tricks, but here the clipped vocals lose themselves in more propulsive surroundings. Unlike the relatively stable dynamics of ""Tangier Winds"", the momentum shifts gears throughout, carrying more of a disco palette than anything else on the record. There's a fun and hedonistic Salsoul vibe to the track--  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU41QbPQj3w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shep Pettibone and </a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU41QbPQj3w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cathy Dennis</a> are among the samples-- an idea that feels just distinct enough to work as a worthwhile homage exercise as well as a blissed-out summer dance track.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything on <i>Atlantic</i> exists in a seasonal haze-- nobody's going to mistake this for anything but a record of summer jams. That tight focus may seem limited in scope, but it helps yield the EP's concentrated burst of sensation. And, while the majority of recent sun-drenched music's been concerned with retelling half-remembered feelings from the past, Southern Shores escape that vacuum by investing in the moment at hand: As the opening track title ""Take Me Anywhere"" suggests, this is music that not only wants to soundtrack your vacation, it wants to <i>be </i>your vacation.</p></div>"|15734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15734-atlantic-ep/|7.3|Hari Ashurst

Unless you work inside certain sects of the music industry, the answer, at most, is likely a couple dozen. Yet the number of working imprints in the world-- from the biggest corporate conglomerates to the upstarts young bands craft only so they can have a logo to put on the back of whatever they issue-- is incalculable because it's ever-changing. That is, running a record label is a risky business plan, where one mistake about the number of units you might move can torpedo the entire operation, where technological sea changes can wash the need for you and your product away. Labels, then, tend to memorialize every few years, commemorating every anniversary with a limited-edition box set, a spree of concerts, or an appreciative giveaway. However deserved it may be, this is self-congratulations of the purest sort, a proud proclamation that the brand has yet again made it to some arbitrary finish line.</p>
<p>To that end, Three Lobed Recordings' <i>Not the Spaces You Know, But Between Them</i> is a different kind of birthday set. Meant to mark the 10th anniversary of the tiny North Carolina outsider music label, the collection subverts the usual order of such pieces, serving more as a celebration of the participating bands than the presenting brand. The packaging-- a hard paper box containing four LPs and liner notes, all designed by the instantly recognizable Portland, Ore., poster artist Casey Burns-- hardly mentions the anniversary. In fact, the label's name takes a smaller font than not only the bands included, like Sonic Youth and Sun City Girls, but also Burns himself. Inside, during an interview with Pitchfork contributor Marc Masters, label owner Cory Rayborn doesn't talk much about his happenstance journey into owning a label (he started it to release one Bardo Pond 10"") or the stylistic confines of Three Lobed (from broken folk to pan-everything psychedelic explorations, there have been none). Rather, he spills his words about the acts involved, calling Steve Gunn ""transformational,"" suggesting Johnny Cash would have covered Wooden Wand, and labeling Mouthus as ""true auteurs."" At least half of Rayborn's own short essay is spent thanking friends and expressing dismay that this is happening. <i>Not the Spaces You Know, But Between Them</i> is less a Three Lobed trademark proclamation than an earnest and excellent offering from one of America's best little labels.</p>
<p>Most commemorative compilations like this simply stack a bunch of tracks from catalog artists side-by-side, reprising both the accomplishments of the label in question and offering a few selected gems that either never made it onto a release or have long been out-of-print. But <i>Spaces</i> smartly gives full LP sides to seven bands, essentially affording each act the opportunity to create an EP that's simply part of something bigger. None of this material has ever been released. Considered on its own terms, each contribution from each band is stunning, most often as a summary of what they've done best. Mouthus' two sprawls, for instance, are violent churns of sound, splitting the unexpected distance between industrial music, power electronics, IDM and singer-songwriter fare. A 21-minute, relatively seamless collage of Comets on Fire rehearsals reminds that they’re one of the most ferocious bands of last decade’s psych revival. ""The Invisible Fire"" is one of Bardo Pond's customarily immersive zones, with guitar riffs, electronic whirs, and the alternating flute and contorted moans of Isobel Sollenberger forming a sheet of sound as thick as smoke from a woodland wildfire. And the three live cuts from Sun City Girls, recorded in 2004 at the band's last American show, vividly capture the group's range-- their guitar bravado and brilliance; their mix of country, jazz, rock and Middle Eastern music; their almost-alien intercommunication; their humor; their interesting songs; their interest in exploring those songs' edges through improvisation.</p>
<p>But these are all reaffirmations by bands with status to spare: <i>Not the Spaces</i> is, at its best, about future heroes. In the liner notes, Rayborn says that guitarist Gunn doesn't realize ""how ridiculously talented he is."" His ""The Lurker Extended"" is a testament to ambition and narrative, plus a validation of the brilliance Rayborn suggest. Spiraling from slow, graceful licks to variations so fast and frenetic they seem to kick up sparks, Gunn's piece is the kind of statement that should make the unaware place him alongside the best acoustic masters, past and present. The young Pacific Northwest collective Eternal Tapestry has never sounded more forceful and convincing than they do on this alternate take of ""Doing Your Own Being"". With saxophone, bass, and guitars clinched in tidal unison, the band suggests the most triumphant soul-jazz of the 1970s, aggressively recreated by some stoned kids in a basement.</p>
<p>D. Charles Speer &amp; the Helix actually split the last side of the third record with Wooden Wand, but their sets are different sides of the same sermon. Led by Dave Shuford of the No-Neck Blues Band, the Helix handles two country classics with a tight grip, giving Gene Clark's end-of-innocence tale ""Shooting Star"" a heartrending, Skynyrd-sized coda. Wooden Wand's three originals are ramshackle country laments, strummed and sighed with threadbare despair. His tunes are written with the same deep-seated gravitas that those Helix covers sport, showing that the blues don't necessarily depend on how they're offered. In his most polished country affectation, Shuford sings, ""It's all very clear/ It's near and then gone."" Wand later slurs an answer, unaware: ""If this is a destination, call it No Survival Drive.""</p>
<p>Surprising as it may seem, Sonic Youth supplies this set's most positive, apt metaphor. Lee Ranaldo has released a record through Three Lobed, as has Thurston Moore's side project, Bark Haze. Sonic Youth never has, but Moore's own label, Ecstatic Peace, trades in many of the same circles as Three Lobed. Playfully titled ""In &amp; Out"" and ""Out &amp; In"", Sonic Youth's dual contributions were recorded a decade apart from one another, so Jim O'Rourke-- who plays bass on one song but not the other-- had left the band and so that, after September 11th, they had moved their Echo Canyon studio from New York City to New Jersey. Together, these songs show the band's consistent excellence as patient textural explorers. ""In &amp; Out"" is Sonic Youth at their most tempered; ""Out &amp; In"", the earlier of the pieces, is one of the most ferocious Sonic Youth jams ever put to tape. What begins as a winding, discordant instrumental suddenly finds this three-guitar, five-piece configuration surging with a hardcore-punk intensity. Noise claws at the edges of the relentless beat. They sound scary.</p>
<p>The interval between these tracks roughly coincides with Three Lobed's lifespan. Given that Sonic Youth's career was really just starting at the 10-year mark, it serves as a promise of Three Lobed's continued vitality well past this landmark release. And considering the label's mostly spotless résumé and the incredible substance of this commemoration, it's difficult not to hope that suggestion holds true in this often anonymous, unstable industry.</p></div>"|15710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15710-not-the-spaces-you-know-but-between-them/|8.3|Grayson Currin

We assumed everything while Ariel danced in her room and took off her clothes. We were at their last show where Bob Nanna cried and maybe we did, too. Sure, this is a composite sketch, but we repped <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/braidband"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Braid</a> to the fullest back when emo <i>meant something</i>. Of course, that ""something"" mostly meant humble Midwesterners with enough start-stop trickery and ""auxiliary screaming guy"" to crucially place themselves in the cred lineage of Fugazi even if the lyrics yelled ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv8poVospPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">do you like me?</a>"" more than ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNail6JjEiE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you are not what you own.</a>"" It's been hard since then: not just because Braid went dormant, but because emo's domination of early-2000s radio was a pyrrhic victory, its ensuing evolution leading to its becoming the single most vilified form in all of indie rock.</p>
<p>But oh shit, <i>Braid are back. </i>Even if <i>Closer to Closed</i> is just a four-song EP, come on! Chris Broach in the building! Unfortunately, the brevity of <i>Closer to Closed </i>only makes it easier to remember that this is also pretty much the same band as Hey Mercedes, a competently forgettable Vagrant latecomer that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3847-everynight-fire-works/"" target=""_blank""><i>Everynight Fire Works</i></a>, a record I haven't listened to in a decade mostly because I recall it sounding a hell of a lot like this. ""This"" mostly meaning market-tested emo-pop with the emotion and pop aspects sterilized by an unwillingness to commit to either. It sounded somewhat desperate back when there felt like a reason and a market to sell out for, but now it just sounds utterly clueless.</p>
<p>This year, we've seen Taking Back Sunday, Saves The Day, and the Get Up Kids attempting to play catch up with themselves, but here Braid bafflingly jettison the goodwill of their past: the palm-muted verses and squeaky choruses, the one-sided conversations of the lyrics, the antiseptic production-- I'll say it could come from anyone because you probably don't remember who the Pinehurst Kids are. With not a single sharp edge provided by any riffs or even Broach (whose guitar doodles enough in the margins to let you know that he actually showed up), you haven't much choice but to sort of pitifully engage with <i>Closer to Closed </i>like a nervous friend before a huge date he's clearly going to fuck up.</p>
<p>During its first two clean-shaven and aloe-moisturized choruses, Chris Broach sings, ""It could never be this good again/ You know it's true,"" and Nanna, ""I want a do over, do over, do over."" If you want to project your vague romantic frustration onto a blank slate, this'll do. You can just as easily take it as running commentary on <i>Closer to Closed</i> itself, stuck for inspiration outside of<i> </i>constantly introducing and apologizing for its own existence. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congratulations_I'm_Sorry"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Congratulations...I</i>'<i>m Sorry</i></a>, y'know?) ""I wouldn't mind a second try,"" Nanna chirps on ""Do Over"", and at its climax, ""now is the part where I break your heart"" flips to ""this is the part where <i>we </i>break some hearts."" Hearing them stoop to the Panic! At the Disco-era necessity of establishing some sort of conspiratorial fourth-wall busting narrative with the listener is just such a fucking bummer that you can't even muster the energy to use their own words against them.Which is incredibly easy since Nanna's lyrics have further devolved into pure emo madlibbing.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be just as easy for you to point out that I'm a grown man and wanting Braid to pick up and recreate 1998 on the rebound is no more rational than my college friends expecting me to knock off that bottle of Goldschlager and somehow shake it off before that huge presentation the next morning. But are you seriously asking Braid fans to not <i>care so much</i>? Let us mourn in peace-- Urbana's just too fucking dark, and it's not getting any brighter.</p></div>"|15697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15697-closer-to-closed/|2.8|Ian Cohen

You could maintain a dignified silence, either letting the memory of your band live relatively untarnished in the hearts of fans, or maybe building up feverish anticipation for a lucrative reunion tour. You could start a blog, an acting career, or some other non-music project. There's also always the possibility of starting a new project to satiate your musical urges. Like many artists, Martin Cohen, bassist of UK lad-rockers Nine Black Alps, has chosen Door No. 3, recording songs under the name <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/milkmaidmilkmaid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Milk Maid</a> primarily from his Manchester apartment.</p>
<p>From the blast of distortion on opener ""Such Fun"" on, <i>Yucca</i> clearly basks in the influence of a few 1990s lo-fi indie greats. Guided by Voices have been the chief comparison so far, but Cohen isn't as strong a singer or as gifted a melodicist as Robert Pollard and where 11 songs make up <i>Yucca</i>'s 33 1/2-minute running time, GBV could easily cram at least two dozen songs in that window. Milk Maid is more similar to a group like Sebadoh in musical and lyrical content, combining mostly sunny, pop-friendly melodies with macabre imagery and the occasional spate of abject self-loathing-- at least in the handful of lyrics that you can make out.</p>
<p>Cohen injects a little irony into ""Such Fun"", delivering the bouncy, jaunty tune-- and its chorus of ""'Round, 'round, 'round, and over again""-- with an affect so distant, that it sounds like he's lamenting a tedious exercise, regardless of the slightly more energetic backing vocals that punctuate the hook. ""Dead Wrong"" puts an emphasis on the former word of its title, with the song's first few lines splattered with blood from dismembered limbs and stab wounds in the stomach. The first verse of the 49-second ""Kill Me Again"" simulates the back-and-forth of a lovers' spat, with Cohen singing, ""Kill me again... And then I'll kill you."" Most of <i>Yucca</i>'s violent images are delivered as a metaphor for a deteriorating relationship, relating to the death of a romance as death in the most literal terms.</p>
<p>Reportedly inspired by the recording approach of Sic Alps, but mostly lacking the bloodthirsty snarl the San Francisco basement dwellers capturing on tape, <i>Yucca</i> is almost split evenly between propulsive, driving, pop-influenced garage-rock tunes and downtempo almost-ballads covered in a thick topcoat of fuzz. The catchiest of these-- ""Can't You See"", with its acoustic guitar drowned-out by heavily distorted electric guitar, late-album climax ""Back of Your Knees', the buoyant power-pop of ""Not Me""-- are torn wide open by ear-splitting guitar solos, ably and excitingly straddling the line between noise and pop. While its lyrics-- especially the hook of ""She was American / She was an American girl""-- aren't especially gripping, ""Girl"" provides a refreshing cool down in the midst of the blown, overheated amps exploding across most of the collection.</p>
<p>A melancholy sway marks ""Someone You Thought You'd Forgot"", finding Cohen using his voice to deliver a kind of sadness that perfectly matches the song's chords. The song itself makes for an appropriate closing track-- it feels like the soundtrack for saying goodbye to someone, all long faces, downturned eyes, and slow, monotone speech. It's softer feel also illustrates the dynamic range Cohen has as a songwriter on his first solo outing, one that isn't especially revelatory or inventive, but does offer a solid starting point for the second chapter of his career.</p></div>"|15727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15727-yucca/|7.2|Martin Douglas

But there's something single-minded, even monastic about the way he's made each one. Typically, he focuses devoutly on a single approach, sticking with the same instrumentation, tempos, and tones from track to track. Even records that could be considered outliers-- take last year's pop-oriented <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14467-beyond-the-valley-of-ultrahits/"">Beyond the Valley of the Ultrahits</a></i>-- have a core personality that make adjacent songs like fraternal twins.</p>
<p><i>Amplifying Host </i>takes that genetic consistency to a microscopic level. I needed multiple listens to tell these six songs apart, all of which generally start the same way-- with a slow, bent note-- and are built from the same parts: long electric guitar twangs, gentle acoustic strums, big bass rumbles, and Youngs' deliberate, extended-syllable singing. They also include drumming from Damon Krukowski (of Galaxie 500 and Damon and Naomi), but he's so backgrounded I didn't initially notice his contributions, which are primarily atmospheric cymbal washes.</p>
<p>Whatever elements are there, Youngs' vocals are the center, in ways good and... well, never bad, but sometimes perplexing. He's often found success with more formal singing modes-- take the chant-like melodic lines of 2009's <i>Under Stellar Steam-- </i>but here he's more interested in deviating from the paths he lays. He'll sing a line, vary it slightly, wander away, then curve back close to but not exactly where he started. Floating between form and improvisation, he mixes the searching quality of Bill Callahan with the stubborn dodge of Jandek. Which makes songs like the pensive ""Tessellations"" or the simple ""Too Strong for the Power""-- which feels a lot longer than its 13 minute duration-- both enticing and maddening. Youngs always sounds like he's going to coalesce his lines into a climactic chorus, but his angles never quite straighten, instead birthing even more tangents.</p>
<p>I'm probably making <i>Amplifying Host </i>sound more difficult than it is. The bulk is warm and inviting, as hypnotic as any Youngs record. Let it envelop you without worrying about where it's going, and it'll massage your brain even as it evades it. If you do find Youngs' skewed perspective frustrating, there's a reward at the end. On ""This Is the Music"", he allows himself a true chorus: ""This is the sunshine of generations/ Music of exaltation/ This is the time of fulfillment."" The music's measured rhythm and plaintive chords may belie those bright sentiments, but if everything lined up perfectly, this wouldn't be Richard Youngs.</p></div>"|15728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15728-amplifying-host/|7.0|Marc Masters

Upstaging Sykes is difficult: The Seattle-based singer possesses a distinctive voice with the eloquent grain of a young Marianne Faithfull, but with a tendency to strain toward certain notes that suggests a barely contained emotional distress. She haunts the band's first two albums, 2002's <i>Reckless Burning</i> and 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7766-oh-my-girl-with-the-sweet-hereafter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Oh, My Girl</i></a>, which both retrofitted 1990s alt-country influences to a darker Americana. Starting with 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10014-like-love-lust-and-the-open-halls-of-the-soul/"" target=""_blank""><i>Like Love Lust &amp; the Open Halls of the Soul</i></a>, however, Wandscher has become less of a sideman and more of a bandleader, which is fine: He's a resourceful guitar player who allows these tunes to careen and serve perilously.</p>
<p>This development has its advantages and disadvantages. Like Neko Case before her, Sykes abandoned the more straightforward country-soul of her early albums for a more idiosyncratic style that favors oddly shaped jams over vocal melodies. What should be more personal is actually more impersonal-- <i>Marble Son</i> sounds coded, vague, purposefully obscure. ""Come to Mary, she don't mind,"" she sings on the vaguely Catholic ""Come to Mary"". The line repeats several times, but it's less a hook than an excerpt from a larger melody. Sykes has never had tremendous range, nor has she really needed it; in the past, she's gotten by on sheer tone and expressiveness. Yet, on opener ""Hushed by Devotion"" and the folksy ""Be It Me or Be It None"", she sounds too detached, too cold, such that her voice gets lost in the mix-- never quite as assertive or as evocative as she could be. It sounds like she's holding back, trying to fit into the band, but with an instrument like hers, that seems like driving a plane when you could be flying. By contrast, Wandscher's guitar never sounds hushed or hesitant. It never shies from the spotlight or fades into the background. He's a bold player, which means he can carry these songs by himself.</p>
<p><i>Marble Son</i> is the band's heaviest album to date, perhaps owing to their recent collaborations with <span class=""st"">Sunn O))) and Boris. That context makes Wandscher's updates on San Francisco rock riffs all the more intriguing, especially on ""Ceiling</span>'<span class=""st"">s High"" and ""Your Own Kind"", whose central themes could have mutated directly from the Dead themselves. On ""Hushed by Devotion"", the band launches abruptly into a faster jam, propelled into a new direction by a few brazen notes from Wandscher. It's a great moment, but they do the same trick several other times, most egregiously on ""Pleasuring the Divine"". With every repetition it loses power, emphasizing rather than concealing the band's limitations. Instead of exploring their sound and growing more dexterous over time, Jesse Sykes &amp; the Sweet Hereafter have backed themselves into a creative corner on <i>Marble Son</i>-- with a sound so austere it becomes tedious instead of heady, tentative instead of revelatory. </span></p></div>"|15729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15729-marble-son/|5.9|Stephen M.

It's just two of rap's biggest figures and best friends getting together to make some of the  swollen, epic music that comes so naturally to them. Listening to it  is sort of like watching George Clooney get all his movie-star  friends together for a party at his Italian villa, and, along the way, maybe dream up <i>Ocean's Twelve</i>. (I liked <i>Ocean's Twelve</i>.)</p>
<p>In  the past week, Internet sleuths have pointed out that the release of many Jay-Z albums have coincided with some national or  international calamity, 9/11 not excluded. <i>Watch the Throne</i> is no exception: its release on the same day as yet another catastrophic stock  market downturn has led some critics to conclude that the pair's  boasts of obscene wealth is out of step with the times. That's a fair  case to make. But one of the striking things about <i>Watch the Throne</i> is how often Jay and Kanye address matters beyond their bank accounts. On ""Why I Love You"", it's  Jay's dismay at past crewmates' betrayals. On ""Murder to  Excellence"", it's black-on-black crime and the scarcity of people of  color at society's highest seats. On ""Made in America"", it's the hardships of youth and coming of age. ""New Day"" is framed as a letter to the pair's imagined sons, a  device that mostly gives them a chance to soul-search and self-criticize. On ""Welcome to the Jungle"", Jay, never a tortured pop star,  actually says, ""I'm fuckin' depressed."" Despite all the triumphant  bravado these two bring to practically everything they do, they work overtime here to bring a sense of empathy to this  enterprise. Once in a while, they even sound vaguely humble.</p>
<p>These subtler moments are admirable, but they don't always work. Consider, for example, the song ""That's My Bitch"", on which Kanye and his collaborators flip the classic ""Apache"" break into a devastating dance-rap monster with synths zooming off in every direction and Justin Vernon making the aforementioned sweaty soul moves. It's a vicious song, catchy as fuck, but it turns out to be weirdly awkward. Despite the title, Jay's verse is all devotional-prophet; it mostly concerns the way American beauty standards so often work against women of color. The sentiment deserves respect, but his laidback delivery, on a track with production and structure that call for ferocity, drains his ideas of force.</p>
<p><i>Watch the Throne</i> works best when Jay and  Kanye are just talking about how great they are. The single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12266-otis/"" target=""_blank"">Otis</a>"" is  dizzy fun, with Jay and Kanye rapping hard and swapping mics like hungry  kids. ""Niggas in Paris"" rides an impossibly propulsive synth riff  and gigantic drums and gives Jay a chance to display the technical rap  wizardry he still has in him. (It also features this great Kanye moment,  ""Doctors say I'm the illest because I'm suffering from realness/ Got  my niggas in Paris, and they going gorillas,"" followed by a  sample of Will Ferrell in <i>Blades of Glory </i>talking about how awesome  shit doesn't have to mean anything.) ""Gotta Have It"" unites Kanye and  the Neptunes to crazily chop up James Brown vocal samples and Eastern  flute melodies. And ""Who Gon Stop Me"" finds Kanye cussing in Pig Latin  while turning dubstep-rap into a viable subgenre.</p>
<p>If you buy <i>Watch the Throne</i> from iTunes-- the only place you <i>can</i> buy it at the moment-- you'll  notice that it's credited to ""JAY Z &amp; Kanye West"" (capital letters  and missing hyphen unexplained). But while Jay might be billed first for  seniority's sake, Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force.  Throughout, he displays levels of unequaled audacity. On  ""Otis"" and ""Gotta Have It"", he reduces Otis Redding and James Brown to  simple grunts, then builds rhythm tracks out of them. On ""New  Day"", over a beat co-produced by RZA, he <i>actually runs Nina Simone through Auto-Tune</i>. On ""No Church in the Wild"", he authoritatively vows, ""You will <i>not</i> control the threesome."" The musical scope of <i>Watch the Throne</i> is a tribute to his distinctive taste and sense of style. The whole  thing sounds huge, and even the sillier moments (""Made in America"",  especially, reminds me of the inspirational ballads of late-period  Michael Jackson) succeed on pure orchestral excess. Jay and Kanye  debuted the album in a private listening session at a New York planetarium, a setting which made perfect  sense: even if it never approaches the grandeur or character-study complexity of <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>, this is still exploding-star music.</p>
<p>So:  two long-reigning titans make a relatively quick album which, despite their best efforts, still winds up being a  monument to their own grandiosity. Should we  care? Well, yeah. Kanye doesn't have a cruise-control switch, and when  he's around, neither does Jay. On <i>Watch the Throne</i>, they  push each other and have fun doing it, and the result is a  stadium-sized event-rap spectacle that still sounds like two insanely  talented guys' idiosyncratic vision. That's worth celebrating.</p></div>"|15725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/|8.5|Tom Breihan

The box is labeled something like ""dirty old Frenchman who liked to drink."" We credit or debit him to varying extents for being brave/gross enough to make an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/"" target=""_blank"">album about statutory rape</a> or a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE06lqT0Y2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song about incest</a> with his very young daughter, for being a lover to both Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin (and using the opportunities to make innovatively raunchy music), for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwBXCGAg_aA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">making an ass of himself</a> on European talk shows in the 1980s, for being unapologetic about all of this. He is, in effect, reduced to a whispering, occasionally drunk lothario by people who don't speak French, his often brilliant wordplay and punning sense of humor hidden behind a language barrier. His musical innovation? Often not discussed at all.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that most of his work remains obscure outside of France. It's only when you pull back from ""Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus"" and <i>Melody Nelson</i> and look at his entire career that it becomes apparent how massively influential he was to the body of French song. He started out in the late 1950s making records backed by Alain Goraguer and his orchestra in a style that was little different from the modern chanson that dominated French music in the mid-20th century, but he very quickly began to incorporate elements of American bebop and cool jazz, the first of many such stylistic deviations that helped form the landscape upon which modern French pop and rock grew.</p>
<p>In 1964 Gainsbourg was well-known but still not the giant he was to become. His first brush with major controversy-- France Gall's risqué Gainsbourg-penned hit ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nr0dUcrAU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Les Sucettes</a>""-- was still two years away. The Serge that English speakers tend to know hadn't been invented. Gainsbourg was working then on more purely musical inventions, and <i>Percussions</i> is an invention of sorts. It's not the first album to directly merge Latin American and African music with Western song styles, but it was unique at the time for the way it did it, essentially grafting chanson onto African and Latin drum patterns and choral styles to create one of the earliest ethno-beat records. Think of it as an ancestor of Paul Simon's <i>Graceland</i>, a record whose approach to mixing African music and Western song is quite similar.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg didn't take an entirely hard road to this fusion. Three of the album's songs, ""Joanna"", ""New York, U.S.A."", and ""Marabout"" are built directly on carbon copies of songs from Babatunde Olatunji's 1959 <i>Drums of Passion</i> LP, with the Nigerian chants replaced by French lyrics and Gainsbourg's new melodies and verses laid over the top. This theft is not hidden at all-- it's totally obvious to anyone familiar with <i>Drums of Passion</i>-- though no credit was given to the source. France was just then beginning to close its Colonial chapter, so the idea of a French musician co-opting the music of a Nigerian drummer for his own purposes certainly has an element of ugliness.</p>
<p>That said, I suspect Gainsbourg knew some people would spot the lifts, and I think in a way he hoped they would: Across the LP's 12 tracks, he makes no audible attempt to sanitize the African, Brazilian, Caribbean, and bebop rhythms at the heart of the songs, the direct theft functioning somewhat like a coded announcement of their authenticity. On ""Les Sambassadeurs"", Gainsbourg does samba so effectively that the difference between his version and the real thing is mostly one of language and instrumentation (I think the tuba completes a pun in the lyrics). If we explore the album for insight into Gainsbourg's thought process while he was making it, a definite (and rather anti-colonial) theme of embracing people across race lines emerges. ""Couleur Café"" does this directly with its declaration of ""I love your coffee-colored skin."" It sounds sort of unremarkable-- and maybe even condescending or at least un-PC now-- but in its day, it would have been a provocative sentiment to the exact people Gainsbourg liked to needle.</p>
<p>For all the ethical ambiguity surrounding its creation (in this way it's similar to Paul Simon's <i>Graceland</i>), <i>Percussions</i> is still a very powerful record. Discounting even its musical concept, it is an uncommonly cohesive and consistently great LP for 1964. It is beautifully recorded, too. The female choirs backing Gainsbourg are vividly captured and lively, the percussion tracks have unusually sonorous low-end (they sound especially good on this vinyl reissue), and the guitar sound on ""Ces Petit Riens"" is uncannily modern. This is something Gainsbourg doesn't get nearly enough credit for-- outside of its sometimes outrageous content, his music was always progressive, and he never was content to stay in one place for too long.</p>
<p>This is one reason he never created another LP like <i>Percussions</i>. He came closest on the two reggae LPs he did in Jamaica with Sly &amp; Robbie in the late 1970s and early 80s, but even those lack the <i>Percussions</i>' accessibly experimental scope and cultural curiosity. In 1965, France Gall won the Eurovision Song Contest for Luxembourg with ""Poupée de cire, poupée de son"", a song written by Gainsbourg. It elevated him to another plane of fame, one where he couldn't make an album as casually innovative as <i>Percussions</i> and remain under the radar. Instead, he pointed himself elsewhere musically and became the Serge we know best. On <i>Percussions</i>, though, we can hear the Serge that the salacious details sometimes obscure, the musical experimenter hungry for new sounds, out in the open, innovating if not inventing.</p></div>"|15717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15717-gainsbourg-percussions/|8.2|Joe Tangari

The space in question is the one with a ""for fans of Flying Lotus"" sign posted over the door, and there hasn't been a ton of vacancy in there lately. Those who've broken out have done so by tweaking the sonic imprint of decaying beats and melting analog chords until they come across as distinctly tactile things, humid and slippery, blown-out and elastic.</p>
<p>Reaching out to clutch the music on <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/shlomoshun"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shlohmo</a>'s <i>Bad Vibes</i> might cause it to crumble in your grasp-- and then cut the hell out of your fingers. The L.A. producer's sophomore full-length comes after a handful of singles, EPs, remixes, and compilation appearances, as well as last year's disorienting debut, <i>Shlomoshun Deluxe</i>. And in that short yet busy time, Shlohmo has dredged up something strange: an aesthetic that's jaggedly delicate, filled with melodic beauty but jostled by abrasive percussive hitches, undercut with sandpapery patches of ambient fuzz. It's a deft merging of gentle, wafting electronic tones and intricately beat-to-shit rhythmic atmosphere, the sounds of old technology trying to reconcile its former gloss with its fading functionality.</p>
<p>The cynical ears that still can't get past the nostalgic surface of chillwave might have their own bone to pick with the cassette-deck/VHS fidelity of <i>Bad Vibes</i>, which stands out pretty prominently in hissy tracks like ""Same Time"" and ""Parties"". But instead of celebrating corroded, neon-pastel magnetic-tape detritus for its own sake, the music on this album leans closer to an appreciation of the actual rhythmic counterpoints, quirks, and resonant qualities of white noise. Alongside the moments that seem to revel in the flutter and crackle of old equipment are stretches that draw similar vibes from the sound of literal rainfall (""Seriously"") or birdcall-strewn field recordings (""Big Feelings"")-- not to mention the texture you can get from good old-fashioned feedback, like the keyboard squall of ""Trapped in a Burning House"".</p>
<p>The beats themselves are striking enough, whether they're the distant trickling clicks of ""Sink"" or the sharp, crisp snap-thump grooves that push along cuts like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15473-places/"" target=""_blank"">Places</a>"" or ""Same Time"". Yet even the moments where the beat feels secondary to the other instrumentation have a pulse to them, run through floaty guitars or humming synthesizers that converse with the ambient hiss in compelling ways. Still, neither the melody nor the ambience overwhelms the other. It's easy to hear the silky, billowy tones through the dying-battery distortion, but hard to picture what they'd sound like without it.</p></div>"|15698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15698-bad-vibes/|7.8|Nate Patrin

But those roles look pretty shaky now that Pele is defunct and CCB is still going strong. Founded almost concurrently with Pele, the project began as an outlet to explore folk and bluegrass in a post-rock context, and while its purview quickly expanded, those origins are still vestigial in new album <i>GIVING</i>. They're tangible in the bright banjo plinking behind the guitar cascades of ""Lawns"", and they spiritually inform the conversational disposition of the instruments. Though the songs are as sprawling and segmented as the band's name, CCB brings a touch of relaxed humanity to a style of music that can be unduly grave.</p>
<p>While peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a> worship sheer trajectory, CCB seem more interested in the vistas that open up along the way. Downtown minimalism and ambient electronics have become pervasive influences, and during tiered ascents that take in the molten guitar waves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"">Rhys Chatham</a> (with whom Mueller has worked) and the spectral patterns of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>, the band often wanders off-course to linger in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-inspired electronic wildernesses. Their adventurousness earned them a devoted fanbase, and their stock really took off in 2009, when they hooked up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Justin Vernon</a> to create the widely admired <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13506-unmap/"">Unmap</a></i> as Volcano Choir. The four-song, half-hour <i>GIVING </i>is their first new record since then, and finds them saying hello to new fans while bidding goodbye to two outgoing members, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13267-physical-changes/"">Mueller</a> and pianist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15203-harbors/"">Thomas Wincek</a>. It feels both triumphal and valedictory, bypassing spacey tangents in favor of CCB's hard-charging live sound.</p>
<p>Though <i>GIVING </i>may be an unusually eyes-on-the-prize record for CCB, they still have more in common with questing, omnivorous post-rock bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2161-jaga-jazzist/"">Jaga Jazzist</a> than with the single-minded crescendo hunters of the world. Variations of force and expression derive less from rhythmic and harmonic changes than from the accumulation and development of soulful ostinati, woven in and out of freer, more ""rock"" chord progressions. Though a guitar may occasionally break off for an expressive flight of fancy, there's seldom a single musician carrying the moment-- instead, they each lean into repetitive fragments that gradually coalesce into organic, blossoming wholes. At the deepest level, a collectivist honeycomb pattern prevails, and the one-note lead seared across alternating bars of the crunchy climax of ""Vorm"" is the closest thing you'll hear to a killer solo.</p>
<p>This is rock music that has come almost completely unstuck from the blues, with a sleek, relentless drive subbing in for swing. Mueller's almost motorik-style percussion sows accents in the intricate layers of pattern, so that similar instrumental passages take on different feelings of loping, staggering, or soaring. Still, it doesn't quite save the album from a somewhat monolithic quality, which is clearly intentional but can be a trifle wearisome. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15967-lawn/"">Lawn</a>"" is the obvious anthem; ""Vorm"" is bucolic and churning; ""Lawns"" is moodier; and ""Vorms"" is the rangy epic. These cosmetic adjustments to one hypnotically bruising ideal only go so far, and if you're not in the mood to hear dudes being really stoked about their guitar playing, it can make for a long half-hour. But all in all, it's an exciting victory lap for a band whose confidence is highly palpable in this hard-earned moment of high visibility.</p></div>"|15718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15718-giving/|6.8|Brian Howe

Scowling ferociously in the corner, techno seems blessed by its own misanthropy: Never the crossover dance music of choice, it's accorded a certain fearful level of respect and admiration regardless of what might be today's story and (inevitably) yesterday's news. (It's the perennial ""real shit"" for the cognoscenti with a more discerning understanding of the infinite shades of variety afforded by a stoically pummelling kick drum.)</p>
<p>Techno seems to be ""back"" at the moment, largely due the partial absorption of dubstep influences into its high-pressure bloodstream, its lacerating percussive attack tending more toward syncopation and snare-heavy swing than in the bad old days of stentorian four-by-four pound. The shift is less one of wholesale transformation than a kind of magnetic realignment, dubstep's clattering and clanking syncopation inspiring a reemphasis of those same qualities always already lurking in techno proper.</p>
<p><i>Breaking the Frame</i>, the first new album from the British producer (real name Anthony Child) in a decade, isn't nearly so gregarious: Surgeon's return to the artist full-length foregrounds the chilly austerity associated with the veteran producer's name throughout the late 1990s. Think of it as the Arctic cousin to the more passionate explosions of Surgeon's DJ mixes, a series of twisted rock formations left behind by the frozen lava of a sweaty night out on the town. But for all that, the album remains bang up to date, with nearly every groove structured around the absent centre of a 4/4 kick drum, that punishing pulsation eschewed in favour of either a halfstep lurch (""Transparent Radiation"", ""Remover of Darkness"") or hectic breakbeat assault (""The Power of Doubt"", ""Radiance""). Only on ""Those Who Do Not""-- by some distance the least memorable moment here-- does Surgeon succumb to the kick-drum's wearied trudge.</p>
<p>Almost entirely devoid of anything you might call a tune, Surgeon's productions nonetheless place a high premium on narrative development, plunging from the surface of rigorous acid chugs to clattering rhythmic undercarriages to the rising panic of synthesiser chords so gracefully and organically that the effect is like a microscope training its gaze from the impenetrable solidity of skin to the frenetic molecular activity that secretly comprises it. One can describe these qualities endlessly and barely come closer to pinpointing what it is that makes <i>Breaking the Frame</i> so unexpectedly listenable for the uninitiated: For all that a tune like ""Radiance"" may sound like two continental shelfs grinding past one another, for instance, its forbidding assault is executed with a compositional neatness, clarity, and vibrance that seems to leap out of the speakers.</p>
<p>Even more so, the iridescent hum of ""Presence"" glowers and shudders with the compressed heat and intensity of an angry star in the moments before it collapses into a black hole. It's typical on an album whose structures throw shadows of bleak, inhuman grandeur: Enormity, rather than velocity, defines the best work on <i>Breaking the Frame</i>, and there's a masochistic pleasure in being made to feel very small as you lose yourself on the dancefloor.</p></div>"|15720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15720-breaking-the-frame/|7.2|Tim Finney

During our <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38496-rising-dom"">Rising interview</a> with the Worcester indie-pop outfit last year, their eponymous frontman mentioned that one of the benefits of living in the Massachusetts town was the lax laws on weed possession. About a month later, they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40770-echo-chamber-dom-try-craigslist-personals"">put an ad on Craigslist</a> for what essentially sounded like a band babysitter. In the year and a half leading up to Dom's second EP, <i>Family of Love</i>, they released their debut <i>Sun Bronzed Greek Gods</i> EP <i>twice</i>, the most recent reissue coming from big-dog label Astralwerks. If you didn't get the idea from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvdFnINlN6Q&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the bratty, debauched video for ""Living in America""</a> (again, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38538-video-dom-living-in-america""><i>second</i> clip</a> for the song in less than a year's time), the story about how Dom (the person, and band frontman) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41702-echo-chamber-dom"">got lost on tour while tripping on ecstasy</a> should clue you in to how these guys like spending their time.</p>
<p>So, yeah, not exactly the picture of industriousness, these ones, which also means <i>Family of Love</i>'s brevity-- five songs in just under 17 minutes-- doesn't exactly encourage high expectations out of the gate. The real (and very welcome) shock, then, is how well-honed those five songs sound. This stuff is packed with detail, both silly (the telephone keypad solo on ""Telephone"") and ambitious (""Damn""'s sea of golden guitar lines). A few songs bleed into each other, like parts of a larger whole; the album's most straightforward synth-pop cut, ""Happy Birthday Party"", dissolves into rumpled noise and fluttering flutes towards its close. These are rich, dense-sounding compositions.</p>
<p>The element that makes <i>Family of Love</i> sound like the work of an almost entirely different band is the massive leap in production value. For all its pop acumen, the stumbling point of the homespun <i>Sun Bronzed Greek Gods</i> EP was its scrappy, waterlogged sound, which emphasized the band's juvenile delinquencies at the expense of showcasing the songwriting. This time around, Dom worked with reputed producer Nicholas Vernhes in his NYC-based Rare Book Room studio. His touch lends these slyly complicated pop confections the expansive treatment they clearly deserve, turning the aqueous title track into a stretchy jam reminiscent of the sophistipop outfit Sea and Cake (a band that I would have never thought I'd compare Dom to, but there you go). It's tantalizing to imagine how Dom's previous work would sound through this airy filter-- throwing on <i>Sun Bronzed Greek Gods</i> after listening to this one definitely does the former a disservice.</p>
<p>The improved fidelity also helps with understanding the lyrics. ""Telephone"" turns a simple cellular connection into something between eroticism and euphoria (""I come alive when you pick up the line""), while ""Damn"" expounds on the malevolent self-centered attitude previously explored on ""Burn Bridges"". Potential suitors are tossed aside for the one that got away (and, seemingly, isn't coming back) in the balmy, bar-piano jaunt ""Some Boys"", which features fellow one-name guest vocalist Emma and works much better than the band's last tepid experiment with outside vocals, ""Bowl Cut"", with Cults' Madeline Follin. Most emotionally revealing, though, is the EP's floaty title track, which eschews problems of the heart for sentiments on protection and safety through friendship. As is lore, Dom's frontman grew up as an orphan and spent most of his adolescence bouncing around foster homes; ""Family of Love"" is the first time that he's let the sugary facade crack to reveal his own battered beginnings, as well as his wish for a better, more stable life.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is ""Happy Birthday Party"", a call back to the synth-pop glories of their previous work and a silly natal-fixated trifle that will most likely end up soundtracking an episode of <i>iCarly</i> in the near future. The song is goofy and sort of disposable (catchy as hell, too), but it makes perfect sense, since Dom are prone to acting out whenever they can. Living forever is a desire often explored in pop music; I'm not sure that the boys in Dom want to exist for eternity-- if they keep behaving the way that they allegedly do, they won't even come close-- but they're clearly set on making the most of their time while they're here.</p></div>"|15707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15707-family-of-love-ep/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Rapper/producer Oh No is the younger brother of California backpack-rap overlord Madlib and a restless stoner-rap mind in his own right; he's fond of crazy undertakings like releasing an entire album where he only samples Greek and Middle Eastern psych-pop. Together, Alchemist and Oh No linked up last year to form a duo named Gangrene and to release the underrated <i>Gutter Water</i> album, a dizzy pileup of broken-sounding samples and willfully disgusting sound-clips. Rapper/producer Roc Marciano, meanwhile, is a 1990s-era Queens holdover and a veteran of Busta Rhymes' Flipmode Squad. Last year, he released the excellently dense and grimy self-produced solo album <i>Marcberg</i>, a welcome reminder that there's still life in the old Carhart-and-Tims Mobb Deep model.</p>
<p>On their own, these guys are all cranking out impressive work that happily exists within a long, proud backpack-rap lineage without ever really reaching toward larger audiences. And right now, both Gangrene and Roc Marci are labelmates; all three guys are on Decon Records. So really, it just makes sense to put all three together onto an EP, letting them all rap over each other's beats and seeing what happens. <a href=""http://deconrecords.com/collaborators/gangrene/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Greneberg</i></a>-- its title an amalgam of Gangrene and <i>Marcberg</i>-- is a jumbled pileup of three talented artists who all exist on the same wavelength. It's a split EP, with Roc handling the first three tracks and Gangrene doing the next three. But it's also a collaboration, as all these guys flit in and out of each other's tracks, contributing beats or verses where needed.</p>
<p>""Don't give a fuck about the current direction of rap,"" says Alchemist on ""Sewer Gravy""-- a bold statement from a guy who still works as Eminem's tour DJ. But the quote holds true, since these guys basically combine to form their own aesthetic universe. In this trio's vision of rap, choruses never need to show up, and beats sputter and ripple as often as they thump. The production on <i>Greneberg</i> sounds like what might happen if you threw late-1960s soul and psych into a malfunctioning blender; it's a beguiling fog of horn-stabs and organ sighs and guitar flutters. It sounds chaotic, and that's fine, since the three rappers sound most at home in chaos of their own making.</p>
<p>The EP works best when Roc Marciano is rapping; his threats pack a whole lot of lyrical inventiveness into a few terse, sneery lines. On ""Jet Luggage"": ""Dress spiffy/ Finesse the Mac-11 out the Dickie/ Let off a dozen rounds into ya Crown Vicky."" On ""Momma Told Me"": ""My discography's godly/ Biters copy while I pull one out the crime rhyme glossary/ Before I pop your meat like Luca Brasi."" Oh No and Alchemist can't compete with that, but they try, and it's fun to hear their attempts. (Alc on ""New Shit"": ""Rockin' a jamboree, Barry Manilow piano man/ Freely perform compositions randomly."") And even when the verses don't click, it's worth it to hear all three producers push their vision of what rap is to its logical extreme. This is some hard, dusty, uncompromising underground rap, and there's always room for some of that.</p></div>"|15706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15706-greneberg/|7.4|Tom Breihan

They were constantly about to peak until they were obviously releasing post-peak albums. When Mason's post-Beta <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2294-king-biscuit-time/"" target=""_blank"">King Biscuit Time</a> work (and his album as Black Affair) failed to catch on, he disappeared and fans worried for his mental health. He was rumored to be in debt. His career, his life even, began to resemble his voice: wispy, elusive, sad.</p>
<p>Last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14231-boys-outside/"" target=""_blank"">Boys Outside</a></i>, Mason's first album under his own name, was the first Mason product to suggest stability. A blanched, graceful folk-rock album, it was placid like a heart trauma victim begged by his family to settle down for the good of his health. I mean this musically: Mason's track record on his most spastic work is spotty. He returns to this material on <i>Ghosts Outside</i>, working with UK-based dub veteran Dennis Bovell (whose previous production credits include Mason-friendly touchstones like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"" target=""_blank"">the Pop Group</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"" target=""_blank"">Orange Juice</a>) to re-work <i>Boys Outside</i>'s 10 tracks into classically echoing dub pop.</p>
<p>Anyone waiting for a playful, Mason-esque twist can stop. <i>Ghosts Outside</i> is a sober, catholic dub remix album: one new mix for each track, re-branded with a ""dub"" title (e.g. ""Hound on My Heel"" is now ""Dub on My Heel"", ""Am I Just a Man"" now ""Dub I Just a Man""). Mason was one of the late-90s pop chameleons, so he's no stranger to Reggae and dub music (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZONu6OW6DKY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a personal favorite</a>), but <i>Ghosts Outside</i> represents the first time he has lain himself prostrate before a genre. Possibly in deference to Bovell, possibly because <i>Ghosts Outside</i> is an exercise as much as it is an album, Mason has no interest in coloring outside the lines.</p>
<p>Still, there are gains to be had. Dub is the rare technique that feels both transgressive and <span>cliché</span>, and it fills both roles here. Bovell scatters Mason's vocals, which untether his songs in interesting ways. ""The Letter"", so deliberate in Mason's hands, stalks aimlessly under Bovell, its chorus suddenly ascendant. Bovell's treatments cause the song structures to dissipate but stratify the productions, providing layers through which Mason's voice filters (a crucial function of the best Beta Band compositions). The robust horn charts of ""Lost and Dub"" and especially ""Yesterday Dub"" swallow Mason whole and provide a rigid counterpoint to his gummy croon. While I wish Mason and Bovell had found a way to do this without resorting to the trope-iest of dub tropes-- chirpy guitar chords, reflective drums, pliable basslines-- the effect is, at times, enlightening.</p>
<p>The Mason Fan Club (we meet Wednesdays at 7; dues are collected quarterly) will want this. It is novel, in its way: Mason, who once seemed capable of inventing a new genre with each track, reverently bowed before dub reggae, a staple fetish of Western European pop (see also: Serge Gainsbourg, the Clash, the Police). You're forgiven if you find the idea underwhelming, but it wasn't so long ago that the prospect of any new Mason material seemed doubtful. He's returned, calmer, still exploring, but doing so carefully.</p></div>"|15704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15704-ghosts-outside/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

In prose that evokes a sense of discovery and excitement, Kleyn describes her introduction to the counterculture as a freshman at UC Santa Barbara, where she wrote songs for her poetry class before dropping out to concentrate on music full-time. Kleyn shacked up with one-man psychedelic band Bobby Brown, who brought her a harp for her birthday one year. Rather than take lessons at the university, she taught herself to play the instrument and promised to perform her own songs exclusively. Soon she was lugging that harp-- which was nearly as big as she was-- in and out of buses, down streets and alleyways, and across fields to busk for passersby at street corners, community fairs, and Renaissance festivals all over California.</p>
<p>This musical coming-of-age story eventually becomes a <i>Zelig</i>-style romp through 1970s pop culture, as Kleyn toured with Gregg Allman and hobnobbed with the Eagles, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli, and Sly Stone, among many other contemporaries. She came close to signing with a label, specifically Allman home base Capricorn, but instead she released three self-funded albums on her own. Rather than achieve success as defined by the music industry, Kleyn went on to become a legend among crate diggers and harp-folk enthusiasts. The twist ending: Reading these liner notes, it's clear Kleyn prefers her relative anonymity to anything else that might have been.</p>
<p>The epilogue: More than three decades after self-releasing her debut, Kleyn signed her first record deal with Drag City, which means she now shares a label with that other indie harpist, Joanna Newsom. Kleyn's first proper release is this reissue of <i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i>, a collection of original songs that translate strummed hippie folk music to the plucks and glissandi of the harp. It's a product of its time and place, made by a social and musical free spirit who gently tested the strictures of West Coast pop music not only in her choice of instrument but also in her relentlessly sunny disposition. This is the sort of album you might identify with Laurel Canyon in the late 60s, not with the post-Watergate bicentennial.</p>
<p>In 2011, that mountain child sensibility may seem a little naïve, especially when Kleyn sings, ""Come on, let's sing the world a love song,"" on ""Blackbird"", before performing a hiccupping imitation of birdsong. And yet, that performance-- which sounds like Buddy Holly at a commune-- is so whimsical as to be both endearing and commanding. <i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i> is fascinating as a pop artifact that's more extroverted than Vashti Bunyan's <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i> and more insular than Judee Sill's <i>Heart Food</i>, but its true impact derives from the sheer force of Kleyn's personality, which makes hippie cheer feel brave.</p>
<p>Kleyn displays an intriguing cross section of styles and influences, a range that ostensibly results from her being self-taught. She strums and picks her harp like a guitar on ""Baby Come Close"" and ""Love's Goin' Round"", and on ""Street Song"", she plays the instrument almost like a dulcimer, percussively plucking countermelodies that sound both tender and slightly foreboding. When Kleyn trades the harp for keys on the album's second half, however, she loses some of what makes her distinctive. On songs like ""Well Glory Be"" and ""You Know I Love You"", Kleyn's keyboard playing is more rudimentary than inventive, more technically constrained than artistically free. More often, though, <i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i>'s rough-around-the-edges imperfections only allow Kleyn to convey her spirited optimism all the more forcefully. That sort of music boldness never goes out of style.</p></div>"|15659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15659-love-has-made-me-stronger/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

For one, it's their first album as an honest-to-goodness group: previous Cult of Youth recordings (including the official full-length debut, Dais Records' <i>A Stick to Bind, a Seed to Grow</i>, currently out-of-print) were exclusively the work of frontman Sean Ragon.  On these earlier works, Ragon didn't invite comparisons to neofolk progenitors like Death in June and Current 93 so much as demand them. The combination of Ragon's strident and sepulchral vocals -- which could bear a striking resemblance to those of Swans' Michael Gira-- with vigorously-strummed acoustic guitars and semi-industrial backing beats often made for an arresting experience, but even those attuned to Ragon's particular wavelength might find the original version of Cult of Youth hard to take for more than a few songs at a time.</p>
<p>The four-person configuration presented on <i>Cult of Youth</i> goes a long way toward smoothing over those rough edges. During the album's first few tracks, it sounds like Ragon's simply found a way to successfully translate his previous work to a full-band setting.  As the album progresses, though, it becomes clearer that this version of Cult of Youth (with the help of producer Chris Coady) has taken on an air associated with that small bundle of first-wave post-punk groups who opted to account for more rustic musics within their angles: think pre-<i>Breakfast Club</i> Simple Minds and (especially on ""Through the Fear"") or ""Cattle and Cane""-era Go-Betweens.  Replace Ragon's indomitable vocal presence on a song like ""Casting Thorns"" or ""Weary"" with a more soothing presence-- Marissa Nadler or Alela Diane, for example-- and you might think those songwriters were the ones responsible for writing the track.</p>
<p>The updated, re-recorded version of <i>A Stick to Bind</i> track ""Cold Black Earth"" provides a perfect contrast between Cult of Youth's past and present.  Originally, the song featured a multi-tracked Ragon bellowing the would-be anthem in a stiff and martial fashion, accompanied only by guitar and bass.  On the new album, the track is given a propulsive rolling drum beat, which inspires Ragon (now singing by himself) to speed up his pace and lighten his touch. The addition of well-placed violin flurries (courtesy of Zola Jesus string arranger/full-time Cult member Christiana Key) also helps, turning a lugubrious dirge into something much more spry and palatable.  However, those afraid Ragon has lost his edge amidst these more flattering surroundings don't need to worry:  If anything, as his unhinged performances on ""The Dead Sea"" and ""Weary"" illustrate, he's more willing to risk absurdity as a vocalist now that he has a more robust musical backing to soften the blows.  That goes double for Ragon and friends as musicians: It's hard to not listen to the band take the ""The Lamb"" from its modest acoustic introduction to its expansive semi-psychedelic end and think of what Cult of Youth could accomplish once they reconvene to make their second album.</p></div>"|15719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15719-cult-of-youth/|7.3|David Raposa

The current sextet is nowhere close to the original lineup-- 22 other people had to come and go before that group solidified. The setlists from the reunion shows haven't dipped back before 1992. This version of events sets up a narrative that has Pulp arriving fully formed with their last single for Fire Records, 1992's ""Countdown"", and conquering the charts in short order. It glosses over the longer, much more interesting story of the band's origins and lurching path to fame.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Pulp ought to be playing songs from their early days in their current shows, and I'm definitely not saying they should have gotten the real original lineup back together, but it seems odd to position the reunion as they have-- it has the effect of disowning the fits and starts of their awkward stage. Perhaps that's their intention, but the band's ignored history won't exactly be buried, because Fire's reissued all of it. The music Pulp made from 1983 to 1992 is in no way on the level of the music they made after that, but you can hear all the seeds of <i>His 'N' Hers </i>and <i>Different Class</i> dropping into place, even as the band digresses and fails.</p>
<p>Pulp were formed by Jarvis Cocker and his friend Peter Dalton at the City School in Sheffield in 1978, when the two were in their teens. Dalton was still in the group three years later, when they cut their first Peel Session, a four-song set that shows them torn between hard-edged post-punk and New Wave. Dalton's father forced him to leave the band (he threw a plate of food at him and told him he had to go to university), and by the time Cocker got them signed to Red Rhino and back in the studio, it was 1983 and the band had completely turned over, apart from its gawky front man and drummer Wayne Furniss. The album this version of Pulp recorded, <i>It</i>, almost completely abandons the sound of that first Peel Session in favor of a folkier setup and a generally cheerful disposition.</p>
<p>The first thing anyone familiar with classic, 90s Pulp will probably notice while listening to <i>It </i>is that Cocker hadn't yet developed his stage persona. There's no hint of the lasciviousness, class awareness, or cultural appetite that defined his best-known work. As a vocalist, he's adequate but not yet himself as we know him-- basically, he sounds like he listened to the Chameleons a lot. That in mind, <i>It</i> is a nice indie pop record, but the songwriting seams show. For instance, the waltzing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcmQ7klwkAo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joking Aside</a>"" finds him stretching out certain words awkwardly to make the melody more interesting-- it just sounds odd. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vavCPJuwbgs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Lighthouse</a>"", on the other hand, is pretty accomplished, and its turns of phrase point toward what lay ahead. On release, <i>It </i>sank without a trace, but Cocker soldiered on, getting the band signed to Fire Records. Keyboardist Candida Doyle and guitarist/violinist Russell Senior both joined, putting in place part of the classic 90s lineup of the band.</p>
<p>On the recordings from 1985 to 1988, you can hear Pulp figuring out the kind of band it wants to be. <i>Freaks</i>, the album they released in 1987, is a 180-degree turn from the happy pastoralism of <i>It</i>, and the pair of EPs and two non-album B-sides gathered on the reissue's bonus disc (which has almost the same track selection as the mid-90s compilation <i>Masters of the Universe</i>) move similarly into the dark. In some ways Cocker seems less certain of the kind of singer he'd like to be than on <i>It</i>. Senior takes lead vocals twice on <i>Freaks</i> and once on a B-side, while Cocker wavers between developing his own identity, imitating Ian Curtis, and trying to beat Mark E. Smith at his own game. He sometimes does this a bit tunelessly.</p>
<p>Still, though most of these directions were best abandoned, this is an immensely interesting period for the band, and often an entertaining one. Senior's lead on <i>Freaks</i> opener ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFYDr__X98Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fairground</a>"" is hilariously demonic, and the band builds a carnival atmosphere around his maniacal laughing. Cocker's unsteady grip on the key of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXZAyBXUA5E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Being Followed Home</a>"" is actually an asset, as his flat singing intensifies the paranoia of the lyrics. Getting in key a little more strongly could have made ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoj4S3ulOoA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Want You</a>"" Pulp's first big pop moment-- I'd love to hear him sing it today. His Ian Curtis impression on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBa6il63yrM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master of the Universe</a>"" is a little painful, but Cocker and the band very nearly equal the Fall at their own game on the eight-minute B-side ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV2EAfQ2RO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tunnel</a>"". This material may be uneven, but it points to a band growing more confident and willing to take risks.</p>
<p>The failure of <i>Freaks</i> and its satellite singles prompted Cocker to move to London to study film and very nearly ended the band, but he connected with bassist and fan Steve Mackey in London, and Pulp reconvened with the lineup that would finally put them over the top. Mackey's interest in house music rubbed off on Cocker and proved decisive to the sound of their next LP. <i>Separations</i> was recorded between 1989 and 1991 but not released until 1992. In the meantime, two of its songs, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoeenK4RVM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Legendary Girlfriend</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GjBFDFln90"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Countdown</a>"", had been released as singles, and these afforded them their first significant critical and commercial traction.</p>
<p>The first half of <i>Separations</i> frankly sounds like songs the band would have placed on B-sides just two years later-- the sound and feel are there but the tunes largely aren't. Side two, though, is Pulp's long-awaited artistic breakthrough. It begins with ""Countdown"", the band's first full-on foray into disco (or something like it) and also the first prolonged glimpse we get of Cocker at his sexed-up and observational best. ""My Legendary Girlfriend"", which <i>NME</i> made its Single of the Week in early 1991, is even better, foreshadowing the acidic whispered monologues of ""I Spy"" in its icy verses. In four songs (and a couple of bonus B-sides), we hear Pulp reinventing themselves as the band that made <i>His 'N' Hers</i> and <i>Different Class</i>. In spite of its lack of consistency, the LP is worth hearing by fans for that alone.</p>
<p>Given that the band is almost entirely ignoring these records in its  current reunion, now is as good a time as any to revisit them (or visit  them for the first time, as the case may be). They are each flawed in  different ways, but at the very end of the chronology the  classic Pulp-- the Pulp the band prefers to remember-- emerges,  glistening.</p></div>"|15708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15708-it-freaks-separations/|6.1|Joe Tangari

Senior takes lead vocals twice on <i>Freaks</i> and once on a B-side, while Cocker wavers between developing his own identity, imitating Ian Curtis, and trying to beat Mark E. Smith at his own game. He sometimes does this a bit tunelessly.</p>
<p>Still, though most of these directions were best abandoned, this is an immensely interesting period for the band, and often an entertaining one. Senior's lead on <i>Freaks</i> opener ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFYDr__X98Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fairground</a>"" is hilariously demonic, and the band builds a carnival atmosphere around his maniacal laughing. Cocker's unsteady grip on the key of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXZAyBXUA5E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Being Followed Home</a>"" is actually an asset, as his flat singing intensifies the paranoia of the lyrics. Getting in key a little more strongly could have made ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoj4S3ulOoA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Want You</a>"" Pulp's first big pop moment-- I'd love to hear him sing it today. His Ian Curtis impression on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBa6il63yrM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master of the Universe</a>"" is a little painful, but Cocker and the band very nearly equal the Fall at their own game on the eight-minute B-side ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV2EAfQ2RO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tunnel</a>"". This material may be uneven, but it points to a band growing more confident and willing to take risks.</p>
<p>The failure of <i>Freaks</i> and its satellite singles prompted Cocker to move to London to study film and very nearly ended the band, but he connected with bassist and fan Steve Mackey in London, and Pulp reconvened with the lineup that would finally put them over the top. Mackey's interest in house music rubbed off on Cocker and proved decisive to the sound of their next LP. <i>Separations</i> was recorded between 1989 and 1991 but not released until 1992. In the meantime, two of its songs, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoeenK4RVM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Legendary Girlfriend</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GjBFDFln90"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Countdown</a>"", had been released as singles, and these afforded them their first significant critical and commercial traction.</p>
<p>The first half of <i>Separations</i> frankly sounds like songs the band would have placed on B-sides just two years later-- the sound and feel are there but the tunes largely aren't. Side two, though, is Pulp's long-awaited artistic breakthrough. It begins with ""Countdown"", the band's first full-on foray into disco (or something like it) and also the first prolonged glimpse we get of Cocker at his sexed-up and observational best. ""My Legendary Girlfriend"", which <i>NME</i> made its Single of the Week in early 1991, is even better, foreshadowing the acidic whispered monologues of ""I Spy"" in its icy verses. In four songs (and a couple of bonus B-sides), we hear Pulp reinventing themselves as the band that made <i>His 'N' Hers</i> and <i>Different Class</i>. In spite of its lack of consistency, the LP is worth hearing by fans for that alone.</p>
<p>Given that the band is almost entirely ignoring these records in its  current reunion, now is as good a time as any to revisit them (or visit  them for the first time, as the case may be). They are each flawed in  different ways, but at the very end of the chronology the  classic Pulp-- the Pulp the band prefers to remember-- emerges,  glistening.</p></div>"|15708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15708-it-freaks-separations/|7.1|Joe Tangari

The current sextet is nowhere close to the original lineup-- 22 other people had to come and go before that group solidified. The setlists from the reunion shows haven't dipped back before 1992. This version of events sets up a narrative that has Pulp arriving fully formed with their last single for Fire Records, 1992's ""Countdown"", and conquering the charts in short order. It glosses over the longer, much more interesting story of the band's origins and lurching path to fame.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Pulp ought to be playing songs from their early days in their current shows, and I'm definitely not saying they should have gotten the real original lineup back together, but it seems odd to position the reunion as they have-- it has the effect of disowning the fits and starts of their awkward stage. Perhaps that's their intention, but the band's ignored history won't exactly be buried, because Fire's reissued all of it. The music Pulp made from 1983 to 1992 is in no way on the level of the music they made after that, but you can hear all the seeds of <i>His 'N' Hers </i>and <i>Different Class</i> dropping into place, even as the band digresses and fails.</p>
<p>Pulp were formed by Jarvis Cocker and his friend Peter Dalton at the City School in Sheffield in 1978, when the two were in their teens. Dalton was still in the group three years later, when they cut their first Peel Session, a four-song set that shows them torn between hard-edged post-punk and New Wave. Dalton's father forced him to leave the band (he threw a plate of food at him and told him he had to go to university), and by the time Cocker got them signed to Red Rhino and back in the studio, it was 1983 and the band had completely turned over, apart from its gawky front man and drummer Wayne Furniss. The album this version of Pulp recorded, <i>It</i>, almost completely abandons the sound of that first Peel Session in favor of a folkier setup and a generally cheerful disposition.</p>
<p>The first thing anyone familiar with classic, 90s Pulp will probably notice while listening to <i>It </i>is that Cocker hadn't yet developed his stage persona. There's no hint of the lasciviousness, class awareness, or cultural appetite that defined his best-known work. As a vocalist, he's adequate but not yet himself as we know him-- basically, he sounds like he listened to the Chameleons a lot. That in mind, <i>It</i> is a nice indie pop record, but the songwriting seams show. For instance, the waltzing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcmQ7klwkAo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joking Aside</a>"" finds him stretching out certain words awkwardly to make the melody more interesting-- it just sounds odd. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vavCPJuwbgs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Lighthouse</a>"", on the other hand, is pretty accomplished, and its turns of phrase point toward what lay ahead. On release, <i>It </i>sank without a trace, but Cocker soldiered on, getting the band signed to Fire Records. Keyboardist Candida Doyle and guitarist/violinist Russell Senior both joined, putting in place part of the classic 90s lineup of the band.</p>
<p>On the recordings from 1985 to 1988, you can hear Pulp figuring out the kind of band it wants to be. <i>Freaks</i>, the album they released in 1987, is a 180-degree turn from the happy pastoralism of <i>It</i>, and the pair of EPs and two non-album B-sides gathered on the reissue's bonus disc (which has almost the same track selection as the mid-90s compilation <i>Masters of the Universe</i>) move similarly into the dark. In some ways Cocker seems less certain of the kind of singer he'd like to be than on <i>It</i>.

Though he's released an album every year or two during his two-decade career, <i>Our Blood</i> is his first since 2006's <i>Meadow</i>. Because that extended interim wasn't intentional, it was, as you might imagine, extremely frustrating. After <i>Meadow</i>, Buckner stopped writing records to focus on a score for a movie that was never released; after moving to upstate New York, he worked shifts holding signs for Con Edison construction crews and assisting the Census Bureau before turning his focus back toward a proper LP. His tape machine broke, so he lost all his recordings. Then his laptop was stolen, so he lost all of his recordings again. But these restarts proved purposeful: <i>Our Blood</i> is the most concise, driven, and well-considered Buckner album in the last decade, his ruminative prose-poems becoming determined, last-chance exhortations.</p>
<p>At one time a major-label musician, the peripatetic Buckner has worked with a staggering cast of stars over the years, from Guided by Voices alumnus Doug Gillard and Tortoise's John McEntire to esteemed fiddler Champ Hood and dobro maestro Lloyd Maines. His plans for <i>Our Blood</i> originally included Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley and some pedal steel, but the sessions were among those stolen. For expediency's sake, Buckner played almost all of <i>Our Blood</i> by himself, at home in Kingston, New York. Calling it spare would hedge on hyperbole, but there is a certain necessity-borne restraint. Rather than create complicated convolutions, organs, electric guitars, electronics, and slight percussion mirror or augment the central themes.</p>
<p>This economical approach pushes Buckner's voice into the spotlight, giving him a reason to make every word count-- ""<a href=""http://www.ifc.com/news/2011/06/exclusive-download-interview-r.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a panicked freshness</a>,"" he told me, describing his own singing here. Buckner's rarely sounded more authoritative and confident. For instance, during the album's masterstroke, ""Escape"", the instrumentation is a central acoustic guitar graced only by a few rudimentary keyboard flourishes. ""Let's waste the night/ Pay the price and get out of here,"" Buckner sings, his room-filling baritone unencumbered by its surroundings as he makes his escapist order. His tone sort of forces you to agree. More or less, <i>Our Blood</i> seems to be an album about making better decisions in adulthood-- learning how to hold a job that doesn't hold you down, discovering how not to let bad friends and bar rooms ruin your life, realizing that the best days deliver something you'd never even considered. Buckner's voice feels experienced and empathetic, then, like a knowing pat on the back from a parent or an old friend that recognizes weakness yet pushes you ahead. He sings of ""shaking in the coldest hours,"" ""forgetting to forgive,"" and being ""caught in the lights, left again,"" like a veteran or a guide.</p>
<p>If <i>Our Blood</i> has a fault, it's brevity: Its nine songs (including one slight and predictable instrumental) run only for about 37 minutes. But Buckner's elliptical, impressionistic writing style demands that most of those 37 minutes be heard, studied, and reconsidered. After all, Buckner remains one of the most intriguing songwriters working, using a style that's more likely to show up in anthologies of 20th-century literature than in other Merge Records liner notes. On paper, these tunes are collections of highly punctuated paragraphs (not verses), full of pauses and run-ons and fragments. Diaphanous closer ""Gang"" is a set of two tangled, 70-word questions that beg to be diagrammed; throttled mid-album highlight ""Witness"" mostly forms a spider web of seemingly inconsequential observations, like, ""Sometimes, it would get so cold,"" and ""Leaves, too young to fall."" They're the kinds of phrases that cause the listener to pause mid-song, the rest of it flying by before a meaning's been teased out. These songs store well more than a half-hour of reward and intrigue-- appropriate enough for a record that had to be made three times.</p></div>"|15700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15700-our-blood/|8.0|Grayson Currin

He can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a boisterous patriot for underground UK urban music or a showbiz cat unafraid of his crossover ambitions. On <i>Chill Out Zone</i>'s ""If I Could"", he raps about keeping his music raw and personal while still being able to get it into the charts. It's the kind of sentiment you'd expect from a guy who abandoned his major label for a second chance at the indie life, right after his biggest success with ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOAZsad_ea8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wearing My Rolex</a>"", which fell just shy of topping the UK charts in 2008. But it's also kind of hard to square this ""might blow up but won't go pop"" attitude with R&amp;B cat Ed Sheeran mewling pleasantly on the song's chorus, especially when you consider the stark beats and alien basslines that first brought Wiley to fame.</p>
<p>Ever since his old crew Roll Deep first flirted with the UK Top Ten in 2005, Wiley's been trying on and off to mix grime's twisted low-end theories with the accessibility of R&amp;B, synth-pop, even music hall comedy. <i>Chill Out Zone</i> is his most blatant attempt yet at blending the rough with the smooth, the grimly reflective and the purely pleasurable. There are some beautiful low-key moments, and a few nods to grime's cybernetic fierceness. But most of these cuts are built around synth hooks as bright and immediate as anything you'll find in the work of 1980s-obsessed house producers like Alan Braxe and Fred Falke, even as the lyrics get seriously, painfully emo at times.</p>
<p>It makes for a strange if not always entirely unpleasant mix: soul-searching rap over sugar-coated beats. A self-released EP long enough to really be called an album, it's easy to understand why Big Dada, devoted to left-field tweaks on traditional hip-hop, might not have been interested in <i>Chill Out Zone</i>. Musically it's probably pretty close to the album Wiley's old label, Asylum, was hoping he'd make after <i>See Clear Now</i>, a slick and sumptuous short set of prettified pop tunes. Co-produced by Jay Weathers, the beats on <i>Chill Out Zone</i> are indeed uniformly great. The swoon of ""Get Up"", where they blend the best bits from ambient jungle and synthetic 80s soul music, is as gorgeous a track as any producer's made this year, in any genre. It's just too bad the record's behind-the-boards brilliance is so often obscured by Wiley's surprisingly sluggish rapping and the uniformly lame R&amp;B choruses appended to half the songs.</p>
<p>A lot of the zip and wit has always drained out of Wiley's voice when he's decided to get serious. Even when the music's light and airy, too many cuts on <i>Chill Out Zone</i> find him droning on with surprising self-pity about the perils of fame, thwarted success, his hood credentials, and accusations of selling out. With a backing track that resembles late 80s Steve Winwood as much as anything, ""She Might Holla"" is one of the few cuts where Wiley-the-rapper sounds like he's having any fun, like a guy who actually <i>should</i> be rapping over these unabashedly pop beats. As for the guest singers, they range from adequate to grating, but even the decent ones flop because none of their vocal hooks can match the keyboards for exuberance or memorability. For fans and beat freaks, <i>Chill Out Zone</i> is worth snagging for the shimmering backing tracks and the moments when Wiley bothers to come to life behind the mic. But if you're only going to grab one new Wiley album in 2011, the far more committed and energetic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15595-100-publishing/"" target=""_blank""><i>100% Publishing</i></a>, released just a month ago, is still the one to get.</p></div>"|15711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15711-chill-out-zone/|6.0|Jess Harvell

We bloggers and writers, it turned out, were endlessly tantalized by this austere modesty, and what began as an inevitable reaction to a culture of online oversharing currently verges on being a stock marketing strategy, to be cast off as soon as it gets the job done. You can now visit <i>Pitchfork </i>and read delightfully paradoxical headlines like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43394-wu-lyf-talk-mystique-unintelligible-lyrics/"">WU LYF Talk Mystique</a>."" Meanwhile, newcomer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/daveidspace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dave.I.D</a> makes his quasi-anonymous peers seem like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"">Jandek</a> by comparison.</p>
<p>Google around and you'll be amazed by the number of articles that trumpet the one-man-band's impregnable anonymity before revealing his location (South London), his birth name (David Andrew Hedges), his former profession (accounting), his recording digs (some kind of arty wooden box), his face (half-masked), his influences (everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a> to <a href=""http://chrisandcosey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris &amp; Cosey</a>), details of his personality and process-- shit, I have uncles I know less about than Dave.I.D. But he claims that he was never trying to be a mystery man anyway. ""It's just because I'm not famous,"" he insisted during a <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/05865-dave-id-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Quietus </i>interview</a>, in the enigmatic venue of a Dalston pub. Apparently, failing to aggressively market yourself is now tantamount to stealth.</p>
<p>There's no cultivated air of circumspection around Dave's music either. <i>Response</i>, following up on the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/nov/15/dave-i-d-gangs-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Gangs </i>EP</a>, is a visceral work of raw crimson emotion and apocalyptic drama. It features dense, jaggedly careening electronic rock laced with industrial heaviness, post-punk serration, and proggy pretenses, as if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Einstürzende Neubauten</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"">PiL</a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"">Mars Volta</a> had formed a Voltron-like juggernaut. Also like TVOTR, the music internally combusts with some kind of demonic conviction. Opener ""When Everything is in its Place"" sets a hulking, gothic synthesizer atop a foundation of echoing thwacks, and the tension between engulfing leads and baroquely bruising percussion hardly relents for the entire album. Dave harnesses his concussive beats, blatting synths, air-raid sirens, and growling guitar chords into a dyspeptic, thrillingly overbearing force. Softer touches like the shivering harpsichord of ""SumR"" and the warmly blurred new wave of ""Oil"" are the exceptions accentuating the rule.</p>
<p><i>Response </i>is essentially loop-based, but feels less like an ""electronic production"" than the unconstrained and spontaneous work of a guy who wanted to make a heady rock epic but couldn't be bothered to collaborate. The firebombed atmosphere and abrading textures first command your attention, but Dave is a songwriter at heart, and melody, however seared and bludgeoned, is his anchor. On the downside, his vocals have petulant undertones that can dilute the dark grandeur of the music with a juvenile tinge. But they grew on me, and work especially well as additional musical grist rather than leads. ""You Me Come For"" starts off as jumbled and juddering as its title, but when it subsides into delicate backdrafts of synthesizer, Dave catches his voice in an unusually soulful refrain of ""please let go"" that cycles chillingly in the air. In this moment, you can feel the full measure of his flaws, his longings, and his uncanny powers: his specific, decidedly non-anonymous humanity.</p></div>"|15709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15709-response/|7.6|Brian Howe

Or is it Black Moth Super Rainbow's Haunted Graffiti? Tricky as it is to pinpoint just what's sliding past in <i>Forever Dolphin Love</i>'s psyche-mining slipstreams, it's awfully easy to get caught up in its current all the same. Mockasin's languid, drowsy psych-whimsy-- with its occasional brain-bending detours into a self-made language, more Sigur Rós goobledigook than WU LYF cookie monstrism-- seems to emerge from a gauzy dreamland state, only semi-conscious of its constantly shifting positions. But if you don't come to Connan Mockasin expecting too much pep the first few minutes he's up and going, the gears eventually start to turn.</p>
<p><i>Forever Dolphin Love</i> opens with a gaggle of children shouting salutations at Mockasin: It is, by some distance, the loudest sound on the LP. The stark, almost gestural tunes, Mockasin's wiggly, high-pitched vocals-- whether slathered in Tobacco-style smear or unadorned-- and the record's murky, two-floors-up mix don't exactly get the heart rate rising, but Mockasin's ease around both hooks and arrangements offer plenty to catch your half-attention. Its spindly guitars and squirmy vocals suggest nobody's in any particular hurry to get anyplace, yet <i>Forever Dolphin Love</i>'s drifty hooks, when he gets around to them, never seem to wander too far off course. (Once awoken by those kiddies in the record's first few seconds, Mockasin may be a bit crust-eyed throughout <i>Forever Dolphin Love</i>, but he's always got his wits about him.)</p>
<p>Opener ""Megumi the Milkyway Above"" is something of a slacker samba, its gently descending melody and chipmunk vocals beamed directly from Mockasin's subconscious to yours. It slides into the untethered, almost subliminal ""It's Choade My Dear"": Half-travelogue, half-come on, the tune wafts its way into the room and seems to hang there like a fog. Mockasin's oft-treated, clarity-averse, dare-I-say-wimpy vocals swallow syllables whole, further lending these slippery, spacious tracks their dreamlike quality. It's probably best, all told, that literal meaning takes a backseat to glorious nonsense on a record called <i>Forever Dolphin Love</i>. To that end, the title track-- all 10 minutes and four seconds of it-- is the album's deliriously comatose highlight, a rusty motorik giving way to a kooky, faux-naif, head-sticking hook. An occasional semi-Floydian found-sound burst swirls around the stereo field: The almost skeletal arrangements occasionally give way to a jazz-rock flare-up, but these eyelid flickers never seem to disturb Mockasin's semi-conscious state.</p>
<p><i>Dolphin</i> glides casually through song and snippet, its construction almost elliptical, its effect amniotic. As such, its highlights seem to emerge after-the-fact, burrowing in while it's on and bubbling up later. Mockasin's a more ambitious songwriter than his sleepy demeanor would sometimes suggest, though-- the epic unravel of his tracks are proof enough of that. Ultimately, the ever-unraveling, mind-submerged <i>Forever Dolphin Love</i> reveals itself to be the work of a guy who's sounding small but dreaming big.</p></div>"|15716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15716-forever-dolphin-love/|7.1|Paul Thompson

In the five years since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1204-gulag-orkestar/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gulag Orkestar</i></a> became a surprise success, the dialog surrounding indie culture has drastically shifted away from flesh-and-blood odysseys like Condon's and toward synth textures and vague electronic sighs. (Arguably, Condon and the current crop of emotionally distanced indie stars share nostalgia for experiences not necessarily known first-hand, but that's another conversation.) What's more, many of his peers are in drastically different places, both aesthetically and commercially, since Beirut's last full-length, 2007's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10759-the-flying-club-cup/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Flying Club Cup</i></a>. The National and Arcade Fire have successfully settled into the arena-rocking stage of their respective careers, while Owen Pallett and Sufjan Stevens have embraced idiosyncratic conceptual weirdness-- Stevens especially: Just last week, the pair of Brooklyn shows closing his extraordinary tour behind last year's glitchy, restorative LP <i>The Age of Adz</i> were a complete cosmic blowout, embracing an Etsy-gone-neon ethos and electronic expansiveness alike.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, it seemed like Zach Condon was considering a similar synthetic transformation. The back half of Beirut's mini-LP released that year credited to his Realpeople alias, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12689-march-of-the-zapotec-holland/"" target=""_blank""><i>March of the Zapotec/Holland</i></a>, suggested a move away from his baroque stylings and toward homespun electronic pop in the vein of the Magnetic Fields circa <i>The House of Tomorrow</i>. Apparently, the experiments were just that, as those sounds are nowhere to be found on Beirut's third proper full-length, <i>The Rip Tide</i>. Instead, the project has turned inward, ditching the frilly drama of <i>The Flying Club Cup</i> for more plaintive, understated arrangements. Condon told <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/arts/music/zach-condon-of-beirut-and-new-album-the-rip-tide.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a> earlier this year that the relatively stripped-down approach was a response to his feeling like ""a dilettante with instruments. For years I was picking up new instruments once a month, and for this I was trying to focus a little more, stick with piano, ukulele and trumpet."" You're still going to find a pump organ part or two on this record, but otherwise, <i>The Rip Tide</i>'s reliance on the Basic Beirut Food Groups (piano, horns, strings) keep Condon true to his word.</p>
<p>Leading up to <i>The Rip Tide</i>'s release, Condon <a href=""http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/immaculate-noise/posts/interview-beirut-sets-sites-on-bombay-beach-new-album-this-summer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">also</a> hinted at the album's ""sunny"" disposition. I'm not sure if I'm hearing that. <i>The Rip Tide</i> was recorded in upstate New York two winters ago, and although there's a handful of upbeat cuts (notably, the infinite earworm and LP highlight ""Santa Fe""), a good part of the album sounds especially soft and melancholy, a possible result of the fact that the winter of 2010 was especially snowy and brutal for the greater New York area. If you prefer Condon's balladeer side, then, this isn't a bad thing at all, especially if you are drawn to his richest, most melodrama-dripping highlights (""The Penalty"", ""After the Curtain""). Arrangement-wise, <i>The Rip Tide</i> is slightly more complicated than those past glories, with a few moments (""Payne's Bay"", the swelling title track) that, at times, recall the wooden psychedelic weirdness of Grizzly Bear. Things never get <i>too</i> strange, though: This is still a Beirut album, so declarative horns and impassioned strumming are frequent visitors.</p>
<p>There's a newfound sense of restraint and stateliness on display here, and it's impressive that within five years and at such a young age, Condon's developed so quickly as an arranger and songwriter. Watching him ease into adulthood (he was 19 when <i>Gulag Orkestar</i> dropped) means we've been able to track the maturation of that rich, golden voice he possesses; On <i>The Rip Tide</i>, it occasionally sounds huskier and, in the case of his slight trembles of ""Santa Fe"" and ""Goshen"", a little more unstable. These little cracks in the drywall actually make him seem more human; his voice has always seemed almost too sonorous and perfectly dusty to be real, and hearing him falter (if ever so slightly) is a positive reminder that, not too long ago, this was a kid who, as he told the <i>NYT</i>, ""just want[ed] to swig whiskey and drink beer and go onstage and have a ball."" Still, he's a commanding presence, as his powerful pipes swing to and fro on the robust album bookends ""A Candle's Fire"" and ""Port of Call"". Vocally, <i>The Zach Condon Show</i> is nowhere near cancellation, to a point where the usually distinctive contributing vocals of slow-burning singer/songwriter Sharon Van Etten (who pitches in on ""A Candle's Fire"" and ""Payne's Bay"") are smothered and unnoticeable.</p>
<p>Despite Condon's clear development, <i>The Rip Tide</i> is a defiantly small effort-- the shortest LP in Beirut's catalog (nine songs, clocking in at just over 33 minutes), self-released on Condon's own label, Pompeii. As such, it's a record that's easier to slip by unnoticed than Beirut's two other LPs. (The lack of the previously present heavy affectation contributes to this as well.) However, our own Marc Hogan put it best in his recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12219-east-harlem/"" target=""_blank"">Playlist item</a> on ""East Harlem""-- you get as much out of Condon's creations as you put time into them, and familiarity eventually becomes its own reward. Near the end of the album's beautifully mournful, penultimate cut ""The Peacock"", Condon repeats this telling admission into the face of fading horns: ""He's the only one who knows the words."" His antiquated fantasies still very much belong to him, but it's still a joy to peer inside them-- even if the canvases they're displayed on have shrunk ever so slightly.</p></div>"|15715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15715-the-rip-tide/|7.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

There's a distinct chance the Cleveland-based solo artist and member of tweaked-out futurist outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> might take your record and run away with it. That's a chance Akron-based <a href=""http://www.barkandhiss.com/trblbks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trouble Books</a>, the husband-and-wife duo of Keith Freund and Linda Lejsovka, prove willing to take on this collaborative LP, released on their own Bark and Hiss label.</p>
<p>Luckily for both parties, <i>Trouble Books and Mark McGuire</i> demonstrates a healthy cooperative relationship. The two factions built most of these songs by improving upon one another's already half-formed ideas; figuring out where one party's contribution stops and the other starts soon becomes impossible. Trouble Books seem to work in negative space, letting their insect-like electronic chatterings, spare string pieces, and slow-burning, upward-sloping synths litter the calm. McGuire snakes through these structures in a number of attention-grabbing ways, filling the molds with recognizable, frenetic layerings one moment (""The Golden Waste"") and unleashing a scorching hair-metal wail (""Song for Reinier Lucassen's Sphinx"") the next.</p>
<p>The good-natured piggybacking coheres into a unified and direct whole. In fact, while at times these tracks feel like extraterrestrial Neil Young ballads, the most gratifying thing about <i>Trouble Books</i> is how completely immersive it is, especially album centerpiece ""Local Forecast"". A play on ""Forecast"" and ""Extended Forecast"" from McGuire's 2009 record <i>A Pocket Full of Rain</i>, the track exemplifies how even the most crowded McGuire/Trouble Books composition is still an exercise in transfixing clarity.</p>
<p>Both Freund and Lejsovka sing on nearly every cut here, and while their calm, flat vocals may prove a little too distracting for some, they help reinforce the album's lackadaisical, daydream-like feel. Their vague, oddly graceful observations can be simplistic, but they provide a nice contrast to the sheer lushness of the music. <i>Trouble Books</i> brings together people who have an unusual knack for finishing each other's thoughts, and the result is an uncompromisingly pretty record.</p></div>"|15667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15667-trouble-books-and-mark-mcguire/|7.6|Zach Kelly

He turns out to be addressing a photo of an old acquaintance on a computer screen, but those words also serve to extend an olive branch to his fans. It's been six years since <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lone-Gunman-Idaho/dp/B000BFHVVA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lone Gunman</a></i>, a somewhat out-of-character record heavy on cinematic instrumentals. A whole decade has passed since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4057-levitate/"">Levitate</a></i>, the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2074-idaho/"">Idaho</a> album to feature the kind of slowcore they helped to define alongside bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>. Between Martin's journeyman status and his quiet recent years, you wouldn't be surprised to find him in an aimless experimental phase by now. But instead, this charming comeback sounds like the work of a guy who knows exactly what he's good at doing.</p>
<p>Jeff Martin and John Berry were in high school when they formed Idaho in 1992, and they soon issued their Caroline Records debut, the dark and baleful <i><a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/year-after-year-r256096"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Year After Year</a></i>. Over the ensuing decades, Idaho began to release their own records, and the lineup shifted around the stable center of Martin, who now goes it alone. While the laidback cadence and emotively minimalist instrumentation of <i>You Were a Dick </i>are vintage Idaho, Martin's angst has mellowed into a pensive melancholy with a wry twist. His vocals radiate a welcoming warmth, with just enough coarseness not to float away. No longer straining against high notes, he sings right into the grain of his natural voice, which fits the gentle recriminations and consolations of his lyrics perfectly.</p>
<p>The music comes over as tiny and detailed. Most songs are structured around supple webs of cleanly chiming and pedal-sculpted guitars, or simple piano phrases, lightly dressed in electronic keyboards. But Martin draws many different aspects out of these common elements, from the ramshackle elegance of ""Reminder"" to the soft pastoral glow of ""Structure"". On the title track, what sounds like an <a href=""http://www.ebow.com/home.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EBow</a> misplaced on a fret sends a shimmering buzz coursing through one of the guitar parts, imbuing its clockwork regularity with something a little nervous and wild. Martin is known for using custom <a href=""http://www.tenorguitar.com/glance.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tenor guitars</a>, and in this spare context, those four strings resound like a miniature orchestra. He really lets us hear how his fingers move, with impulsive shifts in phrasing and inflection. The unique, unreplicable emotional character of each note and the snowflake-like differences between similar chords shine out in high definition.</p>
<p>These little loose threads keep the soothing vibe from getting monotonous, as do periodic wake-up calls like the quick-and-dirty instrumental ""Impaler"" and the booming pop-punk of ""The Space Between"". Thanks to the internal consistency of Martin's time-honed tone, the mystical <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>-ish folk of ""Someone to Relate To"" can sit comfortably next to a shaggy anthem like ""Up the Hill"". Again, he knows what he's good at. But even more importantly-- judging from this familiar yet fresh return to form-- he still believes in it, too.</p></div>"|15713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15713-you-were-a-dick/|7.8|Brian Howe

Jon Brooks, who has functioned under this moniker since the mini-album <i><a href=""http://ghostbox.greedbag.com/buy/mind-how-you-go-0/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mind How You Go</a></i> in 2005, plugged into the fear and paranoia induced by such declarations. If you feel the need to assure people that everything is alright, they're going to wonder what caused you to tell them that in the first place. Or, as Brooks put it in an <a href=""http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/reviews/xlr8r%20tac%20oc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>: ""Everything's fine, but there is something not quite right about it."" Brooks is obsessed with the government-sponsored enmity that flows through many of the public information films (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information_films"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PIFs</a>) Britain produced in the 1970s and 1980s, often recreating the stern, authoritarian tones of their announcers at certain points in his albums. <i>As the Crow Flies</i>, his third record as the Advisory Circle, also begins that way, with a female voice claiming: ""The Advisory Circle. We make the decisions so you don't have to.""</p>
<p>Another album modeled on such austerity might feel like Brooks was over-egging an idea that partially helped inspire the hauntology sub-genre. So instead he's slowly evolved the Advisory Circle sound, bringing in acoustic instrumentation to supplement the banks of old analog equipment that remain his primary source tools. This pushes <i>As the Crow</i> <i>Flies</i> a little closer to the kind of darkly pastoral electronic work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> were tinkering with on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/"">Geogaddi</a></i>. But this has more conceptual weight than that record, with Brooks concocting a series of songs inspired by the dueling qualities of stasis and change that cycle through the changing of the seasons. It's even got some wonderfully apt sleeve notes by Ronald Hutton, the head of History at Bristol University, who points out the various merits of seasonal festivals in Britain. Like most <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> releases, the attention to detail is impressive, with designer Julian House completing the package via a series of images of an imagined TV title sequence, aimed at dredging up damaged memories of barely remembered children's dramas from yesteryear.</p>
<p>On listening to <i>As the Crow Flies</i> it's easy to picture Brooks fully taking to his task. You can almost see him clad in a thick wool sweater, watching the droplets of snow amassing on his window frame as he prods at an old synthesizer during the wintery ""Now Ends the Beginning"". On the sci-fi fantasy ""Learning Owl Reappears"" it feels like he's been gazing up to a star-filled sky through a telescope on a long autumnal evening to find inspiration. This is a less foreboding record than prior Advisory Circle outings, but it's no less sad. ""The Patchwork Explains"" might be one of Brooks' most impressive pieces yet, with its icy synth tendrils spiking away at a plodding Kraftwerkian throb, somehow managing to be both playful and quietly beautiful. That it's dedicated to the memory of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a> singer Trish Keenan couldn't be more appropriate, reflecting her group's sense of wonder and love of offbeat pop.</p>
<p>Brooks carefully varies the character of the album as it progresses, nudging the listener down a subtly shifting stylistic gradient that takes in a Renaissance era lament (""Ceridwen""), steely Europop with prog intonations (""Modern Through Movement""), and a lone vocal venture reminiscent in mood of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a>'s underrated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/"">10,000 Hz Legend</a></i> (""Lonely Signalman""). It's evocative, touching, and nostalgic, with the simple keyboard melodies often making it feel like this is all being experienced by a child blinking in bewilderment and amazement as the concept of the natural world is explained to them. But mostly there's a strong sense of discovery, of someone attempting to make sense of their surroundings, with Brooks cast as a voyager trampling through vast stretches of the British countryside, crisp leaves crinkling underfoot as he expertly funnels everything he sees and feels into song.</p></div>"|15712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15712-as-the-crow-flies/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Operating a music label like a fashion line is a dicey proposition-- for every success at merging the two worlds (Fischerspooner, Gaga, Urban Outfitters, Odd Future), there are infinitely more unmemorable attempts. One way to succeed is to stamp your brand on a ton of different things, and count on the fact that the value accrued by the very good outweighs the hits you take from the bad. That's been <a href=""http://www.kitsune.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kitsuné</a>'s goal, it seems, since opening for business in 2002. For a brief minute last decade, it seemed that the label that packaged its first compilation with a pasta recipe was actually going to win the big-club dance music sweepstakes through sheer number of releases alone-- James Murphy, remember, was losing his edge to ""the kids from France""-- but their batting average quickly dipped. By 2007, Pitchfork's Tim Finney could <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9753-kitsune-maison-3/"" target=""_blank"">claim</a> the label had experienced ""a meteorite fall-from-grace.""</p>
<p>Which brings us to 2011, and Kitsuné's latest attempt to merge the worlds of dance and rock music with London trio <a href=""http://istropical.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Is Tropical</a>. They certainly lean more toward style than substance-- they wear bags over their head in promo photos, their band name and debut album title both sound like they were clipped from the middle of sentences in fashion magazines-- but that doesn't mean there's nothing to like on <i>Native To</i>. Like so many of the incalculable number of beachy New Order re-orderings that've cropped up over the past couple of decades, the album packs a bit of catchy disco slickness (""Lies""), more than a few moments that would work well as jingles for travel adverts (opener ""South Pacific""), and approximations of moody, guitar-heavy Brit rock (""Oranges"").</p>
<p>While current American indie artists prefer their surf-and-sand music to echo vague, blurry memories of hitting the beach, Is Tropical aim to pack dancefloors. It's certainly easy to imagine them becoming the next Big UK Band, as well, playing festival gigs and massive club dates and making a fairly good living at it for a few years-- many worse things have happened. ""I'll Take My Chances"" may be a straightforward ditty about going for it with a girl, but it holds the best statement of purpose for the band's M.O. of keeping their music uncluttered and uncomplicated: ""Any idiot knows that simplicity wins."" Indeed, <i>Native To</i> is packed with well-executed, hummable stuff, but it wears thin quickly. To use a style comparison, it's like buying clothes from discount Euro-style mall retailer H&amp;M: They look great on the rack, but you're lucky if they last you through the season.</p></div>"|15702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15702-native-to/|5.0|Eric Harvey

Like Bill Callahan-- another artist who came out of Drag City's mid-1990s bumper crop-- Oldham makes music that implies intimacy while evoking so many personalities that an overview of his work is more like a cubist painting than a candid photograph.</p>
<p>He's worked at this pace for nearly 20 years now, and what's amazing isn't that he's managed to maintain consistency, but that he's made inconsistency part of his artistic identity. In the past two years, he's worked with David Byrne on film scores and remixed Hot Chip. He starred in a short film that made it to Sundance (<i>Pioneer</i>) and made a brief appearance in <i>Jackass 3D</i> alongside a gorilla. Even when his records arguably don't turn out well-- like the Tortoise-assisted covers album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/705-the-brave-and-the-bold/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bold and the Brave</i></a> or<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"" target=""_blank"">Greatest Palace Music</a></i>, where he gave high-gloss treatments to his earliest, most rustic material-- the point is that Oldham threw out his ego and recorded them anyway.</p>
<p>But an artist's generosity can be a fan's chore, and a lot of Oldham's releases end up being markers of time more than anything else. Of his recent offerings, ""There Is No God"" b/w ""God Is Love"", released as a benefit for two Gulf-oriented charities,<a href=""http://saveourgulf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Save Our Gulf</a> and the <a href=""http://www.turtlehospital.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turtle Hospital</a>, is most in line with what Oldham has done well in the past few years: Joyful, barefoot Americana at some unfixed intersection between folk and rock. Oldham's last two solo full-lengths (2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beware</i></a> and 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11549-lie-down-in-the-light/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lie Down in the Light</i></a>) are clever and diverse, working with sounds so familiar that the music's idiosyncrasies-- a bizarre key change, a clarinet or flute solo, a few extra bars of a verse where a more traditional song would've moved to the chorus-- melt into the overall impression of the music. It's an approach that Oldham has probably absorbed from country, a genre with enough clearly delineated rules that the fun part becomes how to bend or break them without becoming something unrecognizable: The innovation is in the craft, not the concept.</p>
<p>""Must Be Blind"" and ""Live in Muscle"" are two songs Oldham wrote with Matt Sweeney, the former Chavez singer he last collaborated with on 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/703-superwolf/"" target=""_blank""><i>Superwolf</i></a> album. Musically, they're more stoic and musky than ""There Is No God""-- an influence of Sweeney's that brings out the fist-on-chest Appalachian Oldham explored on 1999's <i>I See a Darkness</i>, still probably his best-known album. There are Will Oldhams for every occasion; this is the Oldham to bring out when riding alone in the frozen fields before dawn or burying your first-born in the rocky plot behind the outhouse. Personally, I prefer the shroom-eating, big-grinned porchsitter he's become in the past few years, but his sobriety is tense and convincing, and probably the mood people associate him with the most.</p>
<p><i>The Mindeater</i> is the most atypical thing he's released this year in part because he gave up musical control to the Phantom Famliy Halo, a psych band formerly based in Louisville, Kentucky, where Oldham is from and has lived for most of his life.

Black Emperor reunion: the unexpected, out-of-nowhere timing of it; the uncannily ageless, I-can't-believe-it's-not-2000 quality of the band's performances; the inclusion of ""Weird"" Al Yankovic on their curated All Tomorrow's Parties bill. But perhaps the strangest thing was seeing Efrim Menuck recede back into the role of silent, anonymous, ensemble player. More than any other member associated with the Montreal orchestro-rock collective, Menuck has spent much of the past decade deconstructing the mythology and challenging the assumptions surrounding Godspeed (take your pick: they're anarchists; anti-social; humorless; Luddites; squat-dwellers; etc.). Not only has Menuck's offshoot band Thee Silver Mt. Zion emerged over the past decade as a lyrically direct, increasingly aggressive rock band, Menuck has both made himself more readily available to the press and, in concert, become a rather <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTWO0Yz2PtQ&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hilarious</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35ZuVDEpqH8&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stage</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJtDrTQKnro&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">banterist</a>.</p>
<p>So perhaps it's no mere coincidence that Menuck's re-immersion into the Godspeed regimen coincides with the appearance of his first solo album, <i>Plays ""High Gospel""</i>, a record that, in spirit if not sound, recalls another solo album released in the shadow of a monolith: <i>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</i>. Both albums are consumed by matters of love, loss, abandonment by maternal figures, and spirituality; both showcase the respective artists at their somberly tender and uncompromisingly abrasive extremes; and both are emotionally raw, deeply personal works greatly distinguished from the bands that earned their makers renown. (And, come to think of it, Menuck's wiry wail of a voice is pitched about halfway between Lennon's elocution and Yoko's anarchic shriek.)</p>
<p>If <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>'s psychic terrain was mapped out by the death of Lennon's mother and his blossoming romance with Yoko, on <i>""High Gospel""</i>, the emotional goal posts are set by the birth of Menuck's son and the 2009 suicide of his friend/collaborator Vic Chesnutt. And as to be expected from a record recorded over two years in (according to Menuck) ""scraps and hiccups,"" the song-to-song shifts in mood can be disarmingly severe, moving from the churchly organ tones, defiantly celebratory choral vocal, and synth starbursts of opener ""Our Lady of Parc Extension and Her Munificent Sorrows"" to the frosty, electronic chill of ""A 12 Pt. Program For Keep on Keepin' On"", which sounds like a séance conducted via shortwave radio, with a cacophonous, click-tracked surge of percussion intensifying the feel of impending doom.</p>
<p>However, as <i>""High Gospel""</i> plays out, such jarring transitions seem to be less the result of random, grab-bag sequencing and more a manifestation of the album's central theme: that moments of joy and sorrow often come without warning and, in some cases, are triggered by one another. The beautifully desolate piano ballad ""Heavy Calls &amp; Hospital Blues"" presents a peaceful portrait of a sleeping child that's shattered by an ominous late-night call from the infirmary, while the mantric, ecstatic closer ""I Am No Longer a Motherless Child"" works the other way, as Menuck comes to terms with the pain of losing a parent by becoming one himself.</p>
<p>But it's the seven-minute centerpiece ""Kaddish for Chesnutt"" that best exemplifies <i>""High Gospel""</i>'s attempt to reconcile happiness and sadness, confusion and comfort, living and dying. Menuck has obliquely referenced his Jewish roots in the past, from the ""Mt. Zion"" in his band's name to the Hebrew script that graced the cover of Godspeed's <i>Slow Riot for Zero Kanada </i>EP. But here, his invocation of the Kaddish-- a prayer chanted during Jewish funeral services-- proves quite literal, as a mournful electric-guitar soundscape yields to a solemn, repeated group vocal (courtesy of Menuck and some Silver Mt. Zion mates), not unlike that of a temple congregation praying in unison. Though traditionally recited to commemorate those who have passed, the Kaddish makes no explicit mention of death, and likewise, ""Kaddish for Chesnutt"" makes no direct allusion to Vic Chesnutt. Rather, its repeated, increasingly impassioned invocation of the Old Testament's ""tree of life"" is Menuck's means of elevating the late singer to the realm of the eternal, lifting his skinny fists like antennas to heaven.</p></div>"|15703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15703-plays-high-gospel/|7.6|Stuart Berman

""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkRBCPRf8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lay It Down</a>"", <i>King of Hearts</i>' peak moment and a lead single that predates the record by nearly a year, is an exemplar: Its innocent, almost naïve earnestness is married to a preternatural sense for R&amp;B vocal acrobatics, giving dimension and believability to his devotion. A distinctive talent, Lloyd often let his vocals dance around the periphery of a song, giving <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FADxR_aFPa4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his best tracks</a> a spacey, removed quality. As a whole, the LP takes a major step toward streamlining his sound, pushing Lloyd's voice to the center and making a bid for a higher level of recognition in the R&amp;B world. Despite a few missteps, it is a major success, in large part due to the chemistry of Lloyd with producer Polow Da Don.</p>
<p>Lloyd's knack for endearing romanticism is a vehicle for great music, and when the record falters, it feels like a misunderstanding of how his talent operates. The superfluous intro track can be forgiven thanks to its brevity and a surprisingly clunker-free verse from the Game. But ""Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)"", the first full song on the album, is bizarre and clumsy. The generic, faux-Motown beat frames the track as a joke, along the lines of Cee Lo's ""Fuck You"". Perhaps the right performance could have saved lyrics that fetishize the vagina as a relationship's vestigial remnant, but it's hard to buy the tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation of a line like ""I'm about to kill this bitch!"" from an artist typically so wrapped up in enthusiastic sincerity. Aside from this misstep and a platitudinous track aptly titled ""World Cry"", <i>King of Hearts</i> seems perfectly matched to fit Lloyd's strengths.</p>
<p>Polow clearly understands those strengths. Outside the occasional producer's flourish-- like the grinding bass break that opens Young Jeezy's verse on ""Be the One""-- his work is primarily devoted to underlining Lloyd's vocals for maximum impact. On ""Naked"", Lloyd's performance has a dreamy distance from the physical reality of sexuality; instead, his vocals are draped in softly descending washes of guitar and muted trumpet lines, giving a sensuous texture to this awestruck ode to beauty. Single ""Cupid""'s exuberant chorus baits cynical listeners: It works so well as a radio single because, through mild repetition, the hook's infectious idealism overwhelms any resistance.</p>
<p>The heart of the record, though, are tracks like the euphoric headrush ""Jigsaw"", where Lloyd's sense of rhythm lets his vocals dance confidently in the subdivisions of the groove, balancing sugary enthusiasm with deft physicality. Many of the album's best songs seem to inspire comparisons with dancing: There is a connection to the idea of dance as liberation here, as Lloyd's blushing sincerity builds up potential energy, the nimble performance acts as a release valve. In an echo of Aaliyah's ""Loose Rap"", album highlight ""Shake It 4 Daddy"" finds Lloyd dancing atop a vocal shadow; somehow, in his hands, even strip club storytelling comes across as boyish flirtation. Although the lyrics imply he's in the audience, the song's excitement suggests Lloyd is the one performing.</p></div>"|15658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15658-king-of-hearts/|7.9|David Drake

The twitchy grooves of <i>Parabolas</i>, the L.A. transplant's debut LP for the Cologne, Germany-based label, fit right into founder Wolfgang Voigt's minimal techno aesthetic. What binds Tejada's eclectic decade-plus of work is an approach where it seems like every instrumental tweak and glitch has been studiously labored over for great stretches of time. <i>Parabolas </i>feels that way, too. It's a collection of 12 tech-house instrumentals, pitched somewhere between the visceral punch of classic Detroit techno and the headphone-oriented approach of 1990s electronica like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5189-the-black-dog/"">Black Dog Production</a>'s <i>Bytes</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>'s <i>Incunabula</i>.</p>
<p>That's some daunting company to keep, but Tejada has the skills to transform his pilfering into something greater than the sum of its influences. Opener ""Farther and Fainter"" is a case in point. The opening bars initially sound like they're pushing into the kind of densely packed prettiness <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> was obsessing over on <i>Selected Ambient Works 85–92</i>. But then the deadened bass drum beat kicks in, joined by a series of bell-like samples, and the song stretches to a close via low-end synth noise wrapped around a fading hi-hat. Blanketed in a pensive quality that most bedroom techno shares, the track is a good indication of what to expect from much of <i>Parabolas</i>, which essentially acts like a form of comedown comfort food.</p>
<p>Occasionally Tejada strays close to a full-on ambient sound (""The Dream"", ""The Honest Man""), but for the most part <i>Parobalas</i> is deliberately stunted at birth. Tracks like ""Subdivided"" juxtapose zesty synth rolls with stabs of murky bass and rarely deviate from that path. Occasionally the trance-like state Tejada favors can be a little monotonous, but he usually works in unexpected twists just before the music settles into a rut. For example, a few corkscrewing samples light up ""Timeless Space"", while ""The Living Night"" tempers its house-y piano stabs by heading somewhere far darker and then frittering into ambience.</p>
<p>The doomy tone that briefly surfaces in ""The Living Night"" recurs across much of <i>Parabolas</i>' later tracks, neatly contrasting with the airy material that opened the album. On ""Unstable Condition"", Tejada even heads close to the kind of relentless downer vibe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2581-lfo/"">LFO</a> toyed with on ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/U-dsUVSP14A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tied Up</a>"" albeit with all the dissonance scraped away to fit with this record's late-night mood. The convergence of light and dark helps make <i>Parobalas</i> work well as a self-contained piece, while the album's sense of focus elevates it above some of Tejada's typical lurches in style.</p></div>"|15692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15692-parabolas/|7.1|Nick Neyland

A fedora, to be specific. Always front and center in the mix, Clare's voice drips with the brassy confidence and implied stylistic reverence of post-Mark Ronson ladies' men like Bruno Mars, Wallpaper, and Mayer Hawthorne, artists who seem to exist solely to don fancy duds in men's magazines that congratulate them for doing absolutely nothing to upset the concept of how this stuff should sound and look-- soul music as a fashion accessory, mostly.</p>
<p>The difference with Clare is that the young Brit is being produced by Diplo and Switch and it all feels icky in a way any album does when it comes off like a record exec's version of Listerine, something that invents both the problem and the solution. This year, the likes of James Blake, Jamie Woon, Katy B, and to a certain extent SBTRKT have all made strides in satisfying those who'd prefer the fluidity and innovation of dubstep and UK bass music be delivered by knowable singer-songwriters. It was basically the same issue that people had when trying to monetize electronica over a decade ago, and <i>Lateness </i>offers up the same one-step fix: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXd6u9o6dYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keep it goin' louder</a>.</p>
<p>But the idea that this is even a proper forum for discussing the purity of the form gets decimated in less than three-minutes with opener ""Up All Night"". Major Lazer too minimal and chaste for your blood? How do you feel about Arctic Monkeys guitar chug with dancehall beats and that almost-rap cadence from ""Wannabe""? In its quest for confluence with lyrics that play out like a longform Bacardi ad, it's a tidy summary in how the hedonism of pop radio can feel so predatory these days. (Or you'll end up with a justified worry that Major Lazer's collaboration with No Doubt will end up sounding like <i>Transistor</i>-era 311.)</p>
<p>From there, <i>Lateness </i>never does much to prove Clare and his producers were on the same page (let alone reading from the same book). Clare's songs are perfectly innocuous and only occasionally irritating transmissions from the mindset of the modern pop&amp;B male, oversinging underwritten come-ons to either the woman who got away (""Humming Bird""), the woman who <i>won</i>'<i>t</i> get away if he's got anything to say about it (""Relax My Beloved""), or failing that, her fine-ass friend (""Treading Water""). The line, ""I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe/ At the end of all you're still my best friend,"" basically reveals the borders of his worldview.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Diplo and Switch are producing like they don't need Clare's voice and he's singing like he doesn't want their production. The high-NRG drums and sandworm synth lines hardly sound like necessary or even complementary additions to ""Treading Water""-- an ""unplugged"" version is helpfully included on the Deluxe Edition if you doubt me. Likewise, the caricatured deep bass on ""Relax My Beloved"" and the gospel-via-T.D. Jakes gaudiness of ""Sanctuary"" are nice tricks that may make you wonder if Diplo and Switch will regret not saving them for someone who'd actually appreciate the details. As the second half drags on, Clare tries to muster some grit into terribly sappy love jams with self-explanatory titles like ""Love You"", ""I Won't Let You Down"", and ""Where Is the Heart?"" making you wonder if <i>Lateness </i>is essentially a Ray LaMontagne record with beats.</p>
<p>Then comes the cover of ""When Doves Cry"". He's almost certainly aware of the talking points-- not just the supposed audacity of trying one's hand at such an acknowledged and shopworn classic, but in how it fits on a record with such an exaggerated low end when Prince famously removed bass entirely. Like most of <i>Lateness, </i>though, it's more eye-rolling than pernicious. (You could argue ""Tight Rope"" is a worse crime for revealing Clare has clearly never heard of Janelle Monáe, taking the central metaphor from her song of the same name wholesale and nothing else worthwhile.)</p>
<p>Truth is, it's much easier getting mad at the marketing plan of <i>Lateness of the Hour </i>than the record itself: The total mismatch of artistic motivation makes everyone involved come off like innocent bystanders, not manipulators.

Combining antiquated diction with lilting melodies drawn from UK folk rock and U.S. indie pop, his compositions are recognizable whether they're sung by Marianne Faithfull, Patti Smith, or anyone else. What stands out most from <a href=""http://decemberists.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Decemberists</a>' near-decade together isn't the albums. Instead, it's the songs-- ""Billy Liar"", ""16 Military Wives"", ""O Valencia!"", ""On the Bus Mall""-- that are the best showcases for the Portland band's lyrical indulgences and clever arrangements. The pop song, especially the kind that hovers around the three- or four-minute mark, has been the ideal framework for Meloy's explorations of prog rock, sea shanties, wake music, fanfares, and showtunes.</p>
<p>2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Hazards of Love</i></a> was an especially egregious misstep. A concept album with an overarching narrative involving otherworldly lovers and forest-bound shapeshifters, <i>Hazards</i> was grandiose and mock-epic, but it evoked a world much more circumscribed than can be found in almost any of Meloy's individual songs. Most recently, <i>The King Is Dead</i>'s abrupt change in style played as a retreat: a means of making amends to the same fans <i>Hazards </i>risked alienating. Impressively, though, the album's renewed emphasis on standalone tunes made Americana jangle sound like not only a natural detour for the Decemberists, but an inevitable destination. A few months later, the eight-song <i>iTunes Session</i> puts curious punctuation on its predecessor, with nice flourishes of fiddle from former Nickel Creek member Sara Watkins, but a tracklist that pulls from throughout the band's discography while skipping the high points.</p>
<p>The Decemberists fare better on <i>iTunes Session</i> when they play songs from the new album than when they travel back through their own and others' catalogs. ""Calamity Song"" may not be nearly as calamitous here as in its studio version, but the runaway ooh-ooh-oohs make for one of the EP's most unguardedly joyful moments. ""June Hymn"", meanwhile, is no ""January Hymn"", but the song's folksy ramble comes through more clearly in this slightly more stripped-down performance than it did on the LP. Still, <i>King</i> dud ""This Is Why We Fight"" is a dud again here-- further proof Meloy's examinations of military violence work only when he filters them through character and story (see also the genuinely affecting ""Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)"" vs. the pedantic ""16 Military Wives""). And the band tries to salvage ""The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)"" by reworking it as a languid country lament, but while fiddle and weepy pedal steel reinforce the tragedy of the lyrics, the melody feels soggy, the performance a bit aimless. ""Shiny"", from 2003 debut EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2240-5-songs-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>5 Songs</i></a>, likewise rambles, though it's worth revisiting that early effort's ""Oceanside"" and ""I Don't Mind"".</p>
<p>The primary draw of <i>iTunes Session</i> is the pair of covers that act almost as its bookends. They're an uneven couple. The Decemberists effectively recast Leonard Cohen's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jexNsBjz1r8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye</a>"" as a country tear-jerker, but Meloy just can't muster the gravity to sell the song. Though Cohen's lyrical style is as stilted and heady as Meloy's, the elder songwriter's near-comical solemnity is a bad fit, especially considering what Meloy could've done with a tune by wryer Cohen contemporaries like Loudon Wainwright III or Randy Newman. Luckily, a locomotive-paced, countrified rendition of Fruit Bats' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZJJiW1z3QY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">When U Love Somebody</a>"" better suits the Decemberists' strengths. But it only makes you wonder how something like ""The Engine Driver"" might sound translated to a genre famous for songs about trains. In that regard, the EP's lackluster tracklist leaves <i>iTunes Session</i> seeming clunky and unrepresentative-- like it's not a full set, but an excerpt from a larger show.</p></div>"|15691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15691-itunes-session/|6.2|Stephen M.

Over four albums and a live set, longtime frontman Robert Pollard's most dependable post-GBV group has dealt in obnoxiously catchy, insistent, Meadowlands-ready power-pop caught somewhere between Cheap Trick's <i>Heaven Tonight</i> and the Who's <i>Quadrophenia</i>. Pollard, Decemberists drummer John Moen, and Spaceships sonic mastermind Chris Slusarenko may not play arenas-- in fact, the Spaceships haven't played much of anywhere in years-- but their best tunes have both the hooks and the heft to reach the back-bleachers. Seems like any good arena rock band, whether real or perceived, eventually gets around to the double-discer.</p>
<p>2008's <i>Brown Submarine</i> arrived in the wake of a mid-2000s turn toward overcooked, plodding, patchy numbers run through with too many opposing currents. Over their four fine LPs, the Spaceships have pushed the hooks right out front, done away with almost everything short of the mid-tempo, and culled many of the musical left-turns, leaving Pollard with four of the most immediately enjoyable, fat-free LPs of his career. Between Pollard's excitable vocals and streamlined hooks, Slusarenko's rich but unfussy arrangements, and Moen's rock-solid but far-from-flashy backbeat, the spotlight's always seemed fixed on the songs themselves.</p>
<p>A double LP is different: With all that extra room, you can stretch out, goof off, or beef up, all of which <i>Let It Beard</i> does, sometimes quite well. These guys, 1970s rock junkies that they are, are scholars of the form, and it's to their credit that <i>Let It Beard</i> doesn't sound like two single-length Boston Spaceships LPs affixed at the gatefold. It operates instead like a double LP from that format's classic era, with roomier tunes, more expansive arrangements, ripping guitar solos, and (largely inconsequential) cameos from the likes of  Wire's Colin Newman, the Dirtbombs' Mick Collins and Dinosaur Jr.'s J  Mascis. The way they break down <i>Let It Beard</i>'s four sides even seems to hold to the classic template: A is for the bombastic, ambitious ones, the rockers are on B, the weird ones on C, and D brings it all together. Alas, that most damning of double-album takedowns is also true of <i>Let It Beard</i>: At 26 songs and 75 minutes, it's entirely too long.</p>
<p>A portent of things to come, bumpy opener ""Blind 20-20"" never finds its footing, shifting brusquely between unadorned piano-and-vocal and a thuddy riff. Titles aside, the empty snarl of ""Juggernaut vs. Monolith"" and the centerless ""Tourist U.F.O."" don't fare much better. These first few songs either fail to get to the point (or don't seem to have much point to get to...). ""Minefield Searcher"" sounds strikingly like a Robyn Hitchcock cover of a Cheap Trick song and it's the set's first truly spirited melody, but it's over before you'll notice. ""Make a Record for Lo-Life"" proves the set's first big winner, its bright, knotty melody bashed out with marksman's ease, but it's quickly followed by the dismal ""Let More Light in the House"", a dirgey, disinterested moaner just barely salvaged by its banjo-and-snare-augmented second half. It's hard to think of a more lackluster stretch on a Pollard record of any vintage. Could be they didn't want to stick all the good ones up front, but whatever the case, no one's going to accuse <i>Let It Beard</i> of being frontloaded.</p>
<p>Things pick up with lively punker ""You Just Can't Tell"", leading <i>Beard</i> into its heftier second quarter. The album's highest high, the sorta-Stonesy soul-singer-assisted pub-rocker ""Chevy Marigold"", takes its time getting everything right, and the stretch that follows-- the peppy ""Earmarked for Collision"" and ""Toppings Take the Cake"" and the triumphal ""Tabby and Lucy""-- is <i>Let It Beard</i>'s best, a lot of fun without a whole lot of fuss. Not coincidentally, it's this run that feels most like the Spaceships LPs that've come before it, their tempos swift, their hooks coming in quick and dirty. In a way, <i>Let It Beard</i>'s overly sinewy opening stretch feels like the tension before the glorious release of this rocky run. But the other Spaceships records have never felt the need to tease the listener in quite this way: There's no waiting around for the good song when every song's pretty good.</p>
<p>Then there's ""(I'll Make It) Strong for You"", a stirring, stripped-down curio that ushers in <i>Beard</i>'s oddest section. This third side finds Pollard's eccentricties taking over in a way (Circus Devils aside) he hasn't allowed himself in some time. Take the schizoid ""A Hair in Every Square Inch of the House"", vacillating wildly between soft strums and fierce shouts; it's not brilliant, but it's peculiar in a far less leaden way than the row of misses that kicks off the collection. They're not all winners back there-- too bad Pollard wasted a title like ""The Ballad of Bad Whiskey"" on such a dreary tune-- but they're the first indication that a double LP was, in fact, a good idea for the Spaceships. With all this extra time, they can afford to be a little odder, stick their necks out a little more, and while it's a shame they seem to separate the pop from the weirdness-- rather than letting them bleed all over each other, as on Pollard's best records-- at least here the latter makes a good showing. ""Let it beard and get all weird,"" Pollard sings on the title track, and that's as close to a thesis statement as the album offers: This is what we do, he's saying, only scragglier. And so it is.</p>
<p>To cap things off, a side of solidly unspectacular riff-rockers and spindly balladry culminates in rousing closer ""Inspiration Points"". While it does bring together the diffuse strong structures, the stop/start energy, and a bit of the off-kilter weirdness that characterizes the preceding sides, it's not quite the misstep-salvaging send-off a piece of this length merits. Through decades of setlists and LPs alike, Pollard's always shown a knack for pacing, so it's odd that <i>Let It Beard</i> seems so sluggishly arranged. But <i>Let It Beard</i>'s undoing isn't its formatting, but its songs  themselves; there are simply fewer winners to be had here than on any  Spaceships LP that came before it, and they're spread over a far greater  expanse. A terrific amount of thought seems to've gone into <i>Let It  Beard</i>'s structure, its scope, its knowing nods to an earlier era's  excess. But one vital question seems to have eluded them: Do we actually  have the tunes to pull this off? They didn't; not quite, anyway. In a  surprising turn, an email went out to the Pollard faithful this week,  announcing that the brash, boisterous <i>Let It Beard</i> would prove the  Spaceships' swan song. That's the other thing about the great arena-rock  bands; even in their excess, they leave us wanting more.</p></div>"|15693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15693-let-it-beard/|6.0|Paul Thompson

What's important is that he's able to bridge that gap when addressing his congregation.  As far as modern-day garage rock acts go, Human Eye used to be one that had trouble standing out.  They could work up a nice head of steam when they wanted, and their fondness for the stuff of Ed Wood features and other B-movie fare was always charming, but their previous two albums were inconsistent slogs through various levels of fidelity and songcraft.  On <i>They Came From the Sky</i>, the band's focus on extraterrestrials has been matched by an equally exacting focus on their music.</p>
<p>Granted, the ""alien"" thing happening on this album is nothing new for Vulgar.  This sort of sci-fi schlock has been a trademark throughout most of his recorded work.  In fact, one <i>Sky</i> track, ""Impregnate the Martian Queen, Pt. 2"", is a sequel/rewrite of a track from Vulgar's last album as Timmy's Organism, <i>Rise of the Green Gorilla</i>. Also, a few tracks deal with topics that are slightly more grounded, like the self-explanatory ""Brain Zip (Kickin' Back in the Electric Chair)"". What makes <i>Sky</i> stand out in Vulgar's discography is the melding of these semi-nostalgic concerns with a sound that  hearkens back to those good old days in a refreshing manner.  If the intent with <i>Sky</i> was to create an album that could be the sort of <i>Nuggets</i>-worthy vinyl treasure one would find at a garage sale behind a bunch of dog-eared copies of <i>Famous Monsters of Filmland</i> and a Space Ghost tin lunchbox, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, Vulgar combines Iggy Pop's laconic drawl with Roky Erickson's unrelenting fervor, giving the pulpy stories unfurled in tracks like ""Alien Creeps"" and ""The Movie Was Real"" a little extra juice.  Sci-fi-friendly sounds pepper a good number of these tunes-- the album's opening salvo, ""Alien Creeps"", features what seems to be the sound of a malfunctioning radio transmitter, while ""Impregnate the Martian Queen"" offers a burbling noise that sounds an awful lot like the 13th Floor Elevators' ""electric jug."" As a guitarist, Vulgar's never too far from ripping off a mind-splitting fuzzed-out solo that, like the rest of his band, is heavy and stupid in all the right ways: His rave-up closing out the album's title track is especially ""out there."" Human Eye have always seemed like the type of band whose perfect day involves a secluded basement, a recreational substance, and a horror/sci-fi movie marathon featuring second-rate monster suits and pie tins dangling on very visible strings. With <i>They Came From the Sky</i>, Human Eye finally make that sort of get-together sound appealing.</p></div>"|15705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15705-they-came-from-the-sky/|7.7|David Raposa

It is what you think it is. Not only is it attention-grabbing, it's a good metaphor for the music of this yet-unidentified New York-based artist. You probably wouldn't refer to the extreme close-up of a female sex organ as pornography-- the clinical, uncontextualized presentation is absent any eroticism. Pornography's aim is to provide pleasure, usually presenting the most attractive and desirable package possible. The same is also typically true of pop music, yet Auture Ne Veut is every bit as obstinate as <i>Body'</i>s cover about taking pleasure-producing elements and making them raw and discomfiting. In much the same way the photo delivers a view of sex so intimate and vivid it might leave you squeamish, <i>Body</i>'s music forswears the niceties of pop and R&amp;B, instead rubbing its squirmingly real feeling in the listener's face.</p>
<p><i>Body</i> picks up where Autre Ne Veut left off on his terrific 2010 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14925-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, utilizing pop hooks and R&amp;B declarations predominantly mined from the 1980s, but presenting them as garish and unhinged. The results fleetingly inspire nostalgia, only to warp those comforts into something unsettling and queasy. It's terrain also covered by the likes of How to Dress Well, the Knife, and Ariel Pink: Autre Ne Veut shares those artists' mix of a strongly expressive pop instinct and an arty deconstructionist bent. Starting with disorienting synths and unnerving background vocals, EP opener ""Sweetheart"" immediately announces its disruptive intentions. Autre Ne Veut's vocals bend and leer drunkenly, sometimes sounding sickeningly sweet or affected, sometimes painfully sincere, as he competes with layers of swirling keyboards and blasted-out beats. It's followed by the lone throwaway of the four cuts, ""Not the One"", a scant two minutes of guest vocalist She Wolf's single repeated lyric (""This is not the one that you've been promising me"") sliced and diced and plied with spooky synths.</p>
<p>That eerie aesthetic carries over on ""Just Return"", but here Autre Ne Veut complements the horrorshow synths with a gripping tune, powerfully sliding between vocal tones, starting off softly fragile before emoting with real abandon on the refrain, fervently declaring wishes for empowerment and acceptance that only increase curiosity about the man behind this artistic mask. The EP closes with the similarly effusive ""Your Clothes"", though here the mood is far more playful, with Autre Ne Veut grunting and moaning like an exaggerated R&amp;B loverman over the kind of noisily fun 80s-inspired gallop that Max Tundra is also so good at summoning. <i>Body</i>'s over in fewer than 13 minutes, but you feel like you've been on a legitimate ride: Autre Ne Veut almost never lets up pushing messily human pop exclamations forcibly to the forefront.</p></div>"|15701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15701-body-ep/|7.5|Joshua Love

And if you want to hear some utterly godawful rapping, pull up a video of Chiddy finishing off that marathon. Or rapping for a 10-minute stretch during hour five. Or 22 minutes into it. Really, any random moment from the writ-large publicity stunt is going to give you some truly clumsy time-killing fluffiness. Even if Chiddy was Rakim, he couldn't have pulled this thing off; there's not a rapper alive who could say anything compelling for nine hours straight. But a great rapper wouldn't have attempted this stunt because a great rapper wouldn't have needed to do it. There's no worthwhile artistic reason to rap for that long-- it's pure online traffic-bait. When you rap for nine hours, words stop meaning anything; they become a way to fill time. If you pull up a random video from the nine-hour stretch, you'll see Chiddy wandering aimlessly around a spotlessly furnished room, flopping down on a blinding white couch, lifelessly throwing out words while the other dudes in the room stare at their iPhones. It's depressing.</p>
<p>That same disregard for language is all over <i>Peanut Butter and Swelly</i>, Chiddy Bang's recent mixtape. As a rapper, Chiddy never shows the slightest bit of intensity or emotion. This is breezy cool-kid rap and nothing more, which might be fine if Chiddy did it with <i>style</i>. Instead, we get some truly awkward, forced, jumbled line construction. On the very first song, Chiddy actually uses the word ""hashtag"" in a (terrible) hashtag-rap punchline. Here's Chiddy on himself: ""My life is pretty as the face of a girl/ And watch out, I got too much soul for the world."" On a girl: ""She got them soft legs/ She got them plum thighs/ And her bathing suit is something that is fun-sized."" On his rivals: ""Rapper, you should die/ Reading <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>."" It's grisly.</p>
<p>Chiddy Bang first started building blog attention because producer Xaphoon Jones used samples of some extremely recognizable mainstream-indie pop hits (MGMT's ""Kids"", Sufjan Stevens' ""Chicago"") to build his synth-rap tracks. These kinda-juxtapositions don't quite qualify as a neat trick; rappers have been rapping over weird shit since rap's earliest days. As canny as they are, the production choices are simply lazy, a transparent bid for Chiddy Bang to become the one rap group a certain subset of indie kids cares about. So on <i>Peanut Butter and Swelly</i> we get stuff like Chiddy rapping over Matt and Kim's ""Cameras"", a decent song that's way too thin and burnished to serve as the skeleton for a rap song. Or we get ""Heatwave"", the posse cut where Xaphoon throws bleepy keyboard sounds all over a Martha and the Vandellas song for absolutely no reason. They seem to be aiming for the ""Oh, hey, I know that song"" reaction. It's not like they go anywhere with the songs. It's all reference with nothing behind it, and that also goes for the rapping. A line from all over: ""Got me throwing my arms around Paris, shit: Morrissey."" It just figures that this kid's Morrissey reference of choice would be some shit from <i>Years of Refusal</i>.</p>
<p>On ""Heatwave"", after painful verses from Chiddy and the odious Pittsburgh frat-rap goon Mac Miller, we get a verse from the Texas gangsta legend Trae, who stays on autopilot and steals the entire mixtape anyway. (Rest assured that the score at the top of this page would be a couple of decimal points lower without him.) Trae has been making a transparent bid for career-revival lately, showing up on tracks with ascendant weed-rap goofballs like Wiz Khalifa. Even so, his appearance here feels jarring. Trae made his name with a gutturally depressive hardhead style. He's a ferociously powerful voice who can sound tough even when he's talking about intense emotional pain. That makes him basically the polar opposite of Chiddy, a rapper who never has anything to say and who always sounds comfortable saying it.</p></div>"|15683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15683-peanut-butter-and-swelly/|2.1|Tom Breihan

The story begins at the University of Kiel in Germany, where the self-taught composer was studying oceanic science in the late 1970s. Müller purchased some electronic instruments and set them up on his houseboat in the town of Heikendorf, where he began crafting instrumental pieces that reflected his love of undersea life. His dream of selling those compositions to film and TV companies for use in documentaries never transpired. But Müller did press fewer than 100 vinyl copies of the recordings in the early 80s and titled them <i>Science of the Sea</i>, giving most of the albums away to friends and family. Fast forward three decades and a copy of the record ends up in the hands of <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/rec_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Digitalis Recordings</a>, just as a resurgence of interest in the type of new age recordings Müller was practicing is taking place.</p>
<p>So it's reasonable to wonder if the backstory was constructed as part of a larger concept, the way people continue to wonder about 	 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12694-recordings-1969-1988/"" target=""_blank"">Ursula Bogner</a> or <a href=""http://www.dramaticrecords.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=17&amp;category_id=2&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=54&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Endless House</a>. One intrepid <a href=""http://holywarbles.blogspot.com/2011/06/jurgen-muller-science-of-sea-1982.html?showComment=1309723028950#c5614040450661790666"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog commenter</a> even claims to have contacted the University of Kiel and found no trace of Müller's presence. Either way it doesn't really matter, because the music on <i>Science of the Sea </i>continues that superior strain of contemplative elegance records such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14275-does-it-look-like-im-here/"">Does It Look Like I'm Here?</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/"">Rifts</a></i> have touched on in recent times. Like those releases, the relation <i>Science of the Sea</i> has to actual new age music is tangential at best. There are no <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gheorghe_Zamfir"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gheorghe Zamfir</a>-esque pan flute solos or anything that will drive you to join a local color therapy group. Instead it's an uncomplicated series of recordings, mostly based around gently unfolding synth arpeggios set to faintly pulsing rhythms.</p>
<p>The tracks are short-- only five of the 12 here make it over the three-minute mark-- although <i>Science of the Sea </i>doesn't really make sense when broken down into its component parts. Instead each song works as a natural evolution of the theme set out in the opening ""Beyond the Tide"", where great washes of cleansing synth are interrupted by spiky twists of becalming noise that were presumably conceived to mimic dolphin chirps. It's not hard to see why this might have been thought of as a perfect soundtrack to a Jacques Cousteau-style undersea documentary. The following ""Sea Bed Meditation"" is full of rippling loops tied down by globs of tenderly resonating bass frequencies, not far removed from <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Klaus+Schulze"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Klaus Schulze</a>'s contemplative solo ventures. Müller also shares Schulze's fondness for vaguely humorous song titles (""Dream Sequence For a Jellyfish"", ""The Elusive Seahorse"").</p>
<p>What's remarkable about this album is how acutely it reflects and comments on the environment that served as its inspiration. ""Waterworld"" doesn't travel far beyond the coiling melody that ebbs and flows throughout the track, but it feels like the musical equivalent of a trail of oxygen bubbles arcing to the surface as a scuba diver peacefully plunges to the depths. Similarly, ""Marine Technology"" is all digital interference and signal jams, with zaps of synth noise pinging back and forth across the surface as though an urgent piece of undersea communication were being transmitted. Once you get deep into <i>Science of the Sea</i>, especially on headphones, it feels like Müller is simultaneously replicating that world and conveying his chimerical dreams about what it epitomizes. ""Coral Fantasy"" and ""Vast Worlds Beneath"" function as utopian fantasies about the great unknown, with Müller utilizing slowly disentangling sounds to give a sense of scale, wonder, and a natural curiosity about all the things that lay undiscovered down there.</p>
<p>The way <i>Science of the Sea</i> subtly shifts in theme, from then-current meditations on the ocean to quixotic impressions about its unexplored expanses, is its masterstroke. It feels like you're on a journey alongside Müller, carefully mapping out the thoughts and fears the murky depths have come to represent, all laid out in a way that your brain would naturally process if you were immersed in that world. The closing ""Lonely Voyage"" even feels like a warning of sorts, with its foreboding timbre suggesting that you can plunge a little too deeply into yourself if you spend too much time down there. That's where this album disconnects from anything that could perfunctorily be tagged as ""new age."" This isn't simple relaxation music, although much of it could easily perform that function. Instead the beautifully uncomplicated surface structures are used to prize open a boundless amount of feelings that are every bit as complex and unfathomable as the ocean itself.</p></div>"|15696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15696-science-of-the-sea/|8.4|Nick Neyland

Featured on the definitive <i>Singles </i>soundtrack, evergreen psych-rock jam ""Nearly Lost You"" smeared its wah-wah guitar solos and the alluring dusk of Mark Lanegan's vocals all over MTV. But the band couldn't capitalize: <i>Sweet Oblivion</i> had already been out for months, and its ensuing tour resulted in more turmoil than triumph. Four years later, <i>Dust </i>was a very strong follow-up whose staunch classic rock sound made it a critical hit and a commercial non-starter on alt-rock radio. Screaming Trees more or less confirmed that for all of its anti-image posturing, grunge was <i>still </i>about fashion: Having never been embraced as reluctant, PC-friendly sex symbols or drunken lumberjacks (rumors persist that label execs tried to force out at least one of the hulking Conner brothers), the band called it quits in 2000 and went their separate ways in a manner that didn't leave much to the imagination until now<i>. </i></p>
<p><i>Last Words: The Final Recordings </i>was put to tape during 1998 and 1999 at Stone Gossard's studio, features guitar work from Peter Buck and Josh Homme, and was recently mixed and mastered by Jack Endino, but it arrives without much fanfare: It's being released on drummer Barrett Martin's label with tentative plans for physical distribution and, unsurprisingly, Screaming Trees have no plans to reunite.<i> </i>Musically, it's streamlined and aerodynamic, the sort of thing you might expect as a ""back to basics"" move from a band getting together for the first time in over a decade, not one making the follow-up to <i>Dust</i>. But was that direction even really necessary back then? Though they waited until their sixth album to incorporate ambitious signifiers like sitar, tabla, and Mellotron, <i>Dust </i>was hardly the sound of a band gone off the deep end. More pointedly, the parameters for ""basics"" set forth here never existed for Screaming Trees-- this is neither the crusty SST punk of their earliest days nor the shaggy radio rock of <i>Uncle Anaesthesia </i>or <i>Sweet Oblivion</i>. Revisionist history has occasionally cast Screaming Trees as an unremarkable, workmanlike rock band blessed with a distinct vocalist, and if <i>Last Words </i>does anything for their legacy, it makes that notion somewhat true for the first time.</p>
<p>Not much here bears the weight of creative struggle or even an idea dump, just up-the-middle guitar songs that could conceivably be the result of a five-minute writing session or a dogged determination to have <i>something </i>to show for a 12-hour day in the studio. Opener ""Ash Grey Sunday"" boasts the kind of casually anthemic guitar jangle in the lineage of the Yardbirds or ""About a Girl"", but it's garage rock in theory only, all simple transitions and lyrical archetype with no crackling urgency. A similar lack of development pervades ""Door Into Summer"" and ""Tomorrow Changes"", bright and agreeable strummers whose most interesting songwriting touch is a <i>fourth </i>chord on top of the requisite three. Any tie towards actual psychedelia in their rock has been severed as well: ""Crawlspace"" is the most audacious bit of studio experimentation, but it merely subjects Lanegan's vocals to the same tinny flange effect that's found its way onto too many Twilight Singers albums.</p>
<p>Sure, I've got the benefit of hindsight here, but these really do sound like the work of a band struggling with inspiration, more unwilling than unable to push themselves: ""Revelator"" finds them kicking up some <i>Dust </i>with a bluesy front porch jam<i>, </i>but it's a total rewrite of ""Dying Days""; ""Low Life"" pops up later sounding like a minor variation of ""Revelator"", and the closing title track's basically a minor variation of ""Low Life"". I think we can all agree that ""Dying Days"" is a good song, but not <i>that </i>good.</p>
<p>Ironically, <i>Last Words </i>is actually rendered more inessential by its best quality. In terms of sheer tone, Lanegan once again sounds fantastic. But you already knew that. Whether we're talking about his solo albums, collaborations with Isobel Campbell and Greg Dulli, or his more high-profile work with Queens of the Stone Age, there's no shortage of him functioning as rock's equivalent of Scarface (the rapper, not Al Pacino), relied on as a character actor specializing in a certain kind of brooding, wizened masculinity. An oft-overlooked problem with this lonesome stranger guise is that while Lanegan's lyrics read straightforward on paper, there's something weirdly unknowable about them. It's tempting to read into such a leading title for insight on Screaming Trees' mindstate during the sessions that caused their dissolution, but <i>Last Words </i>is sort of a record about nothing much at all.<i> </i></p>
<p>Even if the circumstances are different, I can't help but compare this to <i>Rock ‘N</i>'<i> Roll Submarine, </i>the comeback record released by a reincarnated Urge Overkill this year.<i> </i> Both were bands that similarly arose from a primordial, noisy 80s to the perpetual precipice of stardom thanks to a soundtrack hit, only to slowly burn out by the end of the century. And while each developed a distinct sound and subtly covered a lot of ground in their time, they're somewhat awkward to reevaluate in 2011, when few bands (if any) bear any sign of their influence. Screaming Trees lived a full artistic life and were often great beyond ""Nearly Lost You"", but <i>Last Words </i>is basically an epitaph for a band that died of natural causes.</p></div>"|15680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15680-last-words-the-final-recordings/|5.7|Ian Cohen

The arty Portland electronic duo formed in early 2009, with singer Patricia Hall and keyboardist/programmer Ian Hicks becoming a romantic couple not much later. The two recently did a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d7ndeiLaSc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mean cover</a> of Throbbing Gristle's 1979 ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnVneEBpgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot on the Heels of Love</a>"", a techno-predicting cult classic that mixes robotic arpeggios and steamy vocals (recalling Donna Summer's rapturous ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06a_Xi1AU9s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Feel Love</a>"" from a couple of years earlier) with the industrial pioneers' own creepy foreboding.</p>
<p>Soft Metals' self-titled album extends that combination of lovers' intimacy and retro-futuristic ominousness, which Hall and Hicks previously introduced on the 2010 EP <i>The Cold World Melts</i>. With Hall's detached, often-indecipherable vocals over Hicks' pulsating configurations of vintage synthesizers and drum machines, <i>Soft Metals</i> bears traces of virtually every bleakly gliding descendant of Kraftwerk's O.G. synth-pop grooves, from gothic early-1980s new wave to house, techno, and electroclash. But it's somewhat telling that this blurrily beguiling debut-- which reprises two tracks from the EP, plus eight new ones-- arrives on Brooklyn-based Captured Tracks, a label better known for the lo-fi noise-pop of Blank Dogs, Beach Fossils, or Wild Nothing.</p>
<p>As with their labelmates, Soft Metals' aesthetic is born not of lavish studios but in the bedroom. The songs on <i>Soft Metals</i> have a foggy, surrealistic shimmer rather than the clear-cut precision of many of their electronic forebears. Where Ariel Pink cohort John Maus uses like-mindedly retro trappings as a jumping-off point for experiments with ideas about art and artifice, Soft Metals concentrate instead on the type of subtly evolving textures you might be more inclined to play when you're drifting off to sleep than when you're throwing a dance party. Even the most lucid songs here, whether echo-besotted EP cut ""Voices"" or swelling first-meeting reminiscence ""Do You Remember"", stake their appeal on their glistening, ever-changing surfaces, not traditional songcraft.</p>
<p>Still, just because your brand of old-school electronics has more in common with mood-oriented Italians Do It Better producer Johnny Jewel (Glass Candy, Chromatics) than with song-driven nu-disco princess Sally Shapiro (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/6508-the-top-100-tracks-of-2006/8/"">I'll Be By Your Side</a>"") doesn't mean the wordless repetitions of ""Celestial Call"" or ""Hold My Breath"" fully reward our attention. Then again... Soft Metals might wince at this comparison, but it's not such a leap from their album's prelude-to-a-kiss cover art to the <i>Cosmo</i>-copped sex scene (speaking of love and theft!) that adorns <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15614-within-and-without/"">Washed Out's latest</a>. <i>Soft Metals</i>' ""Eyes Closed"" may have a faster tempo, a more dangerous charge, and one fewer title syllable than languid <i>Within and Without</i> opener ""Eyes Be Closed"", but they're both headed toward a similarly sensual place.</p>
<p>If Soft Metals are nostalgic, however, it's less for lost innocence than for a lost idea of the future. Where are the flying cars? The album's use of analogue synths isn't a regression, but an attempt to find a new way forward. On instrumental finale ""In Throes"", they finally do, as eerie buzzes and disjointed rhythms chart a course somewhere near the Knife's still-unmatched 2006 dark-electronic landmark <i>Silent Shout</i>. In the end, the more important love on <i>Soft Metals</i> isn't necessarily between Hall and Hicks; it's between them and three-plus decades of synthesizer music. And wherever that leads next.</p></div>"|15681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15681-soft-metals/|7.5|Marc Hogan

The UK band's discography is a finely detailed and uncommonly honest document of lives lived through music, free of schmaltz and coated with lyrical nods to the records they admire most (""You <i>can</i> hide your love forever,"" goes Comet Gain's heartbreaking <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD3FkHC1wcc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">response</a> to Orange Juice). ""Jack Nance Hair"", from 2009 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12848-broken-record-prayers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Broken Record Prayers</i></a>, is a manifesto for people who love music to an almost religious degree: an outsider anthem reflecting scrappy, fallible humanity through a record's imperfections (""Young, free, and single/ Like the crack in the 45"") and the comforting indifference of time through the turntable's ceaseless spin.</p>
<p>The group's sound, accordingly, is a shambolic collision between elements of dream pop, mod psychedelia, northern soul, and riot grrrl (guitarist Jon Slade cut his teeth in Huggy Bear). On <i>The Howl of the Lonely Crowd</i>, Comet Gain's first proper album since since 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1560-city-fallen-leaves/"" target=""_blank""><i>City Fallen Leaves</i></a>, singer/guitarist David Feck and his revolving-door lineup of musicians put a new twist on their incessant dialogue with their favorite artists: They recorded with one. Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins produced much of the album, which means Feck got to live out a fanboy fantasy. The new album also features collaborations with some of Comet Gain's contemporaries, such as Alasdair Maclean of the Clientele, as well as their heirs, including the Cribs' Ryan Jarman and Shrag's Helen King. Jarman and Brian O'Shaughnessy (whose credits go back to Primal Scream) lent additional production.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Lonely Crowd</i> finds Comet Gain up to their old tricks: paeans to impressive record collections (""Thee Ecstatic Library""), odes to cult heroes (""Herbert Huncke Pt. 2""), and wistful balladering (""In a Lonely Place""). The record's first few tracks, in particular, can stand respectably beside the band's strongest material, with jangling standouts like ""The Weekend Dreams"" and ""Clang of the Concrete Swans"". Side B gets bogged down by a few too many inert slow songs, but singer Rachel Evans swoops in to save the side with the ""Ballad of Frankie Machine"", a quintessentially British tribute to the protagonist of <i>This Sporting Life</i> that effectively channels the 1963 film's haunting mood.</p>
<p>Even if <i>Lonely Crowd</i> doesn't quite live up to the bar set by <i>Broken Record Prayers</i>-- which was, after all, a singles collection-- there's still something dependably refreshing about a new Comet Gain record. The band's diehard convictions and carefully wrought lyrics seem even more vital these days, when ""indie pop"" often signifies a marketable sound rather than a lifestyle commitment. Comet Gain cling to the vestiges of that lifestyle with a convert's zeal. ""Some of us don't want to be saved,"" Feck sings in one of the album's most memorable lines-- presumably because some of us already have been, as long as the turntable's spinning.</p></div>"|15558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15558-howl-of-the-lonely-crowd/|7.3|Lindsay Zoladz

It was an exciting time in West Africa, as the colonial governments pulled out, and the first generation of post-independence African leaders translated a wave of African cultural pride into public policy. In Mali, as in its neighbors, then-President Modibo Keita pursued a rigorous program of nationalization and socialization, and he encouraged development of the arts. Musicians were told to modernize the country's traditional music. Much as in Guinea next door, a system of regional orchestras was established.</p>
<p>But modernizing the traditional music of Mali wasn't exactly a simple task-- the country is a swirl of different cultures, ethnicities, languages, and traditions. In the city of Mopti, at the confluence of the Bani and Niger Rivers, a young bandleader, singer, and flutist named Sorry Bamba jumped on board the modernization train with gusto. His band eventually became the Regional Orchestra of Mopti (Mopti is an administrative region in central Mali as well as a city), and Bamba worked hard to encompass the diversity of his region in his music. <i>Volume One</i>, assembled by Thrill Jockey with involvement from Bamba himself, covers music from Bambara, Fula, and Dogon traditions, updated with electric guitars and organs during the 1970s. By the time this music was made, Keita was in a prison in Kidal, having been overthrown in 1968 by General Moussa Traoré, who ruled the country as a police state until 1991 but continued many cultural programs.</p>
<p>One of Bamba's greatest cultural coups was to get the Dogon people to accept him and teach him their songs. A cliff-dwelling people who lived for centuries along the Bandiagara Escarpment, the Dogon had long kept their religious rituals and customs mysterious to outsiders. But they let Bamba in, giving him such songs as ""Sayouwé"", which honors ancestors, and in return he renamed the Regional Orchestra Kanaga Orchestra after the creator god of Dogon myth. ""Sayouwé"" is included here, and it has an unusual drum rhythm that the band turns into something like funk with guitar and a bit of spacey organ. That same tripped-out organ is the main texture on ""Porry"", a slow-burner that also features a great Afro-Cuban trumpet solo by Bamba himself. The momentum it has might be best described by comparing it to walking when you're tired; it becomes almost more like repeatedly catching yourself in mid-fall than locomotion.</p>
<p>Overall, this compilation explores an intriguing discography that, more than many, really feels like a meeting of folk styles and modern instrumentations. Bamba makes little overt attempt to funk up or psychedelicize the music, and where those qualities are found, it's an organic outgrowth of the old music he was working with. There are lots of call-and-response vocals, snaking horn sections, guitars dripping with reverb, and hand percussion. I love African funk, rock, Afrobeat, and the like, but it's nice to hear a compilation that's so dedicated to music so wholly African (and in a couple of cases, Afro-Cuban) in its construction. If you've found your way into vintage African pop music and are looking to go a little deeper, this set is one good way to do it.</p></div>"|15646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15646-volume-one-1970-1979/|7.7|Joe Tangari

What this actually means-- and whether or not it's a bit premature to talk of their ""lifespan""-- is unclear, but fortunately, Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug do not need each other to make good music. Last month Boeckner's electro-punk duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/handsomefurs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Handsome Furs</a> released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15579-sound-kapital/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sound Kapital</i></a>, and it was undoubtedly the most impassioned record they've made yet. The prolific Krug, on the other hand, has been churning out interesting music for years with a variety of different projects, be it the eccentric supergroup Swan Lake or the increasingly ambitious one-time side project Sunset Rubdown. In a moment when many popular independent artists value accessibility, simplicity, and beach-ready blitheness above all else, Krug's continued appeal lies in the fact that he is an anachronism: a songwriter who's trying to squeeze Byzantine grandeur into the unlikely framework of indie rock. His catalogue is dense, charged with anxiety, and-- in a trick he may have picked up from Dan Bejar-- about as self-referential as a late-series episode of ""Arrested Development"".</p>
<p><i>Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped</i>, Krug's first post-Wolf Parade LP, feels like ritual music infused with 1980s nostalgia. Like his previous release as <a href=""http://moonface.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moonface</a>, a 20-minute marimba showcase appropriately subtitled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13899-dreamland-ep-marimba-and-shit-drums/"" target=""_blank""><i>Marimba and Shit-Drums</i></a>, <i>Organ Music</i> springs from Krug's experiments with a particular instrument. Over <i>Organ Music'</i>s five tracks (the shortest of which clocks in at six-and-half minutes), he creates what you might call Nintendo spirituals: songs that evoke his double-manual organ's devotional vibes just as much as they do-- through the use of drum machine beats, loops, and some skittish programming-- that song that plays throughout all the underwater levels in the original Super Mario Bros. These tracks are meditative, hypnotic, and born of Krug's unmistakable infatuation with the organ's brooding drone. I saw him perform the record live, and whenever he stopped singing he looked completely lost in his own reverie. Which, ultimately, is precisely the problem with this record.</p>
<p>Sunset Rubdown's last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13232-dragonslayer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dragonslayer</i></a>, found Krug doing something that his critics didn't think he had in him: self-editing. It remains Krug's most impressive work to date because it's as accessible and immediate as it is thematically complex. Sure, there are dragons, muses, and forays into the Icarus Rhyming Dictionary, but there are also pummeling riffs and catchy hooks galore. Perhaps <i>Dragonslayer</i>'s greatest and most unexpected triumph, though, was how emotionally relatable it was. It was a personal record about the toll that the worlds inside someone's head takes on his relationships.</p>
<p><i>Organ Music</i>, on the other hand, is more of an exercise in shadowboxing. Here, the music drones on without creating an inhabitable atmosphere, and most of its melodies are flat and uninviting. Even when Krug explores <i>Organ Music</i>'s more interesting lyrical terrain, it often feels like an echo of something he's done better in the past. The opening verse of ""Whale Song (Instead of a Kiss)"", for example, feels like a retread of Wolf Parade's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D4JJPZQ2Ic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grounds for Divorce</a>"", but with less of a blunt impact.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say it's all tedium. The opener ""Return to the Violence of the Ocean Floor"" is absorbing and showcases a wide array of the titular instrument's moods. And the standout track is ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12208-fast-peter/"" target=""_blank"">Fast Peter</a>"", a charming tale of recreational drug use and long-distance Internet love with a frenetic tempo and a weirdly compelling 8-bit Peer Gynt vibe. These two songs combined are about as long as <i>Marimba and Shit-Drums</i>; they might have made a good EP.</p>
<p><i>Organ Music</i>'s press release has been floating around the Internet for some time now. It was written by Krug himself, and it is magnificently bizarre and fittingly meta. In it, he hints at knowing that this release is more than a little self-indulgent. He tells us the record was twice as long before he cut five tracks; ""You're welcome,"" he adds. He also seems to wink at the inevitability that we will compare it to the high-water marks of his career. ""Moonface will probably never sound like Wolf Parade or Sunset Rubdown,"" he says, and he's not wrong. <i>Organ Music</i> isn't reaching for any brass rings, so it's hard to fault it too hard for not being a highlight of his career when it never tries to be one. And Krug fans who can't get behind this particular side of him shouldn't get too bent out of shape; his back catalogue shows that something completely different could be around the next corner.</p></div>"|15674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15674-organ-music-not-vibraphone-like-id-hoped/|6.1|Lindsay Zoladz

This 37-minute LP isn't a proper follow-up to 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/"" target=""_blank""><i>8 Diagrams</i></a>. But neither is it one of those slapped-together collections of B-sides, remixes, and outtakes that mostly function as stress tests for the W's quality control. With the exception of Masta Killa and GZA, every top-ranking Clansman delivers entirely new verses here. Combined with low commercial prospects, that level of commitment means <i>Legendary Weapons </i>is probably the closest thing we've got so far to a legit, hard-as-fuck Wu-Tang Clan street album. Frighteningly, depressingly, or both, it turns out to be as boring as nearly everybody else's legit, hard-as-fuck street album.</p>
<p>Judging from the tracklist, you might think Wu-Tang are trying to counteract the ""hip-hop hippie"" label Raekwon and Ghostface placed on <i>8 Diagrams</i>. Guests such as AZ, Sean Price, Roc Marciano, and Action Bronson are peers and stylistic descendants alike. Marciano's <i>Marcberg</i> and Bronson's <i>Dr. Lecter</i>, in particular, prove that records restricting their worldview to grimy New York rap ca. 1994 can still sound exciting to this day. But those guys are about the only ones who treat an appearance on <i>Legendary Weapons </i>as a privilege, and for the most part, the Clan can't commit to underground hunger or regal triumph. Though RZA is listed as executive producer (make of that what you will), <i>Legendary Weapons</i>, produced by Noah Rubin, burdens itself with nth-gen knock-offs of early Wu producer Tru Master: distended bass, cheap horns, muffled EQ'ing, and drums that knock more like pillowfights than like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl6jwab3HWk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Da Mystery of Chessboxin'</a>"".</p>
<p>But this is still <i>Wu-Tang Clan</i> we're talking about. They've overcome weak production before. I mean, Ghostface Killah shows up on, like, 40% of the tracks! How dull can this <i>be</i>? <i>Legendary Weapons</i>' greatest asset is nearly two decades of goodwill, but at what point are you just flat-out going to admit that Ghostface has been badly coasting downhill for at least five years? Here, Ghost is rapping like he's got someplace else he'd rather be. He leads off every track he's on with verses that weirdly seem to end a couple of bars early, to say nothing of the recycled rhymes about Clarks Wallabees, Mrs. Dash, and cheap rice we've been hearing for ages. Anyone who thinks Action Bronson is currently palming off a weak imitation of Ghostface needs to listen to ""Meteor Hammer"" right away-- it's the equivalent of Allen Iverson's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEmS8ZQIhTA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">killer crossover</a> on Michael Jordan, Bronson going off in all directions in the record's lone display of joy in sheer wordplay. It quickly gets snuffed out by an atypical swag-rap verse that's as good as you can expect from a guy named Termanalogy.</p>
<p>Almost by default, <i>Legendary Weapons </i>has its moments. Raekwon, who's clearly the most reliable of the crew at this point, pops off a typically adept quickie at the beginning of false party rocker ""Start the Show"", and everyone else at least competently plays to type: U-God the prodigal son, Cappadonna barely staying within the confines of spoken rant, and RZA doing his thing where his conspiracy theorizing flows like steel wool and has only the most tentative hold on erudition (""Islam is the way of life/ Islam is the way of <i>Christ</i>""?). With the higher-ups phoning it in, Wu affiliates Killa Sin and Trife Diesel must sense an opening, because the two go as hard as possible to assert themselves as first-tier. Trife, especially, sounds wholly committed to his aggressively average street soldiering, but whether he's spitting awkward rhymes about famous athletes or confessing the death of his parents, he continues to be proof that you can have all the self-confidence in the world and absolutely zero charisma.</p>
<p>In addition to letting you know this is a Wu-Tang record, the beyond-tired kung fu and blaxploitation audio clips suggest there's supposed to be an astute anti-industry streak underlying <i>Legendary Weapons</i>. But these samples are almost entirely disconnected from the actual contents of the record. Aside from Method Man's streetwise reportage on ""Diesel Fluid"" and Inspectah Deck's skeptical ""Never Feel This Pain"" (actually recycled from 2010's <i>Manifesto</i>), little on the album acknowledges a world outside its own 16 bars. Truth is, Wu-Tang know time is money. While that much-lauded business acumen might explain the low-profile <i>Legendary Weapons' </i>utter lack of spark, it hardly justifies it.</p></div>"|15687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15687-legendary-weapons/|5.0|Ian Cohen

After all, words can ruin the mystery of something as abstract as musical direction. William Bennett must not be worried. In <a href=""http://www.viceland.com/int/v15n9/htdocs/the-second-coming-227.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> and on his <a href=""http://williambennett.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">various</a> <a href=""http://afronoise.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blogs</a>, the founding member of UK noise group Whitehouse has openly discussed his fascination with Africa, how it influenced Whitehouse, and how it eventually led to his Cut Hands solo project. Bennett has even <a href=""http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/music/3072"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">given</a> his new style a name: ""afro noise.""</p>
<p>Bennett's candor turns out to be wise, because the more you know about Cut Hands, the deeper and richer the music sounds. The artist's longtime interest in African culture and world sociopolitical issues (see his <i><a href=""http://www.susanlawly.freeuk.com/africa/africa.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Extreme Music From Africa</a> </i>compilation, or the reading <a href=""http://www.susanlawly.freeuk.com/textfiles/reading.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">list</a> on his website) adds layers of meaning to the songs<i>. </i>When you learn that Bennett has studied African voodoo, or that he uses native instruments like djembes and doun douns, all the rattling activity on <i>Afro Noise I </i>starts to sound like the rumblings of a global subconscious.</p>
<p>Besides, there's still a lot of mystery here<i>, </i>particularly in how Bennett can make such spacious, often-catchy music retain the penetrating relentlessness of Whitehouse's all-out noise. Part of it is simple evolution: Three of the tracks here are from previously released Whitehouse albums, and they complement newer pieces that mix gunfire beats, heavy atmospheres, and piercing tones. But even the songs that skew furthest from Whitehouse-- like ""Impassion"", which could soundtrack a nature documentary-- have the dark, foreboding quality of Bennett's previous work.</p>
<p>In keeping with Bennett's omnivorous tastes, <i>Afro Noise I </i>also shows impressive sonic variety. On ""Stabbers Conspiracy"", overlapping layers of pulse and clang reach Autechre-like levels, while the echo of ""Rain Washes Over Chaff"" and grind of ""Shut Up and Bleed"" dart between eerie calm and screeching panic. Ultimately, every sound that Bennett adds to his core of percussion reinforces the beats. But taken together, those sounds are a lot thicker and thornier than they appear on first listen.</p>
<p>Still, this album is pretty accessible, and the question of whether Bennett fans would like this music were it done by someone without a noise pedigree will inevitably arise. But with Cut Hands, the point seems moot-- it's hard to imagine anyone else making <i>Afro Noise I.</i> Certain tracks can be compared favorably to other artists-- for me, the more filmic pieces call to mind the Residents' underrated <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Residents-Hunters/release/311021"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtracks</a> to the Discovery Channel series <i>Hunters</i>. But as a whole, <i>Afro Noise I </i>has a scope and vision that's pure Bennett, making this new direction less a wild leap than a supremely logical step.</p></div>"|15699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15699-afro-noise-i/|7.8|Marc Masters

A Lee County, Iowa native, Whitmore plays scrappy, acoustic folksongs on banjo (occasionally augmented by a bass drum), singing earnestly about things like hammers, steamboats, and dying. It's embarrassingly easy to picture him attacking logs with an old, rusted ax, or sitting by a campfire chewing on a stick of black licorice. There's a dignity to his work, which is unfussy and ambivalent to trends; sometimes that simplicity can feel admonishing. Whether he intends it to or not, something in his voice seems to say: ""Stop Tweeting. It's stupid.""</p>
<p><i>Field Songs</i> is Whitmore's seventh full length (not counting a collection of demos in 1999), and stylistically, it's right in step with his previous albums. Whitmore still works on his family's farm in southeastern Iowa, in a fertile little crescent between the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers; his official bio includes the line, ""I was out chopping wood and my uncle said I had a call from a record company."" (Authenticity alert!) He came up in the hardcore scene, sharing the stage with bands like Murder By Death and Converge, serenading crowds of agitated kids with tattoos and shaved heads, and proving that folk music could feel just as revolutionary, just as strong. On his last record, 2009's <i>Animals in the Dark</i>, he became a protest singer, skewering conservative policy and encouraging thoughtful mutiny.</p>
<p>Work is a persistent theme on <i>Field Songs</i>. Samples of chirping critters pop up frequently (Whitmore and his family raise wild birds), and his lyrics tend to be focused on tactile, useful things: ""We're gonna do some work, spend a day digging in the dirt,"" he bellows on the record's title track, his voice suddenly big, bombastic. Plenty of these songs position labor as a kind of salvation, a way to insulate yourself from the modern world; for Whitmore, work itself is a threatened institution. ""Three square meals and a living wage, reminds me of the good old days/ Before the manifest destiny of the factory farms, before those cutthroats came and burned down the barns,"" he sings. It may sound like an awful lot of posturing, but Whitmore sells it; miraculously, nothing at all here reeks of bullshit. ""Here I am, working in the field/ If the heat don't getcha, then the sunburn will,"" he promises, with all the confidence of a man who knows such things.</p>
<p>Although Whitmore is a talented banjoist, his voice is very much the focus. Weary and full of crags (from a lifetime of smoking, maybe, or hollering at hardcore shows), it's impressively wide and strong, imbuing his compositions with a kind of welcome toughness. Folk music has a reputation for limpness, but Whitmore's vocals are energizing-- they give these tracks backbone. And while a few pieces are undeniable standouts (""Everything Gets Gone"", ""Let's Do Something Impossible""), <i>Field Songs</i> really plays best as a single document: a soundtrack to a day in the field, a day anyone stuck behind a keyboard has probably yearned for once or twice.</p></div>"|15690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15690-field-songs/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

Singer Jennifer Charles exudes a forbidding cocktail-dress cool; her slick presentation conceals uneasy psychological themes. Think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"">Mazzy Star</a> on a serious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Bad Seeds</a> binge. The band has collaborated with many leading lights of the American pop avant-garde-- <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3571-marc-ribot/"">Marc Ribot</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lurie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Lurie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.tv/artists/4725-john-zorn/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Zorn</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.tv/artists/5804-mike-patton/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mike Patton</a>-- while guitarist Oren Bloedow has backed up demanding traditionalists like <a href=""http://www.drjohn.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. John</a> and <a href=""http://www.lizzwright.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lizz Wright</a>. But Elysian Fields remain a cult act in the States, a condition that <i>Last Night on Earth</i> seems unlikely to change.</p>
<p>At heart, Elysian Fields are doing what they've always done: recruiting prestigious collaborators (the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16890-antibalas/"">Antibalas</a> horns, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"">Jeff Buckley</a> drummer Matt Johnson, and members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony and the Johnsons</a>) to back Charles' slinky chanteuse vocals. The group still gets the lead out sometimes: ""Red Riding Hood"" is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"">Grinderman</a>-style seether complete with blues harmonica and a croaking Nick Cave impression, and ""Chance"" bounces on a glinting knife-edge of electric guitar. But more atmospheric styles have risen to prominence, like the foggy old-world folk of ""Johnny"" and the chamber-pop of ""Chandeliers"". Unfortunately, this mostly positive evolution comes with a problematic one in Charles' singing style, which is too blurry to work as a focal point.</p>
<p>I know this is sacrilege: Charles defines this band, and she can certainly sing. But the exaggeratedly breathy and heavily ornamented style she cultivates here overshadows the diversity of the music with a uniform cloud of affectations. Compare these frilly flutters and meanderings with early songs like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSic9tseaCU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Star</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAWLTxFT_Ss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack in the Box</a>"", where Charles carved a svelte, forceful path through the band's chugging alt-era grooves, to hear how her cosmetic decorations sap the music's elemental vitality. She sounds fresh and inspired when she sings a bit straighter, as on ""Sleepover"", a breezy concoction of guitars, horns, and martial percussion; the title track also accrues a spacious, soulful momentum. Between these dynamic bookends, solid musical ideas are too often dissolved in expressive scribbles. <i>Last Night on Earth</i> should do well with those already invested in Elysian Fields-- and they are legion, especially in Europe-- but newcomers may need to start with 1996's <i>Bleed Your Cedar</i> to figure out what the big deal is supposed to be.</p></div>"|15695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15695-last-night-on-earth/|5.9|Brian Howe

They weren't quite ""lo-fi,"" they weren't quite ""slackers,"" their guitars weren't quite ""noisy"" and their drums weren't quite ""mathy."" Eric Bachmann's vocals were gritty and visceral, but his lyrics were oblique and cerebral. Archers of Loaf thrived on subtle contradictions, on purposeful vagaries, on tentative gestures delivered with utmost conviction. It comes as neither a surprise nor a disappointment that this much-needed remaster of the band's 1993 debut, <i>Icky Mettle</i>, isn't particularly revelatory: Everything is still right there in the songs themselves.</p>
<p>It seems fitting that Archers of Loaf's first reunion show this year was not a high-profile festival appearance, but rather an unannounced ""opening"" slot for now-labelmates the Love Language at a mid-sized rock club. Like fellow North Carolinians Superchunk, Archers passed on interest from a major label during the 90s ""alternative"" gold rush, signing instead with independent label Alias (then home to Yo La Tengo and the Loud Family). They released increasingly adventurous records for five years, and broke up with minimal drama or fanfare. This, the first in a series of planned deluxe reissues from Merge, perfectly captures the energy of the band's early days, from their slapdash first singles to the scrappy brilliance of <i>Icky Mettle</i> itself to the more honed recordings that followed.</p>
<p>Released on the heels of some well-received singles and a buzzed-about performance at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, <i>Icky Mettle</i> was a hotly anticipated debut for the pre-Internet age. To say it starts on a strong note would be an understatement; opener ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIBBbWFJ38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Web in Front</a>"" is quite simply among the finest indie rock songs ever written. That a song whose lyrics are all but impossible to parse literally comes off as so immediate and relatable speaks both to Bachmann's skill with words-as-sounds, and to his bandmates' ability to put force and nuance behind his voice. Much of the credit here belongs to guitarist Eric Johnson, whose melodic and fluttery guitar parts seem to hammer the very emotional notes that Bachmann's words intentionally skirt.</p>
<p>""Web in Front"" finds its near-equal in ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK3SksQ1fd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wrong</a>"", B-side to the band's first single and perhaps their most compelling study in self-effacing aggression. It is only in the second half of the song's ascendant chorus that Bachmann admits, ""I do not think that you could like me anyway/ Because you are superior in all aspects to me,"" echoing the first half of the chorus but inverting the previously uttered ""inferior."" This self-fulfilling fatalism is at the heart of innumerable rock songs by innumerable bitter young men, but it is rarely expressed with the introspective clarity that Bachmann displays throughout <i>Icky Mettle</i>.</p>
<p>The second disc of Merge's reissue compiles the excellent <i>Vs. the Greatest of All Time </i>EP and the early singles that were previously included on the <i>Speed of Cattle</i> compilation. The five songs from <i>Vs. the Greatest of All Time</i> hint at the more spacious and muscular sound that the band would cultivate on their sophomore LP, <i>Vee Vee</i>, while early 7"" versions of ""Wrong"" and ""Web in Front"" are disjointed and flaccid previews of their album counterparts. The slightly claustrophobic sonics and consistent midtempo clip of <i>Icky Mettle</i> can be daunting at times, and the textural variety of this bonus material makes for a welcome change of pace.</p>
<p>The ramshackle sound of <i>Icky Mettle</i> earned Archers of Loaf comparisons to Pavement (and the occasional dismissal as a Pavement ripoff act), but Bachmann's earnest self-consciousness is miles away from Stephen Malkmus's arch self-awareness. The strain in Bachmann's voice as he sings ""clearly, this is your loss"" in prescient hipster diss ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHhvEAtX3QU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plumb Line</a>"" is devastating, a crack of self-doubt that masterfully undermines the pointed decisiveness of Bachmann's language. Uncertainty has never sounded so much like a rallying cry.</p></div>"|15688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15688-icky-mettle/|9.0|Matt LeMay

Not long ago, the Glasgow producer (real name: Ross Birchard) received a ridiculously glowing Twitter shout-out from hip-hop head-knocker Just Blaze, and Chris Brown <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vl9bjwHCMM&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jumped on an old HudMo track</a>. Still, in a way it's surprising Mohawke has received any level of popularity beyond beat freaks and Warp roster-checkers. His 2009 debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Butter</i></a>, didn't exactly flow like the melted yellow stuff; it was an unfocused mix of future-R&amp;B pastiche and jumbled funk experimentation.</p>
<p>Good thing for second chances. Mohawke's new <i>Satin Panthers </i>EP shows the kind of improvement that a couple of years in the lab will do for you. His music is still jumbled-sounding, but rather than being sneakily complicated, this record is obviously so; the fact it all works so well is the sneaky part. Mohawke packs in oodles of genre- and artist-specific tics: the hard-hitting repetition of Chicago juke, the sharp melodic tang of Bristol's ""purple"" scene, the sticky swarm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/"" target=""_blank""><i>Los Angeles</i></a>-era Flying Lotus, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(franchise)#Light_cycles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">light-cycle</a> chaos of hip-hop producer Lex Luger, and the galloping rhythms of UK funky. Which might sound like the recipe for a total mess, except HudMo combines every ingredient expertly.</p>
<p>One complaint: The EP's 17-minute run time feels too brief. Luckily, <i>Satin Panthers</i> offers more than enough to tide listeners over until a potential follow-up album, whether the double-octave bass line on ""Thunder Bay"" or the building synth spirals on ""Octan"". The closing track, a burst of marching-band mania, is called ""Thank You"", but when all's said and done, there's a lot of gratitude to go around here.</p></div>"|15685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15685-satin-panthers-ep/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

This is particularly true in the case of Zach Rogue's stepping out as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/releasethesunbird"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Release the Sunbird</a>: though Rogue Wave grew from a solo project to a full-time band in a matter of months, I imagine a guy who sorta named the band after himself maintains as much songwriting autonomy as he wants. But upon holing up in a Bloomington, Ind., studio with a batch of unfinished songs after a grueling tour stint, you could assume that Rogue wanted to pump the brakes on a band that was getting bigger and not necessarily better. Of all the records from the past decade accurately likened to the Shins, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6919-out-of-the-shadow/"" target=""_blank""><i>Out of the Shadow</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6920-descended-like-vultures/"" target=""_blank""><i>Descended Like Vultures</i></a> are pretty much the only two that still hold up. But attempts to muscle up for amphitheaters (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10667-asleep-at-heavens-gate/"" target=""_blank""><i>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</i></a>) and dancefloors (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/"" target=""_blank""><i>Permalight</i></a>) proved Rogue Wave's charming indie pop wasn't really scalable.</p>
<p>On the title track here, Rogue sings, ""I'm already able to cut myself down if I need to,"" and <i>Come Back to Us</i> goes out of its way to be accommodating to those unconvinced by the direction Rogue had been taking. Described as a ""solo project, yet not,"" it brings him back to the <i>Out of the Shadow</i> days where the bulk of the songs were just him and his guitar, occasional production touches applied after the fact. Opener ""It's All Around You"" is more of a purposeful mantra than song, the single titular lyric doubling seeping Farfisa (courtesy of the Wave's Pat Spurgeon) and surprisingly loud drums for an enveloping, you-are-there sound. <i>Come Back to Us</i> never rocks that hard again (""rocks"" being relative), but the homey warmth is maintained through an <i>au naturel</i> recording where every scrape of fingernails on guitar strings, bounce of room echo, and imperfect harmony is kept intact. Even the more surprising studio touches-- a distorted percussive effect on ""Come Back to Us"", guiro, the unsettling reverb of ""A New You""-- come off like natural found sound amidst rumpled folk-pop that doesn't sound composed so much as snuggled into wakefulness.</p>
<p>Yet for all of its dewy production and dog-eared melodies, Rogue's words themselves sag with the burden of addiction, death, and fatherhood: It sounds like early morning music for people who've been up all night struggling with something heavy. Though it's not addressed to anyone specific, ""Always Like the Son"" carries devastating weight, the passing of a brother or one's closest friend being used as a reflection for one's own personal shortcomings. ""Why Can't You Look at Yourself"" instantly recalls an unplugged version of <i>Descended Like Vulture</i>'s ""Bird on a Wire"", but forgoes its lighter-waving to seek relief from the powerlessness of watching an alcoholic waste away. If not so much a sharp turn for Rogue sonically (""California"" and ""Christians in Black"" come to my mind), it's unquestionably the most personal and direct he's ever been-- a lyric like ""all this emotion, can't help myself"" might read cloying, but it's the purest distillation of a record that thrives on straightforwardness and honesty.</p>
<p>But while <i>Come Back to Us</i> isn't Rogue's longest release, it's got the longest tracklist and it's a little too good at establishing mood: The cumulative effect of 12 straight ballads of misty eyes and resigned acceptance after ""It's All Around You"" saps the individual effect of each. Or maybe the most powerful of the songs all come in the first half, and as <i>Come Back to Us</i> pushes toward its disappointingly vague closer, ""Outlook's Anonymous"", Rogue's words get more terse and emotionally illegible without offering any compensation in volume or melody. Still, it's a shame that the songs on <i>Come Back to Us</i> weren't available to Rogue previously, since ""A New You"" or ""Why Can't You Look at Yourself"" could've certainly counterbalanced some of his more awkwardly ambitious moments of late. So even if it's a pointedly despondent record, it actually makes me hopeful that Rogue hasn't wholly lost touch with the humble charm of his best work.</p></div>"|15632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15632-come-back-to-us/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Its single, 48-minute track is warm, reverent, and emotional. Compared to some recent trends in drone, which tend more toward the dark and cavernous, <i>Please Stop Loving Me</i>'<i>s </i>bright organ tones are practically hymn-like. In other words, this is music that sounds like it wants you to love it.</p>
<p>The further I got into the album, though, the more Szczepanik's wry choice of name made sense. Whenever you try to get too comfortable with his drones-- to glide across their surface or ride them like a soft cloud-- he pushes back. His sounds constantly twist, dive, and circle, avoiding complacency and requiring you to do the same. Innumerable shifts in volume, tone, and tempo occur with sneaky unpredictability. Often Szczepanik will lull you into calm waters before tossing you into choppy waves. There is a lot to love here, much of it mesmerizing, even soothing. Just don't turn your brain off, because Szczepanik is more interested in challenging than hypnotizing.</p>
<p>The beauty of <i>Please Stop Loving Me</i> is that he manages to do both consistently. There's really no point along Szczepanik's journey-- which doesn't feel long or short, but more outside of time-- where the music's meditative qualities outstrip its thought-provoking ones or vice versa. In that sense, his material reminds me most of the careful work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28249-kyle-bobby-dunn/"">Kyle Bobby Dunn</a>. There's an intangible similarity between the ways both musicians turn sounds and patterns into wordless emotional language. But where Dunn is a master at massaging his tones toward quietude, Szczepanik excels at finding subtlety and nuance in immersive volumes. Even at his softest here, he could fill an airplane hangar with his music.</p>
<p>Szczepanik's work<i> </i>conjures lots of images like that one. Whenever I listen, I find myself thinking in pictures and metaphors, giving shapes and colors to his sounds the way I imagine the faces and voices of characters in a book. So it's tempting to concoct a narrative that could accompany this sonic epic, and claim that its arcs and curves are scene changes and plot twists. Maybe they are, but what impresses most about Szczepanik's story is that it could be told only with sound, and only through his particular, engrossing way with it.</p></div>"|15689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15689-please-stop-loving-me/|7.8|Marc Masters

He reminds me of an aged-out, nomadic skate rat who posts up in a downtown coffeeshop to scribble poetry about the 10 lives it feels like he's lived so far. He's not a pseudo-intellectual, and while he's been through some shit, he's also not a whiner, preferring to be positive about his future, occasionally almost to a fault. He is far from content with his station in life, but he balances his complaints and worries with a reflective and forward-moving worldview, a methodology that Rhymesayers MCs (and the hardcore punks who preceded them) have mastered, ensuring that the smallish number of people who like them will really like them. As for bystanders like me? I wish him the best, but could I get some breathing room, please?</p>
<p>Grieves asks us to serve as his casual confidants on <i>Together/Apart</i>. He dwells on the down-to-earth drudgery of being broke, kicking addictions, and getting over ex-girlfriends (On ""Heartbreak Hotel"" he describes one of them as ""the scalpel to open up my doubtful,"" which... wow); all of which makes for an interesting fit with the pop savvy and light colors of Budo's production work. Grieves is more than game to match his collaborator's slick, itchy Okayplayerisms, switching between rapping and singing as his partner stacks up the soul chords and funk flourishes. Over Budo's double-timed synth squirts for ""On the Rocks"", he switches to a laconic drawl reminiscent of Bay Area backpack OG duo Latyrx; on ""Boogie Man"", he more closely recalls the intense confessionalism of labelmate Slug on the spare verses, before the chorus expands into a more gelled-up rap-rock hybrid.</p>
<p>The duo provides compelling surface-level reasons to hear them out, but in the end, it all adds up to well-produced, confidently delivered Rootsy boilerplate. After an hour of this, though, Budo's tracks start merging together into a session-level slurry, and you can listen to Grieves' laments only for so long until you start checking your watch, if not occasionally raising an eyebrow at an awkward turn of phrase. It's all encapsulated on the ""Juicy""-style coming-up narrative of featured track ""Lightspeed"", into which Grieves incorporates the positive admonitions of Blackalicious' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYwndYSA6-U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Make You Feel That Way</a>"" and Mos Def's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in1XouH9FTk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speed Law</a>"". The pieces are there, as they are on much of <i>Together/Apart</i>, but the execution is lacking. Grieves' breathy self-serious vocal rubs the wrong way against Budo's lush, sepia-toned track, his shout-outs to Tamagotchi toys and Fleer trading cards (what, no ""Boy Meets World""?) are weirdly TMI and just sort of bland, and a clunky chorus (you don't need to follow ""once in a while"" with ""sometimes,"" because they mean the same thing) compel me to agree with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhTuYKR-ejo#t=0m9s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tony Soprano's opinion of ""remember when.""</a> ""Landspeed"" is the sort of tale that works best when its narrator has much more distance between now and then; like the rest of <i>Together/Apart</i>, it's the work of a precocious artist who perhaps assumes we should care about the details of his life, instead of compelling us to listen.</p></div>"|15666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15666-togetherapart/|5.2|Eric Harvey

Events that would eventually cement the collective's budding stardom-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"">Tyler, the Creator</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12112-yonkers/"" target=""_blank"">""Yonkers""</a> becoming a viral sensation, their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x0JZ7L0PKI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">seminal performance</a> on <a href=""http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon""</a>, Tyler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41562-tyler-the-creator-signs-to-xl/"" target=""_blank"">inking a deal</a> with <a href=""http://www.xlrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XL</a>-- were either weeks or months away. The group at large was still strictly a sensation in a small pocket of the Internet, somewhat mysterious, amorphous, confusing and-- as anyone who tried to grab an album from Odd Future's official blog only to be met with a broken download link could attest-- amateur.</p>
<p>Released after that initial rush of online hype, <i>BlackenedWhite</i> (along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"">Domo Genesis</a>' <i>Rolling Papers</i>) was, if not an introduction point, at least the first new music released since many had initially heard of Odd Future. Described on the crew's <a href=""http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a> as ""The Perfect Soundtrack For Mobbing On A Dark Halloween Night,"" and littered with references to dead cops, the album easily fit into the general perception of what Odd Future's music was about.</p>
<p>So here we are, some eight-and-a-half months later, and <i>BlackenedWhite</i> has now been remastered, rearranged, and re-released by <a href=""http://www.fatpossum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fat Possum</a> into a market where Tyler easily coexists next to pop stars. And yet, oddly enough, MellowHype's role is almost precisely the same, again representing the first new release by Odd Future since being embraced again by a wider audience. But where in October 2010 it might've been hard to pinpoint exactly where MellowHype stood in relation to guys like Tyler or Domo or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, time has allowed the different personas within Odd Future to distinguish themselves.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"">Hodgy Beats</a>' wild-eyed glare can be seen next to Tyler on stage during Odd Future's shows, and it's easy to see how he could be thought of as Tyler's sidekick. And in fact, when people talk about Odd Future on a macro level, especially when that discussion is boiled down to the more controversial elements of the music, who they're really talking about is Tyler (and, to a lesser extent, Earl), oftentimes glossing over the individual members of the group. Part of that is by design, of course: Tyler has always been front and center, and not only is his star power blatantly obvious, but he feeds on being on a lightning rod. But lost in the shuffle is that the other arms of Odd Future are putting out music that is far from Tyler's trolling self-autopsies, which is both a good and bad thing.</p>
<p>As a rapper, Hodgy seems mostly concerned with stringing together words on the basis of their sound in rapid-fire fashion. This is seen most obviously in ""Igotagun"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42789-video-mellowhype-64/"" target=""_blank"">""64""</a>, the two new tracks added to <i>Blackenedwhite</i> for the reissue. He doesn't have Tyler's focus or imagination, but his garden-variety shit talking, combined with gleefully inhabited fables of drug pushing and cop killing, bring the sort of levity that you would expect from a group of skate-punk ""Jackass"" descendents, and in a way that's much less obnoxious than, say, Tyler's ""Bitch Suck Dick"". What can't be found here are all the things that upset people about Odd Future, namely Tyler's reliance on slurs and his elaborate rape fantasies. And though Hodgy doesn't possess Earl's effortless rapping skill (who does?), his penchant for tongue-twisting alliteration further separates him from the stoned flows of fellow Odd Future stoners Domo and Mike G.</p>
<p>The flipside of that is when Tyler storms through on ""Fuck the Police"" (now rebranded for Best Buys as ""F666 the Police""), the effect is slightly jarring. While Hodgy's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Flocka</a> homage and producer Left Brain's turn as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> circa <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQPvgHEMCFs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Need a Resolution""</a> work just fine, Tyler tells a strikingly vivid story of getting pulled over and murdering a cop in what is easily the most accomplished verse on the album. <i>BlackenedWhite</i> is the most fun Odd Future release (excepting, arguably, the collaborative mixtapes) and it's one of the easier to digest, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny in the way that Tyler's or Earl's work does.</p>
<p>This cleaned up version of the album also puts a stronger concentration on the Left Brain productions that lean heavy on Southern rap. Replacing the distinctly Tyler-esque <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12034-chordaroy-ft-earl-sweatshirt-and-wolf-haley/"" target=""_blank"">""Chordaroy""</a> and ""Loco"", as well as the trifles ""Stripclub"" and ""Gram"", are the aforementioned new tracks, both of which call back to the beats that the Neptunes used to give to Clipse. The result is both a more succinct and cohesive full-length. The catch-22 for MellowHype is that while their centrism certainly has its merits, their music is unlikely to convert anyone that has, at this point, already written off Odd Future. Which leaves them with a solid, fun rap album to satiate a feverish cult and a growing number of casual fans. Things, all told, could be worse.</p></div>"|15686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15686-blackenedwhite-reissue/|8.0|Jordan Sargent

MCDE's output is often described as deep house, and there's a long tradition of deep house producers simply borrowing polite brass and woodwind arrangements from old jazz records and slapping them on top of featureless beats. The results are usually bland, sometimes plain banal. An hour's worth of the stuff, all that polite chugging and all those waxy saxophones, tends to be good for napping but not much else.</p>
<p>That's not what you get here. The mix opens with an eerily swaying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sun</a> Ra tune, which is a pretty good indication that Danilo Plessow's taste in jazz runs more toward the odd and cosmic than the smooth and placid. But aside from the tart Afro-funk horns on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Allen_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tony Allen</a> cut, there's really not much here that sounds like jazz of any sort. Even the Sun Ra record more closely resembles a kind of slightly sinister soul music from outer space. Across the mix, Plessow focuses on what makes the best deep house its own animal: fluid bass, swinging beats, and the spaciousness of good dub.</p>
<p>And even then, as long as his choices fit those requirements, Plessow goes further out than you might expect. He often leaves the boundaries of deep house, or any kind of house, far behind. MCDE throws in old-school IDM and sweaty vintage Afrobeat, polyrhythmic weirdo disco and wombing ambient house, classic Detroit-style techno and the outer limits of the genre's Germanic counterpart. Like all the best DJs not bound to a scene, Plessow has managed to locate connecting points between records released years apart and for entirely different audiences, cuts that feature the muscle of live human drummers and rhythm tracks that sound more like computer hiccups.</p>
<p>And yet all of them feel weirdly natural linked together, as if they were always meant to build to this whole, which begins with simmering dub and Afro-Cuban rhythms, moves through a mini-set of warm and ultra-traditional house, and then launches into various kinds of fractured funk experimentation from the 1980s into the 2000s. While staying doggedly mid-tempo, whether it's techno's pulse or disco's boogie, Plessow proves himself a master of pace. And while there are no floor-filling anthems here from any era, it's all too busy and bustling to be called minimal. Like all deep house fans, Plessow chooses tracks in part because they sound so luscious, with every piano and snare drum sounding extra crisp, perfect headphone music. But the bass here is so uniformly rich and powerful and forward-charging that even at its most gentle you never forget this is still music designed to move bodies.</p>
<p>Plenty of DJs have wide-ranging record collections. Rare are the ones who can seamlessly mix between genres without sacrificing flow for eclecticism or excitement for a display of pure technical skill. MCDE's <i>DJ-Kicks </i>is one of those rare home-listening mixes that is stylistically all over the map but feels unified, that can mix records released three decades apart more because they feel right, because they produce sparks. If you're only a casual house and techno fan, this <i>DJ-Kicks </i>won't catch you up on dance music's cutting edge. But if you're looking for one of the best-mixed and most immersive sessions of the year, dance music that's both a head-trip in the dub tradition and unflaggingly funky, this is the mix for you.</p></div>"|15684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15684-dj-kicks/|8.0|Jess Harvell

Please, don't hold that against them. The band's genesis may be purely millennial, but its music is firmly situated in the 1990s. Grooms' 2009 debut, <i>Rejoicer</i>, slightly recalls the shambling rawness of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>; for the follow-up, <i>Prom</i>, Grooms dive headlong into the sweeping erotic confusion that permeated the dreamier sphere of 90s alt-rock. They aren't the only band making such a maneuver this year (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Being Pure at Heart, the Pains of</a>), but Grooms' aims give off a whiff of vague danger, a static unease occasionally broken by detuned guitars and skins-smashing breakdowns.</p>
<p>Travis Johnson's swinging, strung-out pipes dominate here, though bassist Emily Ambruso somewhat ill-advisedly takes the mic on the short breakup blast ""Sharing"", which sounds quite a bit like fellow New York shoegaze fetishists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/216-asobi-seksu/"" target=""_blank"">Asobi Seksu</a>. Like that band, Grooms have little relation to the Brooklyn scene's recent shift away from hazy, distanced rock toward synths and new age tropes. Although <i>Prom</i> does occasionally dip into the well of perpetually vogue, vague nostalgia (""17 is the whole world/ In my room/ The Smiths, and girls""), the album is especially close-focus when compared to a few of the band's regional peers. When Grooms hit the sticky, slack-jawed realities of album highlights ""Expression of"" and ""Skating With Girl"", they rank among the few guitar-indie bands so unafraid to match intimacy with clarity.</p>
<p>Unlike another of those bands, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>, Grooms are still a ways away from managing to carve out an identity through tons of obsessive record-collection re-creation. That's especially true on ""Into the Arms"", where Johnson barks in a way that's almost distractingly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2461-les-savy-fav/"" target=""_blank"">Les Savy Fav</a>'s Tim Harrington. The rest of the band doesn't have the muscle to match up with that sort of brawn (really, who does besides LSF?); despite Grooms' excellent ability to resemble many other bands without necessarily ripping them off, the track is a reminder that, well, not <i>everything</i> is a perfect fit.</p></div>"|15662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15662-prom/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

He founded SSION while at art school there-- his extracurricular credits include album art for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> and music videos for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"" target=""_blank"">Liars</a>-- and the band communicates over a wide range of media: campy, trashy music videos that would make John Waters smile; elaborate stage shows involving garish sets and costumes; and the kind of attitude-heavy electro pop that would go over equally well at the gay disco as the queercore dive bar. The question then is how does this stuff hold up outside the disco, without the dance routines or the videos, on its own, as an album?</p>
<p>The answer on <i>Bent</i> is: unfortunately, only okay. The album's lead single, ""Psy-Chic"", is a delicious tease: just under three minutes of propulsive bass arpeggio, fluttering synths, and Critcheloe singing, in an airy and inviting voice, the kind of chorus that could loop on forever (""Sometimes I think about you everyday/ Some days I only think about…""). It even has a righteous Courtney Love appropriation (""I told you from the start…"") delivered in a deadpan speaking voice then breaking into laughter with a playful ""psych!"" If there's not already an extended 12"" dance mix of this track, it will be necessary to create one. If <i>Bent</i>'s shortest song is also its best, then its runner-up is its longest, ""Nothing Happens at Nite"", which spaces Critcheloe's usually dense approach out over eight minutes, making for a kind of dubby, sun-rising house track that's more subtly moving than SSION's tightly wound pop numbers. More of this, please.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Critcheloe's songs and productions are pleasant and utilitarian-- if any of these came on at the right moment on the right dance floor, you'd wanna dance-- but ultimately insubstantial, fizzing out of one's memory almost as soon as they're finished playing. Still, there are some nice touches: the funhouse bells and whistles of ""Blonde With U"", the Freestyle-by-way-of-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules and Love Affair</a> ""Luvvbazzar"", the muted beatboxing of ""Growin"", the drippy snaps occasionally overwhelmed by oppressive drum pulse on ""Feel Good (4-Evr)"", the brightly upbeat ""My Love Grows in the Dark"". But nothing on <i>Bent</i> pops off the screen quite as vibrantly as ""Psy-Chic"" or with as much cool confidence as ""Nothing Ever Happens at Nite"".</p>
<p>Maybe it's unfair to judge <i>Bent</i> as a stand-alone object, as the point or the primary document of the SSION project rather than as merely one prong of many in a multimedia pincer attack. But taken on those terms, it leaves you longing for the discotheque. Maybe that's the point.</p></div>"|15682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15682-bent/|6.8|Eric Grandy

The term is an obvious nod to Britpop but also to their hometown of Slough (which, by the way, still isn't half as gritty as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a>'s early 1990s Sheffield). A large part of how they have made it this far has to do with their loudmouth posturing in the British indie press and in public starting their second ever gig with the line ""If anyone here doesn’t want to see the future of music, leave now.""</p>
<p>That kind of sassy talk has polarized the UK press but at least puts them leagues ahead of countless other faceless major label bands in the personality game. However, all that bluster and boasting comes undone when listening to <i>Famous First Words</i> and you realise they actually don't have anything to say at all. The songs range from a parade of clichés to the plain ridiculous, none  more so than ""I met the mermaid and I showed her just how to run,"" from  ""False Alarm"", a song that also relays an imagined conversation with a  tornado. Those kind of ideas come across as  an unintentionally hilarious attempt to out-stupid Oasis at their most  obtuse, but even the Gallaghers had enough sense to qualify their  non-sequiturs with lines about getting high. Also, at least <i>somebody</i> in  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Champagne Supernova""</a> was having fun, because let's be clear-- nobody on  this record is having fun, not you the listener nor any member of Viva  Brother.</p>
<p>Musically, things are just as drab and any hint of an interesting idea on <i>Famous First Words</i> can easily traced back to a much more appealing root. Take opening track ""New Year's Day"" for example and its wordless chorus, lifted almost directly from the coda of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDswiT87oo8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Girls and Boys""</a>, but replacing that bands cheeky charm with try-hard conviction. And then there's ""Otherside"", which opens with a promising <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chameleons"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chameleons</a>-like guitar line before descending into yet more chugging guitar and infant grade lyrics. This time Newell recounts the places he has been leaving his head-- at the end of the phone, by a bedside light-- before sneering ""I got a job/ That I don't want"". It's pretty brainless stuff, the special kind that makes you feel somehow stupider for having listened.</p>
<p>Look, It's easy to see why Viva Brother were given a shot at the big time-- the dual allure of a Britpop revival and four arrogant young men with guitars must have been impossible for record execs to resist. But in execution the whole thing comes off as nothing more than a thinly disguised, crass attempt to smoke latent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">Oasis</a> fans out of hiding. Unfortunately for them, Beady Eye already beat them to the punch.</p></div>"|15669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15669-famous-first-words/|2.9|Hari Ashurst

Over the previous seven years, the relationship between the singer and his label was contentious yet fruitful; gritty uptempo songs like ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" and ""Hitch Hike"" were hits, but they undermined Gaye's dream to be a balladeer in the mold of Nat King Cole. Those lusty trifles also roused the internal conflict between the artist's gospel upbringing and his endless desire for carnal pleasure. And while Gaye aspired to be more than just a singer within Motown's assembly-line chug, his boss, brother-in-law, and fellow hard-headed egoist Berry Gordy Jr. wasn't so crazy about the idea. So when Gordy heard that original ""What's Going On"" mix-- which is included in this box set for the first time-- he rejected the song, reportedly calling it ""the worst thing I've ever heard in my life.""</p>
<p><span>Instead of releasing ""What's Going On"" that fall, Motown put out the Gaye compilation <i>Super Hits</i>, which depicts its clean-shaven star as a cartoon superhero flying through the air and fixing a radio tower as a buxom damsel perilously hangs from his shoulder. But Gaye wanted nothing more than to blow up that gleaming image of himself-- now in his early 30s, he would accept nothing but complete control over his art. And if Motown wasn't going to release his first self-produced song, he wasn't going to make music for Motown. Gaye sat idle for months until his label, desperate to put out something-- anything-- from its biggest solo star, finally eked the single out under Gordy's nose on January 21, 1971. It was an instant success, hitting No. 2 on the pop charts and, perhaps more importantly for Gaye, giving him a win in his constant battle with Gordy, who couldn't deny a smash. Five months later, Marvin Gaye released his full-grown symphony to God, </span><i><span>What's Going On</span></i><span>, with little resistance.</span></p>
<p><span>Forty years of ubiquity have made the title track commonplace, so it's easy to forget that the song was the ""most avant-garde hit Motown ever had,"" according to Ben Edmonds' thorough album history <i>What's Going On: Marvin Gaye and the Last Days of the Motown Sound</i>. With this album, Gaye wished to sidestep the sound that made him and others famous during Motown's untouchable 60s run, trading in that trademark big, bright beat for laid-back grooves inspired by Duke Ellington, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, and Santana. And not only was the album a coming-out party for Gaye as a producer and songwriter, he found his signature voice-- soft, floating, airy-- on <i>What's Going On</i>, too. ""I felt like I'd finally learned to sing,"" he told biographer David Ritz. ""I'd been studying the microphone for a dozen years, and I suddenly saw what I'd been doing wrong. I'd been singing too loud."" The record and its creative revelations led to his stunning 70s auteur period, which birthed three more classics: 1973's <i>Let's Get It On</i>, 1976's <i>I Want You</i>, and 1978's <i>Here, My Dear</i>. Yet <i>What's Going On</i> still stands tallest, making this 40th anniversary, 2CD/LP edition more of a welcome reminder than just another eulogy to baby-boomer culture. </span></p>
<p><span>Much has been made of <i>What's Going On</i>'s political bent, and it's true that the music was partially inspired by Marvin's brother Frankie, who had come back from a three-year tour of Vietnam, along with troublingly violent episodes like the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kent State shootings that saw four students killed by national guardsmen. Songs like peace-espousing title track and ""What's Happening Brother"", which finds Gaye expressing a war veteran's helplessness upon returning home, show Marvin's dismay toward his country and government. But this album isn't just a protest time capsule. Far from it. Gaye's disappointment isn't just societal, it's personal as well. During this period, the singer had lost his duet partner and dear friend, Tammi Terrell, and his marriage to Gordy's sister Anna was violently breaking down, and he was being tailed by the IRS for unpaid back taxes. His resulting depression is evident throughout; <i>What's Going On</i> isn't a fiery album filled with timely sloganeering. Part of its long-lasting appeal involves an element of true-to-life resignation. ""Who's willing to try to save a world/ That's destined to die,"" he sings on ""Save the Children"", pinpointing an American melancholia-- a mix of world-saving power and funereal inevitability-- that endures today.</span></p>
<p><span>But the album doesn't wallow, either. It hums and glides on the effortless, multi-tracked Marvins that swoop through the stereo spectrum like ghosts. Gaye's signature vocal ad libs started here and have endured through R&amp;B and hip-hop ever since. His marijuana-soaked delivery, along with the album's mutating, percussion-fueled rhythms, majestic strings, and jazzy horns, give the affair levity. Perhaps this smooth front also has to do with the fact that Gaye was ""hardly an activist in the traditional sense,"" according to Edmonds. While his Vietnam-battered brother was an emotional catalyst, Gaye had neglected to send him one letter during his army stint. And though he was certainly aware of the Detroit race riot that left 43 people dead in 1967, he viewed the sad display on TV from his cushy home on the outskirts of town. Not to say Gaye didn't wholeheartedly believe in the progressive observations found on <i>What's Going On</i>, but his relative distance from his subjects allows him to fly over top of them, providing a healing pulse to the disarray below.</span></p>
<p><span>For an album as timeless as this one, reissue bonus material can provide worthy footnotes to the main article. Probably thanks to the last decade's vinyl resurgence, this 40th anniversary edition immediately sets itself apart from 2001's 30th anniversary release by presenting its iconic cover in a glorious 12""x12"" square. The package's lone LP features the more straightforward, early Detroit mix of the album, while the final, L.A. mix is relegated to a CD. For die-hards, the most alluring part of the package may be the second compact disc, which features 18 mostly instrumental demos recorded in Gaye's post-<i>What's Going On</i> honeymoon period, when his vast artistic ambitions and abilities were being embraced by the greater public. These somewhat experimental demos-- deep, in-the-pocket funk in the vein of Sly Stone, George Clinton, and Jimi Hendrix-- clearly laid the groundwork for much of his subsequent 70s material. Though he doesn't sing on most of these tracks, it's exciting to hear him get loose as keyboardist and band leader.</span></p>
<p><span>Just as <i>What's Going On</i> marked the emergence of Marvin Gaye as an all-in-one talent, it also signaled the decline of Motown's reign. It's tempting to simply side with Gaye in his battles with the label that raised him and play into the auteur myth. But it's more complicated than that. Without his tutelage at Motown, first as a session player then as a singer, Gaye wouldn't have been able to conceive a work like this. The help of Motown backing band the Funk Brothers-- credited in the <i>What's Going On </i>liner notes after years of anonymity-- was also essential. Before he was shot and killed by his own father at age 44 in 1984, Gaye was afforded the schooling of America's finest pop academy and then the freedom to flourish and act on his own whims afterward. His 70s brilliance is unfathomable without his 60s pop triumphs. And <i>What's Going On</i> is the turning point, the moment when he was able to bypass his selfishness and self-destructiveness in the name of God, peace, love. It's a nice dream. One that he knew was too good to last. ""Mercy, mercy me,"" he pleaded calmly, desperately. </span></p></div>"|15679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15679-whats-going-on-40th-anniversary-edition/|9.5|Ryan Dombal

I want to be able to judge it outside the shadow of Radiohead, the band Selway drums for, but I'm not sure that's really even possible. As Mark Pytlik did last year in his review of Selway's debut solo LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14602-familial/"" target=""_blank""><i>Familial</i></a>, I give Selway all the credit in the world for stepping out on his own and responding to a singing and songwriting muse that's never going to become a part of Radiohead's music. To make such straightforward singer-songwriter music only increases the challenge. It leaves him exposed as a performer in a way he's normally not when he's at the drum kit.</p>
<p><i>Familial </i>was OK: a couple of memorable tracks and a lot of pretty filler. <i>Running Blind</i> comprises four songs that were left over when <i>Familial</i> was completed. One of them, ""What Goes Around"", was included as a bonus track in demo form on that album and gets fleshed out here. And <i>Running Blind</i> is... OK. It does move the sound on a bit-- <i>Familial</i> was almost self-consciously sparse, as though Selway wanted to distance it as much as possible from Radiohead and that band's mastery of texture and electronics in the context of songs. <i>Running Blind</i> opens up a little to the soundscape, though we're nowhere near <i>The King of Limbs</i> territory in that respect. The additions here are more like textural dressing for Selway's delicate, almost-whispered singing, which hasn't changed from the LP.</p>
<p>The new take on ""What Goes Around"" is the most compelling thing Selway has released under his own name. This has little to do with the arrangement, though, and everything to do with the fact that he strongly delivers a well-crafted melody, and the textural elements of the music pick up the thread from there to emphasize certain feelings implied in the lyrics. The other songs move with a bit less purpose-- Selway is getting good at setting a mood with his songs, as he does with a little Theremin and a brief wordless harmony passage on the title track, but there's very little energy in the music, and the tone doesn't vary much. The vaguely tribal drumming on ""Every Spit and Cough"" adds a little variety, but it can't quite get out from under its blanket of ambient keyboard and low-volume vocals.</p>
<p>The EP reinforces the impression created by the debut that Selway only really runs in one gear on his own. <i>Running Blind</i> is a slight improvement on its predecessor, but its true saving grace may be a run time so short (15 minutes) that it doesn't have a chance to tranquilize the listener fully. Selway is creeping toward making something that stands well on its own, but he's not quite there yet.</p></div>"|15673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15673-running-blind-ep/|5.8|Joe Tangari

Age has nothing to to with it, but the New Jersey-based founder of the labels <a href=""http://www.troublemanunlimited.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Troubleman Unlimited</a>, <a href=""http://vivaitalians.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italians Do It Better</a>, and, most recently, Perseo, has without a doubt enjoyed a lengthy and meandering role in the world of relatively underground music. For all the many releases Simonetti has overseen at his labels, ranging from hardcore to Italo disco, <i>Capricorn Rising</i> is the first record of original material to appear solely under his own name.</p>
<p>On the evidence here, Simonetti is definitively <i>not</i> too old for this, though like many artists with full creative control he can sometimes be a bit indulgent. At nearly 39 minutes, the EP is longer than plenty of albums, but 21 of those minutes are given over to a single song, advance mp3 ""Third of the Storms"", which appears in three separate instances. Mesmerizing chill-out disco that sets an innocently chiming melody atop handclaps, driving krautrock bass, droning washes of synth, and occasional idyllic sound effects, the song makes a fine bookend to the record: On the opening, vocal version, Australian electro-R&amp;B smoothie Sam Sparro adds multi-layered, chant-like repetitions conveying a sense of joyful fatalism, while the closing, instrumental take leaves more room for the track to breathe; each is excellent depending on your mood, though as with disco singles like this since time immemorial, you probably won't want to listen to both cuts in the same sitting (that's not a criticism). As a centerpiece, though, ""Third of the Storms (Acapulco)"" disappoints; more or less five minutes of Sparro's already-familiar incantations over sparse, monotonous backing, it almost could have been called ""Third of the Storms (A Cappella)"".</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Capricorn</i> offers another four cuts in a similarly hypnotic, synth-based mold. The best is the title track, with pulse-raising electronics and wisps of breath that suggest a mechanically precise jogger; <i>Blade Runner</i> would be too obvious a reference point for a crate digger like Simonetti, but given this track's sci-fi synthesis of chilly electronics and thriller suspense, a comparison to that classic film (and its equally classic score by Vangelis) can't be too far off the mark. Just as seamless is pounding synth workout ""Song for Luca"", the longest non-""Third of the Storms"" piece here, building to a climax that belies its Balearic calm. Simonetti also detours into humming ambient textures, on ""Dust Devil"", and a mournful keyboard reflection, ""Renko's Theme"", which has a rich, yacht-friendly pomp. The end result is a worthwhile stepping-out EP from a longtime behind-the-scenes player, and if its worst crime is excess, well, we're talking about a record with an ice cream sundae on the cover.</p></div>"|15678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15678-capricorn-rising-ep/|7.1|Marc Hogan
