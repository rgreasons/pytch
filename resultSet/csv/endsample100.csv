That mythology began before the band even existed, written into being in Pete Doherty's journal. Like a lovelorn teenager, he scrawled ""<span>Doherty/Barât"" across countless pages, in which he also laid out his and Carl Barât's poetic ambition: ""To gain a measure of immortality in the plastic bubble of popular culture. A tricky task—unless one happens to be equipped with the belief, the talent, and the fervour."" <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Such was the price of admission into the world of the Libertines. <span>You didn’t need a military jacket and crude tattoo stick'n'poked in a Camden </span>bedsit,<span> </span><span>just the belief that belief itself was enough to transcend unfavorable circumstances, whether class or humdrum surrounds. They called this </span>state of mind Albion, framed as a fantasy of a kinder England rooted in kitchen sink drama and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_and_Simpson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Galton and Simpson</a> comedies. But Doherty knew it couldn't last. ""Look at the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3749-sex-pistols/"" target=""_blank"">Sex Pistols</a>,"" he said in 2002, before the Libertines had even released debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4769-up-the-bracket/"" target=""_blank""><i>Up the Bracket</i></a>. ""They split up and there’s bitterness and sourness."" He told Barât that they would meet the same fate, and they did.  Their Albion became oblivion. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""><span>Considering the interim decade of hubris (Barât's truly awful solo records) and reckless devastation (the crimes resulting from Doherty's enduring addictions, now supposedly kicked), it's a huge surprise that the Libertines' unlikely third album <span>doesn't reprise old glories. <span>On</span><i> Anthems for Doomed Youth</i><span>, the immortal Albion dream is dead, their erstwhile fantasy mocked and incinerated like an effigy on bonfire night.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p> <i>Anthems</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""> is littered with fragments of various past demos, but one old song appears wholesale. ""You're My Waterloo"" dates from 1999, a smoky piano ballad about the blossoming all-but-physical romance between Doherty and Barât. As lovely as it is, the intervening 16 years make tragic lines like ""I'm so glad we know just what to do and everyone's going to be happy"" just sound mawkish. Sharper is ""Fame and Fortune"", a shanty about Camden good old days that would be self-aggrandizing if it wasn't so self-mocking. ""Dubloons down for a double bluff/ Dip your quill or your bleeding heart and sign <i>there </i>and <i>there </i>and <i>there,""</i> Barât sings, sending up the naivete of bohemians doing business. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">For fans, it's always galling to see a band dismiss the parts of their past that they fell in love with. But <i>Anthems</i> isn't bitter or dismissive. Opener ""Barbarians"" is a gimlet-eyed spaghetti western rallying optimism for the broken. Lifting the guitar from Sixpence None the Richer's ""Kiss Me"", the title track starts out as a grand proclamation about the futile spoils of war and revolution, espoused with Barât's typical camp flair. But then he shreds the glorious fantasy, revealing an ignominious reality with a comic turn of phrase: ""In the pub that night, racking out the lines of shite/ Putting to right all of the world's great wrongs."" When righteous belief is its own life force, an array of beer mats is as good a map to conquer as any.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">There's no romance in the songs where the duo confront their demons (Barât has also struggled with addiction and depression), but they're still full of fight. On </span><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">""Belly of the Beast"", Doherty sounds as if </span><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">he's trying to slap himself out of the fug with every syllable of ""It was a smacked-up, cracked-up, bone shark smacked -down day."" Single ""Gunga Din"" has a reggae lilt, and Doherty's portrait of the cycle of veins, drinks, panic, and suffering is flinty, in stark contrast with the chorus' sloppy, rueful rush about having weak moral fiber. On ""Heart of the Matter"", the guitars echo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g207eTzVw0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Look Back Into the Sun""</a>, but whereas that classic praised a chancer's luck, here the pair express sad surprise that they're still going, having made it this far on a ""crooked little smile.""<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">It's a reminder of the beguiling poetry of the Libertines, the world of Biggles and Bilo, ships and maidens, which they indulge on ""Fury of Chonburi"", a tale of conflicted, enduring devotion among ""pig men"" (their mutual pet name). It's one of the only ragers here, alongside ""Glasgow Coma Scale Blues"", tumbling pub rock with a brash theme tune quality. <i>Anthems</i> is an absorbing listen front to back, but lacks the iconoclasm of <i>Up the Bracket</i> and 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4771-the-libertines/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled</a> record. Still, it's rich with mood and gorgeous melodies, and a pervasive doomy streak. The record's two love songs that don't concern Pete'n'Carl are both PSAs about the danger of believing in eternity: ""Iceman"" showcases their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a>-y knack for storytelling in an acoustic yarn about a figure best avoided; ""Dead for Love"" is affecting noir cabaret that warns that death is the only true forever.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Given how easy it is to hate what the Libertines became, it's strange how endearing they remain, how magnetic </span><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Barât and Doherty's</span> deep, despairing love. And how successful: The music that the two frontmen made apart was often disappointing—Barât’s knees-up theatrics (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bydUclq5aU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""je regrette, je regrette that I haven’t had you yet""</a>) more than Doherty’s occasionally lovely work alone and with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/618-babyshambles/"" target=""_blank"">Babyshambles</a>. Yet their enduring facility together—as much as their third record swears off such cosmic promise—is almost, just almost, enough to make you believe in soulmates.</span></p></div>"|20881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20881-anthems-for-doomed-youth/|7.7|Laura Snapes

The trio had invested more time and money into their 1998 album <i>Challenge for a Civilized Society</i> than they had any other, and they’d never been more disappointed by the returns. Trading the unrelenting roar of its predecessors for hit-or-miss studio experimentation, the album alienated longtime fans and halted any career momentum the group had gained from their 1996 near-breakthrough <i>Repetition</i>.

Instead of disbanding, though, they pushed on a little longer, holding out against mounting personal troubles and growing geographic and emotional separation long enough to muster a magnificent final statement, 2001’s <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i>, a hauntingly beautiful double album that upended every preconceived notion about the band.<br/> <br/> <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i>, out of print on vinyl for over a decade, is <i>Empire</i>’s main event, the career high this entire box set series has been leading up to.

Even though they don’t cohere, the songs reveal a range the band’s previous albums had never hinted at. The opening throes of the nine-minute ""Side Effects of Being Tired"" are scribbled with gnarly free-jazz saxophone.

The similarly sprawling ""Terminus"" begins as a statement of defiance before succumbing mid-song to an orchestra of despair, led by a spectral cello that seems to sweep in and out of the studio walls. The whole record exists in a permanent November, condemned to those waning days of fall when all the color has been drained from the skyline, and all that’s left are barren trees and an isolating chill. <br/> <br/> Yet for all its melancholy, <i>Leaves</i> is also an album of uncanny splendor. Opener ""We Invent You"" follows a full two minutes of cautionary drone—the band’s way, perhaps, of weeding out old-guard fans unwilling to take the album on its own terms—with an outpouring of mammoth, multi-tracked psychedelia.

The band’s last full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17551-almanac/""><i>Almanac</i></a>, showcased a lively, psychedelic strain of '70s rock'n'roll, and their following EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18688-widowspeak-the-swamps/""><i>The</i> <i>Swamps</i></a>,<i> </i>was a bluesy, banjo-plucked ode to the Southeast. But Widowspeak's third record, <i>All Yours,</i> seems to strip away the group's hyper-referential past sound to something more sparse. <i>All Yours</i> is committed to a sunbaked, blissed-out pop rock sensibility that is noticeably lighter than their previous work. There’s no big concept here or specific inspiration behind it other than making something that sounds pretty and easy to listen to. And where there first two records were dark and haunted, filled with Morricone-style guitars, <i>All Yours</i> is all lightly shaken maracas, dreamy acoustic melodies, and getting so stoned the world feels like velvet.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to say this record is all feel-good music to string daisy chains together. Singer <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2015/07/widowspeak-all-yours-new-album-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Molly Hamilton has said</a> that for <i>All Yours</i> the band wanted to focus for the first time more on ""writing songs about what we’re thinking,"" and you can hear that in the lyrics. From blaming the stars on ""Cosmically Aligned"", to being too young on ""Girls"", to not being able to read the lines in a palm well enough to know on ""My Baby’s Gonna Carry On"", the band runs vaguely through all the reasons why love can go to the wayside. The rollicking ""Dead Love (So Still)"" is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a> wannabe, its jangly guitar almost masking the record’s most devastating inquiry. ""Dead love, you’re so still,"" Hamilton sings. ""Are you just sleeping in?""</p>
<p>There’s a sort of rolling movement to every track on <i>All Yours</i>, partly owed to Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas’ steady and unfussy guitar work but mostly to their songwriting, which lays heavy on fleeing scenes. It's a road trip album, less for the heartbroken crowd and more for the heartbreakers (and every runaway and hitchhiker ditching a promise.) ""You know that I’m always worried that I can never pay my debt,"" Earl Thomas sings for the first time on ""Borrowed World"". ""Always feel like I’m running and they haven’t caught me yet.""</p>
<p>Though it’s clear the band is refining their songwriting and getting more personal in the process, the record feels wilted instrumentally compared to their previous releases. <i>All Yours</i> has its gorgeous moments, but when you hear the band’s older tracks like <i>Almanac</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6ZcAy9xazA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Dark Age""</a> or <i>The Swamps</i>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ygPh97VVs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smoke and Mirrors""</a>, you have to wonder where that fiery spark went.

Not all of them were good, but many—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23483-the-wailers/"">the Wailers</a> from the Pacific Northwest, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Explosion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Music Explosion</a> from Ohio, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23495-the-barbarians/"">the Barbarians</a> from Mass., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chocolate_Watchband"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Chocolate Watchband</a> from Calif.—were doing interesting enough work to merit a larger amount of exposure than they received. Some of these groups ultimately enjoyed a latter-day career re-examination due to compilation releases like the seminal <i>Nuggets</i>, but most, like the Kitchen Cinq, a psychedelic rock group hailing from Amarillo, Texas, have been lost to history. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The Kitchen Cinq released just one full album, <i>Everything but…the Kitchen Cinq</i>, in 1967 and a fistful of singles for LFI and its distribution partner Decca before ultimately calling it a day in 1968. Assembled by <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>, this anthology of their work is like a survey of popular '60s rock and pop sounds. You can hear jangly traces of the Byrds on ""If You Think…"", the exquisite vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys on ""Still in Love With You"", the abrasive fuzzed out tones of the Yardbirds on ""Solitary Man"", the then-fashionable Eastern sounds on ""Dying Daffodil Incident"", and then there’s of course the near-obligatory cover of the Them garage rock anthem ""Gloria"". There’s even a dynamic, pushed-to-the-brink take on the Beatles’ ""Run for Your Life"". Heard without any background or context, it’d be difficult to tell whether the band was on the cutting edge or merely chasing trends, but they certainly had a keen ear for what was happening in the world around them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The real strength of the Kitchen Cinq as a group lies not in songwriting but rather in the way they arrange and perform the music. Their voices intertwine and harmonize in a way that adds real weight to the chorus section of the songs, and those harmony parts, deployed to their fullest effect on ""Figareux Figareux"" and ""You’ll Be Sorry Someday"", distinguish the group’s general sound from any number of other '60s pop and rock bands. And while Mark Creamer is no Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page, his guitar work had style—the solos on ""Need All the Help I Can Get"" and ""Searchin’"" are particularly thrilling.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s easy to dismiss collections like this one as nicely packaged cash-grabs marketed to the musically curious in search for an obscure outfit to champion, but the Kitchen Cinq are one of those rare acts like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixto_Rodriguez"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sixto Rodriguez</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8974-the-sonics/"">the Sonics</a> who merit another look. Maybe they didn’t catch the breaks they needed when they needed them, maybe their label dropped the ball or didn’t push them hard enough to the tastemakers, or maybe, as band member Jim Parker has suggested, the scene in L.A. simply chewed them up and spit them out. The music on <i>When the Rainbow Disappears</i> deserves another chance to be heard.</p></div>"|20992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20992-when-the-rainbow-disappears-an-anthology-1965-68/|7.6|Corbin Reiff

Such is the lot of the vibraphone, that of a supporting instrument regularly submerged by voices, guitars, strings, horns, and drums. The career of Japanese vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita seems, at times, to represent a rebuke to this notion. While collaborative releases with German experimentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2182-jan-jelinek/"">Jan Jelinek</a> and from his <a href=""http://masayoshifujita.com/elfog/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">El Fog</a> solo project filtered his lithe performance through a sieve of effects, the two albums Fujita has issued under his own name—2013’s <i>Stories</i> and 2015’s <i>Apologues</i>—promote a soaring classical purity, as though by rejecting electronic interference, he’s learning how to stay out of his own way.</p>
<p>By turns jaunty, shrill, and subdued, <i>Stories</i> found cellist Arturo Martínez Steele and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> violinist Hoshiko Yamane accompanying Fujita. The pair return for <i>Apologues</i>, joined by accordion player Motomitsu Maehara, snare drummer Masaya Hijikata, French horn player Tomonobu Odai, clarinetist Yoko Ozawa, and flautist Mio Suzuki. The collaborators’ massed whorls—tender, nuanced—act as painterly, accommodating foils or accents to Fujita’s playing, which invariably conveys a startled, improvisatory sense of wonder.</p>
<p>Awe and sorrow wash through opener ""Tears of Unicorn"" in equal, alternating measure, as strings saw-circle a series of melodic constellations so impeccably gorgeous that they ache; blink and you’ll miss the fleeting quote of ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"". As Fujita metes out tight, teasing trills on ""Moonlight"", strings yawn as woodwinds pipe along in harmony. ""Puppet’s Strange Dream Circus Band"" and ""Flag"" introduce perceptible jolts of urgency, with the former favoring a courtly, in-the-round gait and the latter’s sleeting tones and orchestral sweep midwifing a thrilling friction. An outlier, ""Beautiful Shimmer"" swaddles a spare Fujita motif in waves of reverb.</p>
<p>A pristine dream magic seems to inform <i>Apologues</i>—the fluid serenity of the music projects a lulling, murmured unreality that suggests that the album is a figment of the listener’s imagination even while it is in play. It’s not whimsy exactly, but an anesthetizing innocence primed for comfort and nostalgia alike—savvier, music-box sweetness summoned into being by a vibraphonist.</p></div>"|20931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20931-apologues/|8.2|Raymond Cummings

The free 23-track album, written and recorded outside the governance of Cyrus' label and co-produced in large part by Wayne Coyne and other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a> members, appeared on Sunday accompanied by a <i>New York Times</i> <a href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/the-long-winding-interview-with-miley-cyrus/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> where Cyrus detailed its making. In it, she recalls being told by her team that the album was too long. She proceeded to add ""Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz"", as an impetuous reminder that Cyrus plays by no one’s rules but her own. That pretty much says it all: <i>Dead Petz</i> is the definition of a vanity project, an indulgent collection of experiments that exist for no other reason than because they can.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It would be hard to imagine Cyrus and Coyne’s talents combining to worse results: there’s nothing here as pleasant as her appearances on the Flaming Lips’ <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19862-the-flaming-lips-with-a-little-help-from-my-fwends/"">cover album</a> last year, nor are these collaborations audacious enough to fail in exciting ways. Mostly they are tossed-off<i> Diet Yoshimi </i>detritus, the kind of music these guys can fart out in their sleep. There are bright spots, many of them via former mentor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a>’s handful of productions. But on the whole <i>Dead Petz</i> is a borderline unlistenable slog through dorm-room poncho bullshit and blissfully ignorant acid koans (""Can’t you see, all the clouds are dying?""), delivered earnestly from an ex-child star seemingly unaware of how fundamentally inseparable her own privilege is from her ""do whatever the fuck you want all of the time"" ethos, and enabled by a 54 year old who should know better.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Take ""Dooo It!"", the album's single of sorts. There's a lot going on in the track—weed, flying saucers, queries about the origins of the moon—but the part I keep coming back to is Cyrus proclaiming, ""Peace, motherfuckerz! Do it!"" Far be it for me to dash the idealistic, psilocybin-fueled dreams of a 22-year-old multi-millionaire whose emancipatory phase has swerved from ratchet-lite twerk ambassador to proudly pansexual LGBTQ advocate and Wayne Coyne bestie: she’s figuring it out, as 22-year olds do, though rarely from such a precipitous platform. But still: ""Do it!"" As if it were just <i>that</i> simple. </span></p>
<p>But that’s why having an editor is important, and why ""No parents! No rules!"" is almost always better as a slogan than as a creative mode. ""Self-control is not something I am working on,"" Cyrus trills on Mike WiLL cut ""Slab of Butter (Scorpion)"", and while she seems to be having a blast, we are left with the utterly pointless witch-house skid mark ""Fuckin Fucked Up"" (not to be confused with ""I’m So Drunk""), and ""BB Talk"", a rambling monologue that wastes one of the album’s few salvageable hooks. ""1 Sun""  namedrops <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2207-grace-jones/"">Grace Jones</a> alongside tuneless invocations to ""Wake up, world! Can’t you see the earth is crying?"" There is a twee piano ballad about a dead blowfish friend, who her human friends eat at sushi dinner. The circle of life, man. (She fake-cries at the end.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Presumably, Cyrus will look back on all this and laugh, having learned something about herself and about making art, and move on, as she seems to have done with 2013’s <i>Bangerz</i>. And there are moments of promise here—most often, when Coyne backs off a bit. She’s much better at love songs than drug songs. ""Space Boots"" streamlines the album’s cosmic vibes into an electro pulse somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5245-kavinsky/"">Kavinsky</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"">Rilo Kiley</a>, with sweet, direct lyrics that pierce through the fog of bullshit: ""I get so high cause you’re not here smokin’ my weed/ And I get so bored/ Cause you’re not here to make me laugh."" Best of all is ""Lighter"", a stunning, '80s-nodding Mike WiLL ballad that poignantly redeems the general ""whoa, dude"" vibes: ""We never get to see ourselves sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love,"" she sings. It’s genuinely moving.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Cyrus returns to idealized depictions of sleep and dreams often here, and given how hyper-regimented most of her life must have been, her attraction to relinquishing control to drugs or the subconscious makes sense. But for all the Instagram nudes and real talk about gender and sexuality in the press, very little of </span><i>Dead Petz</i><span> reveals much about Cyrus beyond the bacchanalia and non-sequiturs. </span>I can’t shake the sense that <i>Dead Petz</i> exists more as a glorified VMA party favor than as a work that can stand on its own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Speaking of: the biggest irony of Cyrus’ clash with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a> is that if Cyrus were to pay closer attention, she might recognize Minaj as a trailblazer for the career path she's trying to take—a massively famous woman who does things the ""wrong"" way, pisses a lot of people off in the process, and refuses to give a fuck. As far as surrealist pop albums this decade, it doesn’t get much ballsier than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16471-pink-friday-roman-reloaded/""><i>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</i></a>. But the stakes there were huge, and there is literally nothing at stake for Cyrus here. In a way, <i>Dead Petz</i> is a fascinating milemarker of pop music in the post-album, post-Internet era: a major pop album that lands with a splash, then sinks like a brick, as ephemeral as the Tumblr culture Cyrus draws from. Maybe that’s the most visionary aspect of <i>Dead Petz</i>: it feels like it was built to disintegrate.</p></div>"|21023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21023-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz/|3.0|Meaghan Garvey

Where his first record was acoustic and much of it was recorded live in a room, his music since has mostly consisted of him singing over loops, constructing songs from other songs. The fact that the backing tracks mostly consist of processed samples gives Lennox a wide palette to work with, and he’s able to keep his music varied by how he approaches texture and arrangement. He’s also <i>good</i> at making music in this format, no question. But there are limitations to the approach, in terms of dynamics and song structure—the amount of empty space and variations in terms of volume are kept to a minimum, and when Lennox’s melodies are less engaging, his songs tend to bleed together.</p>
<p>Melody was decidedly <i>not</i> a problem on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20079-panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper/""><i>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</i></a>—in fact, it was the most tuneful Panda Bear album, filled with songs that felt familiar because they sounded like classics that somehow also managed to be surprising. But the <i>Crosswords</i> EP, consisting of one song from <i>Grim Reaper</i> remixed, an updated version of a bonus track from 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15299-tomboy/""><i>Tomboy</i></a>, and three songs from the <i>Grim Reaper</i> sessions that didn’t make the cut, isn’t up to the same standard. It’s reasonably pretty and it’s always welcome to hear new material in this style, but songs like ""No Man’s Land"" and ""Jabberwocky"" don’t stand out in a catalog that is by now pretty extensive; there’s never a moment where you stop breathing for a second to zero in on the way Lennox skips up an interval, no tunes that won’t leave your head. These are solid and enjoyable tracks in Panda Bear’s style, and hearing them here, untethered from an album that has more of an arc, they never become much more than that.</p>
<p>When working as Panda Bear, Lennox essentially makes comfort-food music, songs that come off as gentle and created with care that bring warm feelings, so it feels wrong to use the word ""comfortable"" in a pejorative sense when discussing his work. But the five songs on the <i>Crosswords</i> EP sound like tracks that come easily to him, songs he knows how to make without stretching himself. The most distinctive is the closer ""Cosplay"" whose lyrics, oddly enough, mostly consist of Lennox singing variations of ""Marijuana makes my day."" Live versions of it floated around last year, and it’s been stripped of some of its initial samples but still retains an appealing bubbly texture. Even though the words are goofy and obvious (has any Panda Bear fan ever thought otherwise?), it’s the one place where the album stops being good background music and makes you take notice.</p></div>"|20991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20991-crosswords-ep/|7.1|Mark Richardson

Lead singers Macie Stewart has toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> and Liam Kazar with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32512-tweedy/"">Tweedy</a>, and both were members of the now defunct hip-hop group Kids These Days. Still, even with their city’s cred behind them, Marrow is very much a blank slate. </p>
<p><i>The Gold Standard</i> doesn’t feel like a cohesive debut statement by any means. You get the sense the band was trying to display range, settling for writing an album filled with certain types of songs rather than a unified collective vision. They can do classic rock on ""She Chose You"", they’re <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28007-edward-sharpe/"">Edward Sharpe</a>-leaning faux-folk on ""Ocean of Glory"", and then spinning apocalyptic, Hozier-sounding ballads with songs like ""Cities"" and ""Leave Grounds Stay"".</p>
<p>Marrow tout themselves as being schooled in jazz and classical, and it’s something you can hear consistently in how they compose their songs. The group likes using a diverse smattering of instrumentals, from horn arrangements to classical piano to violins and harp. It’s like they made a list of what sounds they wanted on the record and then ordered them up like a diner’s Hungry Man Special, though it doesn’t feel like overkill. </p>
<p>There’s an authentic-sounding tinkering, improvisational quality that emanates throughout <i>The Gold Standard</i>’s instrumentals; music boxes break down on ""Darling Divine"", cowbells ring and guiros scratch at the tail end of the ""Mother of Maladies"", a xylophone dings under an electric guitar solo on ""Quarter to Three"". Though, this improv quality becomes their downfall when it sounds like they got stuck in a groove and couldn’t get out. ""Corsicana"" plays like a completely anonymous and derivative piano ballad and the nearly six-minute ""The Gold Standard"" is severely tedious, coming off like a somber pre-performance guitar tuning with slow percussion before erupting into repetitive, roaring guitar solos.</p>
<p>Still, there are diamonds here. The album’s lead single ""Paulson"" is a furious, head-banging, shred-heavy rock song with Stewart’s voice like a bolt of lightning; you can practically see the spotlight on her. The charming ""Mother of Maladies"", carried by a peppy organ melody, is sweet, waltzing in a sort of theatrical romance as Stewart sings of how love feels. ""Every night I am with you, I feel it/ Every night’s not every night enough,"" she sings. And as ho-dunk as ""Ocean of Glory"" might be (""You could make love to me when I’m older/ You’re a bootstrap, I’ll pull you closer,"" Stewart and Kazar sing), at the five-minute mark the song feels like opening a trap door and finding a party as it wigs out into frantic psychedelia.</p>
<p>You wonder why they didn’t make a whole new song; then again, letting a saccharine, cult-evoking sing-along dissolve into a shrilly-sung wacky trip isn’t an entirely bad move either. Still, on the whole,<i> The Gold Standard</i> feels like Marrow are in the midst of trying to define their sound, throwing things at the wall and seeing what will stick. They're a band that can build a great three-minute song, but they lose themselves in the construction of anything bigger.</p></div>"|20973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20973-the-gold-standard/|6.0|Hazel Cills

The line raises a lot of questions. Given the context, wouldn't it, in fact, be <i>Kent</i>'s podiatrist that this was shitty for? Would he go to the podiatrist immediately after administering the ass kicking? Is he going to the podiatrist as a <i>result</i> of the ass kicking? Is he barefoot? Can't he just take a shower?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yes, this is devoting a little too much thought to a throwaway bar, but it illustrates the most frustrating issue with <i>Anesthesia</i>, Kent's seventh solo record (not counting an excellent 2013 <a href=""https://apollobrown360.bandcamp.com/album/ugly-heroes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaboration</a> with Red Pill and Apollo Brown as Ugly Heroes). His rhymes are lean, his delivery is hungry, and he has excellent taste in collaborators<span>—</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"">Freddie Gibbs</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torae"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Torae</a>, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/redpillrap"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Pill</a> all show up here—and producers. He has a knack for lining up consonant syllables and rattling them off in a staccato morse-code delivery that renders every line tense and jagged. But for the most part, <i>Anesthesia</i> is a thicket of non sequiturs, a ""Family Guy"" pile-up of unrelated images and decontextualized half-puns, free of any organizing structure that might lend them impact or meaning.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Absurdism in hip-hop has its place<span>—</span>in the late '90s, Kool Keith and Ghostface were masters of it, as was Cam'ron circa <i>Purple Haze</i>. The difference is that they were </span><i>also</i><span> expert world-builders, so even their stranger asides felt like they were obeying a certain internal logic. Kent's verses just feel like clumsy free-association: In the heavy-lidded ""Add Anesthesia"", which features sinister music-box production from Kaz 1, Kent says, ""One-hitter in the parking lot/ Anne Frank with the discreet smoking/ Hid her in the parking lot."" Later in the same song, he offers the even-more-baffling ""Huddle up and nurse from the nipple/ Suck on the same tit, so when effects ripple/ It's a simple thing to solve.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Traces of a stronger record turn up throughout </span><i>Anesthesia</i><span>, and when Kent manages to follow a train of thought from start to finish, everything suddenly clicks. On the breathless ""Suit Case Switch"", he trades motor-mouthed verses with Freddie Gibbs, running roughshod over Apollo Brown's beautifully woozy, '70s-soul-quoting production and nicely working a protracted heist metaphor. In the album's latter half, Kent briefly dabbles in autobiography, and the emotional grounding focuses him. In ""Notes"", he struggles with the news that he's about to become a father and, aside from a nonsensical digression about albacore tuna, it's poignant and striking. And on the soft, soulful ""Is This My Life"", Kent seems to be alluding to either substance abuse or the 2003 stabbing that almost took his life when he declares, ""Recovery's a myth/ Because you don't ever really return/ You just become a new version of the person you were/ And those of us that make it out a little wiser/ Instead of more bitter, get to shine a little brighter.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-edc21f8d-9491-a4fd-770d-f613240eea1e""><span>Those few flashes of earnestness and coherence suggest the album </span><i>Anesthesia</i><span> might have been. Its title, along with a few pointed, passing references to self-medication, imply that Kent had some desire to explore the ways people choose to numb themselves. But none of those ideas are ever fleshed out; instead, Kent keeps falling back on stuff like, ""Teach and grade my own masters' thesis/ Hot chili pepper temper, Flea pleading with Anthony Kiedis."" The line makes a kind of sense, inasmuch as both Flea and Anthony Kiedis are in a band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Otherwise, like so much of </span><i>Anesthesia</i><span>, it's about as resonant as a Wikipedia entry.</span></span></p></div>"|20932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20932-anesthesia/|6.0|J.

Clearly, Krol has a sense of humor about himself, and his position. </p>
<p>But his Merge debut isn't hangdog at all. It has a do-or-die desperation: The sound is scuzzy, but the energy is pure, bristling with the aim to be stronger and more memorable than the two that came before it. When Krol whines and shouts lines like ""you've been warned that I'm not fooling around,"" you believe him. The song that line comes from, by the way, is called ""Neighborhood Watch"", and it's sung to somebody who stole his bike. This is one of Krol's strongest suits; taking a small and seemingly silly premise, making it universal and hiding at least one line in each song that could be pulled from it to form a mission statement. ""The world can't stop me now,"" he sings in ""Cactuses"", a song about being mad at the pain that a cactus has caused him. </p>
<p>Krol recorded <i>Turkey</i> in just four days, co-producing with Elliott Kozel, who also plays piano and synth on the album. Engineer Beau Sorenson improves upon the sound of Krol's first two albums, without compromising any of the shambolic glory. Instruments are panned hard, handclaps occasionally emerge through thick fuzz and squalls of feedback, and at the center of it all is Krol's nasally voice, singing sweet melodies through a guitar amp and hitting effects pedals at just the right time. He sings with the uncontainable excitement of an underdog finally realizing his dreams, and the album courses with the adrenaline of newfound confidence. <br/><br/> It's hard to resist comparing Krol's voice to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/939-coachwhips/"" target=""_blank"">John</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Dwyer</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29648-king-tuff/"" target=""_blank"">King Tuff</a>, and Krol seems ready to dispel any accusations of bandwagon-jumping. ""I feel left out of every city and scene I belong to,"" he sings on a track that is unambiguously titled, ""Left Out (ATTN: SoCal Garage Rockers)"".<br/><br/>If<i> Turkey</i>  just misses greatness, it's because it's just too short. The whole thing is over in 18 minutes. This is the downside to spending only four days recording. And with the way that <i>Turkey</i> is sequenced, you can feel the slow deflation of the world-conquering drive. The album is front-loaded with biting rock that eventually devolves into ""Piano Shit"", a song which is just a <a href="" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx6gr_Ch9x8"" target=""_blank"">Dustin O'Halloran</a>-ish re-working of the previous track. (It's called ""Less Than Together"", and Krol's singing is less-than-in-tune on it.) The song ""Save the Date"", where Krol anticipates an invitation to the wedding of an ex, hints at deeper moods, but it, too, is over too quickly, a verse shy of poignance. You can hear Krol's asides to the engineer on <i>Turkey</i>, just as you can in his previous releases, and they hint at his gradually expanding ambition. His 2011 album, <i>I Hate Jazz</i>, ends with him simply asking, ""Did that sound even close?"" <i>Turkey</i> finds him zeroing in: ""Did that sound better?""</p></div>"|20944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20944-turkey/|7.4|Pat Healy

You listen to Destroyer to hear the smartest person at a party mutter funny and erudite things in your ear. Even by 2006, Bejar had generated a world deep and manifold enough that fans of his made, and passed around, a<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141020231051/http://i-rock.wackiness.org/bejaromatic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Dan Bejar lyric generator</a>. His mind, and the music he's made exploring its contours, is a minor zip code in independent rock music.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/""><i>Kaputt</i></a> from 2011 exposed that zip code a little bit, briefly subjecting Bejar to the indignities of mid-level festival-touring success. It was the most immediately beautiful record he'd ever made, but it also accidentally coincided with a rising interest in the soft rock of the 1970s and '80s, which meant that Bejar, long the wry bridge troll beneath the zeitgeist, momentarily represented it. The story is important to Bejar's career, but it feels like an ancillary concern to <i>Poison Season</i>, his new album. The point and pleasure of Destroyer's world, after all, is that it motors away on its own  juice, irrespective of others.  The world is a big place, his records seem to say, and it can be wearying and demanding, but your thoughts are a republic entirely within your control. As he memorably put it on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/"">Destroyer's </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/""><i>Rubies</i></a>' ""Painter in Your Pocket"": ""You looked OK with the others, you looked great on your own.""  </p>
<p><i>Poison Season</i> retains the sumptuous melancholy of <i>Kaputt</i>, leavening it with the elegant swoon of Nelson Riddle-era Frank Sinatra. There are string arrangements all over <i>Poison Season</i>, and they are gorgeously recorded: the orchestra on ""Girl in a Sling"" sounds like 180-gram vinyl even while in earbuds. Destroyer has always partly been a nostalgia project, even when Bejar's nostalgia was decidedly ersatz—his records aim to stir the <i>feelings</i> that classic recordings arouse in us. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14141-city-of-daughters-thief-streethawk-a-seduction/""><i>Streethawk</i></a> hearkened back to glam-rock Bowie even if the resemblance was off, and the magic of <i>Kaputt</i> was partly that of a peculiar and gnomic figure like Bejar conjuring the jaded romanticism of Bryan Ferry. On <i>Poison Season</i>, he visits a different section of his record collection, one that predates rock'n'roll, and he applies all the studied love and imagination to the endeavor we've come to expect from him.</p>
<p>Bejar uses his voice in new ways here, stretching words out generously on the two-part story-song ""Bangkok"" so that we feel the beauty of the melody but also don't miss the bumps and crags in his throat. There's a basic tenderness that communicates itself beneath the vermouth of his words, and they remain a joy to soak in, a purposeful blurring of sense and sound. Lines like ""The writing on the wall/ Wasn't writing at all"" or ""It sucks when there's nothing but gold in those hills"" resist interpretation and invite savoring—the Destroyer-lyric-generator couplet here would probably be ""The ass king's made of asses, the ice queen's made of snow,"" from ""Archer on the Beach"". But my favorite moment might be Bejar muttering ""aw shit, here comes the sun"" on ""Dream Lover"", the Bruce Springsteen-style rocker that, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9651-accidental-pop-a-conversation-with-destroyers-dan-bejar/"">he told Pitchfork</a>, he didn't even want to make. The juxtaposition—a curmudgeon swearing under his breath as the horns and drums he's arranged around him power the record up to transcendence—is, as he Bejar noted with some self-deprecation in that same interview, ""Destroyer 101."" </p>
<p>In fact, there are moments on <i>Poison Season</i> where Bejar's formidable mind threatens to drag the proceedings down a bit. The swooning '50s strings sometimes collides awkwardly with the '70s pop gestures—the funk bass line that peppers ""Midnight Meet the Rain"" mostly serves to underline the sleepiness of the album's last third. ""Hell"" lurches between ponderous chamber pop and a swinging beat, capturing the album's uncertainty about exactly what kind of dance it's doing. For an album that took an unusual amount of time for Bejar to make—the four years separating <i>Poison Season</i> from <i>Kaputt</i> represents his longest stretch ever—it feels tonally hesitant, jets of cold water and warmth doled out in furtive and uncontrolled doses. He has never made, and will probably never make, a <i>bad</i> album—he's far too accomplished, intuitive, and literate for that. But on <i>Poison Season</i>, you can occasionally detect the dismaying sound of indie rock's greatest intellect second-guessing itself.</p></div>"|20706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20706-poison-season/|7.6|Jayson Greene

This is how Johnny Blaze does nowadays—after kicking off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/""><i>8 Diagrams</i></a> with a promise to ""bring the sexy back like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland"">Timbaland</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake"">Timberlake</a>,"" he’s followed with countless other, similarly demoralizing punchlines that are at least a year past their spoilage date. Method Man has always been expected to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan"">Wu-Tang Clan</a>'s mainstream emissary, and his lyrics mirror their currently tangential relationship with relevancy.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t kill your vibe, look at the tracklisting of <i>The Meth Lab</i>: of the 19 tracks, only three are credited solely to Method Man. One is the intro, another is the outro, and the other is fittingly called ""2 Minutes of Your Time"". This actually works out quite well for the Method Man brand<span>—i</span>f hip-hop has completely passed him by, Method Man can always surround himself with rappers more out of step than himself.</p>
<p>Though it doesn’t advertise as such, <i>The Meth Lab</i> is a throwback to Wu-Tang’s mid-2000s wilderness period where the leading figures tried to establish independent fiefdoms outside of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza"">RZA</a>’s view<span>—</span>even if Hanz On, Eazy Get Rite, Mack Wilds, Chedda Bang, Dro Pesci, Kash Verazzano, and Hue Huf aren’t given the dignity of a crew name, <i>The Meth Lab</i> is a posse record in practice, very much in the lineage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4365-theodore-unit"">Theodore Unit</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8276-718/""><i>718</i></a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10627-polluted-water"">Polluted Water</a></i>, or the ultimate in Wu-Tang marginalia, <i>Ugodz-illa Presents the Hillside Scramblers</i>. Pity these dudes if you want<span>—</span>Method Man is still a household name.</p>
<p>Based on their handles alone, you can’t possibly imagine the aforementioned involved with pertinent rap music in 2015. Not that they want to anyway<span>—</span>beyond the likely deathless #hashtag and ""no [RAPPER OF INTEREST]"" kickers, <i>Meth Lab's</i> foot soldiers have a stylistic cut-off point around the most recent Method Man album, and that came out in 2006. They favor broadly-drawn street journalism and humorless punchlines, less derived from Method Man than the still-down-for-whatever Streetlife, who appears on over 1/3rd of <i>The Meth Lab. </i>The production complements the rapping<span>—</span>you likewise get Wu-Tang’s second tier (4th Disciple, Mathematics behind the boards, Killa Sin and Carlton Fisk on the mic), and the occasional ""oh that guy!"" from any number of ""bring New York back!"" waves. The biggest outside appearances come from Corey Gunz and Uncle Murda<span>—</span>both are technically major-label rappers, though it feels like a matter of time before Epic or one of the <i>four </i>imprints currently sharing Gunz <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4eCd6xUSik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fixes the glitch</a>. Likewise, you get a beat from Ron Browz, who no longer refers to himself as Etherboy. Seven tracks are helmed by Pascal Zumaque<span>—</span>the first thing that pops up in a Google search of his name is his <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=pascal+zumaque&amp;oq=pascal&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.1103j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oKUu1fO9KM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you know Meth’s steez</a>—Wu-Tang’s for the children, other rappers need to pull their pants up, hip-hop peaked when you could still hear Method Man songs on the radio. He’s basically turned into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5204-redman"">Redman</a> now<span>—</span>except when Redman stays making O.J. references in 2015, he’s at least staying in character as hip-hop’s favorite knucklehead uncle. Method Man just sounds like a guy who got set up with a <a href=""https://twitter.com/methodman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter account</a> and has no initiative to use it, making jokes to himself while watching TV. Sift through the verses for proper names and the likes of Michael Vick, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, and Rappin’ 4-Tay emerge. Yet, here’s the one that I find most fascinating<span>—""</span>I’m here to analyze your shooter like I’m <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kenny Smith</a>."" Just think about that one for a second<span>—</span>what exactly is Method Man trying to express here? I know what he means, but it also makes no goddamn sense. This is undeniably the result of Method Man’s mind drifting while watching ""Inside the NBA"" and as far as rapper/actors clowning on the Jet, he now ranks below Shaquille O’Neal.</p>
<p>To Meth’s credit, he hasn’t fallen the fuck off as hard as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10020-inspectah-deck/"">Inspectah Deck</a>, who shows up on ""The Purple Tape"", a highlight by default because it also features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon"">Raekwon</a><span>—</span>the one guy left in Wu-Tang Clan who really hasn't fallen off at all. His <i>F.I.L.A.</i> record from earlier this year didn’t leave much of a mark either, but the appearances of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky"">A$AP Rocky</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a> didn't feel like desperate grasps at Hot 97 airplay; those guys likely showed up on their own volition, an acknowledgement that Rae’s style has aged well because rapping in code about selling drugs and fly gear has never gone out of style in hip-hop and never will. All you can really do with <i>The Meth Lab </i>is contemplate its reason for existence<span>—</span> if anything, the fact that it's being released on Tommy Boy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQekXk7CYo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">might get a chuckle out of GZA</a>... provided you can get a chuckle out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1812-gza"">GZA</a>. But if you make it to the end, you find out that this is actually a prelude to Method Man’s<i> real</i> solo album. Which will be called <i>Crystal Meth</i>. So really, we’re right back where we started.</p></div>"|21000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21000-the-meth-lab/|4.0|Ian Cohen

Katie Crutchfield had just released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/""><i>Cerulean Salt</i></a>, her breakthrough second album as <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"">Waxahatchee</a>. Northampton's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"">Speedy Ortiz</a> would soon release their debut, as would Wales' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31621-joanna-gruesome/"">Joanna Gruesome</a>, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31640-courtney-barnett/"">Courtney Barnett</a> first broke beyond Australia that August. All received some degree of international mainstream acclaim; the plainspoken, fuzzed-up frontwoman was being widely celebrated for the honesty that would likely have been dismissed as <i>typical confessional singer-songwriter chick</i> fare a decade, or even half a decade, earlier. While the links to forebears like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a> were clear, their simply stated, often brutal honesty felt somehow new.</p>
<p>Two years later, as All Dogs finally release their debut album, its 40 minutes of grungy intimacy feel, in a sense, relatively commonplace, though that's good. Praising young female lyricists for the simple candor with which they confess complex emotional devastation as if they didn't expect to be heard is a trope by now, but the growing audience and respect for a woman's internal life should be relished. And even if <i>Kicking Every Day</i> firmly inhabits a sound and type, that doesn't mean that it has nothing new to offer. The female trainwreck is having a pop cultural moment on the big and small screen, but all too often these figures are reduced to their perceived or self-professed limitations. Jones (who is also a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31770-saintseneca/"">Saintseneca</a> and plays solo as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32720-yowler/"">Yowler</a>) deals with the constant mutability of experience, refusing to let a single interpretation of an event define her. It's appropriate to an age where everyone is the editor of their own life, when self-love and self-loathing go hand-in-hand online.</p>
<p>Back on ""Love Song"", from that debut 2013 tape (a split with fellow Columbus band Slouch), Jones warned a potential partner not to give her a chance because, she admitted, she'd only fuck it up, ""just wait and see."" Across <i>Kicking</i>, she confesses to being driven by anxiety and self-loathing, maintaining on ""Skin"" that ""every darkness I push through/ There is a quiet familiar feeling/ And in it I am always waiting for everything to fall/ Just like I always make it so."" ""That Kind of Girl"" starts with her mid-sentence, aware that she's as destructive a force in someone else's life as she always imagines herself to be. But the minute some unknown third party warns her lover off ""messing with that kind of girl,"" she starts burning with rage, demanding transparency and explanation over a fiery squall and bass that drones and sparks like an anchor towed down a gravel road. On paper, Jones' lyrics can scan a little sad-sack; on record, she delivers them with the joyous belligerence that befits a band who often sound like early 2000s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a>, all mid-fi production, hectic drums, and fuzzy power chords hewing euphoric hooks. They play arena-sized in basement studios, their reach infectious.</p>
<p>Jones spends much of <i>Kicking</i> bristling against her own limitations as well, aware of the way her self-defeating impulses play into depression's toxic loop. ""I will find a way to justify my pain,"" she sings on ""Skin"", and asks any friend that finds her on the floor to check if she's alright, but not to tell her otherwise on ""Sunday Morning"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4936-the-lemonheads/"">Lemonheads</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3981-the-sundays/"">Sundays</a>-y bundle where she's caught adrift in the routine-less routine of touring. ""How Long"" is a triumphant-sounding portrait of self-loathing where she gives the Joan Didion edict about staying on good terms with your past selves a nightmarish inversion: ""All these people that I've been hold knives."" Her lacerating lyrics offer the potential for deadening recognition, but also empathy. ""Your Mistakes"" has a softer touch, as if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a> had started releasing records as a drunk 19 year old in a garage, and offers a friend comfort for the way that enduring regrets tend to obliterate the mind. Jones makes shame corporeal and emptiness vast, giving these songs gut-punching impact beyond the lingering melodies.</p>
<p><i>split tape w/slouch</i> and November 2013's <i>7”</i> both saw All Dogs moving at breakneck speed, stretching out power-pop with fiery yearning. Towards the end of <i>Kicking</i> especially, things take a calmer, darker, turn, the drums often fading away. The stillness suits them. Standout ""Leading Me Back to You"" has the tainted romance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football/"">American Football</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2777-mineral/"">Mineral</a>; before the defiant chorus kicks in, ""Skin"" could be a relic from 1990s Louisville, and the warm hiss of ""The Garden"" suggests that it's Jones' original demo. It's a softly strummed plea for someone to hold tight, because parts of her are going to disappear by the time she returns from some sojourn—not through collapsing in on herself as in opener ""Black Hole"", but by heeding the warning she set out in the careening ""Flowers"": that you'll never find satisfaction ""if all that you grow are gardens of longing for things you don't know."" <i>Kicking Every Day</i> spends a lot of time trawling the murk, but recognizes that, ultimately, it's down to the individual to dig herself out; it's a warm thump of encouragement from an equally grubby hand.</p></div>"|20961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20961-kicking-every-day/|7.6|Laura Snapes

They’ve performed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2286-david-kilgour/"">David Kilgour</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a>’s backing band, and they instantly and seamlessly fit into the legacy Kilgour helped establish; their debut album, <i>Metalmania</i>, feels less like an homage to New Zealand’s 1980s underground and more like a lost release from that time period ready to be unearthed by the record collectors of the future.</p>
<p>When <i>Metalmania</i> is good, it's nearly transcendent, as much as a pop album can be. The melodic kick in the last minute of opener ""Here's No Use"" is as bracing as sunlight slanting through dust-motes on a beautiful day, and ""Dream Date"", the album's first single, is driving, energetic, and charming. Later single ""No Taste Bomber"" is perfectly noisy, just so slightly psychedelic, one of those songs it’s impossible not to nod your head to on first listen (and it only gets further under one’s skin the more one listens). ""I’m a Mountain"" is crafted so tautly that the chanted lyric ""I won’t let you fuck it up"" takes on new dimensions with each repetition. ""Hit Her and Run"" takes a while to build: though it feels like initially it might grow into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a>-like California country song, it turns on its heel into a thick wall of distortion.</p>
<p>What <i>Metalmania</i> is slightly short on is the underlying grit present in much of the work of Salad Boys' forebears, one of the elements that kept even the poppiest of the Flying Nun bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/616-the-bats/"">the Bats</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5411-the-chills/"">the Chills</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Tasmans"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Able Tasmans</a>) from sounding too cloying. Existential sadness haunts so much of New Zealand’s indie pop but there are three or four tracks on <i>Metalmania</i> that feel like dreamy filler, tracks so airy that they never quite make the emotional impact they could or should. There isn’t quite enough dissonance to them, not enough low end, not enough movement, not enough curiosity. Having similar tempos and chord structures, these filler songs bleed into one another; their grounding is too stable, too comfortable.</p>
<p>Since the memorable tracks on <i>Metalmania</i> are <i>so</i> good, the tracks that don’t quite rise to the occasion feel all the more frustrating. Yes, this is a debut album for a relatively young band (they’ve been around less than three years), and to hold Salad Boys to such a standard might feel a little unfair, but they’ve proven themselves capable of holding their own with the best indie pop their country has to offer. The fact that they’ve set the bar so high for themselves is, in the end, a testament to how exquisite their songwriting at its best can be.  </p></div>"|20877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20877-metalmania/|6.8|Jes Skolnik

Along the way, they've crafted beats for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"">Childish Gambino</a> on <i>Because the Internet</i>’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/christianrich/childish-gambino-crawl-christian-rich-re-work"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crawl""</a>, and for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>, on <i>Born Sinner</i>’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/christianrich/j-cole-sparks-will-fly-feat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sparks Will Fly""</a>; in 2013, Christian Rich landed four tracks on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>’s breakout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18380-earl-sweatshirt-doris/""><i>Doris</i></a>, and most recently, the duo composed <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/christianrich"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Señorita""</a>, the menacing lead single from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Vince+Staples"">Vince Staples</a>’ exceptional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20719-summertime-06/""><i>Summertime '06</i></a>. On the surface, their production work hasn't been particularly groundbreaking, and their debut album, <i>FW14</i>, doesn’t make an immediate impact. But midway through the record, near the end of the <a href=""http://iamjmsn.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JMSN</a>-featured ""Fast Life"", a bright flurry of drums move <i>FW14</i> from mostly contemporary fare to an international sound closer to their Nigerian roots. It's another subtle shift for a group that's built a strong career on understated creative turns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album is loosely conceptual, with references to traveling through space and time and a premise derived from sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick’s <i>VALIS</i> trilogy and <i>We Can Remember It For You Wholesale</i>, and director Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film, <i>Interstellar</i>. Musically, <i>FW14</i> brings to mind <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/"">The Love Below</a>, </i>the André 3000-led second disc of OutKast's award-winning LP. The pace and influences are similar, and both albums take their time reaching their destination. It drifts comfortably through the cosmos, and a song like ""FACE"" benefits from a wafting ambience.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album thrives on a technical prowess that grows more refined over its length. <i>FW14</i> features several collaborators whose names might be more recognizable than the group's, even if they've spent several years crafting hits for Top 40 radio talent. But on <i>FW14</i>, and working with Vince Staples and singers Jack Davey and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Niia"">Niia</a>, the group chops their vocals and re-filters them through the arrangements, keeping the producers at the forefront. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music centers on glossy EDM grooves while mixing in jazz, global dance, and '70s funk. Thematically, <i>FW14</i> feels like a romantic jaunt through the universe, following the ups and downs of a couple with common relationship struggles. Through songs like ""Real Love""—a nostalgic R&amp;B number featuring vocalist Angela McCluskey—and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19325-goldlink-the-god-complex/"">GoldLink</a>-assisted ""Compromise"", there’s a prevailing intimacy in the album’s second half. The aforementioned ""FACE"" delves into unconditional commitment: ""Let’s go half in life,"" goes a line from the track. ""I don’t need so many things to myself."" <i>FW14 </i>has a gentle touch that grows more intoxicating with each listen, an album that moves calmly without much commotion, gradually taking shape.</p></div>"|20874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20874-christian-rich-fw14/|7.5|Marcus J.

Not that the song's success was unpredictable. Co-written by Max Martin, ""Can't Feel My Face"" replaced direct references to Tesfaye's favorite things (cocaine and sex) with PG-13 allusions—a Weeknd song that's fun for the whole family.  It was also the catchiest song of his entire career. </p>
<p>Tesfaye's pivot from cult lothario to pop star began last year with a guest verse on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qU7p7yOY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Me Harder""</a>. Tesfaye scrapped what writers provided him with and tried his hand at something radio-friendly, and the result was his most likeable verse since the hallowed days of the <a href=""%20The%20Weeknd%20Trilogy%20by%20Ian%20Cohen""><i>Trilogy</i></a>. Then there was ""Earned It"", the theme song for <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> which introduced him to a whole new audience and put his angelic voice over orchestral pomp—a formula that proved hard to resist, even if the song was kind of icky.</p>
<p>With that momentum behind him, <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i> sees Tesfaye hell-bent on stardom, shedding the fat from his disappointing major label debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18458-the-weeknd-kiss-land/""><i>Kiss Land</i></a>. But instead of going the ""Can't Feel My Face"" route, opening up his sound and softening its edges, he returns to what made him great in the first place. Everything we know about the Weeknd is here: the dark, mysterious production where contemporary R&amp;B rubs elbows with post-punk and shoegaze (Tesfaye's OG producer, Illangelo, is everywhere on it); the lascivious lyrics that swing between menacing and laughable; and, most of all, Tesfaye's sinuous vocal melodies. Developed from a childhood spent listening to Ethiopian music, his labyrinthine hooks and ad-libs are more indelible than ever.</p>
<p>The album plays like a victory lap, with Tesfaye revisiting past glories and embellishing them. ""The Hills"", with its disaffected croak and horror-movie screams, sounds like a song from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/""><i>Thursday</i></a> mixtape on a Hollywood budget. ""Tell Your Friends"" is like ""The Morning"" produced by <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>. ""Shameless"" is ""Wicked Games"" from a more knowing perspective, while ""Angel"" wraps the Weeknd's most epic moments—think ""Heaven or Las Vegas""—in a glossy adult-contemporary framework that could house a Celine Dion song (and written with one of her collaborators, Stephen Moccio). And then there's ""In the Night"", a MJ-esque disco stomper and guaranteed hit single that sounds like nothing he's done before.</p>
<p>In moments like this, when Tesfaye harnesses his gift, the results are impossible to argue with. But he's still a victim of his own flawed persona. Tesfaye repeats the tired tropes he's been squeezing the life out of since the beginning (take a shot for every time he offers a variation on ""love is pointless""). ""Acquainted"" and the mind-numbingly boring Ed Sheeran collaboration ""Dark Times"" feel like they were written with Mad Libs, and elsewhere, Tesfaye's cruelly misogynist perspective remains jarring and uncomfortable. Sometimes he's underhanded, like on ""As You Are"", which is one long neg disguised as a tender love song, and other times it's skin-crawlingly direct. Thankfully, he has toned it down somewhat —we're miles away from that time he killed a woman in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxilwT1sKSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music video</a> and let the camera pan over her bloodied body.</p>
<p>In the end, enjoying the Weeknd requires a certain suspension of disbelief, and that remains true on <i>Beauty Behind the Madness. </i>You really have to buy into his bad-guy persona, and after four years of this stuff, you might roll your eyes at a chorus like ""I only call you when it's half past five""—<i>we get it</i>. But for newcomers, there's a whole world to explore, and on <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i> it's richer and smarter than ever.</p>
<p>It helps that the self-awareness he's flashed in his interviews has begun creeping slowly into his music. Tesfaye has made a career singing nasty things in a sweet voice, but there are moments on <i>Beauty</i>, like ""Prisoner"",  his soul-searching duet with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>, where he finally sounds like he's engaging with this persona critically, making his audience question themselves for singing along so easily this whole time. ""Tell Your Friends"" reflects on Tesfaye's rise over six crystalline minutes that rank among the best in his career.  The themes are familiar, but his voice carries a new authority, and when he sings ""I'm that nigga with the hair/ Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill,"" at the end of the chorus, there is an audible smile on his face.</p>
<p>That song restates Tesfaye's defining duality, reveling in the bacchanalian excess of his lifestyle while keeping a hold on its emptiness. When he wrote songs like ""High for This"" or ""The Morning"", Tesfaye was homeless and barely 20, crashing on couches around Toronto and working at American Apparel. On ""Tell Your Friends"", he's a touring pop star with a number one hit under his belt. He's cruising in the West End in his new Benz, hearing his songs stream out of the Queen Street haunts he used to frequent. He uses ""Tell Your Friends"" to look back, reminding us that he's still the same old guy in the face of all the fame, though some things have changed: back then, in 2011, Cali was his mission. Now, it's the whole world.</p></div>"|20999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20999-beauty-behind-the-madness/|7.2|Andrew Ryce

""Blue Blood"" captured the surprising progression of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14269-total-life-forever/""><i>Total Life Forever</i></a> in miniature, slowly evolving from the pinging, prickly riffs that defined <i>Antidotes</i> to a cloudbursting crescendo. By 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17578-holy-fire/""><i>Holy Fire</i></a>, Foals were a legitimate arena act and acted like they've <i>been there</i> before, hence, the four-minute, crowd-stoking <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaFEG3F1V8o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Prelude""</a>. At this point, Foals have nothing left to prove—they are a big-ticket rock band until further notice, so the opening title track of <i>What Went Down</i> gets right to it with blunt-force, pitch-shifted riffs and Yannis Philippakis promising that you’re gonna hype him up and make him catch a body like that: ""So don’t step to me kid, you’ll never be found.""</p>
<p>The lyrical aggression is curious, but the confidence is warranted<span>—</span>after planning on an extended hiatus after <i>Holy Fire</i>, <i>What Went Down</i> came together in relatively quick fashion after something ""clicked"" during preliminary sessions. No surprise that they’re locked in, as Foals are basically a genre of one at this point. This appears more obvious when you consider the bands who’ve ascended to their level in the UK over the past few years; if they’re not adhering to the most obvious NME-bait <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19814-royal-blood/"">lad-rock</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrrcVxnjJO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">template</a>, they’re following some kind of obvious precedent. Meanwhile, Foals have mastered an arena-funk hybrid that others have only touched on<span>—</span>post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11887-the-top-the-head-on-the-door-kiss-me-kiss-me-kiss-me-blue-sunshine""><i>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</i></a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> when they wanted to be silly, latter day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> when they wanted to be serious.</p>
<p>But unlike those bands, Foals aren’t fronted by a self-fashioned icon. The presumptive medley of ""London Thunder"" and ""Lonely Hunter"" find Philippakis jetsetting between gigs and considering the ocean as a reflection of his emotional emptiness, the first time he’s directly addressed what it means to be The Guy in Foals. But while Foals are considered the ""thinking person’s alternative"" to most mainstream UK guitar bands by default, the knuckle-dragging of the title track and ""Snake Oil"" isn’t that much more cerebral than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32495-royal-blood/"">Royal Blood</a> or Drenge. More often, Foals are a ""feeling person’s alternative""<span>—""</span>Mountain at My Gates"" and ""Birch Tree"" are defined by an all-purpose spiritual and/or romantic longing and spacious production, meaning they’re walking the same path as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay"">Coldplay</a> ca. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1541-xy/""><i>X&amp;Y</i></a> with more pep in their step. <i>What Went Down</i> revels in lurid imagery—love is a gun in Philippakis’ hand, he runs through the streets bloodied from a fistfight, his heart is an old pole dancer and an old black panther.</p>
<p>In that regard, <i>What Went Down</i> feels like the completion of an unplanned trilogy<span>—</span><i>Total Life Forever</i> embraced commitment, <i>Holy Fire</i> yearned for liberation, and this is Philippakis recoiling from the blowback. ""Give It All"" initially comes off like an inert songwriting exercise in lyrical juxtaposition, before Philippakis cleverly twists the title into an ironic burn (""Give me the time but not an age/ Give me the look but not the rage...you give me it all""). But by ""Lonely Hunter"", the tables have turned on Philippakis<span>—</span>he gets lost in foreign cities and makes perfunctory late night calls, only to get back and recognize how it’s not the same as being there (""why must I wait in line for what is mine?"").</p>
<p>It’s not a particularly unique viewpoint, though it’s unique in relation to other Foals records. In fact, it’s about the only way to truly distinguish <i>What Went Down</i> from <i>Holy Fire</i> and <i>Total Life Forever</i>. There are superficial differences in aggression<span>—</span>slightly more electronic buzzing, harsher vocals, gristly guitars. It’s Foals’ <i>raw</i> record, but it’s still filet mignon <i>tartare</i>, as raw as you can get when your producer’s two other gigs in 2015 were <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20605-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful"">Florence and the Machine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20421-wilder-mind/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <i>What Went Down</i> is the latest example of Foals’ uncanny ability to make records whose basic musical trajectory and quality are nearly equal regardless of the band's intentions going in. And <i>What Went Down</i>is their most consistent, steady-handed work yet—the distance between their purest pop moments (""Miami"", ""My Number"") and their opulent ballads (""Spanish Sahara"") has virtually disappeared. It's also significantly less exciting than <i>Total Life Forever </i>and <i>Holy Fire</i>, dynamic records <i>because </i>of their unevenness and ambitious strain—while Foals have realized a sound that's truly their own, they sound far too comfortable in it.</p></div>"|20971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20971-what-went-down/|6.7|Ian Cohen

The growing label <a href=""http://www.fofmusic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Friends of Friends</a> and its offshoot, Young Adults, have helped shape a loose aesthetic, with the sub-label focusing on a more explicitly niche template of chilled-out, lo-fi house music, providing a home for releases from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30659-suzanne-kraft/"">Suzanne Kraft</a>, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/marvin-and-guy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marvin &amp; Guy</a>, and slow-mo house deity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29661-mark-e/"">Mark E</a>. Their latest release is an EP from Daniel.T., aka Daniel Terndrup, a SoCal house upstart who’s also put out a few promising nu-disco singles as one half of Cosmic Kids.</p>
<p><i>Tetrachromat</i> is his sunniest and most musically varied offering so far, painting the producer as an enthusiastic cultural omnivore. Terndrup’s ear is tuned to a certain feel-good, typically Californian frequency: his favored warm and atmospheric sounds connect him to a nebulous lineage populated by Balearic pop, space disco, and SoCal neo-psychedelia. The EP begins with the warmly burbling ""Mission Hill Morning"", a track that calls to mind the gentle late-aughts disco put out by Oslo label <a href=""http://www.smalltownsupersound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smalltown Supersound</a>, and concludes with the slightly-too-on-the-nose uke-strumming of ""The Sun &amp; the Sky"", which Terndrup fleshes out with genial whistling and sing-song vocals. It’s PCH music for commuting into the city for parties, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ha-ZsGxCb8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ventura Highway""</a> for the laptop generation.</p>
<p>Wisely, Terndrup places his best track right in the middle. The woozy ""Planetesimal"" features the EP’s heaviest build-up and its biggest payoff, in the form of a giddy, insouciant synthesizer line that cascades over the sounds of sputtering engines like a stretch of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJF-u9xWIH8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainbow Road</a>. This is exactly the kind of sound that often gets called colorful, and Terndrup seems to know it—the term ""tetrachromat"" refers to a person who possess an extra cone in the eye, leading to an enhanced ability to see color (a less-than-reliable test for the condition was passed around online earlier this year, after a certain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meme</a> got the Internet talking about color perception.) After the warm bubble bath of the first half, the chilly ""Laced"" comes as something of a surprise, though Terndrup incorporates enough equatorial flourishes to suggest a strong connection to the rest of the material.</p>
<p>Terndrup’s flexibility with his sound can sometimes project a lack of confidence—the title track, a mellow cloud of contentment disturbed by a wildly ebullient melody, suggests a more restless producer than the EP’s general mood describes. Still, the sense that he has further to go in terms of editing and honing his sound doesn’t detract from his ability to filter a wide range of influences into an appealing and well-crafted aesthetic.</p></div>"|20968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20968-tetrachromat-ep/|7.7|Abigail Garnett

After all, they’ve already detailed environmental degradation, screaming lines about nature’s revolt and grand-finale floods as rhythm and riff crack and lash against one another. But when Dead to a Dying World at last pull back during ""Beneath the Loam"", one of four quarter-hour marvels on their second album, <i>Litany</i>, it is only to regroup and instantly return with twice the speed and twice the fury. ""Brittle embers flicker inside,"" screams Heidi Moore, pushing her voice so hard above the sudden black metal melee that she takes full stops between every word. ""Where blasting suns once raged."" It’s a shocking and gripping moment, a jolt applied with unapologetic force and impeccable timing amid what was already a mighty furor.</p>
<p>That sort of escalation is exactly what Dead to a Dying World do so well throughout <i>Litany</i>, a vivid hybrid of doom, black metal, and crust punk, buttressed by baroque classical flourishes. Dead to a Dying World’s 2011 debut pursued a similar mix, with doom lunges and black metal surges woven together with string sections and riffs that expanded or contracted based upon the context. The idea, though, often outstripped the execution, so that the transitions between those parts felt threadbare and rushed, the rookie mistakes of an audacious new seven-piece ensemble. Four years later, however, Dead to a Dying World show no such signs of folly. These six deliberate pieces commingle melodrama and momentum, horror and hope, pulling the listener along like some tight-wire suspense flick.</p>
<p>To an extent, that’s what it is: <i>Litany</i> deals with the state of the world and its rather grim prospects, delivered in moribund language that suggests we are, as a species, poised at the precipice of our end. The music animates that message, with sweeping arrangements and chiming guitars, washes of distortion and marches of drums shaping a battle between anxiety about our future and hope for it, between infinite pessimism and purposeful optimism. Though the tools are different, Dead to a Dying World suggest the same frisson as the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> in their salad days and the same emotional ambiguity as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>. There is no single style to <i>Litany</i>, just as there are no easy answers about the worries Dead to a Dying World address.</p>
<p>For an album that lasts for more than an hour, though, it is at least an easy, alluring listen, largely because so much effort and thought seem to have gone into building it. During 17-minute opener ""The Hunt Eternal"", for instance, Dead to a Dying World volley between invigorating, aggressive black metal passages and stately, alluring doom. They drift into a pensive and patient midsection, where the spectral voice of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30726-sabbath-assembly/"">Sabbath Assembly</a>’s Jamie Myers-Waits hangs like foreboding fog. When at last they reach the end, they funnel all of it together, with the harshness pushing against the heaviness and buoyed from below by viola. Each moment feels bigger and more powerful than the last, so that these epics never overstay their welcome and linger into tedium. The song establishes the rubric for the rest of <i>Litany</i>, a seesaw of dynamics built around a world of apocalyptic images and faint whispers of renewal.</p>
<p>Just before the album’s final minute, Dead to a Dying World collapse, exhaustedly, from <i>Litany</i>'s blitz, the beat marching along in halftime. His voice fighting above surviving sheets of guitar, Mike Yeager fights to pose one final question: ""Do we choose to follow, or can we break away?"" At times, <i>Litany </i>may feel overwrought, too emotionally loaded and compositionally ostentatious for its own good. But here, at the end, you understand that Dead to a Dying World aren’t being maudlin just for kicks, that they’re not howling about ""a bloodless pillar"" and ""ochre hands"" and intoning lines about the end of days without cause.</p>
<p>No, these are real-world worries, written in the extreme patois of heavy metal and cast with the mild panic of environmentalists, climate scientists, and even civil rights activists. <i>Litany</i> reminds me of Paul Gilding’s <a href=""http://paulgilding.com/the-great-disruption/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Great Disruption</i>, in which he wonders if emergency can force humanity into grand action</a>, or the glaciologist Jason Box, who proclaimed that we <i>might </i>be, <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36228/ballad-of-the-sad-climatologists-0815/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as he infamously put it, ""f’d.""</a> Dead to a Dying World’s roots in punk and metal afford these concerns urgency, while their sophisticated sounds lend it magnetism.

With a shock of blue hair and vocal control beyond her years, Halsey arrived with just five songs and a buzzed-about live show. Since then she became the <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/festivals/6509472/sxsw-twitter-stats-miley-cyrus-run-the-jewels"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most tweeted-about artist</a> at SXSW, toured with Imagine Dragons, and was the subject of a fascinating <i><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/arts/music/halsey-with-badlands-is-moving-fast-to-share-a-secret-language.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York Times</a></i> profile that explored her identity as a ""biracial, bisexual and bipolar"" artist. To boot, Halsey's debut album, <i>Badlands</i>' latest single, ""New Americana"", recently premiered on Apple Music's Beats 1 with an enthusiastic endorsement from Zane Lowe: ""There’s a new icon there,"" he said, possibly making it so by fiat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The momentum behind Halsey is undeniable, but <i>Badlands</i> mostly falls flat. At its best, the record plays like a conflagration of a half-decade's worth of alt-R&amp;B—catchy, dark, spottily engaging. But it is weighed down by trite lyrics and stale production: The details of her story wind up far more interesting than the music itself, which is a weird place to be for a superstar-in-the-making.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Badlands</i> opens with ""Castle"", an unhurried track with a trip-hop backbone that serves as a meditation on Halsey's growing fame. ""Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise,"" she sings, ready to reject celebrity like an industry pro from the get-go. ""And there's an old man sitting on the throne that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean,"" she sings, taking a jab at the patriarchy; it's one of the occasional moments on <i>Badlands</i> where Halsey's personality emerges and the knives come out. But sonically, ""Castle"" is dull; a misguided plainchant interlude threatens to derail the track early on and the soupy production never quite congeals.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Elsewhere, Halsey's choices are even clunkier. ""New Americana"" reconstitutes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s Hollywood Babylon-isms and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a>'s tongue-in-cheekiness as a millennial call-to-arms: ""Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire/ Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockafellas,"" Halsey sings, piling on the Gen Y bromides. She runs down a ""big issues"" checklist, from social media fame (good? bad? maybe both!) to wealth inequality (a problem, no doubt!), and her concerns come across as plasticky and surface-level. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""New Americana"" isn't the only time Halsey evokes Del Rey. ""Drive"" hews close to the Lizzy Grant playbook, with saccharine strings and West Coast anhedonia that has <i><a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Ultraviolence</a> </i>written all over it. The more successful tracks tend to be the ones that feel personal and specific. ""Ghost"", which also appeared on Halsey's EP, gives you a sense of what she can do when the scale is smaller. The track is a sinuous synth-pop love song whose economical runtime plays in its favor; one can almost forgive the music video for being yet another <i>Enter the Void</i> knockoff. ""Hurricane"", a bonus track that doubled as an early single, also has a striking specificity to its unusually bleak lyrics: ""He's got an eye for girls of eighteen/ And he turns them out like tricks,"" Halsey sings, painting a troubling picture of a traumatic youth.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Reading interviews with Halsey or scrolling through her Twitter feed, you get the sense of a canny and talented performer, one who legitimately wants to connect with fans. But the public persona only comes through on <i>Badlands</i> in fits and starts, and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album. ""We are the new Americana/ High on legal marijuana/ Raised on Biggie and Nirvana,"" goes the chorus on ""New Americana."" Like most of <i>Badlands</i>, it's calculated, defiant, and, ultimately, hollow.</p></div>"|20951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20951-badlands/|4.9|Nathan Reese

Its powers and influence ebb and flow in waves; over the years, funk has ridden out these changes with an easygoing grace, confident in the fact that any low period will be inevitably followed by a swing back up. Right now we’re living in an especially strong time for funk–in fact, it should go down as one of the highest points in funk history. And like the other times like this in the past, we have California to thank for it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Funk’s current comeback has been rumbling out of L.A. since the end of the last decade. There was the Brainfeeder crew breaking hip-hop’s increasingly mechanized mold in order to reconnect it with the cosmic slop that helped birth it. A generation of young rappers that grew up during the city’s gangsta-rap heyday (many of them aligned with Black Hippy and TDE) began preparing for the return of g-funk 20 years after it first developed. Somewhere off to the side, Dâm-Funk began creating massive beats whose invocations of past masters like Roger Troutman and Egyptian Lover underlined Cali’s prominent place in funk’s lineage.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Only in the past year or so has it become entirely clear that these aren’t isolated cases, but one immense upswell, as artists from across these different scenes released a string of records that reflected a new level of skill, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19875-flying-lotus-youre-dead/""><i>You’re Dead!</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20760-the-beyond-where-the-giants-roam/""><i>The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam</i></a>. With <i>Invite the Light</i>, Dâm-Funk’s joined them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dâm’s always been one of the spacier of funk’s new prophets, which, considering how far-out that whole scene is, is a major accomplishment. He’s always seemed uninterested in making his creative impulses fit in any kind of box, so his records tend to range from relatively straightforward, pop-compatible stuff into more abstract territory hovering in an ambiguous space between funk, electro, and experimental electronic music.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Invite the Light</i> is proof that Dâm-Funk’s leveled up on both sides of the equation–the pop stuff’s poppier, and the weird stuff’s more intriguingly weird. On the opening track, former Ohio Player Junie Morrison delivers a staticky distress call from some dystopian time where the funk’s been extinguished and humanity suffers because of it. What follows is a megaton funk bomb that would be more than sufficient to set this alternate universe straight.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In his intro, Morrison says that he ""cannot tell you the exact time, day, or year"" that he’s broadcasting from, because humankind’s given up keeping track. <i>Invite the Light</i>’s got the same kind of temporal ambiguity running through it. Dâm-Funk has a particular soft spot for the peak of funk’s analog electronic era (bookended roughly by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BonCLU297hM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""More Bounce to the Ounce""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjFs9CPGhts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Egypt, Egypt""</a>), but he seems to be drawing his inspiration here from funk in its entirety.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some of these songs are the catchiest and most direct Dâm’s ever produced, and they all go about it in distinctly different ways. ""We Continue"" has a Zapp-ish electro bass bump, but the synth pads, twinkling pianos, and multitracked vocals layered on top impart a breezy disco buoyancy that suggests matching satin outfits and choreographed dance moves. ""Somewhere, Someday"", meanwhile, has the same sparkle as the soulful midtempo bubblegum Prince makes when he’s not feeling tortured.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even when Dâm gets further out, the album holds together. ""The Hunt and Murder of Lucifer"", as the title suggests, is a deeply tripped out, bloody-sounding instrumental with leads shared by a nastily buzzing bass part and an icier, pitch-bent synth that throws off all kinds of unsettling discordant frequencies when the two combine. And his <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> collaboration ""Acting"" is such potently blissed-out psychedelia that you’re likely to catch a contact high just listening to it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At its best, <i>Invite the Light</i> manages to bring together Dâm-Funk’s wilder, more experimental side with his newly refined pop side to produce not just some of the strongest material he’s ever made, but some of the strongest material to arise out of the current funk boom. ""HowUGonFu*kAroundAndChooseABusta'?"" comes near the middle of the album, and it feels like the track that everything else revolves around. From different angles, it resembles Snoop when he was trying to sound like George Clinton, or Prince when he was trying to sound like a rapper, or Outkast when they were trying to sound like Prince. Taken as a whole, though, it’s unmistakably new and unique, and it'll make you thankful that we get to live in a world where funk exists.</span></p></div>"|20943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20943-invite-the-light/|7.6|Miles Raymer

It features the kind of glossy production made popular in the 1980s and '90s by John Fryer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4217-this-mortal-coil/"">This Mortal Coil</a> in his myriad productions for 4AD, Mute, and Beggars Banquet—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>, Xmal Deutschland, Clan of Xymox, Chapterhouse. Tamaryn herself is the only constant between her past two albums and this one, changing instrumental personnel (here she works with Shaun Durkan of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29185-weekend/"">Weekend</a>) and production credits (Jorge Elbrecht of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28480-violens/"">Violens</a>, who has also worked with Ariel Pink and No Joy) from her previous incarnation.</p>
<p>No longer competing for sonic space with a heavy wash of guitar, Tamaryn’s voice, even drenched in reverb, becomes the focus. There are serious pop hooks on this record—opener ""Cranekiss"" has a chorus that will alight inside your skull, flutter its wings a bit, and set to making a nest—and her voice sounds much less constrained, more ebullient and full, than on previous recordings. Many of the songs on <i>Cranekiss</i> are about uncompromising female desire from varying perspectives (the first single ""Hands All Over Me"" and ""Softcore"", which samples both porn simulacra of female orgasms and the peep show scene from <i>Paris, Texas</i>, stand out), a joyous thing in and of itself, and the theme of <i>Cranekiss</i> overall seems to be freedom, expansion, exploration.</p>
<p>There are moments when <i>Cranekiss</i> seems a little <i>too</i> hewn to the '80s and '90s ethereal/goth sound it’s an obvious homage to—the sonic Cocteau Twins references throughout the first half of the record can sound a little heavy-handed, and any of the tracks would have fit in seamlessly on the classic <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Various-Heavenly-Voices/release/292383"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperium Records <i>Heavenly Voices </i>compilation. </a>There is value in exploring the particular styles that made you fall head-over-heels for music in the first place, though, and while <i>Cranekiss</i> hardly breaks new ground it has a sense of playfulness to it, a sort of sparkling and infectious enthusiasm. Tamaryn has said that making this album was a <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6634282/tamaryn-cranekiss-video-interview-exclusive-premiere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""very, very pleasurable, inspiring, fun experience unlike anything I’ve ever done before,""</a> and that’s palpable upon hearing it.</p>
<p>Amid all the swirl and shimmer, there are some tracks that feel more rooted—""Fade Away Slow"", a goth taffy-pull of a song near the close of the album, probably has the most low end on an album that likes to pull away from the earth overall. It unwinds deliciously, unpeeling layers of itself to nearly break down before spinning into a lovely bridge and a recall chorus. Because some of the tracks are so airy, a call down to close out the record, like closing out a ritual, seems like a necessary respite.</p>
<p><i>Cranekiss</i> firmly establishes Tamaryn’s pop songwriting chops. It also indicates a willingness to play with new instrumentation—the synths, drum triggers, and sampling are all new to Tamaryn's palette—and a willingness to play with established style and form. It's a beautiful, heavily textured, highly sensual record, heady sugar on the tongue. </p></div>"|20981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20981-tamaryn-cranekiss/|7.4|Jes Skolnik

But while scuzz-covered Toronto rockers Fake Palms hardly seem like the types to be strategically capitalizing on boutique cocktail trends, band founder Michael le Riche seems well familiar with the sensation of being caught between the world in which he exists and the one he wishes to inhabit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Le Riche represents a bridge between divergent Toronto indie rock narratives. His former band, the Darcys, were signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"">Broken Social Scene</a>’s Arts &amp; Crafts imprint, and, prior to a lineup shake-up last year that’s <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/wes-marskell/darcys-band_b_6327666.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>cast the group’s future in doubt</span></a>, were being groomed as the label’s next-gen art-rock lynchpins. But with his new full-time concern, le Riche takes a detour down the burning-embered trail blazed by local art-punk heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30564-metz/"">Metz</a> to join the freak scene at <a href=""http://buzzrecords.ca"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Buzz Records</span></a>, whose name is as reflective of the label’s rising profile as its raucous roster’s overheated amplifiers. And yet, even as Fake Palms has evolved from le Riche’s bedroom recording project to a veritable Toronto underground supergroup (with Lane Halley of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31250-hooded-fang/"">Hooded Fang</a> on second guitar, Burning Love’s Patrick Marshall on bass, and long-time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19363-slim-twig/"">Slim Twig</a> associate Simone TB on drums), the band’s self-titled debut still bears an intensely claustrophobic quality. Le Riche isn’t so much stepping out into the spotlight as fortifying the walls around him, finding sanctuary in noise.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Fake Palms are, fundamentally, a dream-pop band that plays with garage-punk aggression, subjecting pristine pop songs to bruising beatings. For them, distortion isn’t a weapon, but the inevitable consequence of a stringent, Dogme 95-worthy approach to recording that emphasizes live-off-the-floor authenticity and forbids overdubs. The in-the-red interaction of le Riche and Halley’s gleaming guitar lines, Marshall’s rhythmic rumble, and Simone’s thwack attack has produced a naturally corroding effect, as if all the sound bouncing off the studio walls formed a storm system that soaked the recordings in static.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That shrouding effect can make it hard to grasp exactly what le Riche is trying to express, though the underpinning ennui is easy enough to parse. On the hard-charging opener ""Fever Dream"", the only easily decipherable words are ""my friends""—repeated at the top of each increasingly inscrutable verse line—but they’re delivered with enough audible distress to suggest le Riche is ready to ditch them. The few other soundbites on the album that emerge from le Riche’s foggy cloud of a voice—""I’m not here/ I never was,"" ""Where did my life go/ It’s on the ground,"" ""I need a change""—suggest the singer is trying to retreat from the world even as his band is trying to thrust him to the frontlines.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This tug-of-war tension permeates the songs’ very structural DNA, constantly yielding surprising shifts: the deceptively upbeat twinkle of ""Sun Drips"" dissolves into a stalking, slow-motion krautrock strut; the wistful, melancholic verses of ""Melatonin"" are upended by a stomping, storming midsection powered by a twinned guitar line that sounds like broken glass—sparkling yet dangerously jagged. But if Fake Palms’ obfuscating approach threatens to pummel more outwardly melodic, mid-tempo turns like ""Estate"" into sluggish sludge, the pin-pricked riffs of disco-not-disco thumper ""Sparkles"" and ""YTMATLDPH"" poke holes for their fetching ""ooh wee ooh"" falsetto hooks to waft through, like steam rising out of the punctured cellophane film on a microwave TV dinner.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ff92a71c-8191-28dc-0a40-8935eeac725c"">Though these songs date back to 2011, Fake Palms has the slight misfortune of emerging mere months after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32165-viet-cong/"">Viet Cong</a> showed us how you can translate similar inputs—goth-schooled brooding, shoegaze haze, needling post-hardcore guitars—into something more expansive and emotionally direct. The structural intricacies and melodic integrity of this otherwise raw recording suggest le Riche is capable of pulling off something similarly bold. But for now, Fake Palms’ ocean-sized ambitions are confined to a grimy fish tank. </span></p></div>"|20972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20972-fake-palms/|6.9|Stuart Berman

An unidentified pianist interjects simple flourishes barely audible above the din of scratches and scrapes on the acetate. But then Hooker’s voice enters, emphatic and sturdy, weary yet randy as he begs a woman to relieve his sorrows. Her name is illegible (Essie Mae? Ethel May?), but the desire borders on desperation: ""I want you to drive my blues away."" ""Rocks"" is not one of Hooker’s best tunes, but it does project a certain charisma that would later come into greater focus. It’s notable for being one of the first recordings Hooker made after leaving Memphis and arriving in Detroit in the late 1940s, a tenure that would produce some of his most famous hits—including 1948's massive ""Boogie Chillen"". As such, ""Rocks"" is the anchor of a new 4xCD set from the UK label <a href=""http://www.jsprecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JSP Records</a>, a fanfare that set Detroit blues rolling and tumbling for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Hooker was the focal point for the scene, and he gets more than a full disc of tracks—35 in all, a number that reflects both his early arrival in Detroit and his heavy studio schedule. Neil Slaven, the producer and historian who penned the liners for <i>Garden City Blues</i>, sounds almost apologetic about some of his cuts: ""There’s none of the personality in his guitar playing that we came to expect. He’s not helped by a pedestrian pianist even more limited than he was at the time."" Especially compared to Hooker’s most popular hits (many of which were recorded in Detroit yet have been omitted from this compilation), these tracks may sound rudimentary, but together they add up to more than just a prologue to his career. Each one indulges some new whim or tries out some new trick: ""Boogie Woogie"" moves with such an exaggerated strut that even the poor quality of the recording can’t diminish its cocky exuberance, and ""Christmas Time Blues"" slows a jingle-bell melody down to a crawl before disrupting the lament with loud, percussive strums.</p>
<p>Hooker comes across as a musician of formidable ability and charisma, so it’s little wonder that he played with most of the other artists on <i>Garden City Blues</i>. Eddie Kirkland was his touring partner, Eddie Burns backed him on harmonica. Obviously they all borrowed from him, just as he no doubt learned a few things from them, but they developed their own styles. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this box set is its range: Detroit obviously encouraged a great deal of variation and innovation, such that the rhythms, the structures, and even the lineups vary from one track to the next and certainly from one artist to the next. Some of these artists provide their own accompaniment, picking on a guitar while stomping on the floor, while others bring in one or two other players. Big Jack Reynolds brings in a full band for his sole track, ""Going Down Slow"", recorded sometime in the early 1960s, and his unidentified drummer takes off in the first measure and turns the song into a pounding proto-garage rocker.</p>
<p>That loose parameters of the Detroit scene also permits some entertaining oddities, especially the Richard Brothers’ ""Stolen Property"". Recorded in 1959, it starts as a fairly run-of-the-mill blues number, with the siblings lamenting an unfaithful woman and laying down a jumpy blues riff. Soon, however, they veer into a bit of comic playacting, with one brother playing a pistol-wielding husband and the other a movie-house usher trying to minimize the violence. ""Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please, there’s a man in the inside of the theater with another man’s wife, and HE’S OUTSIDE WITH A .45!"" The whole place empties out in just a few seconds, leaving the brothers to deliver the inevitable punchline. It’s an odd bit of humor—part radio play, part vaudeville routine—but nearly 60 years after its creation, it works as a winking parody of the violence so often described in blues lyrics.</p>
<p>Despite its subtitle, <i>Garden City Blues</i> doesn’t really chronicle a scene so much as it documents a transitional period in blues history. The early and mid-20th century saw millions of African-Americans leaving mostly agrarian jobs in the South for the promise of work at factories in Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and other areas thriving in the new industrial era. The Great Migration coincided with great leaps in recording technology, and blues musicians began to gravitate toward electric guitars. This was industrial music before it became a rock subgenre—before rock itself was even a genre—and the new sounds allowed players to do things in urban venues that had been unimaginable in the farmland juke joints many of them had left behind.</p>
<p>The shift from acoustic to electric wasn’t instantaneous, but gradual. It took years for ideas to develop and conventions to gel, and the music collected on <i>Garden City Blues</i> documents that period of transition, when old styles and methods mingled with new. As such, the set may not be the best point of entry for anyone unfamiliar with what led to this music and what followed it. (For primers, either of Smithsonian Folkways’ <i>Classic Blues</i> comps is recommended, as is the 1992 box set <i>Chess Blues.</i>) But there is still a great deal to discover and appreciate here: spirited performances depicting a lively city that prized jumpy grooves, idiosyncratic swagger, and dogged innovation above all else.</p></div>"|20938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20938-garden-city-blues-detroits-jumping-scene-1948-1960/|7.6|Stephen M.

Twenty-first century dubstep fans might have traced that wobble back to the likes of Jah Shaka’s soundsystem while alternative rock fans in the '90s learned about such music thanks to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a> cover of <a href=""http://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Lee_Scratch-Grand_Royal_cover.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Grand Royal</i></a>. But dance music fans were well aware of the mind-altering properties of dub since the days of disco. While hot singles were on the A-side, club DJs often spun the more adventurous and unfamiliar B-sides for their dancers, as that's where producers like François K., Jellybean Benitez, Walter Gibbons, and Tee Scott (to name just a few) went deep into dub elements on their remixes. And as the '80s emerged, such experiments got higher and wilder, the ideal soundtrack for the wee hours at the Paradise Garage.</p>
<p>A great many of these experimental American dubs were compiled by Dimitri from Paris on the heady <i>Night Dubbin’</i> comp, which boasted an hourlong mix from London's Idjut Boys. Ever since their start in the '90s, the duo of Dan Tyler and Conrad McDonell have deployed heavy dub FX on their mischievous house sides, But when the duo finally got around to their noodly debut album, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16924-cellar-door/""><i>Cellar Door</i></a>, that spacey, playful side of them took a backseat to placid, at times flaccid, instrumentals. <i>Versions</i>, presented now as a complete overhaul and re-imagining of <i>Cellar Door</i>, nudges their Balearic soft rock tendencies back toward their dubby fundamentals, offering drastically warped takes on that underwhelming album.</p>
<p>Their dub of two-minute acoustic guitar sketch ""Rabass""—now as ""Ambient Rab""—inverts proportions, the acoustic guitar now swinging in and out of earshot amid copious amounts of delay, with great gobs of bass pushed to the fore. But even at twice the length, it leaves me as unimpressed as the original. Things fare far better on the piano-led ""Kenny Dub Headband"", which isn’t so surprising in that ""One for Kenny"" was already the original album’s standout. The driving piano provided by Norwegian jazz musician Bugge Wesseltoft on the original (named for deceased British DJ Kenny Hawkes) now gets run through all manner of effects, making the Steinway sound monstrous as other details: scratch guitar, handclaps, electric gurgles, and snare drums lurch in and out of the mix. By dilating the track to about twice its length (nearly 10 minutes), it gives the Idjuts an ample playground in which to run wild.</p>
<p>The longest track on <i>Versions</i> is the 11-minute ""Another Bird"". But rather than swing wildly like ""Kenny Dub Headband"", this is a more gentle, blissed-out Balearic ride, reminiscent of the Idjuts’ subtle and <a href=""https://youtu.be/7-gwNxrj7_E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">effective remix of this slow-chugger</a>. Full of guitars arcing towards the horizon, it’s perfect for manning a sailboat at sunset. Or as Phil Sherburne recently put it on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/878-the-tide-is-high-10-records-from-the-balearic-revival/"">round-up of all things Balearic</a>: ""If you're not full-on levitating by the end, you need to check the settings on your stereo.""</p>
<p>""Going Down""’s dub benefits from a few minutes more than the original, which got diluted by the vocals and guitar. Here the Idjuts accentuate the darker turns that got lost amid the nylon-string strums of the original, but it takes a few minutes before the druggy effects take hold. When it does, they push into a far stranger headspace, the echoed female vocal asking ""Why you going down to hell for love?"" particularly effective. And while the driving beat of ""Love Hunter"" was the previous album’s other highlight, in the dub the duo scale it back by three minutes. In narrowing the space and pushing the hand percussion and all its Echoplexed permutations up in the mix, as well as distorting the guitar into alien timbres, the track tarts to resemble the strange productions of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZJ9MnXVwaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell circa ""Schoolbell / Treehouse""</a>, suggesting yet another world of echo still to be discovered.</p></div>"|20875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20875-versions/|7.4|Andy Beta

Through the eclectic all-request sets they used to perform for WFMU’s annual fundraising drive and, more recently, their annual Hanukkah shows at Maxwell’s in Hoboken, the band has amassed an infinite jukebox of cover songs spanning golden oldies to underground oddities. It’s almost as if Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley started this band so that they could one day be the sort of tastemaking entity that can rescue forgotten songs from dollar-bin obscurity or subject popular ones to a critical reassessment.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But while it’s customary for indie-rock acts to approach bygone pop hits with subversive intent, Yo La Tengo never sound like they’re taking the piss, preferring to acclimatize themselves to the original material’s natural habitat rather than try to radically change the song’s context. And yet, whether they’re covering Sun Ra or Sonny Bono, Yo La Tengo covers sound unmistakably like Yo La Tengo songs, because they serve the exact same function as the band’s best originals: they’re intimate exchanges, the sound of secrets being revealed. And as Yo La Tengo’s latest covers-heavy set attests, that quality becomes all the more amplified when those exchanges are rendered as whispers.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Given Yo La Tengo’s well-established karaoke-machine rep, the arrival of acoustic-oriented covers collection </span><i>Stuff Like That There</i><span> isn’t as revelatory as their previous acoustic-oriented covers collection, 1990’s </span><i>Fakebook</i><span>, which opened up a new dimension to what had then been a pretty straight-forward, scrappy rock band (a primitive state they revisited on 2009’s all-electric complement, </span><i>Fuckbook</i><span>, credited to their garage-punk alter ego, the Condo Fucks.) But </span><i>Stuff Like That There </i><span>makes perfect sense in the wake of 2009’s </span><i>Popular Songs</i><span> and 2013’s </span><i>Fade</i><span>, which displayed a gradual drift away from the band’s feedback-blasted extendo-jams toward succinct, small-scale statements.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though the album's sources range from '40s country to '60s soul to '90s alt-rock, the execution here is uniform, all brushed-snare rhythms, tasteful twang, and gentle acoustic strums that permeate the air like a late-afternoon drizzle. The readings are low-key and reverential, but the spirit is loose and playful. The Hubley-led versions of Darlena McCrea’s swooning 1964 single “My Heart’s Not In It”, Hank Williams’ tear-in-beer standard “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”, and The Parliaments’ psych-soul serenade “I Can Feel the Ice Melting” manage to feel on point and off the cuff at the same time, as if the band were pulling precious seven-inches from their protective sleeves and not giving a fuck if they get scratched.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Stuff Like That There</i> is not just another excuse for Yo La Tengo to show off their encyclopedic knowledge of pop history. At this stage of their career, it also serves as a poignant reminder of the ’80s and ’90s indie-rock peers who never achieved the same level of success, like Louisville contemporaries/collaborators Antietam (a faithfully reproduced “Naples”), Hoboken hero the Special Pillow (the charming, harmony-rich “Automatic Doom”), and R.E.M.-esque Ohio outfit Great Plains, whose jagged ‘n’ jangly anthem “Before We Stop to Think” is given a beautifully wounded reading by Kaplan. By contrast, the album’s lone concession to popular taste—Hubley’s wistful take on the Cure’s atypically sunny 1992 single “Friday I’m in Love”—feels out of place amid the record-collector finds and personal connections that inform the bulk of the tracklist, coming off instead like a novelty that just isn’t novel enough (not to mention a distant second in the pantheon of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJLOr8S2d2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cure covers by A-list American indie-rock power trios</a>).  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Of course, it wouldn’t be a Yo La Tengo covers album without the band covering themselves. But while the trio is notorious for radically redressing its droning noise-rock odysseys as lilting lullabies and vice versa (often trading Kaplan’s voice for Hubley’s in the process), the rustic redrafts of </span><i>Popular Songs</i><span>’ “All Your Secrets” and </span><i>Electr-o-Pura</i><span> deep cut “The Ballad of Red Buckets” don’t differ all that much from their official takes—the amplifier settings may be adjusted a touch downward, but the essential vibe remains. The major exception is a tiptoed pass through </span><i>I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One</i><span>’s swirling centerpiece “Deeper Into the Movies”, though unlike Yo La’s previous loud-to-quiet transitions (like the ambient “Big Day Coming” that opens </span><i>Painful</i><span>, or </span><i>Camp Yo La Tengo</i><span>’s skiffled take on “Tom Courtenay”) it feels less like a wholesale rethink than a rough sketch that makes you long for the surging force of the original. Thankfully, Yo La Tengo compensate for the superfluousness of these self-covers with two top-notch new tracks: The excellent “Rickety” continues the motorik momentum of </span><i>Fade</i><span> standout “Stupid Things”, with the band sounding like buskers on the shoulder lane of the Autobahn, while Kaplan’s “Awhileaway” is a gorgeous moonlit stroll of a ballad.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Stuff Like That There </i><span>may not always intrigue on a track-by-track basis, but, taken as a whole, the record stands as a loving portrait of Yo La Tengo’s vast musical and social universe condensed into a small wooden frame. And at a time when the full-album experience is </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/""><span>giving way to the almighty playlist</span></a><span>, </span><i>Stuff Like That There</i><span> handily reasserts Yo La Tengo’s reputation as indie rock’s consummate curators. Your music subscription service of choice may present you with a hundred different mood-based mixes to complement Sunday-morning sloth, but </span><i>Stuff Like That There</i><span> is really the only one you need for a day spent lazing away in your little corner of the world.</span></p></div>"|20970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20970-stuff-like-that-there/|7.1|Stuart Berman

In concert, he seems just as content to talk and joke as play, like a charismatic acquaintance regaling you with stories at slightly uncomfortable length. In the muted and gently loping songs on his band Frog Eyes' latest LP, <i>Pickpocket's Locket</i>, too, Mercer playfully mulls over a couple of musical ideas rather than pushing past them quickly or distending them quickly into cracked-mirror reflections of themselves. The approach would have been quite different just a few years ago. The tremulous, haunted tenor of the early 2000s—or for that matter, the percussive, histrionic assaults of  2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3267-the-folded-palm/""><i>The Folded Palm</i></a>, or the breathy, epic-poetic narration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10167-tears-of-the-valedictorian/""><i>Tears of the Valedictorian</i></a> and <i>Paul's Tomb: A Triumph—</i>is a far cry from the more polite and conversational parlance of this album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pickpocket's Locket</i>’s finds Frog Eyes sounding almost muzzled: The drums are hit with brushes and felt-tipped mallets, the guitars and bass are often acoustic, and a lot of the prime sonic real estate is taken up by bright piano chording and string arrangements from Mercer's erstwhile bandmate and former roommate —Spencer Krug of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4126-sunset-rubdown/"">Sunset Rubdown</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"">Moonface</a>. Mercer’s vocal is dry and up front, speaking colloquially, and just from the padded studio room instead of from a mountaintop created by delay or cathedral-like reverb. Despite the record's deliberate transparency of production style, though, the musical structures are as hard to parse as they have ever been; the high dramatics and longform organization of earlier, heavier records feels more intuitive, while it can be pretty difficult to determine where verses and chorus begin and end here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This element of the album points to why—despite his close association with consummate ""songwriter"" types <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Dan Bejar</a> and Krug —Mercer's work calls for a different mode of listening, more like one would use with avant-garde music. Its surface-level structural complexity can add up to a net overarching simplicity, if one hears it first as an inchoate whole before worrying about picking it apart. Eventually, the important musical phrases distinguish themselves; in Mercer's case, in any song, a few distinguishing paeans create signposts. ""Death Ship""s dense, ""Thunder Road""-paced libretto is filled with sneered, ear-catching lines like ""I floated to the New York on the back of a log"" and ""A man shot in the hand from indiscreet fire"" which serve as organizational dividers. The ecstatic closer ""Rip Down the Fences That Fence the Garden"" is built around several belted and bright melodic phrases—""In the dawn, by the river I shall swaddle my wrath!"" The goal in these lyrics is preserving attractive sibilance and meter at least as much as cosmic suggestion. Still, there are powerful shadows of meaning. Pecking at the edges of Mercer's neo-Modernist poetry are images of seediness and criminality— political corruption (""Crystal Blip""), lechery (""Two Girls""), and betrayal (""Rejoinders in a Storm""). But even the darkest moments feel perversely comic; the album lacks, certainly, the staring-into-the-abyss ruminations on mortality and human cruelty of previous releases.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In these clearer sections, <i>Pickpocket's Locket</i> proves itself to be increasingly rewarding upon repeated listens, but it still fails to deliver anything particularly remarkable. All of its component gestures can be found on other Mercer projects. The restrained sound palette resembles parts of FE's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18632-frog-eyes-careys-cold-spring/""><i>Carey's Cold Spring</i></a>, the poppier moments recall Mercer's contributions to Swan Lake, and heavy piano work also anchors excellent Frog Eyes records <i>Valedictorian</i> and 2003’s <i>The Golden River</i>. The main distinguishing feature here is Krug’s string arrangements, but disappointingly, these can feel childishly simple and precious in the same, borderline irritating way as the heavy counterpoint in Krug's own solo work—see the layered, scalar instrumental melodies on Sunset Rubdown’s last two albums, in particular. At their best, Krug's charts here lend Mercer's more modest songs a baroque quality, reminiscent of the modest string work on records like John Cale's <i>Paris 1919</i> or Robert Wyatt's <i>Shleep</i> (see, in particular, the effective, wry figures in ""The Beat Is Down"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mercer has long been someone worth keeping up with in indie rock; his voice has, since his early recording, been commanding, immutable, and seemingly impervious to trends. Fans have grown with the subtle changes in his mode of attack, and given the specificity of his style, sometimes it's easy to overlook the significant ways his approach has drifted since his formative releases. It's startling to realize <i>Pickpocket’s Locket</i> is the odd Carey Mercer release you can almost mellow out to. Once you delve deeper than the pleasant aesthetic, however, it's hard not to wish for a few more distinguishing moments to hold onto.</p></div>"|20876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20876-pickpockets-locket/|6.8|Winston Cook-Wilson

So it only makes sense that the colleagues she <i>has </i>attracted work in a similarly low key. Her labelmates on PMR Records include producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"">Julio Bashmore</a>, who’s quietly become an innovator in a genre full of professional Xeroxers; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai Paul</a>, who’s known for compelling music that’s barely released; and Dornik Leigh, Ware’s tour drummer, who’s since embarked on a solo career as languidly paced as his music. Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15601-dornik-something-about-you/"">""Something About You""</a> came out in 2013 and already sounded timeless, or more precisely out of time: lovelorn neo-soul that shimmers like a late-summer mirage. Subsequent singles ""Drive"" and ""Stand in Your Line"" were much the same, and two years later, Leigh’s proper debut <i>Dornik—</i>named for his parents, Dorothy and Nick—already sounds lived-in.</p>
<p>It’s hard to hear about Dornik without soon after hearing about his resemblance to Michael Jackson. The comparison is fair—Dornik, like many, idolizes the King of Pop, and does resemble Michael vocally, albeit a less hysteric, more quavery version. (And hey, <i>Dornik </i>is a more compelling idea of Michael x 2015 than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19333-michael-jackson-xscape/""><i>Xscape </i></a>was.) Because Dornik makes sumptuously arty R&amp;B, he also gets the Big Three R&amp;B Comparisons almost every time: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>, none of whom he is anything like. Better comparisons might be Maxwell circa <i>BLACKsummer’s night</i>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Dev Hynes</a><i>, </i>or<i> </i>mid-'90s Sade and Everything But the Girl, or<i> </i>for that matter Ware herself. Often, <i>Dornik </i>evokes the brooding side of early-'90s R&amp;B: the cascading-waterfall SFX, reverbed woodwinds, and fuzzy guitar that appear throughout, the haze of synth pads that hangs over most of the album, Dornik’s preference for retrofuturist sounds over modern.</p>
<p>All this moodiness is in service of something specific: <i>Dornik </i>rivals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/""><i>E•MO•TION</i></a><i> </i>for the year’s most crushed-out album; it’s as if Ware’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u03f5Wnwff0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Imagine It Was Us""</a> was an entire album of longing bliss. ""Blush"" is full of little synth twinkles and dazed guitar tumbles that sound like smiles creeping upon a lover’s face. ""Mountain"" is an uncannily accurate reproduction of the feeling of lying side-by-side with someone in a meadow by a quarry. ""Stand in Your Line"" might have been an insufferable friend-zone lament from another artist (""I joke and call you my girl, then you smile and you laugh and you call me your boyfriend—oh, if this were true""), but Dornik offers a vocal earnest enough and an arrangement luxuriant enough to hush any complaints. Even the more combative tracks sound as if an hour or kind word would sweep him right back into a swoon. The lyrics rarely transcend pillow talk, but it hardly matters; Dornik leaves the poetry to the arrangements.</p>
<p>All this makes <i>Dornik </i>easy to get lost in—and also, to lose track of. Extending ""Imagine It Was Us"" to album length is an amazing idea in theory, but in practice hypnotic becomes narcotic. The sequencing is curious: singles toward the end, midtempo mood pieces toward the front; it makes otherwise sumptuous tracks sound samey, and when Dornik tries to inject levity (the singsong ""Chain Smoke""), it makes for a jolting, unwelcome distraction. In a way, though, even this fits: the album’s like a fog one can drift in and out of for however many exquisite minutes. There are points in summer and in love when nothing else will do.</p></div>"|20967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20967-dornik/|7.1|Katherine St. Asaph

So, it’s a happy coincidence that both happen to reside in Chicago.</p>
<p>Natural Information Society is a shifting collective led by bassist, composer, and improviser Joshua Abrams. A long-time presence in the Chicago jazz and experimental music community, he's spent the past five years releasing albums—including <i>Natural Information</i>, <i>Represencing</i>, and the recent double LP <i>Magnetoception</i>—that have concentrated on meditative, pulse-driven music. Rather than a traditional upright or electric bass, on these records Abrams favors a three-stringed North African lute called a guimbri. The instrument’s percussive but rubbery tone provides a foundation for fluid and hypnotic embellishments on percussion, guitar, autoharp, and harmonium.</p>
<p>Lead by Cooper Crain—of Chicago-based krautrock revivalists, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27151-cave/"">Cave</a>—Bitchin Bajas’ music draws inspiration from the minimalist and new age records of the late '60s and '70s. On last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19615-bitchin-bajas-bitchin-bajas/""><i>Bitchin Bajas</i></a> and this year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20476-transporteur-ep/""><i>Transporteur </i>EP</a>, the group crafted patient and serene zone-out music that made heavy use of vintage synthesizers and tape loops.</p>
<p>As a collaboration, <i>Automaginary</i> flatters both parties. Bajas’ music often relies on the embellishment of looped phrases, be they short keyboard figures, guitar riffs, or abstract sounds. Working with an improvising ensemble allows the band—represented here by Crain, Dan Quinlivan, and Rob Frye—the chance to operate in a more dynamic setting. Throughout the compositions musicians drop in and out, switch melodies, or shuffle the phrasing of their riffs, allowing the music to feel organic and alive in a way that’s tough to replicate with a static loop. In turn, Natural Information Society’s scope is expanded through Bajas’ tastefully curated collection of old keyboards, whose hazy tones reinforce the music’s airy and meditative sensibility. </p>
<p>On the nearly 20-minute drone opener, ""On No Fade"", bowed upright bass tones slowly give way to humming keyboards and piano flourishes. The music is melodic, but never in a concrete or hummable sense and while it gradually increases in density, the band avoids a clear climax. It’s very peaceful listening. The subsequent compositions are more in line with Abrams’ recent records. The guimbri is at the center of the music, providing a pulse to guide the other musicians. The music grooves, but never quickens—maintaining a steady and consistent energy throughout. There are no solos and while the players wander and evolve their lines, they always remain in complementary positions to one another.</p>
<p>Bajas and Abrams both find serenity amid perceived stasis—making music that sounds repetitive, but is constantly undergoing subtle scene shifts and mutations. More than that, both make music that sounds strangely timeless. The lack of complex harmony helps to diffuse Abrams’ relationship to much modern jazz and while Bajas' music pays homage to a certain group of composers, those musicians were looking back toward even older traditions. <i>Automaginary </i>works because both excel at making music that feels thoroughly modern, but also ancient.</p></div>"|20959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20959-automaginary/|7.9|Aaron Leitko

Late in 2014, Myrkur emerged with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19808-myrkur-myrkur/"">self-titled debut EP</a> clouded in and catapulted by mystery. Hyperbolically billed by <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse Records</a> as ""a wholly unique perspective on the genre,"" the seven songs webbed haunting, seraphic singing around tremolo guitars and primitive, rumbling drums. The conceit was intriguing, but the songs were unevenly built, with parts that never quite became a complete puzzle and a force that felt mitigated by some sycophantic need for second-wave credibility.</p>
<p>Still, even (especially?) people who dismissed the songs demanded to know just who the unnamed creator of the one-woman black metal band was, a process that begot pernicious conspiracy theories and comment threads devoted to ferretting out the singer and connections that would make her a little less kvlt. Bruun, indeed, had worked as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxCunreNOMo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a pop singer</a> and half of an <a href=""http://fatpossum.com/artists/ex-cops/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indie rock band signed to Fat Possum</a>, biographical talking points that inspired ire. Days before the EP arrived, Relapse confirmed that Mykur did, indeed, belong to Bruun, setting off another wave of debate about whether or not the anonymity had been a mere promotional ploy. The hubbub was more interesting and accomplished than the music that inspired it, a distraction from the real reason anyone should or should not have been talking about Myrkur. But on <i>M</i>, Bruun is free and clear of any identity drama—and a much more convincing bandleader for it.</p>
<p>Myrkur’s animating idea remains much the same on <i>M:</i> Add Bruun’s beautiful voice to brutal metal outbursts, and offset serrated black metal screams with contemplative piano or vocal interludes. This time, though, Bruun has sealed many of the foundational cracks in her compositions and owned the audacity of the project and the form at large. She recruited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"">Ulver</a> mastermind Garm as the co-producer, alongside a rhythm section comprising members of Mayhem and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30890-nidingr/"">Nidingr</a> and a cadre of horns and stringed instruments endemic to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardanger_fiddle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Norway</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fi%C3%B0la"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iceland.</a> They reinforce these songs, adding flourishes that are both striking and subtle and delivering an instrumental aplomb that Myrkur initially avoided.</p>
<p>These songs feel unabashed and fully rendered, neither limited by the codex of a hidebound genre or hindered by the need to prove too much at once. Rather than recede from public view following a sometimes-uncomfortable start, Bruun has pushed Myrkur into the spotlight of big, bright production—a kiss-off to cynical kvlt critics that doubles as a convenient invitation of accessibility. On <i>Myrkur</i>, the relationship between the songs’ varied aspects—the choral singing, the piano pieces, the relentless browbeaters—seemed casual at best, facets of a project that Bruun had not yet fit together. But <i>M</i> works as an album of interconnected miniature arcs, with many songs following the same structure.</p>
<p>Bruun flexes here, too: In the past, and throughout much of <i>M</i>, she has meted out her harsh vocals, judiciously scattering them for dramatic emphasis or as textural undercurrents. But on ""Mordet"", the most direct evidence of her increased ambition, she foregoes clean vocals altogether for the first time in her catalog. Her grim voice webbed with echo, she sounds as though she’s hunting an evil tail through the search-and-destroy maze of guitars, drums, and noise. If only for four minutes, she escapes her predictable comfort zone of hard-and-soft counterbalance, becoming the heavy metal force that her past has only suggested. </p>
<p>At its most compelling, black metal pits the impossible grandeur of the world against its harsh natural realities. It’s a big, vivid vision, where battles between heroes and villains, the dark and the light, the past and the present come into ecstatic conflict. It’s become so stylized and specific, though, that some of that spirit can often be lost in rote genre exercises or aggressively experimental attempts to re-contextualize it. From the start, it was clear that Myrkur wanted to recapture the essence of those competing forces and the tension they produced. That prospect was always more enticing than who she was or who she wasn’t. At last, Myrkur’s music has started to bear out that promise and to rise above the gossip about her pedigree. </p></div>"|20833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20833-m/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

With a resonant baritone that telegraphed masculine authority, Jenkins jumped from not mentioned at all to one of his city's most promising rookie candidates. He combined an ear for poetic language with a principled consciousness and a no-bullshit persona, a formula which quickly snowballed into a substantial underground fanbase. Since that time, in numerous </span><span><a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/mick-jenkins-waves-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profiles</a> and </span><span><a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/mick-jenkins-interview-waves-2015-profile"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, Jenkins has wrestled with what this sudden success means. His art has been in many ways about seeking truth in a system designed to obscure it, as an uncompromising, conscientious moralist unafraid to cut through the noise. It's a relatable pose, but one that doesn't necessarily lead artist and listener to the same destination. </span><i>Wave[s]</i><span> is a new direction, and it may upset expectations, pushing him away from his more strident instincts. Even if it isn't his best, it's probably for the best.</span></p>
<p>What that means in practical terms is a shift from the somber blues and greens of <i>The Water(s) </i>into a more colorful earth-toned exploration of musical possibility. Although his poetic approach and political conscience are still in play, it feels less like a focal point and more a part of the music's texture. With Haitian-Canadian producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a> and Chicago-based musical collective THEMpeople providing the backdrop, <i>Wave[s] </i>is influenced primarily by a jazzy neo soul—to be reductive about it—sound. In a time when artists have been celebrated for chasing fashionable worlds of influence through a bottomless hard drive, Jenkins has opted to stick to a core set of inputs, a closed circuit of musical inspiration, and is finding himself within that limitation. His more orthodox listening tastes are refreshing, a reminder of how constraints can provide a framework for freedom.</p>
<p>So when Jenkins opens up his world, it's for this tradition, one that gives him the grammar to relieve a pressure that had previously driven his work. Thus ""40 Below"" lets him tell a story of lost love that doesn't carry the burden of representing some sort of larger structural critique, or the obligation to wake up the world. Jenkins had painted himself in a bit of a corner, and <i>Wave[s] </i><span>is a sly sidestep, an exploration of possibility from an artist whose overriding purpose had previously eliminated that opportunity. Jenkins could risk didacticism, but it was his willingness to do so that initially cultivated such a loyal following; </span><i>Wave[s]</i><span> gives him an opportunity to shake those who may have valued his work only inasmuch as it provided that function.</span></p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Wave[s]</i> isn't as strong as <i>The Water(s)</i>, and may ultimately be seen as a bit minor in Jenkins' catalog. His biggest strength as an artist is his pen: as a writer, Jenkins has a gift for poetic turns of phrase and clever wordplay, delivered with potent urgency. The level of applied skill in his writing—the work that suggests he could one day rival some of rap's biggest names in a larger arena—hasn't quite been applied to his songwriting. His choruses are things like: ""Get Up, Get Out, Get Down!"", bordering on blank cliches in need of workshopping. Even ""Your Love""—the album's far-away highlight, with the potential to cross over—interpolates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"">Lupe Fiasco</a> for its ingratiating hook. Meanwhile, THEMpeople provide a vigorous experimental backdrop, but relative to the style's jazzy vanguard—think the Los Angeles world of Low End Theory parties, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a>—the group is still establishing its voice, working toward a unique approach.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that the album is a failure, or that Jenkins' new direction is a bad one; if anything, it points to an artistic flexibility that will pay dividends down the road. The room to grow is there, should he decide to pursue the colors <i>Wave[s] </i><span>has opened up for him. The artistic success of ""Your Love"" suggests he has the right instincts, even if the execution is, for now, more of an exploration than a destination.</span></p></div>"|20922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20922-mick-jenkins-waves/|7.6|David Drake

They're maybe the only modern metal band to earn accolades from both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"">Darkthrone</a>'s Fenriz (one of their earliest supporters as a part of his ""Band of the Week"" feature) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8214-dave-grohl/"">Dave Grohl</a> (who has played with them live and produced their covers EP <i>If You Have Ghost</i>). Ghost's main appeal is not only their throwback sound, but also their presentation, which combines black metal's anonymity with a theatrical, sometimes silly macabre bent only slightly removed from King Diamond. Even if we didn't ask for a new Kiss, Ghost is just that.</p>
<p>But if their 2013 sophomore album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17807-ghost-bc-infestissumam/""><i>Infestissumam</i></a><i> </i>was supposed to be metal's second commercial coming, there couldn't have been a worse album to place that expectation upon. <i>Opus Eponymous</i>, their unabashedly derivative 2010 debut, at least had solid hooks. There's that whole thing about catching more flies with honey than vinegar, but vinegar is a crucial ingredient of metal. With <i>Meliora</i>, their third full-length, they've dropped the temporary B.C. from their name and returned to a heavier direction, ditching most of the lite Mercyful Fate/Blue Öyster Cult hybrid for more folk and Deep Purple influences. It's far and away a more engaging record than <i>Infestissumam</i>, but still, you have to wonder if Ghost should be metal's new chief representative.</p>
<p>Commending a metal record for having an upfront guitar sound seems unnecessary; that said, Andy Wallace's mixing was what Ghost needed, and now their desire for the metal big-time at least has a fitting production. Ghost also stepped up when writing more aggressive material befitting of the menace they wish to breed. While opener ""Spirit"" takes its time kicking in, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tdlg2JXuaQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""From the Pinnacle to the Pit""</a> has that drive sorely missing from <i>Infestissumam</i>. The choral breaks and aggressive organ drives, like Purple in their prime, contrast so well, their fullest realization of ""seductive Satanism"" so far. And even if the Rainbow groove and driving bassline aren't anywhere close to new, some things still work decades later for a reason.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ao4t_fe0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cirice""</a> was a wise choice for a first single, a combination of familiar strengths given new life. Again, the contrast of somber acoustic guitars and foreboding strings has been used time and time again, but it's just the launching pad for the song's main riff. In metal, it's very difficult to write a compelling midpaced song—Tom G. Warrior and Dimebag Darrell are among the few to not be cursed—so that Ghost gets that rare boogie right is enough of an accomplishment. ""Majesty""'s intro must have been lifted straight from Deep Purple's <i>Perfect Strangers</i>, oozing blusey swagger that Ghost has never tapped into before. Ghost's presentation works better in a live setting with a powerful PA, and that song has all the potential to become a live staple.</p>
<p><i>Meliora</i> also reveals the limitations of Ghost's vocalist, who this time is the third incarnation of satanic pope Papa Emeritus. (Part of Ghost's gimmick is that each Papa Emeritus ""dies"" and is succeeded by a different Papa Emertius with every album, even though it is, in fact, the same vocalist.) His soft approach to incantations is apt for ""He Is"", which shows off the folkier side of Ghost. Otherwise, it can't keep up with his Nameless Ghouls (the name of the Ghost ""band""). For all of ""Mummy Dust""'s strengths, as it plays with the loud-soft dynamics in a spookier way, a little more drama in the vocals would have really brought it to its full potential. There are plenty of moments where you wish Papa wouldn't just coast on a croon, but would instead let out a maniacal laugh or scream.</p>
<p>That goes back to the central problem of <i>Infestissumam</i>: no matter how accessible you want to be, metal is nothing without a little tough confidence. Granted, getting compared to King Diamond must get old by now. That doesn't mean Papa Emeritus III couldn't vary it up, whether he wants to take it up himself or bring in a rival Pope with a different vocal range. (It'd add to the stage show.) In ""Pinnacle"", he brings a little snarl to his delivery, which should have been applied more liberally throughout the record. Papa Emeritus also doesn't add much to closer ""Deus in Absentia"", which makes the song feel twice as long as it actually is, and ends up being the weakest track on the whole.</p>
<p>Except for ""Pinnacle"", ""Majesty"", and ""Cirice"", none of these songs feel essential or ready for headlining festival slots. That brings us to the ultimate question around <i>Meliora</i> and Ghost in general: What are they bringing to metal, especially for those who are not super into the underground? Say what you will about hair metal's shred pyrotechnics and blatant bubblegum tendencies, it at least brought something new to mainstream metal. Grunge was not the anathema to metal as is the popular narrative, but actually reaffirmed Black Sabbath's status as metal masters by taking more from them than most bands before. Since then? Most of the innovation and excitement has gone underground. So, what is Ghost doing, exactly? Is metal so desperate for a commercial force that we're willing to accept a crooning Pope as our savior? Is Ghost for Kiss fans who want their kids to have another Kiss, instead of something new? When the cloak comes off—and it will, sooner or later—there may not be much left behind. Ghost don't deserve outright scorn that hellishly opinionated metal fans can dish and dish, and <i>Meliora</i> is a step in the right direction, but their pandering can only go so far, and even then, it might be misguided.</p></div>"|20899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20899-meliora/|6.2|Andy O'Connor

Her strong Welsh accent puts her at a curious remove, and she allows the guitars and organs that shape her songs to thrash, but only within strictly drawn boundaries, like Television riffs remade as repeating patterns. Her music has the sense of being just so, which seems to be in her nature: 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18716-cate-le-bon-mug-museum/""><i>Mug Museum </i></a>governed memory as a clearly labeled archive.</p>
<p>Le Bon moved to L.A. to make that album, enlisting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a> touring member Nick Murray on drums. Two years later, she's teamed up with his bandmate Tim Presley as DRINKS, a collaboration (that they'd rather bill as a four-legged solo project) born of a lot of time spent ""playing guitar and laughing manically at each other."" Rather than merge their respective psych sensibilities, they've stripped away the pop fabric—White Fence's dusky harmonies, Le Bon's delicate organ refrains—to muck around in primitive territory, recasting themselves as outsiders.</p>
<p>As consummate musicians and students of pop, Le Bon and Presley aren't able to revert to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3751-shaggs/"">Shaggs</a>-like naivete, but they're able to suspend their aesthetes' sensibility in order to embrace chaos, even silliness. There's unmistakable precedent to the sound where they meet, the dub inflections and buzzing guitar welts. <i>Hermits</i> evokes the captivating disconnect of a late-'70s John Peel show, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">the Slits</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1273-delta-5/"">Delta 5</a> segued into <i>Strictly Personal</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Beefheart</a>'s blues-pop abstractions—you half expect to hear Ivor Cutler pop up to recite a poem in between tracks.</p>
<p>Opener ""Laying Down the Rock"" is a bit of a red herring. It's the most formed song here, a shaggy but highly strung garage plodder that doesn't shine with the wonder of discovery. “Focus on the Street”, though, begins a process of stretching rock's fabric loose. The verse runs on an insistent buzzsaw riff and clipped vocal incantations, the picture of no-wave austerity. Where the duo should break into some kind of lambasting, art-damaged chorus, they drift into hairy freeform guitar, like hippies pranking a White Columns crowd. ""Cannon Mouth"" sounds like Le Bon impersonating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a> through a snorkel; ""She Walks So Fast"" remakes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a>'s ""Picnic on a Frozen River, Deuxième Tableaux"" as splayed British post-punk, Presley yelping ""rock'n'roll!"" amidst the burly twang.</p>
<p>True to its creation, humor courses through <i>Hermits</i>, and rescues a few outlandish moments. ""Tim, Do I Like That Dog"" is almost seven minutes of Le Bon repeatedly asking Presley just that, bringing levity to the frankly hard-going music: strangled guitar scribble that thins to a single piercing note. The few audible lyrics that leap out elsewhere are funny, too, if completely inscrutable. The title track sounds like a reedy cuckoo clock, and marks times such as ""Six past the eight—copulate."" A glance at the muddled liner notes makes it seem like ""Cannon Mouth"" could be a song about austerity politics, privilege, and protest (""If you don't know what I'm on about/ Then you'll never want to scream and shout""), but Le Bon and Presley never make anything obvious. Only ""Cheerio"" veers too far into the unknown, stranding the listener among shrill proto-synth explorations.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Hermits on Holiday</i> is pretty spontaneous and free-form, but it rarely lapses into the stuff of jam-band nightmares. An interviewer recently <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/white-fence-and-cate-le-bon-make-a-pretty-stiff-drink"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked</a> Le Bon and Presley whether they intended <i>Hermits</i> to be a psych album. ""I don't even know what those words mean anymore,"" Le Bon replied. Instead, the pair play like kids trying to light a fire with sticks and flint: there's a distant possibility something might take, but really it's all about the thrill of scrubbing around in the dirt.</p></div>"|20759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20759-hermits-on-holiday/|7.8|Laura Snapes

At that time, Napalm Death, Carcass, Unseen Terror, and others had significantly upped heavy metal's ante by combining thrash and death metal with hardcore, crust- and anarcho-punk at inhumanly fast tempos to create what would eventually come to be known as grindcore. This new movement represented a kind of logical endpoint beyond which it seemed impossible to push. After all, how could music get any heavier than the unremitting abrasion of Napalm Death's first two in-studio <a href=""https://youtu.be/PfPeYD49oY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appearances on the John Peel show</a>?</p>
<p>So, as much as this music shook up existing boundaries, it made sense to assume that grindcore would flame out as a novelty trend after about five years due to lack of innovation. And yet, almost three decades later, we have to marvel at the breadth of a genre that has done the opposite of stagnate. Modern acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/716-cephalic-carnage/"">Cephalic Carnage</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5311-pig-destroyer/"">Pig Destroyer</a>, <a href=""https://antigamaband.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Antigama</a>, and many others have brought myriad new dimensions to the form, and they continue to infuse metal with a sense of limitless possibility. Among them, Fuck the Facts has become so adept at stretching grindcore's parameters that one almost detects a sense of gamesmanship in the way the Ottawa-Gatineau quintet switches styles two dozen times in a single song—often in the span of two minutes or less.</p>
<p>The latest Fuck the Facts offering <i>Desire Will Rot</i><span> begins, seductively enough, in fairly standard full-blast mode. But it isn't long—28 seconds, to be exact—before the band's penchant for nuance rears its head. Double-bass drum volleys, pogo-inducing ""death'n'</span>roll"" crunch reminiscent of Entombed, crossover thrash riffs, powerviolence, guttural hardcore, Yngwie Malmsteen-worthy guitar solos, and jazzy off-time grooves all come to brief fruition before melting away into whatever complementary shade of metal the band chooses next.</p>
<p><span>This segmented approach has typified metal since (if not before) Death’s Chuck Schuldiner employed jazz fusion-loving members of Cynic for 1991’s death-prog classic </span><i>Human</i><span>, but</span> it isn’t staggering technical agility alone that distinguishes Fuck the Facts as exceptional. The real coup here is that <i>Desire Will Rot</i><span> never gives you whiplash because it doesn’t actually contain hairpin turns. Take a moment to let that sink in: to make this music flow to this degree requires an almost supernatural instinct for cohesion. That instinct, on display in spades here, is what arguably positions Fuck the Facts at grindcore's cutting edge. This is all the more impressive considering this album was actually recorded three years ago. </span></p>
<p>Originally intended for release as the main-course companion to the 2013 EP <a href=""https://fuckthefacts.bandcamp.com/album/amer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Amer</i></a>, <i>Desire Will Rot</i> does bear some similarities to the style and tone of <i>Amer</i>’s seven songs, but it leans far less in the straight-ahead melodic-metal vein the band first explored on 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12392-disgorge-mexico/""><i>Disgorge Mexico</i></a>. Even those who are well familiar with <i>Amer</i> or the FTF catalog as a whole wouldn’t immediately think to connect the two releases. <i>Desire Will Rot</i> was conceived and recorded just two years after Fuck the Facts solidified its current five-piece lineup in time to make the joint LP/EP set <i>Die Miserable</i> and <i>Misery</i> (both released on the same day in 2011). The recent <a href=""https://fuckthefacts.bandcamp.com/album/split-with-fistfuck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">split-LP</a> with Fistfuck, released this past May, gives us a glimpse into where FTF might be headed in the future, but it’s easy to see why the band is pushing <i>Desire Will Rot</i>, easily the more expansive of the two titles, as its quote-unquote actual new album.</p>
<p><i>Desire Will Rot</i><span> captures a band that spent significant time gelling and growing as a creative unit. Where Fuck the Facts started out as a quasi-solo vehicle for bandleader-guitarist-engineer Topon Das, these days every member is expected, even required, to contribute to the writing process. It’s not often that we can describe a three-minute song as ""epic,"" but the winding twists and turns of a tune like ""</span><span>Solitude""</span><span> suggest that a bunch of cooks </span><span>can</span><span> work together in the same kitchen without stepping on one another’s toes. Indeed, this five-piece incarnation marks the latest in a series of significant milestones in the band’s history, namely: the addition of frontwoman Mel Mongeon in 2002 and Mathieu Vilandré’s later switch from guitar to drums. Each of these changes has drastically increased the band’s pool of assets.</span></p>
<p>Mongeon, although she now shares vocal duties with bassist Marc Bourgon, remains one of grindcore’s most instantly-recognizable vocalists. Her lyrics hint at a sense of unease within the realm of identity that never explicitly references a worldview shaped by Quebec’s relationships with the rest of Canada and the U.S. Nevertheless, a hazy feeling of clawing for one’s place permeates this music and sets Fuck the Facts’ brand of angst apart not only from other grind acts, but also its own early work, which was characterized more by Das’ sardonic sense of humor. Not to be overlooked, Mongeon’s artwork makes the physical copy of <i>Desire Will Rot</i><span> worth owning for those who like the music enough to seek additional overtones in her sumptuous—even dazzlingly—grim, visuals.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Vilandré, meanwhile, serves as the ultimate dual-threat weapon. Ever since he moved behind the kit for 2006’s </span><i>Stigmata High-Five</i><span>, his precise, assertive style elevated Fuck the Facts from a dirty little underground act to upstart world-contender status. On </span><span><i>Desire Will Rot</i></span><span>, though, his </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/rcdVL1ZxwTc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>drumming</span></a><span> reaches a level of fluidity that’s rare even among the genre’s elite. Vilandré also contributes guitar parts, and his understanding of guitar no doubt contributes to this album’s seamlessness as Das and second guitarist Johnny Ibay’s parts spill forth in an endlessly churning outpour of riffs. By the time the album arrives at ""Circle"", its four-part ambient denoument, those riffs have touched on so many elements that the presence of cello, piano, and noise atmospheres hardly seems foreign or unexpected. Grindcore, as Fuck the Facts prove so ably on </span><i>Desire Will Rot</i><span>, can apparently accommodate any ingredients provided the artist has the imagination to support them.</span></p></div>"|20790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20790-desire-will-rot/|8.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

<p class=""p1"">Lynch and company have framed <i>Music For Dogs </i>as the playful, punkish cousin to last year’s similarly anxious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18919-gardens-villa-dunes/""><i>Dunes</i></a>, with guitars and piano that temporally situate the record somewhere on the cusp of the '80s (the lush art-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a> are the most obvious musical touchstones). Indeed, <i>Music for Dogs </i>sounds more kinetic than past efforts, thanks to the group's incorporation of light-footed, plunky pianos (""Express"") and ever-so-mathy bridges (""Everybody""). At the same time, there’s a lukewarm quality to the jams (which, despite three- and four-minute runtimes, sound twice as long): the guitars are thin, the drum beats flimsy, the vocals frequently obfuscated by a droning synth or a similar effect. It’s as though Ben Folds attempted to create to Eno's <i>Here Come the Warm Jets </i>while under the influence of sleeping pills.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Considering their previous revelations regarding the album’s reactionary origins, it should come as no surprise that Gardens &amp; Villa get more introspective on <i>Music for Dogs</i>. Crushing loneliness and urban ennui loom overhead like storm clouds—a compelling thematic juxtaposition against the manic singsongs of ""Jubilee"" and ""Everybody"". Frequently, these themes manifest in the form of dark, moody new wave. ""Alone in the City"" contextualizes a scene of Los Angelean longing in the terms of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10546-tears-for-fears/"">Tears for Fears</a>, and ""Maximize Results"" sounds like Boy George having a panic attack.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Midway through the album on ""General Research"", Lynch turns the mirror on us, lamenting the various ways in which technology has torn art (and life, for that matter), asunder… or something like that. His lines are meant to scan as introspective and metaphorical, but clunkers like ""Working for the blogs/ Searching for the savior/ Music for the malls"" and ""Vaporizing cigarettes/ Reverential productions/ Following down the rabbit hole"" transmogrify any earnestness into hilarity. Gardens &amp; Villa’s self-conscious, spindling attempts at regression and societal contemplation are admirable and occasionally catchy, but there are so many other albums<i>—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18667-arcade-fire-reflektor/"">Reflektor</a>, Kid A</i>, even the oft-maligned, ahead-of-its-time <i>Metal Machine Music—</i>that navigate the intricacies of technology and society more compellingly and less heavy-handedly that you can’t help but write it off as another brick in the firewall.</p></div>"|20969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20969-music-for-dogs/|4.7|Zoe Camp

But her voice is the thread that holds it all together, and once the album has finished, tied off with a ribbon of wailing trombone, it's her voice you remember most. Crystalline and unerring in pitch, it dominates the album,<span> both solo and in multi-tracked close harmonies that radiate an eerie glow, like pyrite glinting through fog. It's not hard to imagine that an a capella version of this album would be captivating all on its own.</span></p>
<p>This is Deradoorian's debut solo album, but she has played a key role in a number of arty, ambitious indie rock projects: She played bass and sang in Dave Longstreth's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a> in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/""><i>Bitte Orca </i></a>years, and she's one third of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32072-avey-tares-slasher-flicks/"">Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks</a>, the most recent side project of Animal Collective's Dave Portner. As a singer, she's also worked with Vampire Weekend, Charli XCX, Flying Lotus, U2, and Matmos, a list that suggests an unusually robust  versatility. She began releasing her own music in 2009, with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12995-mind-raft/""><i>Mind Raft </i>EP</a>, but the new album represents a quantum leap in complexity and ambition. <i>The Expanding Flower Planet</i> feels like an album full of trap doors, where a single, unexpected sound can deposit you into new worlds.</p>
<p>Playing the bulk of the music herself, with help from two drummers and a handful of backup vocalists, Deradoorian explores krautrock rhythms, microtonal tunings, and various Eastern scales, including those of her Armenian heritage. And she lets those scales dictate a melodic line that takes her far away from the hidebound formula of indie's usual four-bar chord changes. ""A Beautiful Woman"" begins as a garage-soul rave-up and then explodes into the eerie, cascading harmonies of the Black Sea region; ""Your Creator"" stacks ghostly chords to the heavens and trips up and down their intervals, a dizzying game of chutes and ladders.</p>
<p>The album's title comes from a Chinese mandala tapestry that hung in Deradoorian's studio, and, accordingly, she wrestles with big, metaphysical themes: elemental forces, catacombs and mosaics, hearts and eyes, clutching and binding, love and knowledge, and above all, oneness. The theme of self-actualization runs from the first song's daily affirmations (""Beautiful woman/ You're the one I wanna be"") to the last song's healing mantra (""Love/ Grow/ Love… Grow grow grow grow grow""). But the focus is rarely narrative; the lyrics tend to operate like koans, spells, small tokens supercharged with symbolic power. The quest for knowledge drives it all. ""How do you know?/ Who can tell the truth?"" asks ""DarkLord"". In the title song she sings, ""We all know much more than we really think we know,"" and in ""Grow"", that idea becomes a question:"" How do we learn so we can all teach?""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And then there's ""Komodo"", probably the only song you'll hear this year that seems at least nominally to be about a Komodo dragon attack (""Komodo coming through/ Run for your lives/ Run for the hills/ Don't close your eyes""). It contains some of the album's most vivid lyrics, particularly in a cooing chorus whose dulcet tone contradicts its stark imagery (""Drone/ Between the grass/ The blades are rough/ Your metal skin/ Protects your hunt/ Death is in your clutch""). Despite this reptilian foray, though, the album's wide-angled macro perspective suggests that Deradoorian's true spirit animal is likelier to be a hawk or an eagle.</span></p>
<p>There is an aching sense of space in her music: with her soaring vocals leading the way, her arrangements begin to suggest patchworks of fields and freeways and mountains and beaches as seen from above. ""I love the beauty of the state, but there's a whole other aspect of it that I struggle with,"" she told <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2015/08/14/artist-of-the-month-deradoorian/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Self-Titled magazine</a> of her attempt to come to grips with California's sprawl. As she wends her unpredictable way up and away, through strange intros and outros and across mantra-like choruses and far above bridges to nowhere, she offers a bird's-eye view of a landscape unlike any other, a place at once familiar, as though half-remembered from a dream, and spellbindingly alien.</p></div>"|20939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20939-the-expanding-flower-planet/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

The short time between the Memphis punks' extraordinary debut <i>Teenage Hate</i> and their new album had apparently taken a toll. ""In the past year all innocence, all naiveness, and all kindness has all but been sucked out of my heart, my mind, and my soul,"" he wrote in the liner notes. By 1999, he'd already started to alienate some of the people around him. Guitarist Sean Redd stopped regularly hanging out with Jay outside of Reatards shows and only played on <i>Grown Up, Fucked Up</i> because Jay asked him. Jay once noted that about 27 different people had been Reatards at some point; the turn-around rate was significant.</p>
<p>There's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3sbcaQENX0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">footage</a> of Reatards playing a Reno basement in 1999, which offers a pretty good illustration of his live presence at the time. He screams and thrashes everywhere, hitting the floor and smashing himself in the head multiple times. He chokes himself with the mic cable. He'd just been dumped; he is not kind when he described her in his between-songs banter. ""I use [sic] to be a nice caring sweet kid that everyone loved,"" he wrote in the album's liner notes. ""Now I'm just fucked and no one can fucking stand me."" <i>Grown Up, Fucked Up</i> is about making the final transition from sweet-faced little Jimmy Lee Lindsey to Jay Reatard. There was no going back—from then on, he was that shrieking figure writhing on the Reno basement floor.</p>
<p>On <i>Grown Up</i>, Jay's chaotic rage is the driving force behind most of the songs. His enemies list on the record includes Led Zeppelin fans and the entire city of Memphis. On ""No One Stands Me"", Jay posits himself as a ""dirty motherfucker,"" growling and screaming. Many of these songs are about feeling like the perpetual other. ""I'm gonna break down,"" he repeatedly sings in one of the album's best hooks. It's ironic that this declaration is the album's closing sentiment (before the bonus cuts on <a href=""https://www.goner-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goner</a>'s new reissue)—he seems to have been going through a loud, violent breakdown all along.</p>
<p>Of all of Jay's many projects, Reatards are among the most primitive. While speed punk jams like ""Sat. Night Suicide"" and ""Eat Your Heart Out"" reinforce that idea, there are moments that begin to take it apart and predict where Jay would travel next. ""Blew My Mind"" is all muscular guitar and gang vocals right up until the bridge, when handclaps enter and the power-chord melody takes on a saccharine sheen. In glints, you can see the the aggressive-but-catchy sound he'd master on <i>Blood Visions.</i></p>
<p>The middle of the album bogs down a little bit, with hooks and performances that blend into each other. The three bonus tracks from the 1999 ""You're So Lewd"" 7"" feel tacked-on and inessential. Their cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0_6xHHUqjM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Persuaders' ""Heart of Chrome""</a> is sluggish when stacked next to songs like ""Sick When I See"" and ""Sat. Night Suicide"". But even when this album's on the downswing, the Reatards are still screaming, blaring, and ferocious. Sometimes they trudge and sometimes they sprint, but they are always effective.</p>
<p>Jay Reatard pushed people's buttons, but he was beloved. This love shines through in the reissue's liner notes, which feature tributes from Goner Records' Eric Freidl and Empty Records' Meghan Smith. Both remember him for who he was—a frustrated teenager who broke disco balls and sought refuge in rock'n'roll. He was an incredible performer—an unhinged presence whose emotions seemed to be spilling out from all sides at all times. It's been five years since he died, and while many artists make angry rock'n'roll in the Reatards' wheelhouse, Jay's absence is felt. Many have tried, but <i>nobody</i> screams like that.</p></div>"|20940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20940-grown-up-fucked-up/|7.9|Evan Minsker

Singing unhurried minor-key songs burnished with horns, weeping organs, and steel guitar, Parker traffics in a twilit Americana, drifting between <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent</a>'s sun-drunk aphorisms and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/923-castanets/"">Castanets</a>' moonlit chill. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The man at the helm here is an itinerant writer and musician named Mangham ""Monk"" Parker. He went by Parker Noon in the early '00s, when he was based out of New York City and played with his then-girlfriend in a duo called Parker &amp; Lily. After their breakup he relocated to Athens and launched <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4949-the-low-lows/"">the Low Lows</a>, a rotating collective of musicians with its name taken from a Parker &amp; Lily album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For the last five years Parker's lived in Austin, where he put together his latest band. The credits to <i>How the Spark Loves the Tinder</i> list 20-some players and several recording studios in New York (including NY Hed, the studio run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2205-the-jon-spencer-blues-explosion/"">Jon Spencer</a> collaborator Matt Verta-Ray) and Austin (including Parker's home), and it feels more ambitious and more fully realized than any of his earlier work. Perhaps that's the reason for Parker's current moniker and why <i>Spark</i> is billed by his label, UK-based <a href=""http://bronzerat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bronze Rat</a>, as a debut.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Parker's lyrics read like poetry, with images of floating stars and nighttime winds and endless skies. ""Idle in Idlewild"", at seven-some minutes the longest song on the album, contains this perfect triplet: ""Some strange April/ When all the stars stall and stay still/ And the days fly by."" Parker practically gives each word its own breath.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The arrangements are rich in color and nuance: Opener and lead single ""Sadly Yes"" builds from a dirge to a big, brassy climax over nearly six minutes, achieving hard-fought catharsis while a Theremin-like wail cuts through. A mournful, elegant suite of clarinet and strings opens ""I Am a Gun"" before it segues into a kind of chamber-country waltz. There's an extended moment in the middle of ""The Happy Hours"", a song ostensibly about existential dread in Rapid City, Iowa, where horns and strings assume a density as vast and uplifting as an orchestra.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For all of this life-affirming beauty, the album's operative emotional state is resignation. Parker's songs find solace in the ability to accept defeat—lost love, unfulfilled potential—and present this ability as a form of wisdom. This is the sort of mind state achieved only from age and experience. Far from depressing, the exquisite dejection of <i>How the Spark Loves the Tinder</i> is almost celebratory. After all, you can't fight the changing seasons.  </p></div>"|20920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20920-how-the-spark-loves-the-tinder/|7.7|Jonathan Zwickel

Phonte, the group’s affable frontman, feeds <a href=""https://twitter.com/phontigallo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Twitter stream</a> with acerbic real talk and hot-take movie reviews. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NicolayMusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On Facebook</a>, producer Nicolay posts videos of bobblehead dolls in his studio, and jokes about his paltry royalty checks from streaming services. After 11 years together, and several albums of grown folks' soul, it seems the two aren’t taking themselves too seriously. They're having fun and don't mind bringing you into the fold.<i><b></b></i></p>
<p><i>Tales from the Land of Milk and Honey </i>is a delightful collection of sophisticated R&amp;B and electronic dance, tied directly to the era of Morris Day funk grooves and Teddy Riley’s New Jack Swing. As it plays, Phonte, Nicolay, keyboardist <a href=""http://www.theforeignexchangemusic.com/zo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zo!</a>, and vocalists <a href=""http://www.iamcarmenrodgers.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carmen Rodgers</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/sophieblakmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tamisha Waden</a> recall the storied Minneapolis funk sound while staying true to their own established blend of Eurocentric electro-soul. In a way, <i>Milk and Honey</i> feels like a concept record: The press photos resemble a parody of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, and the title track evokes Sergio Mendes’ brand of airy Brazilian jazz. The lyrics pull from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>'s songbook of imagined utopias and peaceful horizons. Then suddenly, on ""Work It to the Top"", Phonte sings in a nasal tone that channels groups like Ready for the World and Cameo over a vintage, computerized-R&amp;B stomp.</p>
<p><i><b></b>Milk and Honey</i> moves swiftly and has the same radiant mood as 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18531-the-foreign-exchange-love-in-flying-colors/""><i>Love in Flying Colors</i></a>, the group’s previous album. But if <i>Colors</i> embraced the joy of a new relationship, <i>Milk and Honey</i> explores the comforts of sustained romance, where the urge to hit the club gives way to Netflix date nights and glasses of wine at the crib. ""Body"", a standout near the album’s end, says as much: ""Nowhere to go and it’s nothing on these streets,"" Phonte sings, who addressed a similar notion on his 2011 solo album, <a href=""http://www.theforeignexchangemusic.com/2011/08/phonte---charity-starts-at-home-official-cover-art-and-album-tracklist.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Charity Starts at Home</i></a>. The familiarity of the music is the best kind, and for anyone who has kept up closely with this project, it's both a joy and a comfort.</p>
<p>Ever since the group’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3321-connected/"">landmark debut</a>, the Foreign Exchange has evolved into a roving crew of musicians who specialize in adult contemporary soul. They tend to focus on the day-to-day aspects of love and life, which helps them stay connected with their cult followers, some of whom have kept up with the crew since its inception on Okayplayer. Overall, <i>Milk and Honey </i>is a victory lap and a nice step forward in the group’s creative progress. Or maybe it’s a two-step.</p></div>"|20945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20945-tales-from-the-land-of-milk-and-honey/|7.4|Marcus J. Moore

There are <i>two</i> such projects currently floating around, both by artists who seem not to have heard of each other before beginning their work. Noah Wall, who has been a conceptual artist since the late '90s, garnered some notice earlier this year for his project <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/driftlessrecordings/sets/noah-wall-live-at-guitar-center"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Live at Guitar Center</i></a>, which he recorded by surreptitiously wandering and capturing sounds in his local Guitar Center, archiving the furtive soloing and jamming of the customers testing amps, plinking at keyboards, fumbling out drum rolls. It was a noisy, blasting mess, and purposefully so, meant to evoke the sort of public-space cacophony that could make any agoraphobe tense up.</p>
<p>Danny Greenwald, working under the name Glassine, arrived at the same idea, completing his project a full year before Noah Wall's was released. He took his samples from two Guitar Centers, one in Brooklyn and another in Baltimore, where he lives and works, and produced a glimmering, soothing album from the results, with the jokey title <i>No Stairway</i>. The coincidence is remarkable, and <a href=""http://www.patient-sounds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patient Sounds</a>, the label issuing <i>No Stairway</i> on cassette, noted the remarkable fact of the two projects' coexistence in its press release.</p>
<p>But apart from the freaky timing, the two albums feel mostly like a testament to the sneaky centrality of a place like Guitar Center to much of young American musical life. For millions of instrument-playing kids, Guitar Center was a sort of local YMCA, an imperfect but important testing ground for life pursuits and passions. If Noah Wall's project felt a bit like an encroaching panic attack in a mall, Greenwald's feels like the dream of someone who fell asleep in the food court bench. It is murmuring, mostly soothing, verging on ambient. Greenwald is a composer, and he treats the samples he has collected as clay, conscripting them into a different context than they came from.</p>
<p>Truthfully, you can learn nothing about the nature of Guitar Center, or what it's like to spend time there, from listening to Greenwald's album, and that is a good thing. You can squint at the deep, hollow knocks of percussion on a track like ""Human Shield"" and imagine they came from amps being plugged in, microphones being clumsily brushed. But to do so seems to miss the point of listening entirely. This is an album to dilate the senses, not sharpen them. <i>No Stairway</i> is woozy and dreamlike, a collection of undulant and wordless pieces that pulse gently in free space. If the album has a genre, it would be somewhere between experimental dub—those reverberant percussive hits can't help but evoke sound-system associations—and new age. The fact that all of these sounds were compacted out of an unruly stream of data is impressive, and even a little bewildering, but the knowledge proves unnecessary.</p>
<p>The revelation of <i>No Stairway</i> turns out to be hearing how Greenwald coaxes these scuffs and shuffles so that they bloom quietly into pop songs. ""Hornet With a Halo"" and ""Sunruse Bench"" have lovelorn, sighing melodies, and sound like what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a> might be doing if he worked in lo-fi cassettes. The radiant ripple of keyboards on ""Human Shield"" turn out to be several layers of sound stacked on top of each other, some patched through old synths and played again and some looped. It is a remarkable simulation, built painstakingly from a thousand scraps, but it rings out in space as simple and immediate as a hand pressed down on keys. The major-key melodies are warm, generous, and refracted through a fisheye-lens mix so that they feel slightly love-drunk. If you've ever closed your eyes in a room full of family and friends, letting the chatter blur so that you sense the surrounding goodwill more than you pick out the words, then <i>No Stairway</i> will have an uncannily familiar feel.</p>
<p>Like many late-'90s big-box music retailers—Sam Goody, Tower Records—Guitar Center is a relic of a different, largely pre-Internet commercial era. Wandering into one today, you feel the same sense of impending economic doom you get from pushing open the glass doors of a Best Buy or Radio Shack. It has been in grave financial trouble for years, and is on pace to <a href=""http://www.ericgarland.co/2015/02/03/end-guitar-center/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">die a slow, ignominious death</a>. Projects like Greenwald and Wall's, then, provide a slight redemptive note to the timeline, quiet reminders that millions of music-loving souls passed through those big doors at one point or another.</p></div>"|20803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20803-no-stairway/|7.2|Jayson Greene

The hook is a moan: ""Mmm, papi pacify."" The lyrics are about the tension of desire, but the </span><span><i>mise en scen</i>e</span><span> is power. </span><span>On the cover of her third EP </span><i>M3LL155X</i><span>, twigs echoes this gesture, staring at us as her own hand merges into her face. Once again, her gaze is discomfiting and impossible not to return. A glassy-voiced singer refracting melody through diffuse electronic beats, </span><span>twigs takes the familiar R&amp;B star as her avatar, but her presentation is more complex: her ideas mar beauty and mine power, and exalt sex without exotifying.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">She develops these ideas further on <i>M3LL155X</i>, a five-song EP accompanied by a 16-minute music video/film that dropped last week, just over a year after the release of twigs' high profile debut, <i>LP1</i>. As a creative package the EP is unimpeachable; a high-concept, intellectually curious project that's evocative, accessible and transgressive enough to satisfy the competing demands of a newly broadened fanbase and her existing audience of Tumblr-educated aesthetes. <i>M3LL155X</i> (pronounced 'Melissa') builds on her previous work, exploring ideas of dominance and submission and drilling down almost completely into the self.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In the video for ""Figure 8"", a song about life and birth, twigs uses a prosthesis to appear pregnant, stepping and spinning while clutching her belly. The title of the track, produced with Beyonce's <i><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7a0a416a-4390-b6b6-2435-011686856abf"">Beyoncé</span></i> ace Boots, is derived from the detailed handwork voguers use to frame their faces as they dance, as twigs explained  i<a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/fka-twigs-breaks-down-every-track-from-her-new-ep-m3ll155x?utm_campaign=musictw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">n an interview with Complex</a>.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>What lyrics might not make explicit, her videos and movement do: illuminating the multifarious ways in which a woman — a black woman — understands and owns her body, sexuality and creativity. The film accompanying </span><i>M3LL155X</i><span> opens on the wrinkled, smiling face of restaurateur and creative icon <span id=""docs-internal-guid-7a0a416a-4390-1e3c-8942-19a740d5850b""><span>Michèle Lamy,</span></span> who is tattooed, older and unbothered, and the muse and partner to fashion designer Rick Owens. Later, twigs moves through vignettes that show her as a sex doll, seductress, pregnant, in the club with her girls, being watched by a man as she dances solo to trembling down a runway with a crew of voguers. The mood flips between the skin-crawling sci-fi of Jonathan Glazer's succubus film </span><span>Under The Skin</span><span> and the bubblegum spunk of early '00s girl groups like 3LW and Cleopatra.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What twigs is interested in, above all, is mastery. Her idea of mastery involves ownership of her craft, but is mindfully tempered with the knowledge that she is one of many voices. twigs appears to understand that mainstream culture pins her as artist zero for voguing (</span><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2997337/Is-style-ll-wearing-summer-Baby-hair-latest-beauty-trend-hit-catwalks-featured-Katy-Perry-FKA-Twigs.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>and baby hairs</span></a><span>) and she counters cultural myopia by continually naming her teachers and collaborators: Wet Wipez, Benjamin Milan, Derek Prodigy. She maintains co-producer credits on her tracks (although, as MIA, Bjork and Missy Elliott have noted of their work, credit often goes to the men who produce with her, like Tic and Arca). For some, it matters profoundly that twigs centers black men in her videos. We increasingly see twigs behind the camera as director as well (in addition</span><span>to many of her recent videos, she developed </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99YyWeqHaBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>that crazy piece for Google Glass</span></a><span> as well).</span></p>

That seems like a lifetime ago. Back then, as a signee of Ludacris' label, Disturbing Tha Peace, with one hit single to his credit (which was heavily indebted to its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBx-M2oRBLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Lil Wayne feature</span></a>), his boasts were discernibly smaller. Still, it was easy to hear his talent working. Even then he was an expert at making basic rap colorful and comical (on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb6UyzOEBhM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stunt""</a>: ""The feet on the whip, big like Jurassic Park/ The car tall, to get in you need a running start""). By the time 2010's <i>Trap-A-Velli 2</i> arrived, the rapper was a free agent, and it felt like he was campaigning to be a star, swaggering a bit bigger on record while carefully floating around an alternate moniker. The following year brought the name change and with it came the breakthrough, completing one of the more successful rebrands in rap history. Shortly thereafter, he landed the rap trifecta: a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dqgr0wNyPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmZvOhHF85I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feature</a> run, a <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/2-Chainz-TRU-REALigion-mixtape.265920.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">signature mixtape</a>, and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17092-based-on-a-tru-story/"">#1 debut</a>.</p>
<p>The third installment in the series, <i>Trap-A-Velli Tre</i>, comes at a very different time for 2 Chainz. After becoming a chart mainstay for much of the '10s, he's fighting to remain relevant in a crowded field. His 2013 sophomore album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18562-2-chainz-boats-ii-me-time/""><i>B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time</i></a>, was shut out by urban radio: Not only did it sell significantly less than its predecessor, it also failed to chart a single in either the Billboard Top 40 or the Rap Top 10. (Four of his previous five singles hit both of those marks.) For a rapper that relies on visibility as much as 2 Chainz does, that's a pretty sizable blow. Last year, his solid<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19361-2-chainz-freebase-ep/""><i> FreeBase </i>EP </a>came and went without so much as a whimper, despite the stellar, single-ready <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjAP7EsPhIA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crib in My Closet""</a> with big name guests Rick Ross and A$AP Rocky. He's at the point in his career where stagnation could render him a footnote.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps 2 Chainz is aware of this, because on <i>Trap-A-Velli Tre</i>, for the first time in a very long time, he raps with real purpose. These aren't the phoned-in raps from failed crossovers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7iLIAD27Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jessie J's ""Burnin' Up""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKqu2kH6cPw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TeeFLii's ""24 Hours""</a>. 2 Chainz has always been naturally charismatic, and it's an integral part of his shtick, but his true talent is measuring the weight of a goofy punchline. When he raps ""Get so much pussy I go to sleep with a condom on"" on ""A Milli Billi Trilli"", it comes after a string of considerably less ridiculous jokes  and it lands right before the hook, boosting its effectiveness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Good comedy sometimes requires a sharp eye for commentary, and on the tape's centerpiece, ""GOAT"", which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a>, he mixes in keen observations (""Mama's only child, the crackhouse was my daycare"") with goofy humor (""Aiming for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony""). <i>Trap-A-Velli Tre</i> often struggles to find that balance elsewhere. On a pair of Zaytoven-produced tracks, ""BFF"" and ""Starter Kit"", cringeworthy bars stick out like sore thumbs. His daughters pop up on ""Halo (Letter to My Unborn Son)"", a weird record written from the perspective of the fetus. There's a random bar about having enough land to find Sasquatch. Sixteen tracks means there is far too much room for filler. 2 Chainz isn't built to embellish.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8d7faf2d-4075-c3bd-d4a3-c6e173352df2""><span>Despite the overabundance of one-liners, it isn't all laughs on </span><i>Trap-A-Velli Tre</i><span>. There are several serious reminders that 2 Chainz still has real hit-making potential. The TM88-produced ""Big Meech Era"" staggers back in time through otherworldly synths and feedbacking 808s. ""Watch Out"" reinterprets the minimalism of OG Maco's ""U Guessed It"" and turns it into a full-on jam that can sustain itself for longer that six seconds. On ""Lapdance in the Trap House"", produced by Honorable C Note, he shouts some of his most graphic boasts (""Put a half a milli in an MCM bag/ Had that muthafucka looking pregnant!"") over deflating synth chords. If he can again harness his charm, he may just stick around awhile longer. </span></span></p></div>"|20926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20926-trap-a-velli-tre/|6.6|Sheldon Pearce

His most renowned work could be described as ""reality programming""—<i>Domestica</i>, <i>The Ugly Organ, </i>and <i>Black Out </i>played up the distasteful and compelling tics of their narcissistic leads to provide gripping conflict and perverse pleasure. His brief residency in Los Angeles coincided with his ""screenwriting"" period, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9323-happy-hollow/"">Happy Hollow</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10648-help-wanted-nights/"">Help Wanted Nights</a></i> creating self-contained, fictional cities filled with multi-dimensional characters and their questionable motivations (the libretto-assisted <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16291-i-am-gemini/"">I Am Gemini </a></i>was a one-off in musical theater). Since releasing music under his own name in 2010, Kasher has shifted to ""sitcoms""—as with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14685-the-game-of-monogamy/"">The Game of Monogamy</a></i> and <i>Adult Film</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1830-the-good-life/"">the Good Life</a>’s <i>Everybody’s Coming Down </i>softens his takes on modern life with gentle, PG-13 humor and a tremendous lessening of stakes.</p>
<p>Last year, Kasher turned 40 and toured behind a reissue of 2003's <i>The Ugly Organ</i><span>—a</span> means of celebrating his most beloved record and reckoning with a <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/music/tim-kasher-starts-his-second-act-with-the-good-lifes-everybodys-coming-down-7488037"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""perspective shift""</a> that made it difficult for him to relate to the guy who sang ""The Recluse"". And yet, present-day Kasher doesn’t achieve much distance from his brash, idealistic, and self-destructive former self, as the entirety of <i>Everybody’s Coming Down</i> puts the two in direct, unflattering comparison. While Kasher’s platitudes are presented as hard truths forged from experience, most of the time, it just sounds secondhand, scripts written by someone whose worldview has been shaped mostly by Cursive records.</p>
<p>There’s the inevitable talk of the futility of artistic expression<span>—</span>maybe <i>Burst and Bloom</i>'s ""Sink to the Beat"" and <i>The Ugly Organ</i>'s ""Art Is Hard"" were cynical, but there was convincing conflict between Kasher’s ego and his soul. The self-evisceration has given way to bellyaching on <i>Everybody’s Coming Down</i>. Rather than busting down the fourth wall and providing insider intel as to what happens in ""The Troubadour’s Green Room"", Kasher diffidently states what was always implied<span>—</span>he’s singing for any kind of attention and the only original thought results from two cliches soldered together as non sequitur<span>—""</span>I was chasing the big fish/ And all the wine and roses that come with it.""</p>
<p>There’s the inevitable talk of the futility of human coupling. As with <i>Happy Hollow</i>'s ""Big Bang"" and <i>Mama, I'm Swollen</i>'s ""Caveman"", ""How Small We Are"" sees procreation as a zero sum game with lyrics not punched-up enough for laughs nor plain enough to be anything anyone might actually say (""propagating teensy human beings is a must""). And there’s the inevitable talk of the futility of human existence itself (most notably ""Holy Shit""), with nearly every song finding some way to rehash the album title: ""With the proper dosage I can feed my ego/ Once the buzz wears off I feel so hollow""; ""Each ticker tape parade/ Is followed by a broom brigade""; ""Every candle lit for every god or cancer kid/ Has flickered out and no one ever heard the prayer""; ""If my body's a temple, it’s crumbling/ It can’t be renovated""; ""Another carousel through the nothingsphere""; ""Everybody’s riding the Ferris wheel/ And the pinnacle’s gorgeous...once the ride is done, they’re back in line again.""</p>
<p>The increasing generality of Kasher’s lyrics is matched by the Good Life’s evolution into a tuneful, spirited, but extremely conventional indie rock outfit. The plodding, bashed-out alt of ""Everybody"" or the friskier pop-punk of ""Holy Shit"" and ""Ad Nauseum"" are hooky enough and they’re the kind of songs you could hear every hour, on the hour just walking through Philadelphia or Boston these days. Kasher’s sardonic tone at least prevents them from anonymity, though the true highlights happen when he takes a supporting role<span>—</span>bassist Stefanie Drootin-Senseney’s aqueous vocals lend ""Diving Bell"" an eerie psychedelia and when its lyrics fail, a worldless, harmonized moan on ""The Troubadour’s Green Room"" properly evokes the weariness of a veteran half-assing it on stage while looking over a half-filled venue.</p>
<p>Cursive had been increasingly shearing off the nettlesome vocal tics and jagged edges of their prickly post-hardcore, while the Good Life had developed from Kasher’s nocturnal synth-pop project to a hearty Midwestern rock act—the distinction between the two has been all but eliminated at this point. And that’s what makes <i>Everybody’s Coming Down</i> disappointing in a way that 2012's seventh Cursive album <i>I Am Gemini</i> or the 2013 solo album <i>Adult Film</i> never managed. The Good Life had once felt like Tim Kasher’s necessary relief from Being Tim Kasher. Not that 2002's <i>Black Out</i> or 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year/"">Album of the Year</a></i> were lighthearted—but they could be cloaked in gothic hues or the assumption of fiction. But whether it’s Cursive or Good Life or Tim Kasher, it’s all sitcom at this point, his version of ""Mulaney"" or ""Mr. Robinson""<span>—</span>a barely fictionalized, deadened version of his own life starring him. Or, ""Shit Tim Says"".</p></div>"|20897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20897-everybodys-coming-down/|4.4|Ian Cohen

Frank could never quite come back. In 1965, under the aegis of producer Paul Simon and with the assistance of sideman Al Stewart, the Buffalo-born Frank cut a 10-song masterpiece of the transatlantic folk revival. Frank’s self-titled debut gathered together the requisite folk threads of his day and refashioned them with his steady picking and a tenor that lilted, even as it moped. Frank could be topical and timely, as on the Dylan social nod ""Don’t Look Back"", or he could web simple phrases and patterns into enigmatic, illusory anthems, as he did for ""My Name Is Carnival"". He made existential unease charming on ""Just Like Anything"", and he updated Bascom Lamar Lunsford’s ancient American banjo trot, ""I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground"", for a new generation of post-beatnik vagabonds.</p>
<p>Frank got to all of those feelings at once during ""Blues Run the Game"", reportedly the first song he ever finished and, for most, the sole perfect number that forms his entire legacy. On <i>The Complete Recordings</i>, <a href=""http://www.badabingrecords.com/2015/04/pre-order-jackson-c-frank-the-complete-recordings/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the most exhaustive assembly of his catalog to date</a>, Frank’s standard tellingly appears three times—at the start of <i>Jackson C. Frank</i>, in an extra tender 1968 take from John Peel’s radio show and in its reverb-enhanced, slide-gilded 7"" form.<i> </i>A mantra for those who can never outrun their own tail of perennial sadness, whether they catch a boat to England or try another city, it doubles as the perfectly tragic summary of Frank’s own life. Before his death in 1999, he would suffer impossible penury and injury and drift into anonymity, but he would never record another album. Frank, you could say, never outfoxed his self-diagnosis of perpetual blues.</p>
<p>A year before Frank made his auspicious but low-selling debut, he left the Northeast for London, where he became an influential implant in that scene’s vibrant and varied lot of writers and pickers. Though new to songwriting, he seemed one of the scene’s certain stars, carousing with the names of the day and soon signing a deal with Columbia. Though only in his early twenties, Frank had already survived a great amount of sadness. When he was 11 years old, a school furnace exploded, burning him and many classmates so badly that he spent months in the hospital. The incident seemed to trail and torment him his entire life, responsible in part for the shadow that hung over many of his songs and made them so immediate but also for the depression that debilitated him. Frank tried time and again to restart his career, just to fumble again. Only now, 16 years after his death, are we really learning that his slim output and tiny reputation stand as one of the great legacies and losses of a movement in which he has sometimes been considered but a blip.</p>
<p>In the five decades since Frank recorded his only proper album, a dozen efforts to revivify his catalog have come and gone, from covers by people like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06j1aPKPc-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bert Jansch</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGSogEdXsY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Mayer</a> to deluxe reissues. <i>The Complete Recordings</i> pairs those earlier excavation attempts with the latest finds from Frank’s fragmented archive, though much debate remains about just how complete this set is. <a href=""http://www.badabingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ba Da Bing</a> is issuing <i>Recordings</i> in conjunction with the arrival of <i><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=hngcBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jackson C. Frank: The Clear, Hard Light of Genius</a></i>, the most tender and authoritative biography on the singer to date. Befitting Frank’s entire career, though, the coordinated schedule hamstrings the set itself, as a truncated and badly edited essay serves as the surrogate for proper liner notes.</p>
<p>At least <i>Recordings</i> begins brilliantly, with Frank’s debut LP in its wonderful, remastered entirety. It then backtracks four years to the campus of Gettysburg College, where Frank and some friends slur through ""CC Rider"", creep through ""In the Pines"", and race through ""John Henry"". According to Mark Anderson, the friend with which Frank cut many of these songs, there were at least a dozen more, but it matters little. These collegiate curios mostly show us the roots of Frank’s musical development. They dovetail well with his ramshackle teenage take on ""Heartbreak Hotel"" (recorded in 1957, the year he met Elvis) and a 1960 session of folk standards Frank cut on the cheap back in Buffalo. He’s less a stylist on these standards than a teenager piecing together his toolkit; these songs would matter to his overall approach, yes, but these takes do not.</p>
<p>The jewels of <i>Recordings</i> come, in many cases, more than a decade after Frank’s debut, long after he and others had already tried to resuscitate his career. The scraps from his aborted follow-ups don’t hang together quite so well as his lone album, but taken together, they reaffirm and expand his general mystique. The terse, romantic existentialism of ""Cover Me With Roses"" overcomes the tawdry blues guitar beneath its chugging chords; a song about the raw deals we all make and deal with ""if you can,"" it adds pep and a bit of wit to the essential premise of ""Blues Run the Game"". ""Madonna of Swans"" is as graceful as the title suggests, with Frank’s lush chords and gentle harmonics lifting his wavering voice.</p>
<p>But it’s the loping ""Spanish Moss"", recorded in 1974, that haunts most. One of the brightest songs Frank ever cut, it is his preemptive <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwSZvHqf9qM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tangled Up in Blue""</a>. He details a romantic rendezvous that feels sinister in its execution—""She opened a picture of Lucifer in chains,"" he haltingly offers—and melancholy in its temporary necessity. ""Her hair hung like a sacrament,"" he relays, ""our bodies to begin."" It’s perhaps the most vivid narrative language in the emotional impressionist’s entire songbook, an unfulfilled promise for the possibility of the other scenes he may have soon set. ""Spanish Moss"" is sexual, sophisticated, and playful, the work of a writer who had momentarily shrugged aside his blues, even if he would never fully break their spell.</p>
<p>He didn’t, of course: During the next two decades, Frank sometimes found himself homeless or committed to sanitariums. He lost an eye in a senseless shooting but was eventually rescued by a fan who got him money from royalties and a new guitar. Some of the most poignant and compelling numbers in Frank’s oeuvre arrive at that point, nearly 20 years ago. In 1994, Jackson cut several songs in a proper studio, and the results rival the best material of his debut. ""October"" is a meditation on the judgment of the drunk and the way that time can never be captured. ""I Don’t Want to Love You No More"" is an attempt to deny the undeniable, a transmission from someone working to regain some semblance of sanity and civility. It’s like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubKUP8c0FHE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George Jones’ ""He Stopped Loving Her Today""</a> rewritten by the survivor. In these sunset songs, you can hear premonitions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/495-richard-buckner/"">Richard Buckner</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2221-damien-jurado/"">Damien Jurado</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a>, songwriters who would soon similarly mumble and croon their way to measures of success Frank never enjoyed.</p>
<p>By 1997, when Frank recorded a set of fragmentary songs and false starts in a kitchen, both his voice and verve had stiffened considerably. His late-life charm had faded. That material is hard to hear, really, as you can tell that Frank’s quest for redemption is slowly drifting into oblivion. The whole situation recalls one particularly excruciating passage from ""Goodbye (To My Loving You)"", my favorite Frank relic from 1994. ""Now that love is leaving,"" he ends one of his saddest, sharpest verses ever, his voice quaking, ""there’s nothing left to show."" Nearly three decades later, blues would finally end the game, he seemed to say, just as they had run it for so long.</p></div>"|20865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20865-the-complete-recordings-of-jackson-c-frank/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

In the first song alone, there are quiet touches that emerge with time—how the violin part floats upward, the extra guitar notes picked out towards the conclusion—testifying to the quiet power of a carefully detailed performance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wilcox began Ancient Warfare as a solo project in 2010, with the encouragement of Shangri-La Productions' Duane Lundy, who serves as this record's producer and engineer. By now, she has assembled a powerful lineup: the muffled, reverbed punch of Emily Hagihara's drumming on ""Dreamcatcher"" loosely evokes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzhbGaCwBzs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Be My Baby""</a>, while Wilcox intones ""dream"" like a woozy afterecho of the Everly Brothers, even as the arrangement gets noisier. Hagihara also contributes piano, bass, and vocals on nearly every track, while Rachael Yanarella's violin work serves as both melodic counterpoint and ghostly atmosphere.</p>
<p>But Wilcox remains the center of the band, exuding a cool confidence in her singing and playing. Hers is the kind of rich voice that blends beautifully into the arrangements even while you yearn to hear more of it on it's own. The entire album is a mood piece to some degree, but it never simply repeats itself: Sometimes it's as simple as a quiet key change or a shift from lyrics to wordless tones, as near the conclusion of ""Tusk and Mouth"". Never once does she sound like she is straining to get across.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-364bbc48-41d1-11d8-496b-c37ef288563c"">Lyrically, her voice is still emerging, but even with slightly forced lines like ""Kentucky's shades of grace,"" from ""Lickin' Lies"", she sells it with her detached cool. The less graceful turns of phrase are still of a piece with the impressionistic stories she weaves. Her vision of America is understated, laying somewhere between concrete and dreamscape and containing echoes of numerous previous decades. Depending on your angle of approach, you could hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1910-lee-hazlewood/"">Lee Hazlewood</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"">Emmylou Harris</a>'s riffs on cosmic American music, the Walkabouts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"">Mazzy Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2803-mojave-3/"">Mojave 3</a>.

Even their name is perfect: Beach houses are rickety, inviting spaces that, by nature of their existence, live outside of time. If a beach house were to change noticeably—if that paperback you left there last May isn’t still sitting upside-down and open to the same page, gathering dust on the same shelf you left it—you'd be upset.</div>
<p>Part of the joy of yielding to their luxuriant music, then, comes from sensing the comfort of these solid borders framing it. Their music explores the sadness of pleasure, and the pleasure of sadness, and with each record they deepen this inquiry a little more. Their newest, <i>Depression Cherry</i><span>, might have the silliest, or at least the most inexplicable, title in their catalog (compare it with the euphonious clarity of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/""><i>Teen Dream</i></a><span>, or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16604-beach-house-bloom/""><i>Bloom</i></a><span>, or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11208-devotion/""><i>Devotion</i></a><span>), but in every other sense it’s another impeccably measured step forward. Their albums might be an ideal soundtrack for daydreaming, but Scally and Legrand seem remarkably clear-headed about their work.</span></p>
<p>The most noticeable changes they make here are adjustments to lighting and angles. They’ve stripped back the booming drums of <i>Bloom</i> and boosted the synth and guitars, giving a new physicality to ethereal sounds. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17554-beach-house-sparks/"">""Sparks""</a>, Scally’s vintage-organ keyboard patch is dissonant, mixed right up front, and a little uncomfortable, like a crick in the song’s neck. The slide guitars have a brittle edge, suggesting the involvement of actual human fingers. The backing vocals are mixed a few inches closer, so they sound less like a celestial choir than an earthbound crew of worried voices whispering secrets.</p>
<p>These minor tweaks result in a sound that retains the band’s grand theatricality, but also lets you smell the grease paint a little more, feel the itch of the Victorian-era fabrics on your skin. When Legrand sings ""Tender is the night for a broken heart/ Who will dry your eyes when it falls apart?"" on the sweeping mid-album highlight ""Space Song"", it registers as exactly the sort of high-flown Romantic soliloquy she’s always preferred. But then a buzzing, dinky-sounding synthesizer burbles up into the track, wandering onstage like a comic foil. Like the old drum machines they prefer, touches like these give the music an air of innocence, evoking silent films, community theater productions, puppet shows. Legrand and Scally have grown so adept at spinning dreams that they can turn all the lights on the set and still dazzle us.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Trance is a big part of our thing,"" Scally said in their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/profiles/9694-all-the-feels-beach-houses-intangible-truth/"">recent Pitchfork interview</a>. ""We'll repeat a part for three hours while we wait for the next piece to fall into place."" On <i>Depression Cherry</i>, you can almost hear these dawning moments as they happen, with a palpable click. The bone structures of these songs are closer to dance tracks—with builds, drops, peaks, and switch-ups—than the flourishes of traditional pop songwriting, and this frame allows Beach House to stretch out and telescope their songs without getting lost. On ""PPP"", Legrand alternates between a pinwheeling melody and a more open-ended, spoken-word performance, with Scally’s arpeggiated guitar stitching a visible, silvery thread through both.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Underpinning everything, as always, is the drone. Legrand’s finger almost never lets up on a chord’s root or fifth note in a Beach House song. You can see her live, doing this—she keeps one hand pressed on the keyboard at all times, grounding the song even as her vocal soars and Scally’s guitar glitters. On <i>Depression Cherry</i>’s opening track ""Levitation"", a lovely saturated D chord opens slowly out of a faint high-F# drone, which never disappears from the song’s edges. The omnipresence of these drones in their songs suggests that their fantasies have a fatalistic tint: The drone is always there, the hum of the air conditioner that’s too loud in your vacation condo, the fly that won’t stop buzzing. That buzzing note is as legible on <i>Bloom</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK_zv3Ubw4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Irene""</a> as it is on many of the songs here, and it’s why we feel our gut tugged to Earth and our skulls lifted skyward when Legrand’s voice reaches for her highest notes.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-de9d4b87-3d39-01d1-d952-eb9cb220d1d0""><span>One of the first lines Legrand sings on the album, from ""Levitation"", is ""There’s a place I want to take you."" Isolated, it’s an emblematic Beach House lyric—a promise of transportation that leaves the destination unspecified. In fact, it doesn’t even promise arrival: she just </span><span>wants</span><span> to take you there. It is this melancholia, the exquisite ache of being nearly aloft, that Beach House has perfected. With every album, someone observes—rightly—that the band has never sounded exactly </span><span>this</span><span> full and soaring before. From their muted first two records, into their Sub Pop debut <i>Teen Dream</i> and then <i>Bloom</i>, Beach House always seem to be just leaving the ground as we catch them. It’s a trick of the light, and it speaks to the sadness that makes their music linger: Transporting experiences, they gently remind us, are always round-trip tickets back to everyday life.</span></span></p></div>"|20691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20691-depression-cherry/|8.4|Jayson Greene

During ""Down the Lane"", fans crashed the stage en masse, and when the chorus hit, they sang it as hard as they could. The scene became more raucous as the band sped into ""Girls"", and that's when cops eventually muscled the crowd off stage. A woman who'd eluded the wall of neon-vested officers took the mic and said, <a href=""https://vine.co/v/edjrdM0ZVeY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I love you, Shogun.""</a> She was speaking to the band's sweaty, shirtless frontman who'd just been singing his heart out, lost somewhere in the mass of bodies.</p>
<p>Royal Headache have earned this beer-slinging, shout-along adulation fair and square. The songs of 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16599-royal-headache/"">Royal Headache</a> </i>were catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic, and Shogun's voice has absurd range, plenty of force, and soul. It took three years to follow up on this debut, and with <i>High</i> they waste no time charging back in. On opener ""My Own Fantasy"", Shogun belts ""I used to live in a world of rock'n'roll and tons of girls!"" over a chugging, high-power intro. At a glance, it seems he's going through rock-god motions—romanticizing guitar music while extolling the virtues of fucking multiple strangers. Really, though, the song is about that bubble finally bursting—the sudden, cold feeling of loneliness even while fans are singing along and dancing all around you.</p>
<p>If there's an underlying sense of dissatisfaction here, it's safe to assume it might have something to do with the band's emotional state over the past year. In one <a href=""http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/4655093"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Shogun said he broke the band up due to their ""dysfunctional"" dynamic. (It was later clarified that they weren't breaking up after all.) In a statement, he said the whole album is ""about someone I don't see anymore."" The open wounds of relationship turmoil fuel <i>High</i>. The band are frenzied on ""Need You"", one of the best songs in their repertoire (buoyed significantly by Gabrielle de Giorgio's organ line). It's a song about professing love to no avail and eventually having those feelings decay into fruitless obsession. On ""Another World"", Shogun accuses the person he's with of judging him for superficial reasons. Both songs are as melodic and upbeat as anything on their debut.</p>
<p>Shogun labors over his vocals in the recording process, and his care shows. He could easily soul-scream all over the place, but instead he holds off on the high notes until the perfect moment comes around. He simmers calmly while addressing someone running scared from new love on ""Wouldn't You Know"". He's dismissive and contemptuous on ""Garbage"". When he <i>does</i> let loose, it's almost disorienting. He belts over and over during ""Love Her If I Tried"", and just when he appears to be going at full power, he seems to momentarily unhinge his jaw for one enormous, cathartic high note.</p>
<p>They still thrive on adrenaline and huge sing-along choruses, and ""High"" and ""Electric Shock"" deliver the dependable goods. They're not just going through the motions, though. ""Carolina"", with its acoustic underpinnings, is a surprisingly pastoral plea. The hook is indelible, stirring memories of other people singing the words ""sweet Caroline"". <span>As ever, it's catchy and full of emotion. Royal Headache have taken steps forward since their last album—they’ve cleaned up their production and diversified their songwriting. Ultimately, though, the important bits are intact: the passion, the power, and the hooks that demand being shouted joyfully.</span></p></div>"|20746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20746-high/|8.0|Evan Minsker

The initial arc of his solo career, which began with 2001's<i> </i></span><i>Jacka of the Mob Figaz</i><span> and peaked eight years later with 2009's <i>Tear Gas</i>, was one of the most prolific auteurs of the 2000s. A peerless writer with a distinct sound, a gift for vivid prose, and a powerful moral conscience, his best material received little attention at his apex. (At least on a national level—within the Bay Area and its satellite cities, he's on his way to matching Mac Dre as a regional legend.) After a fallow period in the early 2010s, Jacka released his official </span><i>Tear Gas </i><span>follow-up, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20045-what-happened-to-the-world/""><i>What Happened to the World</i></a><span>, in 2014. Though his momentum had slowed, his writing was as strong as it had ever been. </span><i>Drought Season 3</i><span>, his first posthumous release and the third in his series of collaborative albums with fellow Bay Area rapper Berner, proves this was no fluke; there was plenty of gas left in the tank when Jacka's life was tragically cut short this past February.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This tape's prequel, <i>Drought Season 2</i>, was one of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT0fHFNTLwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the </a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT0fHFNTLwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last great albums</a> of the Jacka's initial creative run. But at a time when his career should have been peaking commercially, the internet was wreaking havoc. Album sales were at their nadir, and popular regional stars like Jacka suddenly sat in the shadow of viral sensations like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>, whose prescient understanding of meme-marketing gave him a leg up outside his native Bay Area. And while Jacka had long sustained himself by charging for features, the Internet's clear-glass window into the Bay Area scene made it so bootlegs and guest verses buried his official catalog amidst a nebulous cloud of unofficial material.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At the same time, he began to nurse a codeine addiction. Initially, he appreciated syrup's effect on his vocal style, but as time wore on, it began to detach his words and flow from the groove. By the time </span><i>Drought Season 3 </i><span>was recorded, his voice no longer felt as present. Its wispier texture seems seconds from evaporating. On the album, this weightlessness detracts only when the Jacka aims for menace, as on the overdriven guitars of ""45""; his reflective moments remain convincing, ghosted vocals camouflaging complex emotions and hard-earned wisdom in a dreamlike reverie. Despite this effervescence, his writing is sharp enough to cut glass. It's not just that he doesn't waste words; each statement is saturated with meaning, each deceptively simple lyric charged with purpose, its wider implications left to echo over each successive line.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>His passing looms over the proceedings; lyrics recorded before his death take on portentous connotations. On ""One Sound"", he laments the catch-22 of success: ""I just want to make you proud/ But you'd rather see me gunned down."" It's a sentiment echoed by Husalah's chorus on ""Win"": ""When you start gettin' money and these suckers start hating/ Sometimes when you win you lose."" The Jacka's take on street rap is an urgent one charged by violence, anchored by realism that could verge on the despondent. Underlying it all is a struggle to stay sane in a fallen world, one marked by betrayal (""'Cause niggas got rich and ain't show us how"") that is unsparing in its indictment of the wider world's complicity (""Where killing made it safe for y'all to walk around""). A stance of perpetual resistance in the face of the world's cruelty—a cruelty in which he is complicit and compromised—is his eternal subject. That he doesn't fold under its weight, even as the drugs numbed his pain, is a reflection of his abiding Muslim faith, a radicalized race consciousness (""Everywhere I've ever been they treat the blacks, unfair""), and confidence in his art—a trust in truth as a liberating force.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On its musical surface, <i>Drought Season 3</i> is one of the smoothest rap releases of the year—appropriate for a collaboration with Berner, who has membership in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a>'s more commercially-relevant Taylor Gang. The production is lush, colorful, and the dominant rap style throughout its guest-heavy tracklist—give or take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"">Freeway</a>'s urgent mania—is one of half-lidded nonchalance. For the uninitiated, this sleek, subtle mood music belies its depth. Expensive-sounding production has long been the m.o. of the<i> Drought Season</i> series. After all, these were the tapes that made Berner's name, an (ostensible) weed-dealing kingpin buying his way into hip-hop with impeccable taste in collaborators and production. But for his part, Berner is no longer the cipher he once was. His flow, which previously relied upon a halting cadence that sounded As If He Were Rapping In Title Case, now rolls off his tongue in a more effortless legato. His lyrics have also deepened in both his attraction to arresting imagery (""I can see my stones glowing in the limousine tint"") to an emotional potency that seems, well, Jacka-inspired in its multiplicity of meaning: ""We die young but this here forever/ Leave my daughter a letter, don't believe what they tell you.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But while Berner's lyrical contributions here mark a substantial step forward, he's taken a step back in shaping the album's sound, which owes more to Jacka's camp than usual. It's most evident glancing at the record's guest list, which suggests an emotional send-off from his closest friends. For an independent artist working outside the major label system, Jacka's extended crew was built upon strategic alliances, but sustained due to stronger bonds: Ampichino, an Akron, Ohio-based rapper who collaborated with Jacka on two albums as the Devilz Rejects and frequently brought him to perform in the Midwest; Rydah J. Klyde and Husalah, the most active members of Jacka's group the Mob Figaz; Freeway, the sympatico former Roc-A-Fella rapper who bonded with the Jacka over their shared identity as Muslims. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The guests pay their respects in varied ways. On ""Drought Season"", Joe Blow, the most accomplished artist on Jacka's The Artist record label, unleashes a flurry of syllables in a controlled, laconic style that celebrates Jacka's legacy through breathless formal architecture. ""Die Young"", a remake of Cormega's street classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0pzsx2kXo8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""They Forced My Hand""</a>, features Oakland legend Richie Rich, a rapper who was signed to Def Jam in the mid-1990s. He addresses his time in the spotlight in a way that could as easily speak to Jacka's own ambivalence to the industry: ""I ate with Russell Simmons, so how could I be local?/ But a lot of that bullshit, I just couldn't go for."" Cormega appears on ""Whole Thang"", his understated prose taking on deeper implications: ""I was one amongst many, few remain."" But it's Jacka's longtime partner Husalah who captures the album's purposeful spirit, on ""Win"": ""As little kids took an oath to this criminal movement/ Hoping this song redeem our souls and wake you up like a rooster."" Or perhaps that honor belongs to Jacka himself, who raps on the title track: ""I try to end this with who I began with.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Indeed, it's the Jacka's purposeful ideology—scattered jewels throughout the tape which imprint themselves upon the psyche long after the song ends—that makes this a nourishing listen. The album's most revelatory moment comes on the hidden bonus track, ""So Much Pain"". With a beat that sounds like sun breaking through storm clouds, it opens with an affecting turn from Berner (""Thinking 'bout my mother, I'm screaming 'fuck cancer'"") before jumping to one of the most compelling verses of Jacka's career. His truest skill as an artist was the ability to compress a world and worldview onto the head of a pin, and this song is a platonic ideal: opening with a scene of betrayal, he slips to tormented guilt, an indictment of the system, and an affirmation of religious faith that remains as vivid as his street stories: ""I know I'm blessed the way you manifest a hopeless mind, into an open eye/ Never seen a god in the open sky, but I read the signs so I know you are, right there, unseen like the air you feel/ On your skin, unseen like the evil djinn, you know I kneel.""</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-61d0fe39-2cb0-c5c7-8c28-6d0d4d902592""><span>His verse ends in what may as well be his career's statement of purpose (""All I try to do is make it pop, somewhere/ All my fallen soldiers, dead or locked, you'll live again""). The effect is overwhelming, a moment of crystalline clarity, a flash of light. And as suddenly the light recedes, as Carey Stacks, a Seattle protege, returns to the here-and-now, to his immediate vicinity, to the concrete threats of the world in front of him: ""Two feet on the ground, both eyes open."" </span></span></p></div>"|20844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20844-drought-season-3/|7.3|David Drake

Just ask Owen Ashworth. Under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/"">Casiotone for the Painfully Alone</a>, Ashworth spent over a decade giving voice to the anxieties of young misfits with battery-powered keyboards serving as his primary accompaniment. His best songs during these years were miniature bildungsromans, richly detailed portraits of characters fighting to achieve adulthood despite personal failings, everyday struggles, and diminished horizons. By the end of his run as CFTPA, this tension between immaturity and responsibility had reached its logical apex: parenthood. The songs on CFTPA's 2009 swan song<i>, </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13012-vs-children/""><i>Vs. Children</i></a>, read like cautionary tales<i>—</i>it's an album populated by absent fathers, abandoned mothers, and the children hanging in the balance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Having all but exhausted the artistic possibilities built into the Casiotone name, Ashworth rebranded himself as Advance Base in 2011 and set to work de-modernizing his sound. He's now more likely to reach for a Fender Rhodes over a Casio SK-1 and has been studying time-tested pop songcraft, as his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/advance-base"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent covers</a> of classic rock and gospel artists attest. His debut as Advance Base, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16656-a-shut-ins-prayer/""><i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i></a><i>,</i> felt like a natural extension of his previous work, 10 short vignettes soundtracked by charmingly homespun downer-pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Nephew in the Wild</i><span> continues along this same path, employing the warm sonics of vintage gear in service of Ashworth's storytelling. Many of the longstanding hallmarks of his sound can be found here<i>—</i>twinkling melodies, sustained minor chords<i>—</i>though everything feels a bit looser this time around. Ashworth leans on electric piano for most of the lead parts, with guitar, autoharp, synthesized mellotron, and the occasional analog drum machine filling things out. The most striking change, however, is Ashworth's vocals. After years of singing with a flat intonation that gave his voice the tenor of a resigned sigh, on many of </span><i>Nephew in Wild</i><span>'s songs, Ashworth pushes himself to be more expressive, with results that are more tuneful, if still every bit as charmingly gruff.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Musically, </span><i>Nephew in the Wild</i><span> feels like a logical progression from Ashworth's past work; lyrically, however, it isn't always as clear of a step forward. Most of the album's narratives focus on flinty Midwesterners coping with decidedly adult problems: addiction, jealousy, dead-end jobs. These characters feel slightly out of reach for Ashworth and their stories often lack the depth and novelistic detail for which he's known. The post-collegiate malaise of CFTPA characters felt real<i>—</i>you could imagine them pulling up a barstool next to you and unburdening themselves of their troubles. By way of comparison, the characters on </span><i>Nephew in the Wild</i><span> never quite come into focus. </span></p>
<p>But then there's ""Kitty Winn"", the album's final and best song. Over a simple, lullaby-like melody, Ashworth details the joys of married life and parenthood as he looks back on the recklessness of his youth. The song is a clear outlier in Ashworth's catalog; here melancholy takes a backseat to lucid, unguarded sincerity. Summing up the difference between then and now, Ashworth gingerly sings, ""I'm not out looking for something/ I haven't found/ You won't see me around/ I've got a family now."" He sounds like a man who's managed to navigate life's pitfalls, arriving at the contentment that so often eludes his characters. On ""Kitty Winn"" it feels like Ashworth finds his footing as Advance Base, delivering a song that's as affecting as his best work even if there's little that's ""painfully alone"" about it.

Some of them are clearly the result of double exposure or trickery—the photographer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Mumler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">William H. Mumler</a> built a career on such forgeries—but the most <a href=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3161/2957183197_b7fb8953d5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">effective</a> <a href=""http://www.slightlywarped.com/crapfactory/ghastlyghostgallery/ghosts/pictures/pinklady2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ones</a> have an eerie realism, as if you’re catching a momentary glimpse into another, darker world that exists just below the surface of our own.</p>
<p>That’s more or less the effect of listening to <i>Hide Before Dinner</i>, the debut LP from the Australian group F ingers. That’s largely because each of its seven songs strictly adhere to their own cadaverous aesthetic: spider-web guitars billow and glisten, cheap synths drip like melting icicles, and Carla dal Forno—who, like F ingers’ Tarquin Manek, is also a member of the gloomy electronic outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32862-tarcar/"">Tarcar</a>—sings as if she’s in a death trance, emotionless and distant.</p>
<p>That kind of deliberate spookiness in clumsier hands can feel affected or, worse, just dull, but <i>Hide Before Dinner</i> is instead distinctly chilling, mostly because del Forno, Manek, and Samuel Karmel seem to be following specific, supernatural sheet music. Opener ""Escape Into the Bushes"" starts like something from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/"">the Cure’s <i>Faith</i></a>, with a mournful, two-chord guitar pattern ringing out in pitch-black open air. But the minute del Forno enters, it becomes something else. The words she’s singing are indistinct, but that hardly matters: she sings them like they’re the familiar intro to some occult ritual—purposeful, reverent, and with grim anticipation. Whatever weird conjuring is about to take place, del Forno’s determined tone implies that it’s happened before, and there’s no stopping it from happening again.</p>
<p>That mood carries throughout <i>Dinner</i>. There’s not much to ""Mum’s Caress After Trip"" beyond a ghoul-calliope keyboard line and del Forno’s baleful alto, but it inches under the skin. Del Forno sounds like she’s moved past sorrow into something worse—depressive catatonia—and the music’s ruthless blankness seems to mirror the condition of her spirit. ""Useless Treasure"" takes this same aesthetic of emptiness and stretches it out to a full seven minutes. Here, del Forno’s voice is lacquered with effects and then stretched and twisted, lurching zombie-like through blue bars of bass. There are echoes of the same funereal mood that pervaded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>’s <i>Marble Index</i>, but compared to F ingers’ whispery instrumentation and miles of cold empty air, that album seems like an exercise in maximalism. The title track milks a simple, four-chord minor-key guitar line for all it’s worth, dragging it miserably across the song’s six minutes, del Forno’s suffocated vocals so far in the background it sounds like she’s singing from another room, downstairs, beneath a thick wool blanket.</p>
<p>F ingers are even more disquieting when they purposefully ratchet up the darkness. The electronic wind chimes that ripple throughout ""Tantrum Time"" sound like they’re being stirred up by a warm night breeze outside the devil’s back door, and del Forno’s diced-up and detuned vocals are distinctly menacing; as the song progresses, it slowly fills with more and more digital apparitions—warped bass tones, suffocating static—summoning more horror than dread.</p>
<p>Because its primary goal is sustaining a mood rather than delivering concrete songs, <i>Hide Before Dinner</i> works best when taken as a whole, like outsider art from the afterlife. It’s a bleak and focused exercise in misery—traveling music for a long boat ride down the river Styx.</p></div>"|20909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20909-hide-before-dinner/|7.7|J.

""We had the biggest single in the world last time and didn't have the biggest album,"" her <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/arts/music/carly-rae-jepsen-with-a-new-album-is-definitely-changing-her-number.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>manager Scooter Braun</span></a> told the <i>New York Times </i>in July, referring to her 2011 breakout hit, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Call Me Maybe""</a>. ""This time we wanted to stop worrying about singles and focus on having a critically acclaimed album."" It's an ambitious campaign, but the Shellback-produced opener ""Run Away With Me"" announces it with clarion synths that sound like battle-call horns: Carly Rae is at the gates with an army, hellbent on returning home with your love.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In many ways, she succeeds: <i>E•MO•TION</i></span><span> </span><span>is as solid and spotless a pop album as you're likely to hear this year, the result of several years working alongside a storied list of contributors.</span> More than 200 tracks were workshopped in sessions with some of the pop world's most prestigious hired hands, including hitmakers Max Martin and Jack Antonoff, neither of whom made the final cut. In the end, just 12 made the album, with six more filling out the deluxe edition.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The hand-picked collaborators that <i>do</i> appear on <i>E•MO•TION</i> include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Devonté Hynes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Rostam Batmanglij, all of whom contribute excellent work (Hynes, on the twinkling Prince-inspired ballad ""All That"", and Batmanglij, on the weird, warbling ""Warm Blood""). The synth and drum programming, handled by Ariel Rechtshaid, may be his best, building off the sound he developed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"">Haim</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18574-haim-days-are-gone/""><i>Days Are Gone</i></a>. I can think of a few fans and gearheads who would pay good money to have Rechtshaid break down the sounds on this album, as he's <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/doers/2013/01/justin_bieber_s_thought_of_you_producer_ariel_rechtshaid_explains_how_he.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">done in the past</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But whatever lessons we learn from <i>E•MO•TION<span>—</span></i>for example,<i><span> </span></i>that this palette of '80s synth sounds and Madonna hat-tips will probably endure for eternity<span>—</span>we don't learn much about Jepsen. The best pop stars distill attitudes and emotions into gestures so perfect they can take on a life of their own. This is why pop icons inspire endless memes: Rihanna for when we give no fucks, Beyoncé for when we're feeling imperial. We have Drake for performative vulnerability, Taylor for performative generosity. Jepsen, on the other hand, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=carly+rae+jepsen+meme&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIwM6S7dGuxwIVSng-Ch1uvQeM&amp;biw=1267&amp;bih=778"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hasn't captured the Internet's imagination</a> in the same way. Her best performance is still as a shy, boy-crazy brunette, a role she reprises on the ""driving the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oovZa4GVAx8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">speed limit on the zeitgeist</a>"" first single ""I Really Like You"". Her efforts on <i>E•MO•TION </i>to break new ground around this reductive portrait are fitful and unconvincing. (She <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/23/carly-rae-jepsen-zero-i-sound-gritty-vaping-for-a-week-call-me-maybe-emotion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>Guardian</i></a> she ""spent an entire week vaping"" to sound ""gritty"" on the song ""Your Type"", yet she sounds no different on that track than on any of the others.) Ultimately, you can listen to Carly Rae Jepsen for days and still have no idea who she is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This may seem like a surface-level concern, but it's an important one, because <i>E•MO•TION</i> is all surface. It's unfair to deeply scrutinize lyrics on a pop record<span>—</span>the goal is to write smart, but skew broad<span>—but </span><i>E•MO•TION</i> fails to tell us who Jepsen is or wants to be. The economy of her writing is impressive, especially on songs like the shadowy ""Warm Blood"" or the booming closer ""When I Needed You"". ""LA Hallucinations"", her collaboration with members from little-known indie rock bands Zolas and Data Romance, stitches a bubblegum vocal to a no-frills electronic production. (It is also the rare pop song to include the word ""BuzzFeed."") But the album mostly feels like the conclusion of a team determined to create an unassailable pop product.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8f473859-3927-09da-1bdd-22fbb8b184ea""><span>That's why it falls short of its ultimate goal of setting the world on fire; for all its ironclad hooks and studio precision, Jepsen's third album, like her second, lacks the personality of the most memorable pop records. There's an unshakeable vagueness to her—her last album was simply called </span><i>Kiss</i>, and this one bears the generic title <i>E•MO•TION</i><span>, with inexplicable punctuation. It may be flooded with winning moments<span>—</span>the bridge on ""Gimmie Love""! the build to the last chorus on ""All That""!<span>—</span>but <i>E•MO•TION</i></span><span> </span><span>as a whole sounds like a slab of blank space.

Often described as a rapper, he's just as much a singer, and his skill in both arenas is prodigious. When he sings, he vaults between octaves, sliding from tragicomic fluttery falsetto to a luxuriant R&amp;B tenor to a taut, imperious belt; rapping, he flips from wild <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a> shriek, herby <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> bounce, and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32490-father/"">Father</a>-ish benzo disaffectation. All told, Olaniran's got at least a dozen voices, and he moves between them without any sign of conscious effort—or any seeming consciousness that what he's doing is quite so wild. And this, combined with his equally startling flexibility with genre, makes Olaniran's debut album <i>Transgressor</i> feel like it was recorded by a dissonant, flourishing collective, rather than a man from Flint, an LGBTQ activist with a day job at Planned Parenthood, whose only vocal training is choir practice to boot.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Born to a Nigerian Christian immigrant father and an atheist, Socialist union organizer mother, Olaniran was discovered by the Berlin-based producer Phon.O off a MySpace track in 2008. He toured Europe briefly, stopping in the cities where he'd lived when his father was in the military. Since then, he's been a mainstay of and bridge between the scrappy Flint and Detroit musical scenes<span>—</span>he's hands-on to the point of designing costumes for his backup dancers and choreographing their routines<span>—</span>and his collaborators now are steadfastly local. On 2014's <i>Yung Archetype</i>, his under-hyped idea factory of an EP, Olaniran brought on Detroit R&amp;B singer James Linck; <i>Transgressor</i> features even more Motor City, including the raucous kitsch-punk act Flint Eastwood, the cross-racial hip-hop buddy duo Passalacqua, and Invincible, a female rapper who's Jewish and queer.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His interest in genre and identity is central enough that it inspired both his album and EP titles, and he's built an experimental, leftist, theatrically artistic, streetwise pop debut, as close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a> as it is to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a> as it is to some dystopian alley-cat cabaret. <span>His sound is</span><span> pastiche reaching for synthesis, falling short when it lacks a sense of stakes</span>. Olaniran's assets are so plentiful that he tosses them around almost forgetfully: without a clear aesthetic target, his shape-shifting can feel haphazard or unedited. But, when he is motivated by a clear sense of intention—when the disparate elements in each track stand out at right angles, subvert each other, throw each other into relief—the album glows.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This intention, like everything about Olaniran, takes wildly varying forms. He's a conscious writer, to begin with. His bouncy rap track ""Diamonds"", with its singsong, arch delivery and a first verse that name-checks Taco Bell, could sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a> roleplay on a careless first listen; one more time, and it's a painfully astute inhabitation of a story about the slow, mundane, systematic disenfranchisement of the American poor. His activism is out front, too, on ""Everyone's Missing"", a beautiful and spooky lament in which Olaniran sound like a prophet on the chorus, a radio crooner on the bridge hook, and then five different rappers on a verse that ramps up with the line ""It mocks me when I'm wishful/ Grab my guts by the fistful""<span>—</span>""it"" here being both hope and death by police<span>—a</span>nd then tosses off, ""MLK was respectable/ Still gunned down in that motel.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Olaniran's even better when he's elbowing people aesthetically rather than via commentary. There's a lot of new space ready to be claimed in R&amp;B right now, and he's as sonically progressive as he is in verse. His punky, flamboyant, radical edge is immensely satisfying when it's got a tough, pretty melody to play against, and some of the best moments of the album come from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>-esque, flag-waving, desperate, deeply-felt rock toplines. On the standout ""Let Me Go"", his generous hook unfurls down in spirals: ""Once upon a time, I was yours, you were mine/ And you had me hook, line and sinker."" The track's not about romance, but about Olaniran's father (who happened to give him a name that translates, remarkably, to ""The spirit of the father is gone but will return again to bring back the wealth that was granted to your family."") The whole thing's tough and bombastic, as big as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/""><i>Funeral</i></a>, as punk as hell.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Olaniran leans on melody again to great effect on ""Up &amp; Down"", another song with an unexpected subject—his fluctuating weight—that distorts his harmony while spare apocalyptic trap drums build in the back. There's 808s aplenty on <i>Transgressor</i>; Olaniran uses a lot of what the kids are into, to occasionally flat effect. There's an exact <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a> facsimile in the highly catchy if somewhat ""Reading Rainbow""-esque single ""Namesake"", and at multiple points on the album, the progression is metronome-regular: there goes the trap clap, the skitter, the stomping wobbly synth. But, just as often (on the swinging, grimy ""Run to the Gun"" and the dance track ""KYBM"", for example), Olaniran uses these elements flexibly and exactly right.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5c4a00bd-275a-61d2-6fc5-20acdc30a8d3""><i>Transgressor</i> is an exceptional, aggressive, and incendiary album, in which Olaniran's idiosyncrasy feels alternately revelatory and in need of editing. He's in search of his own idiom. But when he's building<span>—</span>and he <i>is</i> building<span>—h</span>is songs feel truly architectural: beautiful, strange structures that bomb themselves at regular intervals; rattling drives through some wild country where subversion is introduced as startling and naturally as landscape<span>—</span>each shift a turn around a mountain that suddenly looms.</span></p></div>"|20941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20941-transgressor/|7.2|Jia Tolentino

She makes similarly childlike gestures on her debut album. ""You made beauty a monster to me, so I'm kissing all the ugly things I see,"" she seethes at an ex in a <i>so there</i> voice on <i>Dry Food</i>'s title track. It's the most deliciously futile form of revenge and reclamation: doing the opposite.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Dry Food</i> is partially a product of the 21-year-old Boston-dwelling songwriter's first big breakup—the deeper kind of solitude of having known and lost someone. Its sound captures the Herculean efforts required to survive the ensuing slump: ""All I need's a little sleep and I'll be good to clean and eat,"" she sings in a medicated sigh on ""Easy"", her acoustic guitar rising and dipping with the methodical pace of someone trying to make a new routine stick. But like her <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/05/happy-campers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">former camp counselor and roommate,</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"">Speedy Ortiz</a>'s Sadie Dupuis, Kempner never lets a sad jam wallow: she kicks the end of the song into shape with a zippy electric guitar motif and some awkward, itchy squall.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's followed by ""Cinnamon"", which takes the opposite tack, hooked around the kind of amiable, waterlogged psych burble that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a> noodles in his sleep. Kempner sings dreamily about her worst self-defeating impulses, but is stirred from her reverie by a divine revelation that her life is becoming ""a pretty lie"". Frantic drums force the song somewhere agitated and ascendant, but instead of bursting into some bright new phrase, the furor falls away like a captivating slo-mo bellyflop.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Kempner has a knack for these odd little about-turns that elevate <i>Dry Food</i> above the usual plainspoken acoustic indie fare. And like her old roommate, she often obscures her intentions between appealingly twisty language. ""Mouth ajar watching cuties hit the half pipe/ I only feel half ripe/ Around healthier folk,"" she sings on ""Healthier Folk"". She distils her disgust at her own post-breakup malaise with perfectly understated images: ""The hair that's in my shower drain/ Has been clogging up my home,"" she sings on ""Dixie"". ""And I try to scoop it up, but I wretch until I'm stuck."" It's maybe the most straightforward song here, just fingerpicked acoustic guitar, but she messes at it like a cat dragging a mouse into a dark nook.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Saddest of all is closer ""Seakonk"", where Kempner protests that she's not alone, actually; she's home watching TV with her parents, sister and their dogs. There's a blithe fairground pirate ship sway to the song, which she closes with a jaunty ""doo doo doo"" that could have come from the credits of one of the cartoons she's watching—only she lets the final note deflate with a groan. It's at this point that <i>Dry Food</i> confronts the point it's been evading: kidding yourself is no way to recover, and comfort offers little impetus to move on. Palehound's discomfiting, unflinching debut suggests she knew it all along.</span></p></div>"|20869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20869-dry-food/|8.0|Laura Snapes

At night, however, he preached the gospel of rock'n'roll at small venues around town, with his crack-backing band the Gospel of Power in tow. Singing in a low, grainy voice that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a>, Cloud played garage rock and noise as though the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8974-the-sonics/"">Sonics</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> were the same band, adding drone and distortion to his three-minute rave-ups and pop tunes. His guitar usually sported only one string, two if he was feeling adventurous, and onstage he transmogrified into the raging id to Nashville's massive ego: the wild, demented offspring chained in the basement, never spoken of in polite company.</p>
<p>Cloud's handful of records comprise a modest catalog that barely sold in the U.S. but established him as something of a hero in Scandinavia. There is a strong <i>you had to be there, man</i> aspect to artists like Cloud, whose charisma is most intense onstage and yet whose live shows don't always translate to YouTube clips or vinyl. And yet, even without the secondhand stories of onstage shenanigans, there is a great deal to admire in his brand of grouty garage rock, from his rusted-tailpipe vocals to the Gospel of Power's grimy reimaginings of '60s pop riffs and grooves.</p>
<p><i>Today Is the Day That They Take Me Away</i> surveys the breadth of Cloud's relatively brief recording career. He may have started performing at local record stores back in the '70s and his previous band the Psychotic Night Auditors may have been banned for life from the <a href=""http://www.thespringwater.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Springwater</a>, but he finally released his debut album in 1999, followed by three more studio albums, one compilation, and a live album recorded just down I-40 at GonerFest in Memphis. Rather than mapping out the development of his sound over 16 tracks (27 on the digital version), <i>Today Is the Day</i> instead reveals an artist who had already refined his aesthetic and had utmost confidence in its viability over the years. In fact, he makes that small patch of garage rock sound unreasonably large: ""Party Doll"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15153-buddy-holly/"">Buddy Holly</a> back from the dead, playing guitar until his hands literally fall off, while the title track layers his paranoid ramblings into a kind of incantatory warning that picks up where <a href=""https://youtu.be/g-eafUBULWA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Napoleon XIV</a> left off.</p>
<p>We've heard songs like ""Bimbo"" and ""400 Girls"" before, reiterations of omnivorous male sexuality that innervated early rock'n'roll but soon became a tired ritual, a means of oppression rather than liberation. But there's something so exaggerated in Cloud's delivery that the songs sound like parodies: hetero-dude desire exploded to Tex Avery proportions. Cloud sings so often about unattainable women that romantic longing becomes the de facto theme of this collection, undermining the jokiness of ""Thieving Love Bandit"" and ""Damn Damn Damn Damn"" and suggesting a very real sense of loneliness motivating these songs.</p>
<p><i>Today Is the Day That They Take Me Away</i> is an epitaph for an unusual career, because Dave Cloud died earlier this year, age 58, of melanoma. He never achieved the fame and fortune many believed was his due, but his true destiny was to be Nashville's glorious cult icon. He obviously relished the role, and this affectionate tribute reveals an artist who managed—amazingly enough—to remake rock'n'roll in his own image. </p></div>"|20937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20937-today-is-the-day-that-they-take-me-away/|7.5|Stephen M.

It's ambient techno the way it's meant to be made, fleshed out with acid lines and updated with live drums, and the way it develops is so effortless—building to a softly rounded climax and then rolling back downhill—that it feels less like a work of art than a product of nature.</p>
<p>One place the hippie ideology has continued to flourish in dance culture is in the so-called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/electric-fling/9464-sketches-from-ibiza-island/"">Balearic scene</a>, the fuzzily defined style of music that grew out of Ibiza's discotheques in the 1980s, when DJs like Alfredo and Jose Padilla bricolaged together an eclectic, sunset-friendly style out of ambient, dub, yacht rock, krautrock, acid house, and anything else that fit the mood. Gonno's Balearic bona fides are solid. After years of making relatively rugged, stripped-down techno, he took an abrupt turn in 2011 and wound up on Ibiza's very own <a href=""http://sketchesfromanisland.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Feel</a>, ground zero for the current decade's Balearic revival. On <i>Remember the Life Is Beautiful</i>, he extends his emotive, exploratory approach to album length, the optimal way to engage with it—not as a series of singles but in an extended session that unfolds like a meal among friends at dusk.</p>
<p><i>Remember </i>isn't strictly a ""dance"" album, although warm-up DJs will find plenty of copacetic material here, and a few tracks are relatively peak-time in their energy. ""Stop"", with its ragged hi-hats and triplet bass, might be a vintage Border Community track, and ""Revoked"", with its chimes, arpeggios, and chugging groove, is part DFA and part Carl Craig. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a>'s hybridized live drums and machine beats inform a few tracks here, as do their photosensitive quirks and generally wistful air.</p>
<p>The uptempo cuts are the exceptions; most songs are stolidly midtempo, if not outright sluggish. In ""The Worst Day Ever"", which creeps along at 100 beats per minute, small plucked sounds pile up into a shimmering whole that verges on sensory overload; the equally dreamy ""Confusion"", a hair faster, affects a majestically relaxed groove. The sonic balance he achieves, between ethereal vibes and physical modeling, is tricky enough; few artists can project a sense of chill that's so convincing. Fittingly, some of the most powerful songs do without drums entirely. ""Beasts in Your Mind"" runs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMVpL3B_6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Göttsching</a>'s arpeggios through the Cocteaus' delay pedals, while ""Already Almost"" goes for a midnight swim in Harold Budd's blue lagoon. And on ""The Island I've Never Been"", he swaps out the drums for clanking ship's bells, climaxing with a green flash of arpeggiated synths before succumbing to dusk again. It's a wonderful summation of the album's strengths. <i>Remember the Life Is Beautiful </i>isn't a triumph simply because it so elegantly captures the Balearic style; it's that it so elegantly captures its spirit.</p></div>"|20873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20873-remember-the-life-is-beautiful/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

This time last year, Richard D. James was seven years into an extended hiatus (or nine, or 13, depending upon the alias) when <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> launched a hot-air balloon emblazoned with his logo into the skies over London. Since then, the occasionally press-shy, always unpredictable artist has cranked himself up to a fever pitch, and there's no evidence that he's headed back to his hermitage any time soon.</p>
<p>In the past year, we've been treated to a wealth of new, or at least new to us, music. First there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/""><i>Syro</i></a>, Aphex Twin's triumphant return. Then, just four months later, came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/""><i>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</i></a>, an EP of more abstracted material, inspired by the intersection between robotics and acoustic instruments. Right around the same time, James <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/648-if-this-aphex-twin-archive-is-fake-we-dont-want-to-know-what-real-is/"">launched a series of anonymous accounts on SoundCloud</a>, where he unloaded more than 100 previously unreleased tracks from his voluminous archives.</p>
<p>If the title of the new release is to be believed, we're still in archival territory. (To that end, the cover art riffs on Warp's very first release, Forgemasters' <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Forgemasters-Track-With-No-Name/master/79596"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Track With No Name""</a>, from 1989.) That the record is credited to AFX and not Aphex Twin is probably significant, although, as with all things related to James, there's room for interpretation. The AFX handle has come to mean different things at different periods: In the '90s, with the <i>Analogue Bubblebath </i>and <i>Hangable Autobulb </i>series, it meant rugged, percussive workouts with a touch of acid. For 2005's <i>Analord </i>series, it came to stand for lyrical, all-analog jams. <i>Orphaned Deejay Selek </i>is closer to <i>Analord </i>and provides a stark contrast to the labyrinthine twists of <i>Syro. </i>These songs soar with a burly kind of grace.</p>
<p>But <i>Orphaned Deejay Selek</i> is no <i>Analord 12</i>. For one thing, many of the <i>Analord </i>releases sound positively lo-fi compared to the eight tracks here. The separation of the sounds in the mix, and the way they stake out a position in space, is nothing short of spellbinding.  He's also not kidding about the ""deejay"" part of the title: These really are some of the most straightforward pieces of music that James has put his name to in years. They're far more focused on rhythm, on that ineffable quality known as the groove, than either of his other recent releases.</p>
<p>James dives right in at 144 BPM on ""dmx acid test"" and doesn't let up, tearing through five tracks at the sort of tempos that haven't often been heard in techno since the '90s. ""acid test"" puts twin 303s through their paces while he lays down hissing, snapping electro rhythms; that track seamlessly gives way to ""oberheim blacet1b"", a slightly more baroque variation on the same theme that gives free rein to his wild, microtonal tunings. ""simple slamming b 2"" is just what the title suggests, right down to the four-to-the-floor kick drums and rolling, 16th-note hi-hats.</p>
<p>Towards the end he slows down. ""NEOTEKT72"" riffs on deliriously detuned synthesizers over a loosely funky beat, full of lanky tambourine and cowbell patterns; the closing ""r8m neotek beat"" recalls the spindly minimalism of 1994's <i>GAK </i>EP. The slowest track here might be the most surprising: ""midi pipe1c sds3time cube/klonedrm"" bumps away at 100 BPM, with wheezing synth-flutes and sad, sour bongo drums like some half-melted rainforest diorama in a gone-to-seed wax museum.</p>
<p>But the keystone of the entire record is the one with the most understated title: ""bonus EMT beats"". In DJ parlance ""bonus beats"" used to mean two- or three-minute filler cuts, often found on the B3 of a standard 12-inch EP, in which the A-side's beat, and maybe its bassline, was given a brief, stripped-down reprise. They were DJ tools, basically, meant to be juggled with. ""bonus EMT beats"" is clearly a rework of ""dmx acid test"": it's got the same hard, dry snare thwack, the same staggered kick drum, the same ricocheting rimshots. The bassline's been muted and the reverb pushed way up. It rolls so naturally that it may take you a moment to notice what's changed: the bonus beat is in 5/4 time, whereas the original counts out in four. What's stunning is that James could take a cadence so unusual and make it feel so natural. For nearly five minutes, he wails away like a prog-rock titan on a drum throne. Usually, drum solos like this one make for an easy punchline, and you suspect that James may be teasing us here—breaking it down, building it up, toying with the reverb, refusing us so much as a note of melody, self-indulgent to the max. And on and on it goes. Three records into his return, on the most Spartan cut of the bunch, James is sounding more energized than ever.</p></div>"|20872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20872-orphaned-deejay-selek-2006-2008-ep/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

A track like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhy0M8X0pJk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Techno Playtime""</a>, which kicked off their 1990 EP of the same name, was truth in advertising, its sleek drum programming overtaken midway by a gnarly thump like Donkey Kong let loose. But by 1995, the trio, comprised of Ken Downie, Ed Handley, and Andy Turner, split, with Handley and Turner taking the more lighthearted aspects of their sound with them when they formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3328-plaid/"">Plaid</a>.</p>
<p>But after a decade, Downie resuscitated the Black Dog with 2005's <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"">Drexciya</a>-inspired <i>Silenced</i>, teaming up with Martin and Richard Dust. Since then, there has been a slew of Black Dog albums, nearly twice as many releases as in its original incarnation. But as Stephen King's <i>Pet Sematary</i> once warned, a revived dog isn't necessarily the same dog. As their seventh post-Handley and Turner album, <i>Neither/ Neither</i>, reveals, they've gotten far darker and more negative. Or as the press release puts it: ""We are all proles now; all are expected to maintain a mental state…of uncertainty and inaction."" </p>
<p>It makes sense that the Black Dog would grow more dour, in that both have roots in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychick_Warriors_ov_Gaia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Psychick Warriors ov Gaia</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thee_Temple_ov_Psychick_Youth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth</a>, which trace back to early industrialists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3408-psychic-tv/"">Psychic TV</a>. The first few times through <i>Neither/ Neither</i>, I was also reminded of fellow '90s acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, who returned after a decade away to far sourer times, their music reflecting a heightened sense of paranoia, anxiety, and pessimism about the world. The downtempo title track here, with its skittering hi-hats and lurching heartbeat pulse, could definitely have come off of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest/""><i>Tomorrow's Harvest</i></a>, especially when—some two minutes in—its slow-moving analog melody crests and breaks.</p>
<p>The tricky cymbals of ""Them (Everyone Is a Liar But)"" suggest a balance between early and present Black Dog, while ""Self Organising Sealed Systems"" is bracing, visceral techno that's au courant in Berlin. But ambient tracks like ""B.O.O.K.S."" mistake aimlessness for eeriness, and the interludes neither heighten the tension nor cast more shadow over the proceedings. As a result, most of the album drifts by without much to distinguish it from its field. Tracks like ""Control Needs Time"" and ""Shut Eye"" are indistinct to the point of anonymity, making <i>Neither/ Neither</i> an all too-perfect soundtrack for uncertainty and inaction.</p></div>"|20870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20870-neitherneither/|6.2|Andy Beta

The gruff rapper embodies the city's resilient spirit and, much like fellow lyricists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5204-redman/"">Redman</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">Black Thought</a>, he shouts out his hometown of ""the D"" every chance he gets. So while his new album, <i>Detroit's Son</i>, is an ode to the Motor City, it's also a chest-thumping salute to himself and a reminder of what he still hopes to accomplish. Because despite a robust discography, Guilty sounds unsatisfied on his new album, still pushing for a breakthrough.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Detroit's Son</i> follows last year's <i>Simpson Tape</i> EP, produced entirely by California composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no/"">Oh No</a>, whose stampeding drum breaks worked well for Guilty's menacing flows. Guilty is more straight-laced than his contemporaries: He relies on monotone real talk that, when paired with the right blend of cinematic soul, resembles <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x0-TPYWxRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4,5,6</a></i> era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30818-kool-g-rap/"">Kool G Rap</a> without the suit-and-tie crime bravado. His style is distinctly blue-collar, correlating with his hometown's hardworking ethos. At his best, he stands apart as a low-key yeoman with a penchant for street narratives.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yet for all the work he's done in his career—his debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11171-ode-to-the-ghetto/"">Ode to the Ghetto</a></i>, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14259-oj-simpson/"">O.J. Simpson</a></i> produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>, 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15526-random-axe/"">Random Axe</a></i> project with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11216-black-milk/"">Black Milk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60727-rapper-sean-price-has-died/"">Sean Price</a>, and 2012's <i><a href=""https://apollobrown360.bandcamp.com/album/dice-game"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dice Game</a></i> with producer Apollo Brown—Guilty is only as good as the beats he receives. His bars tend to recede into the music and there's no 'wow' factor with his approach. Instead, he becomes an accessory; you find yourself more interested in the instrumentals than what he's actually saying. There's no denying Guilty's intense work ethic, but 12 years after his debut on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10333-champion-sound-deluxe-edition/"">Jaylib</a> song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZY9Y5iwIZ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strapped""</a>, he still doesn't sound fully comfortable as a lyricist.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>D</i><i>etroit's Son</i> was produced entirely by <a href=""http://www.katalystmusic.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katalyst</a>, an Australian member of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16464-quakers-st/"">Quakers</a> collective, and his patchwork funk sets a frenetic pace. The music resembles Madlib and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29949-paul-white/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Paul White</a> in a way: It sorta plods along without much structure, and the kaleidoscopic sound feels influenced by the likes of George Clinton and Sun Ra. For <i>Detroit's Son</i>, Katalyst applies a dark sheen that reflects Guilty's home city's gritty reputation. The layered, slow-moving ""The D"" stands out, and ""Dirty Glove"" features an excellent verse from fellow Detroit rapper Phat Kat, and the driving rhythm conveys civic despair.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9d090073-282c-da19-45be-edb79fc9aee7""><span>But like the album's other featured rappers, Kat outshines Guilty, simply because he's more energetic and lyrically nimble. On ""Blue Collar"", Guilty sounds stilted alongside Elzhi, whose complex wordplay fits more naturally with Katalyst's spacey composition. As it plays, </span><i>Detroit's Son</i><span> feels like a collection of songs relying too heavily on well-worn themes (""Blunts in the Air"", ""Smoking"", ""Money""). Quick tracks like ""Ghetto"", ""The Music"", and ""Beautiful Death"" seem out of place and disrupt </span><i>Detroit</i><span>'s sequencing. ""Power Outage""—a salacious sex romp—brings the album to an awkward and abrupt ending. The album feels a bit hastily assembled and packaged, a widget in a long line of solid, dependable products. </span><i>Detroit's Son</i><span> is another line on Guilty's ever-growing resume, not a highlight.</span></span></p></div>"|20915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20915-detroits-son/|6.0|Marcus J.

Stern is the vehicle of Chuck Stern, a singer who spent a decade leading the aggressively esoteric Time of Orchids. That band tellingly hopscotched between metal labels like <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse</a> and imprints that embrace the avant-garde, <a href=""http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/bandshtml/timeoforchids.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">including Cuneiform and Tzadik</a>.<a href=""http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/bandshtml/timeoforchids.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>Since the end of Orchids, though, he's recorded and released loose-limbed solo work under his last name.</p>
<p>For <i>Bone Turquoise</i>, he at last built an elite band (and even scheduled a handful of shows) that includes Toby Driver, the mastermind of art-metal savants <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2394-kayo-dot/"">Kayo Dot</a>, and two of Driver's collaborators in that outfit. But the album's only <i>real </i>outburst—a plangent passage of sustained feedback, roiling drums, and ringing church bells—arrives just before the end of ""Birds of Passage"", the long record's serpentine closer. Instead, for much of these nine tracks, the quartet twists meticulously, almost seductively through pop-rock songs refracted at disorienting angles. At some points, what Stern terms his ""alien pop"" band even feels wistful—surprising given the group's pedigree, sure, but certainly not without reward.</p>
<p>Much of Stern's surprising restraint stems from the quartet's deliberate choices about dynamics and modulation. Rather than simply pivot between quiet and loud or fast and slow, this subtle group often does both at once, moving incrementally rather than aggressively. That's the most striking feature of opener ""Reliquary"", for instance, which goes from languid passages into tense interruptions and then back again. And ""Ousted"" deploys near-amoeboid motion, where every element, from the tempo to the tone, seems fluid enough to shift at any moment. No peak in volume or pace ever lasts too long. That approach allows for touches of post-rock and pop, math rock and metal inside songs where no one look overrides the others.</p>
<p>Stern himself is a provocative lyricist and an oddly endearing singer. His words are impressionistic and evocative—""Silt/ Precious memories/ A grave matter""—and his voice, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>'s, can quickly curve from a croon to a caterwaul. His songs and his sound deserve the full-rock-band treatment. Stern, however, seems to be readjusting to the role of proper bandleader a decade since Time of Orchids split, or of turning over his songs to collaborators who tamper with them. Across the eerie drift of ""Common Carrier"", piano notes echo against arid spaghetti western guitars, and the drums circle idly through low clouds of noise and hum. It's a wonderful arrangement, but Stern chooses to sit at its rear, merging his voice with the haze instead of pushing past it.</p>
<p>Much the same goes for ""Storm Guide"". It's a simple quatrain—""You are my storm guide/ You make it right…""—but the band's luxurious patter communicates the mood more than his near-diffident singing. And during ""The Plot"" and ""Trappings"", songs where the band zigs and zags through time signatures and textural approaches, his singing often seems to be chasing the playing, as if his songs have become so complex he's now just trying to keep up with them.</p>
<p>Still, Stern's tunes provide ballast and borders for Toby Driver and part of his Kayo Dot crew, something <i>that </i>band's albums have needed badly in recent years. <i>Bone Turquoise </i>is a promising start for the meeting of two captivating and contrasting bandleaders. Like the best of Kayo Dot and Time of Orchids, it revels in the unexpected—to the extent that it struggles with letting accessible songs stand, every once in a while, on their own.</p></div>"|20917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20917-bone-turquoise/|6.7|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s an abrupt introduction, a shoulder check that announces itself with its sudden sting, and it’s a fitting entrance for RetcH, who is best described as a menace. RetcH is a small-time drug dealer, a corner boy passing off product through closed-hand transactions on the block. Dealing opens doors to violent crime and petty larceny. There isn’t any of the chest beating bravado that helped mythologize drug impresarios like <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>-era <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a> or (to an entirely different extent) <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>. This isn’t glamorous. This is felony possession with intent to distribute. This is ""selling smack and tucking bread with your granny."" This isn’t <i>Scarface</i>, it’s <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLEaPB9UBWM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pusher</a></i>.</p>
<p>RetcH, or RetcHy P, first began to gain traction on the indie rap circuit with his soul-chopping 2013 mixtape, <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Retch-Polo-Sporting-Goods-mixtape.561582.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Polo Sporting Goods</i></a>, which was entirely produced by Thelonious Martin. The tape, and especially the brilliantly composed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amxYMsowqFc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Special Jim""</a>, which was <a href=""https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/status/412404506391891968"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">endorsed by</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, showcased his colorful storytelling and his angling perspective. RetcH often takes a winding approach to writing that supplements dramatic scene-setting with lesser, more arresting details. He has a keen sense for exactly what makes his stories worth telling—the visceral nature in which he presents them—and he constantly frames his verses like he’s describing a first person shooter to a blind person. But many of the soul samples on <i>Polo Sporting Goods</i> weren’t equipped to fully utilize his skillset. After doing a bid in county last year, RetcHy P returns better than he’s ever been, in his element, on <i>Finesse the World</i>, a super sinister segue into his vivid underworld.</p>
<p>As a proud street urchin, RetcH is a poster boy for Keeping It Real, one who won’t hesitate to snuff a show-off for his jewelry just to laugh about it. On ""Still With It"", which employs the ""fame hasn’t changed me"" trope with a twist, he raps, ""Still rock polo that I stole on me/ Still fuck up niggas that done told on me."" He’s at his best when he unapologetically explores the murky depths of villainy. There were glimpses of it on <i>Polo Sporting Goods</i>, but, as the title implies, that tape had a focus on flair over felonies. With <i>Finesse the World</i>, RetcHy P fully embraces being a scoundrel. This is the darkest he’s ever been, and he rips through ominous productions from noted gloom casters A$AP P on the Boards, H.N.I.C., and Antwon Carrera. There are no moments of reprieve; this is a labyrinth of dark alleyways. Turning the corner just introduces more unscrupulous characters.</p>
<p>Things really heat up on <i>Finesse the World</i> when the beats warp into sonic distillations of evil and RetcH barrels through them with a snarl. On ""Affiliation"" he locks eyes with his foes, firing literal and figurative shots in all directions over a forbidding, distorted piano riff. He writes engrossing tales about small-time drug trafficking on ""Cheap Work"", which makes use of its rumbling bass and a wailing train horn sample. RetcH is at his most venomous on the title track over grim production from H.N.I.C., rapping phrases like ""Ready to shoot the next thing that's breathing, nigga/ I'm fucking heated, a fucking heathen, policing demons"" with real fury. The deeper he crawls inside the sparse, shadowy soundscapes, the better he raps. The tape does have a somewhat singular sound, but RetcH is most at home beneath a cloak of darkness.</p>
<p>Somehow, through all the snarling and terrorizing on <i>Finesse the World</i>, RetcHy P retains his knack for storytelling, penning street epics as captivating as they are chilling. He does some of his best writing on ""Amedei Procelana"", which finds him posing naked for a sketch artist and dealing during chem class. He does some of his best rapping on the A$AP P-produced ""Round Here"", where he raps in compact bursts, stressing syllables like he’s trying to rip them. When he spits, ""Nigga you could get smoked eating jerked chicken/ In front of everybody and still won't be no witness,"" the juxtaposition of his phrasing with his cadence almost makes the act seem comical. There’s even a reunion with Thelonious Martin for ""Bad Luck"", which plays like a wicked outtake from the <i>Polo Sporting Goods</i> sessions. But he really puts it all together on <i>Finesse the World</i>’s most interesting cut, ""Product of Da Block"", layering an elastic riff with one of his most ferocious flows. He opens the song with a speech that condemns friendliness in rap: ""When the fuck did everyone become so friendly… When you see me, don’t even approach me because I ain’t friendly."" It only takes one listen for that same malice to become contagious.</p></div>"|20887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20887-finesse-the-world/|6.8|Sheldon Pearce

Even a cursory listen to Keef's new album, though, pokes a hole, or several, in the latter diagnosis. <i>Bang 3</i> is clearly not the work of a contrarian, unfocused artist (or, for that matter, an <a href=""http://www.last.fm/tag/outsider%20art/artists"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""outsider""</a> one) actively trying to antagonize and self-sabotage; nor is it an awkward or even phoned-in bid for renewed pop appeal. It's the work of a mature rapper and songwriter, putting the skills he developed over several years spent branching out stylistically to good use.</p>
<p>The release of <i>Bang 3 </i>carries some significance for Keef. This project has been in limbo since 2013; it was postulated first as his sophomore Interscope release, then as an album-turned-mixtape (a kiss-off to label bureaucracy), then, following the loss of his deal, as an independent album to arrive exactly one year ago. Luckily, <i>Bang 3 </i>isn't a too-little-too-late effort like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29471-gunplay/"">Gunplay</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20807-living-legend/"">recent, forestalled full-length</a>; instead, it sounds like Keef signaling a new beginning. The higher, clearer production values are most immediately noticeable—this is the crispest-sounding Keef release since 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17477-finally-rich/"">Finally Rich</a>—</i>and its well-ironed-out song structures. It feels like a new coat of paint to befit a new partnership: The rapper is in the honeymoon phase of a new deal with Greek billionaire, web entrepreneur, and <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/07/06/alki-david-greek-billionaire-chief-keef"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">probable psychopath</a> Alki David's multi-platform entertainment company FilmOn, and the sense that he's getting some new encouragement (and constructive criticism) is all over this confident and studied-sounding music.</p>
<p>On <i>Bang 3</i>, his voice is turned up loud, left untreated and pushed to the front of the mix, highlighting smaller, expressive details in his delivery. He builds energy across verses rather than hammering on one idea, relishing word sounds and inflecting his patterns with a conversational, sing-songy style: ""I'm rocking Tweet, beat, skeet, then delete"" (from ""You""). Often, the fun he's having in the booth is infectious, sellling chancier lines like ""Remember having pistol fights, now I'm having food fights/ Now we having rack fights, now we having jewel fights"" (from ""New School"").</p>
<p>For the most part, the production stays behind the rapping, unlike Keef's in-house work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20281-sorry-4-the-weight/""><i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i></a> and the self-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20027-chief-keef-gucci-mane-back-from-the-dead-2big-gucci-sosa/""><i>Back from the Dead 2</i></a>. Trusted Atlanta stalwart Zaytoven is here, as is Keef's first and most important collaborator, his childhood ally Young Chop. On ""Facts"", produced by Glo Gang,<b> </b>he delivers some of his most pointed and emotional lyrics on the album over eerie synth string seesaws.</p>
<p>That said, while these songs feel more well-plotted and pristinely delivered than anything he has released in a while (that is not to say ""better""), you still get the feeling they are molded from Keef's first thoughts after stepping in the booth. In this case, this makes for a lot of very good, but only a few great tracks; the rigorously composed '80s-inflected ballad ""Ain't Missing You""— with its gunshot timpanis, EKG fluttering, and fierce hook—is a one-off novelty, not indicative of a new, aggressively poppy direction.</p>
<p>Ever since the the sleek pop appeal of <i>Finally Rich</i>, fans have wondered if the rapper will someday make another streamlined, unassailably consistent project.  <i>Bang 3</i> seems to signal that, despite his newfound poise, he won't; he's not interested in that. That's not a bad thing, and it's even something of a relief to not be constantly waiting for some succinct return-to-form moment. The key to enjoying his work is appreciating the sweet spots, the moments where his reckless experimentation and his unmistakable attitude intersect and become more than the sum of their parts. These are tapes you wander into slowly and patiently, bypassing some murkier, hastier-sounding clunkers until you find the music that both sounds like no one else <i>and </i>begs for replays reveals itself. It's usually worth it.</p></div>"|20925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20925-bang-3/|7.1|Winston Cook-Wilson

Finally—the big break for Chicago's most criminally slept-on talent (though she hails from south suburb Calumet City), a double threat who'd dropped five good-to-great mixtapes before she'd turned 20. But things got weird quick: specifically, during the <a href=""http://www.power1051fm.com/articles/breakfast-club-served-up-489396/timbaland-talks-aaliyah-biopic-and-new-12988116/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Breakfast Club interview</a> where Timbaland recounted a dream in which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>'s ghost told him Tink was ""the one."" Then came <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHHcJWvYs1w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Million""</a>, the capable-yet-creepy single centered around a prominent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKbWF1jwMhE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One in a Million""</a> sample. The whole thing felt perverse: Timbo dressing up his new muse in his dead muse's clothes. It was hard to ignore the nagging fear that the super-producer was going to smother her.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Tink is not the next Aaliyah; most likely, nobody is. But she doesn't need to be, and in fact, attempting to mold her into Baby Girl the Sequel undersells her extraordinary talents. Despite her girl-next-door demeanor, there was always something mysterious about Aaliyah. At her core, Tink's appeal is that she is very much of this world. She bares her soul completely, putting her most private hopes, fears, and fantasies on paper in hopes of making things a little easier for someone else. Her </span><i>Winter's Diary</i><span> series—spanning from her </span><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Tink-Winters-Diary-mixtape.325519.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>2012 debut</span></a><span> to her latest, </span><i>Winter's Diary 3</i><span>—hinges around the loose concept of journaling about a boy that's fucked her entire world up. And as far as Tink's come since that first project, she's very much still that girl in her room, staying up too late stuck in her own head; the tape opens, as the first </span><i>Winter's Diary</i><span> did, with the sound of her pen scribbling furiously as she narrates: ""It's December 1st, and I met this guy…"" (No matter she's dropped it in the height of summer; the Gregorian calendar is irrelevant in Tink's universe, where cuffing season is year-round.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With <i>WD3</i>, any concerns about her impending debut album should be at least temporarily assuaged. It's a slighter work than last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18979-tink-winters-diary-2/""><i>Winter's Diary 2</i></a>, still her best project to date. But it shows her stepping back from the Aaliyah karaoke and the fun but slightly forced single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17357-tink-ratchet-commandments/"">""Ratchet Commandments""</a> to return to what initially made her so compelling: intimate, writerly, and improbably mature R&amp;B, never oversold by her lithe, iridescent voice. Though she's an excellent rapper, her tough, straightforward rap songs on <i>Alter Ego</i> and <i>Boss Up</i> often tended towards the generic. <i>WD3</i> is the best example yet of her fusing her rapping and singing. On the brief but powerful ""Medicine Interlude"", she lapses almost imperceptibly between the two. ""Look at the flicka the wrist/ I look at the way that you gotta regret every day waking up to your bitch,"" she seethes, rapid-fire, before slipping into deceptively sweet-sounding song: ""Baby you took that L."" Her bars give her ballads an essential edge, and her dense, nimble rap delivery often informs the patterns of her sung vocals: on ""Jupiter"", a slow-burner with a current of Zapp-style space funk, she switches up her flow more frequently than a <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> verse.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d98f945e-2367-ab86-a8f4-408df0b99678""><span>There's only one Timbaland production here, and it's better than any of their previous collaborations: ""L.E.A.S.H."", a quick-and-dirty bad-bitch anthem in the vein of early hit </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPdZR_gaQbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Bad Girl""</span></a><span> that subtly hints at a bass-heavy update of </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUL7OsH7v5s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Indian Flute""</a>.</span><span> ""I'ma turn this boy into a man,"" Tink purrs, and though she's still not old enough to legally drink, I can't help but believe her. But elsewhere, her mentor gets out of her way, giving her space to strengthen her old habits and branch out into new territory. ""Very Very Special"" is a quintessential Tink sex jam, dirty but subtle, with a Cookin Soul beat that lets its juke-referencing hook ride out into a slow bounce. ""Stripclub"" is a showcase for Tink's singular knack for empathetic, reality-grounded narrative (and a prime example of why only women should make songs about the plight of sex workers), telling the story of a single-mother stripper without moralizing or patronizing: ""Can't nobody judge you/ Make that money, don't let that money make you."" But the tape's most promising moment is its closer, ""Afterparty"", which ends the tape's arc from infatuation to breakup on an optimistic note. It's a weightless, '80s-nodding dance number—practically a freestyle track—and completely unlike anything Tink's released before. If her album's anything like this, we're in good hands.</span></span></p></div>"|20905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20905-winters-diary-3/|7.2|Meaghan Garvey

But that year would mark a significant turning point in his career. You can hear it in the jarring contrast between 2001’s solemn, sepia-toned <i>Field Songs</i> and 2003’s scabrous <i>Here Comes That Weird Chill</i>, where Lanegan's brooding balladry gave way to clanging industrial funk, lecherous electric-guitar grinds, and CB-radio squawks. There are a couple of ways to account for the dramatic shift. It’s possible that, with the Screaming Trees officially on ice as of 2000, Lanegan no longer felt the need to present his solo work as the sobering counterpoint to his main band’s amped-up overdrive. Or maybe <i>Weird Chill</i> (and its 2004 counterpart <i>Bubblegum</i>) bore the corrupting influence of becoming an official member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> for 2002’s colossal <i>Songs for the Deaf</i> (a move that would spur Lanegan’s transformation into rock’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27770-isobel-campbell-mark-lanegan/"">most</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11235-saturnalia/"">promiscuous</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13558-broken/"">collaborator</a>).</p>
<p><i>Houston</i> compiles songs Lanegan recorded and then shelved during this transitory period, but it doesn’t so much capture the metamorphosis in action as reinforce the abruptness of his about-face. Rather than serve as a bridge between <i>Field Songs</i> and <i>Weird Chill</i>, it suggests the cul-de-sac Lanegan may have hit had he continued down the former album’s footpath into more arid terrain (as emphasized by Mekon Jon Langford’s creepy cover art). That’s not to say <i>Houston</i> is a retread of <i>Field Songs</i>. Thanks to the atmospheric accordion haze provided by Bukka Allen, the sitar accents of Ian Moore, and controlled feedback bursts of long-time collaborator/ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> member Mike Johnson, the album gently blurs the edges of Lanegan’s sturdy roots rock template with subtle lysergic touches, like mirage vapors rising from the desert sands. But, presumably, <i>Houston</i> wasn’t the bold statement Lanegan needed to deliver at a time when, post-Screaming Trees, his solo work had been promoted from sideline activity to full-time endeavor. The album’s procedural subtitle—<i>Publishing Demos 2002</i>—hints at the career crossroads he was facing at the time.</p>
<p>However, 13 years removed from that context, <i>Houston</i> is a means to revisit Lanegan in his natural habitat, following a decade of increasingly eclectic pursuits both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP5GWYXp4d0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">within</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zLEI9oEHwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">without</a> his own discography. Rooted in timeless musical forms—folk, blues, country rock, spaghetti-western soundtracks, eastern-infused psychedelia—<i>Houston</i> never feels stylistically tethered to its moment of origin; it’s the sort of album that could’ve conceivably been released at any point in Lanegan’s career. Adding to the sense of temporal disorder is the fact a handful of its songs actually first surfaced on the soundtrack to <i>Cook County</i>, a 2009 indie drama about meth addicts in Texas that provided a suitably despairing backdrop for ""When It’s in You"", an early, radically different arrangement of <i>Weird Chill</i>’s howling opening salvo ""Methamphetamine Blues"". But its wobbly-kneed, light-headed lurch bears none of the nasty, scuzz-covered choogle that powers the later version, nor does it contain the song’s now-familiar chorus line. Perhaps Lanegan only later realized that staying the course to <i>Houston</i> would amount to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz6KjFSNq5o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m56s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rollin’ just to keep on rollin'</a>"".</p>
<p>""When It’s in You"" isn’t the only scrap material here salvaged for future use; the hypnotic guitar refrain of ""Two Horses"" would get recycled no fewer than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYiY5zkFHfo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwkBKy-4RMQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">times</a> on future releases. But like last year’s judiciously curated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18852-mark-lanegan-has-god-seen-my-shadow-an-anthology-1989-2011/"">Has God Seen My Shadow?</a></i> box set (which showcased two of these songs), <i>Houston</i> ultimately serves to illuminate a more sanguine side to Lanegan that’s often obscured by the imposing, wraithlike persona he’s projected in his later work. Even at his most dejected, there’s a perceptible smirk forming at the edges of his grimace; on the lilting acoustic serenade ""Nothing Much to Mention"", he surveys the wreckage of a doomed relationship at a wedding reception gone wrong, but is still game to take advantage of the open bar (""pack up that crystal chandelier/ but leave some pink champagne on ice""). And on <i>Houston</i>’s burning-embered highlight—the cantina slow dance ""Halcyon Days""—Lanegan optimistically raises a toast to the good times before wryly admitting, ""I’ll do my suffering tomorrow."" It’s a sweet, self-deprecating moment of levity undiminished by the fact that—as the grimy, guttural <i>Weird Chill</i> would soon prove—Lanegan wasn’t joking.</p></div>"|20933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20933-houston/|7.0|Stuart Berman

It's an appropriate inspiration given the plainspoken way Briana Marela talks about emotions. ""It’s cool to care! Chill is boring,"" she recently <a href=""https://twitter.com/brianamarela/status/630658310157438976"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, and she means it; she titled her 2012 album <a href=""https://brianamarela.bandcamp.com/album/speak-from-your-heart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Speak from Your Heart</i></a>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Marela recorded <i>All Around Us</i>, her first for <a href=""http://www.jagjaguwar.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jagjaguwar</a>, in Reykjavík with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> producer Alex Somers. Strings are played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/253-amiina/"">Amiina</a>, another name that shows up frequently in Sigur Rós album credits. Not surprisingly, some of this record’s instrumental sections—particularly the intros of ""Dani"", ""Surrender"", and ""Further""—feel like place settings for a soaring Jónsi vocal. Instead, Marela enters with crystalline sweetness, not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"">Chvrches</a>’ Lauren Mayberry, but breathier, more deliberate, and precise. Just as she does in her intimate live performances, Marela loops and layers pitched exhalations (usually ""oh"" or ""ah-oh"") to create choral collages that could just as easily evoke Iceland or her Pacific Northwest homeland. It’s her best, most affecting asset. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Her emotional forthrightness can be refreshing, too. On ""Friend Tonight"", she forces herself out of the house and pleads for an old flame to help her face the darkness, but only in a platonic way. ""Don’t come back to my bed tonight/ I just need a friend tonight,"" she repeats. Just as often, though, her only mildly poetic candor disrupts the songs. Marela’s lyrics sometimes lack craft and thoughtfulness, like words plucked from a diary and dropped into a song without regard to word choice or rhythm. It’s a fine line between childlike and childish, and too many songs tend toward the latter. On ""Take Care of Me"", a bouncy tale of a relationship going right, a line like ""Now you know me so well, it’s special that I can be myself"" stands out not for its honesty but its jarring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gms-Yk7mzv4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sesame Street"" </a>tone. </p>
<p class=""p1"">""I Don’t Belong to You"" suffers from the same clunkiness: ""Dream of all the possibilities/ We can do anything/ It’s not a competition/ Everyone has music within them."" And ""Follow It"" is meant to be similarly inspirational, but even amid the gorgeous waves of Marela’s vocals and the well-placed, unpredictable percussion, the words sound like the platitudes of an out-of-work motivational speaker.</p>
<p class=""p1"">She's at her best when she’s lyrically and instrumentally ethereal. ""Everything Is New"" reworks a song from an earlier live album, and Marela wisely lets it breathe and slowly build, accompanying only with subtle drones at first. ""What matters when everything is new?"" she asks. It’s a worthwhile question, and she uses it to get at the concept of carpe diem. ""All we have is now,"" she says. ""All we have is here, and I don’t have the time/ Want to keep you always near, but I don’t have the time."" <i>That</i> is honest simplicity. Sometimes—perhaps most often—relationships end not with fits of rage and screaming and crying. They end for multiple mundane reasons. Two people are right in front of each other, yet they don’t have time to figure it out. Life gets in the way. As Marela sings on the title track, ""Time is love, and love is the time it takes to know someone so well."" Love takes time, and that takes work—that’s the stuff that belongs in both children’s books and Marela’s music.</p></div>"|20923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20923-all-around-us/|5.8|Joel Oliphint

The NYC-based singer-songwriter has released four of them in four years, and they all take place somewhere similar. They are reliable and soothing, like old-fashioneds: Mix a little barely-perceptible organ hum and faraway slide guitars of '90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> with the reedy voice of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2714-cass-mccombs/"">Cass McCombs</a>, twist a few melancholic turns of phrase, and you will arrive at the place Zachary Cale is transmitting from. It's an inviting spot.</p>
<p>His last album, 2013's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18807-blue-rider/"">Blue Rider</a></i>, glides well into this one: You can cue them up and lose yourself in a pleasant haze for a couple of hours and not take immediate notice where they end. Cale probably wouldn't be offended by the suggestion: His 2011 collection was called <i>Noise of Welcome</i>, and so was a song on 2013's <i>Blue Rider.</i> He likes ""blue"": besides <i>Blue Rider</i>, <i>Duskland</i> has a ""Blue Moth"". The crisp, palm-muted acoustic strumming pattern on ""I Left the Old Cell"" is pretty-damn-near identical to the one on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PYT-kzE730"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hold Fast""</a> from <i>Blue Rider</i>. He repeats himself, but it doesn't make his music feel redundant, just identifiable as his own. </p>
<p>Squint into the haze, however, and you'll discern moving parts in these simple and rootsy songs that help them resonate. ""Sundowner"" has a softly complicated arrangement—organs chime at different levels in the mix, playing different chord voicings, and somewhere in that rosy glow, a steady piano pulses. Cale's solo acoustic playing usually covers all corners of an arrangement, from backbeat and melody to counterpoint. But he has a full band on <i>Duskland</i>, one that confidently evokes dream pop and country rock, and he luxuriates in their sound.</p>
<p>There are some horns on ""Low Light Serenade"" (another very on-the-nose song title) that might have come from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a> production, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent</a>'s last album. Cale makes good company with those artists, but his essence feels a little more elusive. Sometimes, that's just because it's often hard to make out what he is singing, even though his voice is mixed high; you can listen to a song multiple times, and only catch a few phrases. His singing is also odd, drawing out notes that don't seem obvious and hitching unexpectedly at others. He sits just far enough away from you. He's close enough to draw your attention, but far enough away to make you lean forward and follow him.</p></div>"|20705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20705-duskland/|7.1|Jayson Greene

This was aided in part by the group’s reunion in 2010. The collection coinciding with that reunion was the 23-song compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14002-quarantine-the-past/""><i>Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pavement</i></a> (which came out in both regular and Record Store Day editions). The title was a clever way of saying no, you really never can quarantine the past. Especially not when you can make money from it.</p>
<p>The newest installment to the discography is <i>The Secret History, Vol. 1</i>, which is the first in a five-part rarity series that will cover the band's proper LPs. They’re being framed as ""shadow albums"" that illustrate how productive Pavement was in their heyday, and how strong the material was that didn’t make it onto the albums themselves. This one collects rarities and live tracks and other odds and ends from 1990-1992, Pavement’s hallowed <i>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</i> period. I was a teenager then, and in love with Pavement, and it honestly was great.<i> </i><i>S&amp;E</i> was one of those albums I owned on vinyl and cassette (two copies, because one got burnt out), and then I found a third copy of the cassette in my backyard after I put on a show. It was everywhere for a certain small group of people, and it meant the world to them.</p>
<p>It still means a lot in 2015, though it’s tricky to calculate how much importance we can place on its B-sides and other miscellany, especially when all of these songs were available as part of the 2002 <i>Slanted &amp; Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe</i> 2XCD. Right, <i>all</i> of them. Even the liner notes included here—blurbs from Matador head Gerard Cosloy, Drag City head Dan Koretzky, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"">Stephen Malkmus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8298-spiral-stairs/"">Spiral Stairs</a>, and the booking agent Boche Billions—are from the 2002 edition.</p>
<p>If you're looking for silver linings, it’s the first time 25 of the 30 songs have appeared on vinyl— purists, there’s that. And, of course, the music itself is mostly great. You won’t need to hear the entire 1992 Brixton set from Pavement's first European tour opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> more than once, but there is plenty of slacker charm to Malkmus’ between-song banter—his references to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> (who the band went on to cover in 1997) and the Beatles in the same sentence, his nods to the elder Sonic Youth in their <i>The Year Punk Broke</i> moment, the wisecracks and asides. But the studio versions of the same songs are undeniably better, and the live takes occupy 13 of the 30 tracks here. (That said, the way they rip through ""Summer Babe"" reminds you how important we all knew that song was, and it can still deliver shivers.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, you get their first and second Peel session, the 7"" version of ""Summer Babe"", the fuzzed-out, grunge-nodding alternate take of ""Here"", and the rest of the <i>Redux</i> ""Slanted Sessions"" (a cleaner, more pristine ""Here"" shows up as part of Peel Session 1), ""Sue Me Jack"",  ""Greenlander"", and ""So Stark (You're a Skyscraper)"" from the <i>Watery, Domestic</i> sessions (I love that EP, and wish it was here in full, maybe instead of the live material), and etc. It’s a bit like Gus Van Sant’s remake of <i>Psycho</i>, though the sequencing <i>is</i> different from the 2002 version, and you get different cover art.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Brixton set, while introducing ""Frontwards"", Malkmus deadpans: ""‘Frontwards’ is the name of this song, it’s about moving forward obviously."" When Stuart Berman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9668-stray-slack-stephen-malkmus-and-spiral-stairs-talk-new-pavement-reissue-series/"">interviewed</a> Malkmus (and Spiral Stairs) about these compilations and asked ""Whose idea was it to go back and repackage these songs?,"" Malkmus answered ""Not mine"" and when asked if they added up to a proper album he replied: ""<span class=""s1"">No way. That’s just fuck-around shit, off-the-top-of-the-head stuff, and B-sides.""</span> Of course, the members of Pavement have moved forward: they're making music, writing about food, bartending, being horse racing buffs, and Gary Young. At this point, you wish the industry around them would, too.</p></div>"|20747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20747-the-secret-history-vol-1/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

She has described it as an exploration of Virginia's history as well as a meditation on brownness, on being Latina, as a kind of geology—""as mud, dirt and mineral, enmeshed in lithic, vast time scales."" Those are big, provocative ideas, but anyone who has ever logged serious mileage crossing the continent will have devoted at least some thought to the bonds of landscape and identity, and Crampton has covered more ground than most. She grew up between Southern California and northern Mexico; these days, she makes her home in Weyers Cave, Va., a small town (pop. 2473) in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>Specific places and the vastness of the continent itself both give shape to <i>American Drift</i>, an album of luminous digital synths and jarring samples whose title suggests tectonic plates and manifest destiny and maybe even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">car racing</a> (not impossible, given Crampton's interest in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB1J4o2vT5s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">monster trucks</a> and the culture of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IUA3FbHBlY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">car stereos</a>). ""Axacan"" gets its title from a 16th-century Spanish mission in present-day Virginia whose personnel were killed by the members of a native tribe (who were, in turn, massacred by Spanish reinforcements sent up from Florida). ""American Drift"", the album's meditative opening track, takes the form of an invocation: over tolling bells, a solemn voice rhetorically unites heaven and earth in unmistakably carnal terms—""O talus-sloped speared summit/ O earthwork and eyeball/ Varicose and branched…"" It's heady stuff, complete with references to the 17th-century Christian allegory <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.</p>
<p>But the encyclopedic references also work on a purely visceral level. Sonically, the album is like a hillside that's been worn away by erosion to reveal a sedimentary record of the millennia. ""Petrichrist"" is steeped in the chorused grunts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a> and his trap imitators, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6154-lil-jon/"">Lil Jon</a>'s trademark yelps are spread liberally across ""Axacan"". That song gets its loping triplet cadence from Andean <i>huayño</i>—a nod both to Crampton's Bolivian roots and to her time in Mexico, where she delved into <i>huayño </i>and <i>cumbia</i> via the local <i>tribal guarachero</i>—and its counter-rhythms come from the unsteady pulsing of crickets, suggesting a natural heartbeat beneath all those gleaming digital surfaces. And what a jagged gleam: all four tracks bristle with dissonant MIDI horns, speed-dial touch-tone bleeps, subwoofer-testing explosions, shell casings clattering to the ground, and all manner of FM radio special ef-ef-ef-ef-ects, like a morning show on steroids. As much as it is a record of the landscape of the Americas, <i>American Drift </i>is also, I think, a communion with the airwaves, an investigation of the ways that radio has contributed to the development of <i>sonic</i> dialects up and down the continent, shaping the way different communities hear not just sounds but frequencies, from the wash of white noise to the THX-worthy rumble of deepest sub-bass.</p>
<p>It is not easy listening. Crampton's music never has been. Previously, as E+E, she developed her voice as a collage artist, layering R&amp;B vocals with <i>cumbia</i> beats and explosive digital effects in a way that suggested standing in the middle of a television showroom in which every flatscreen was tuned to a different channel and every 5.1 system pushed deeply into the red. Likewise, listening to <i>American Drift </i>requires work to make sense of it all; it can be physically fatiguing. But it can also be exhilarating. Turn up ""Wing"" loud enough, wrap yourself up in the woodblock rhythms and trap chants and coruscating organs and a melody that sneakily resembles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-0sUuGufmw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shannon's ""Let the Music Play""</a>, and the effect is overwhelming in the best way. There is a deeply ecstatic <a href=""https://twitter.com/EPCrampton/status/628124722308452352"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spiritual dimension</a> to Crampton's work, and it invests her futurism with much more power than the usual techno-futurist's pose. As a self-proclaimed ""transevangelist,"" her concept of futurism is deeply invested in gender, in transformation, and in the process of becoming one's true self, and that, in turn, invests her music with an undeniable honesty and urgency. Her epiphanies feel hard-won, and they shine all the more brightly for it.</p></div>"|20871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20871-american-drift/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

Pop punk is not a subgenre known for its attention to nuance.</p>
<p>Their newest EP,<i> The Blackest Eye</i>, the title and lyrical themes of which riff on Toni Morrison's 1970 debut novel <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/01/11/home/morrison-bluest.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bluest Eye</i></a>, breaks out of those subgenre forms. On it, Aye Nako are exploring, stretching, and pushing their sound into a unique place. Opening track ""Leaving the Body"" is a relentlessly catchy but also deeply affecting personal account of living with the cycle of sexual trauma in many of its complex realities: the reiteration of patterns of abuse (""Dead men don't abuse/ Still you resurrect"") cemented by the common reaction of disbelief when one tries to tell one's story (""Who would believe me anyway/ It's just the kind of lie a girl would say""). ""Killswitch"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17608-aye-nako-white-noise/"">""White Noise""</a> examine racial fetishization and the immediate heaviness of a society that prizes whiteness at all costs.</p>
<p>Closer ""Sick Fuck"" addresses the weariness and predictability of dealing with a society that would rather turn away from you or place you into a box than acknowledge your queer humanity. ""Already know what you'd say,"" main vocalist Mars Ganito and new guitarist Jade Payne sing together on the chorus, which breaks down into a bridge: ""In lust we trust."" To follow a path away from heteronormativity, away from society's maps, is exhausting, but it is also necessary for so many to live in truth. Is it more exhausting to lie to yourself or to deal with others' approbation, the song asks.</p>
<p>The guitar lines<i>, </i>vocal interplay, lyrical poignancy and pointedness, and song structures on <i>The Blackest Eye </i>avoid predictability and heavy-handed formulae; there are plenty of stylistic curveballs. Though there's a lot of music out there that references the '90s by people who experienced their early childhood during that decade, little of it is as playful or as interesting; where others fall into the trap of directly replicating a sound, Aye Nako take scraps of sonic references to any number of early Sub Pop/K/Yoyo artists and manipulate and repurpose them to their own effect.</p>
<p>One gets the sense that Aye Nako are this tightly coiled and elegantly structured because of the urgency of what they have to say; they can't afford to be anything less than precise. This is a band that is ""political"" because the circumstances of their own lives necessitate it, and we are all lucky to be able to hear their voices.</p></div>"|20927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20927-the-blackest-eye-ep/|7.8|Jes Skolnik

It makes sense: the artist known otherwise as Jamison (he uses only his first name professionally) lives in the Fraser Valley, an exurb of Vancouver that isn't exactly known for a clubbing scene, and it's far enough away from its larger neighbor that you'd probably need a hotel room to bother going out. His earliest work was lumped in with chillwave, but through releases like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16631-teen-daze-all-of-us-together/""><i>All of Us, Together</i></a>, the rhythms started to become the focal point of his productions, leading him to play club sets and even DJ occasionally. But melody has always been Jamison's strong suit, which has lent his dance-oriented work a heart-on-sleeve quality that's more <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28474-tycho/"">Tycho</a> than techno. It also means that his time spent away from the drum machines—like 2013's delicate <i>Glacier</i>—have been the best showcases for his songwriting. And now, with <i>Morning World</i>, Jamison finds his voice. Picking up a guitar (and a studio full of other instruments), he plays, plucks, and sings his heart out for his best record yet.</p>
<p>Following a number of turbulent life changes, Jamison travelled down to San Francisco to work with John Vanderslice, who helps imbue <i>Morning World</i> with indie rock's warm, analog glow. It sounds almost nothing like previous Teen Daze material. Only Jamison's fluttery songwriting remains, and the new style puts his pleasant idiosyncrasies into sharper focus. Instead of pirouetting synths and daydream melodies, Jamison's singing is the center point of <i>Morning World</i>. His voice is wonderfully meek and boyish, with shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard/"">Ben Gibbard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2688-doug-martsch/"">Doug Martsch</a> in his soft, clearly enunciated delivery. It's a great match for the baroque sound he's built with Vanderslice, which feels ornate and well-appointed without reaching for the ostentatious.</p>
<p>While the meat of <i>Morning World</i> is largely string instruments and drums, Jamison's nostalgic synths play an important part, always lurking in the background. Synths swirl underneath the title track, giving it the childlike lilt of hauntology practitioners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29858-the-advisory-circle/"">the Advisory Circle</a>, and add vivid color between the lines on upbeat highlight ""Life in the Sea"". The latter is an ode to swimming that underlines the album's core theme: an appreciation of the simple things around you. Two of the album's tracks, including opener ""Valley of Gardens"", paint verdant pictures: ""I've come to watch the flowers as they grow/ Another chance to feel how little I know/ And another morning spent no feeling alone.""</p>
<p>Those lyrics highlight a naïveté that's been core to Teen Daze since Jamison was young, which makes his romantic songwriting feel as earnest as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a> song. It comes to a head on the LP's climax, ""Infinity"", which is one of his most touching songs yet, breaking out into a soaring coda where he repeats ""Let me stay a little longer/ I can find my way back home."" In the wake of the breakup of a long-term relationship that preceded <i>Morning World</i>, it's an elegant refrain that packs an adolescent's world of emotion into one loaded phrase.</p>
<p>When Jamison isn't being so direct, the album falters: ""You Said"" is a blandly casual instrumental that feels like treading water (think <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjO4fzuXDQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Flying""</a> from <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>), while ""Post Storm"" goes for epic but ends up dawdling through its hefty six minutes. Those signs suggest that Jamison might still be working to reconcile his singer-songwriter direction with his many past selves, but he sounds remarkably assured for the rest of it. More importantly, he sounds like himself more than ever—which makes <i>Morning World</i> Jamison's most captivating and personal album yet.</p></div>"|20918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20918-morning-world/|7.3|Andrew Ryce

With <i>Raw, Vol. 1</i>, however, the self-produced singer winnows out a slice of this familiar territory and advances it with a distinctly British sensibility. Not only is Azekel doing all the singing, songwriting, production, engineering, and mastering on <i>Raw</i>, but standout singles like bass-heavy ""Chronophobia"" and ""Mad About the Boy"" suggest that there is a quintessentially London R&amp;B sound, and that this, more specifically, is it.</p>
<p>The EP has an intimate, conversational atmosphere. Production flourishes peek out from every corner of the mix, from the purposeful, jolting radio fuzz on early single ""New Romance"" to the errant sirens and clips of presumably real DJs talking about Azekel on ""Late Intro"". Interludes like this make the EP sound like a late-night mood mix on the BBC—all vaporous voices and distant chatter over smooth, immersive ambience, crafted to sound incidental. </p>
<p><i>Raw Vol. 1</i> has a pretty solid narrative arc for an EP—from roiling statement singles like ""Chronophobia"" to the reflective closer ""Sold My Love"". Lyrically, however, <i>Raw</i> favors the oblique, with Azekel singing ingratiating lines (""I've been watching you watch me""; ""Sweet love, I've paid my dues"") that occasionally feel redundant. The downtempo soul of ""Holy Matrimony"" provides the best example of the vocal styling that sets Azekel apart: the lilting falsetto, the tremolo, the manifold ways his voice molds and shapeshifts to underscore the production, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>There is room in this spacious music for small, experimental touches that don't announce themselves—from the harmonious, intergalactic fade out on ""Holy Matrimony"" to the womping bassline on ""Chronophobia"", which is later underscored by a beat that sounds like someone clicking their tongue. It's a unique touch that's characteristic of <i>Raw, Vol. 1</i>—Azekel isn't reinventing the wheel, but his attention to detail results in something rare: a record that feels impulsive, risky, and polished all at the same time.</p></div>"|20686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20686-raw-vol-1/|6.2|Molly Beauchemin

A few years ago, he released a pair of singles ostensibly linked to his since-abandoned third album, <i>Detox</i>, and they were dire. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA770wpLX-Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Need a Doctor""</a>, in particular, was awkward and clunky, and it seemed as though Dre was straining too hard to perfect his comeback. He only re-emerged from the shadows in the name of Aftermath's latter-day luminary, <span id=""docs-internal-guid-65737af8-1967-ccf3-9c1a-17a732feb492""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/20935/pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/""><span>Kendrick Lamar</span></a></span>, who appeared to be energizing the elder statesman. But even Dre's surprise appearance on Lamar's major label debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/""><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i></a> in 2012 felt disjointed, providing more reason to fret over the producer's impending solo return.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">News that Dre had scrapped <i>Detox</i> entirely was confirmed alongside the announcement of this new album. Years of build-up washed away in the cancellation. It must have been a unique catharsis, purging an undeliverable hype with something tangible finally in hand. <i>Compton</i> isn't a bait-and-switch. If anything, the album is undersold by its billing as a soundtrack, a tag that misleads how well it stands on its own originality. Dre claims the recording was inspired by the set of <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, the just-released biopic about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"">N.W.A.</a>, and for a guy who's been helplessly coddling music in private for years, <i>Compton</i> ended up being a bit of a rush job. And yet, that haste helps the album sound more of-the-moment and free-flowing. For the first time in more than a decade, Dre's inspiration met up with a corporate deadline, and you can see the appeal for him: an opportunity to bundle his final record with a blockbuster movie about his career's origins. In that way, he's toying with the bookends of his career, polishing the story of his come-up while coming to terms with how to step away for good.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dre has been here before, of course, years removed from a game-changer with an entire industry's eyes trained on him, wondering, ""How might he do it again?"" But he's less invested in building a comeback narrative on </span><i>Compton </i><span>than he was on </span><i>2001</i><span>. Instead, the album finds Dre coming to terms with his career for himself, not others.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If there's a surprise here, it's that Dre, a 50-year-old near-billionaire long suspected of drifting out of touch, sounds charged-up, nimble, and relevant. Dre has always relied on other rappers and producers for inspiration and his own legacy is tied up in showcasing talent, lifting and rearranging it for his own cause. On </span><i>Compton</i><span> he's taken the approach and doubled down, and while the album is frequently personal, it's also communal, pushing his own voice towards the margins in favor of other vocalists. </span>The first raps we hear on the album are delivered by King Mez, a Raleigh native who, alongside Justus, the least known of the album's features, appears to have helped Dre with the bulk of his lyric writing. (Either one or both of them are credited on all but one of Dre's vocal tracks.) When Dre comes in on verse two of the sweeping opener ""Talk About It"", he brags about his unopened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a> royalty checks and jokes about buying the state of California. It's a reminder that Dre is the richest hip-hop artist ever, but he actually seems more interested in pinning down and framing his influence than bragging about his bank account.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17619-dr-dre-genocide-ft-kendrick-lamar-marsha-ambrosius-and-candice-pillay/"">""Genocide""</a> is the earliest and clearest standout, carrying one of two showstopping Kendrick Lamar appearances, who bends and stretches his voice to the limits he encountered on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a>. The song is also the first instance on the album of Dre sounding completely unlike himself. To be sure, he's always been an obvious conduit as a rapper, unashamedly channeling the flow and cadence of his ghostwriters, but here he's adopted a delivery that spills out in bursts, his register is higher, and he's snarling; it's not the only place on <i>Compton</i> that Dre's rapping is both impressively light-footed and almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Musically, the album is a reminder that Dre's palette and appetite for sound has always been eclectic, and rather than retread, we hear him pushing into new territory. At one moment</span><span>,</span><span> he's</span><span><a href=""https://youtu.be/ywhlQLKMcPw?t=37m23s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> sampling an obscure modern funk band</a> </span><span>from Italy (for ""One Shot One Kill"") and the next, lifting a guitar riff from</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL3raxfj1oo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> a random Turkish psychedelic burner</span></a><span>. Throughout, session musicians polish out the edges, and Dre continues to lean on live keys and bass to fill out chunky bottom ends.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dre's quietest and most stalwart collaborator behind the boards on <i>Compton</i> is Focus…, son of Chic bassist Bernard Edwards and a longtime Aftermath in-house guy. (Focus… ditched the label in 2009 after spending years on end piling music into the <i>Detox</i> dump. He returned a few years later, working directly alongside Dre.) If Focus… is the easily overlooked workhorse—he contributes keys and bass as well as frequent co-production credits—higher-profile appearances from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a> and DJ Dahi inflect Dre's music with their personalities. Primo's offering comes in the form of ""Animals"", impressively billed as the first-ever Premier and Dre collaboration. (Russian producer BMB SpaceKid programmed drums, which carry the best of the Gang Starr producer's fingerprints.) The song is also the most politically pressing on the album and nearly 30 years after ""Fuck Tha Police"" we hear desperation in place of rage. Anderson .Paak, a young multi-talent from Los Angeles who's all over <i>Compton</i>, finds his star turn here. (The song originally belonged to him and Premier.) Still, Dre's verse is powerful, a member of the one percent grappling with racism and the depressingly consistent anguish of being Black in America. ""Why the fuck are they after me?"" he booms, ""Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard, or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The cast of musicians employed on <i>Compton</i> is as varied as ever, but some of the most dramatic displays come from the legends. On ""One Shot One Kill"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a> rekindles an agitated menace that he seemed to have lost more than a decade ago. Xzibit and Cold 187um dip into a perfect stride over the meandering ""Loose Cannons"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"">The Game</a>, for the first time since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/""><i>The Documentary</i></a>, sounds like he deserved that original Dre co-sign, owning his original identity instead of falling into chameleonic flow-stealing. ""Deep Water"" is the most dynamic and brooding cut, a moment where everyone's contributions click into place. Anderson .Paak's performance as a drowning man is upsetting and uncomfortable, while Kendrick Lamar appears to be throwing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> subliminals—and enlisting Dre in doing so. His verse is so overspilling with genius technicality that it's hard to dwell in any one place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-4ef10b0c-1910-8543-b080-13c34a00590d""><span>Part of the trouble in anticipating a new Dre album, then, has been a difficulty in framing our expectations. Hip-hop has been evolving around Dr. Dre for decades: He injected the type of ambitious orchestration into the genre that helped it modernize in the '90s, cannibalizing and assimilating everything around it. On his previous classics he showed us that new things were possible, a magic that's available only so many times in one life. </span><i>Compton</i><span> doesn't have the same breathtaking power, but it's excellent nonetheless, and more complicated and jarring than we could have known to hope for. The biggest and most immediately recognizable accomplishments here are basic: Dre is doing more than just fitting in or harking back, and both of those inclinations together were the real nail biters surrounding his new music anyway. Knowing that this is Dre's finale, there's a pleasant melancholy that frames </span><i>Compton</i><span>, and with the music in our ears, acknowledging that maybe that's for the best.</span></span></p></div>"|20935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/|8.8|Jay Balfour

The sentiment isn't too dissimilar from plenty of ""us against the world"" street rap songs, but Dej's sweet hook and relatively unknown status gave the song an extra push. She arrived aloof, an emotion that gains currency as social networks proliferate and push themselves into every corner of our lives. People can buy followers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60651-drake-trolls-meek-mill-brings-out-kanye-west-pharrell-future-at-ovo-fest/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">beef between superstars can start over tweets</a>, and it is harder and harder to opt out of any of it. Dej's latest EP may indulge in this world—see the hashtag inclusion in the EP's title <i>#AndSeeThatsTheThing</i>—but her default remains disinterest.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On the EP's opening track ""Desire"", Dej says ""I'd rather feel on myself than let you feel on my ass,"" and the rest of the EP is just as self-contained and confident. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>-assisted ""Back Up"", one of the most upbeat tracks in Dej's catalog, focuses on keeping the distance with someone after just one night together. Big Sean, someone with a very public and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfrRLdUMhqA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on the record</a> relationship history, struggles to keep up with Dej's cold-hearted dismissals (""If I fuck and make you come, you gotta promise not to stress me,"" she insists). But she never shuts herself off so much to miss when real attraction might be coming her way. ""Butterflies"" refers to the little creatures that flutter in nervous stomachs, and it captures the cheeks-blushing sweetness that is the other side of Dej. On ""Hey There"", Dej partners with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>—more recently a heel on <i><a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/"">Dirty Sprite 2</a></i>—who rediscovers his softer side that won over fans a few years ago with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIrhcTkHX_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Turn on the Lights""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dej Loaf's confidence extends to her production. She knows the particular sound that works for her mix of rap and R&amp;B. The EP's production stays laidback, so Dej can smoothly jump between singing and rapping without leaning too heavily towards one style. ""Back Up"" is the exception, a crisp straight-ahead rap song that forgoes genre blurring. Though Dej's talent is walking both sides of that divide, she's a strong enough singer and rapper that it's great hearing her not stuck on instrumentals that straddle the genre fence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The performative nature of muting people from one's life isn't seeking true isolation, but being selective about who is allowed into one's world. Whether it is a passerby on the street, dudes creeping into DMs, or the comment section of Instagram, there are always so many voices shouting. The response of Dej's music to pull inward feels appropriate, to only open up when most tender. <i>#AndSeeThatsTheThing</i> might sound <a href=""https://twitter.com/sosadtoday"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">so sad today</a>, but Dej appears comfortably dour.</p></div>"|20896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20896-andseethatsthething-ep/|7.4|David Turner

After laboring for years as a country outlier in a city better known for indie rock, she self-released two albums and a handful of EPs in the 2000s, weathered one ill-fated major-label signing, then toured as a back-up singer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12459-brandon-flowers/"">Brandon Flowers</a>. At the beginning of this decade, she signed with <a href=""http://lastgangentertainment.com/records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Last Gang Records</a>, releasing two well-reviewed albums that introduced her studiously forlorn vocals and twang-goth sound to a slowly growing audience. And yet, on her latest album, she sounds like she knows the best part is behind and now she’s living in a lonely place called <i>Faded Gloryville</i>.</p>
<p>Ironically, <i>Faded Gloryville</i> might be Ortega's biggest record yet, one that feels well timed amid a boom of semi-traditionalist female country singer-songwriters. She's never quite as witty as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32337-kacey-musgraves/"">Kacey Musgraves</a> or as bold as <a href=""http://www.nikkilane.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nikki Lane</a>, and she doesn't have the ability to immediately shatter your heart the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10879-ashley-monroe/"">Ashley Monroe</a> can. Instead, she has a shrewd, quiet self-awareness: ""I ain't the girl you're looking for... I ain't the girl for you,"" she sings sweetly on ""I Ain't the Girl"". Even though the song is sung to a clean-cut, buttoned up would-be suitor, you get the sense that she might be speaking directly to you, the listener, and wondering why the hell you're even bothering with her.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That's not low self-esteem or fake humility. Instead, one suspects that it has more to do with always being on the edges of the country industry. Ortega is a Canadian with Irish-Mexican blood and a sartorial style that's more Stevie Nicks than Loretta Lynn. Rather than small towns, she sings about big cities, especially on the standout ""Run-Down Neighborhood"", which finds a sturdy friendship taking shape in the sort of neighborhood where people drive through without stopping at red lights. </span>""Hey, you can have some of my weed if I can smoke your cigarette/ I might be running low, but I ain't out just yet,"" she sings brightly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Most of the time Ortega sounds spry, even excitable, singing with a knowing wink underscoring the fatalism of the songs. E</span>ven the grim details of a hard-luck life can't keep her down. ""Run Amuck"" begins as a typical lament about an unfaithful guy, but the second verse reveals that her man is chasing something besides skirts: ""Uppers and downers, coffee and cocaine,"" she sings, then adds, ""Egg in a frying pan, this is your brain."" In just a few words and a clever rhyme, Ortega stages an intervention and nods at the hokey inadequacy of interventions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There's more than a little rage driving that song, just as there's more than a little sadness nipping at the edges of ""Ain't the Girl"". Even if this isn't her most cohesive or inventive album (that would be 2012's </span><i>Cigarettes &amp; Truckstops</i><span>), these songs highlight her innate ability to peel back the layers of country convention and find weird new emotions underneath. Ultimately, she makes<i> Faded Gloryville</i> sound not so much like a place of diminished opportunity, but endless possibility.</span></p></div>"|20908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20908-faded-gloryville/|7.0|Stephen M.

He's refined his style over 15 years and hundreds of productions, from Prodigy's thug-rap high-water mark <i>Return of the Mac</i> to brilliant loosies for Dilated Peoples (""Worst Comes to Worst""), Nas (""Book of Rhymes"") and Raekwon (""Surgical Gloves""). His sound moves between two poles. There are the loops woven out of all manner of sample fodder, like the superior <i>Israeli Salad</i> instrumental suite he released earlier this year that excavates records purchased during a trip to Israel. Then there's his coldly synthesized gangster music, best displayed on Mobb Deep's mid-'00s hit ""Got It Twisted"", and seemingly inspired by New Wave pop and '80s crime soundtracks like Giorgio Moroder's <i>Scarface</i> and Tangerine Dream's <i>Thief</i>.<b> </b><span id=""docs-internal-guid-30633b23-19d1-9644-ac7f-b8a37f177ef9""> Both types are clipped and chopped like vintage DJ Premier, yet rumble at a leisurely West Coast tempo. </span></p>
<p>Alchemist does consistently entertaining work, but it's become predictable after over a decade and too much music—so far this year, he's dropped <i>Israeli Salad</i> and <i>Retarded Alligator Beats</i> joints, and now comes Gangrene's <i>You Disgust Me</i>. Yet Al's Gangrene project with Oh No gives both a chance to subvert their well-worn templates into something more dynamic. T<span id=""docs-internal-guid-30633b23-19d3-a0a7-8a8b-86e1c1a0cb50""><span>he two complement each other: Oh No likes to flip vinyl from exotic sources, too, whether it's </span><i>Dr. No's Ethiopium</i><span> or </span><span>Exodus into <i>Unheard Rhythms</i></span><span>, the latter built around Galt MacDermot's catalog. He tends to be underrated—it's unlikely that most people who heard Dr. Dre's </span><i>Compton</i><span> and its ""Issues"" track know that Oh No also sampled Turkish folk singer Selda's ""Ince Ince"" with his 2007 track ""Heavy"", which Mos Def used for his 2009 single ""Supermagic"". And while his dependence on traditionalist sample loops runs deeper than Alchemist, he uses rhythm more dynamically.</span></span></p>
<p>Both Alchemist and Oh No approach Gangrene's <i>You Disgust Me</i> as an excursion into weed-hazed hip-hop psychedelia: Snippets of whacked-out voices, culled from some late night VHS videodrome, dudes talking greasy over crate-digger's delights. (RIP Sean Price, who drops a jewel on ""Sheet Music"" alongside Mobb Deep's Havoc.) It's a formula that Gangrene established over its two albums, <i>Gutter Water</i> and <i>Vodka &amp; Ayahuasca</i>, light themes that bracket the usual backpack thuggery.<b> </b>The thirteen tracks add up to just under 40 minutes, and often seem to blend in with one another. Peaks like “Noon Chuckas,” its ominous big band buildup smoothing out into a female voice’s hypnotic glissando, sound indistinguishable from knuckleheaded errata like “Driving Gloves,” with Action Bronson’s brain fart about needing ""a bitch with a pussy like like a Little League glove.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As rappers</span><span>, the words Alchemist and Oh No say are less interesting than the sound of their slangy, chippy voices riffing over the blappers.</span><span>Their peak </span><span>You Disgust Me</span><span> moment arrives on ""The Man with the Horn"", which draws equal inspiration from Miles Davis-styled melancholy and New York noir vis-à-vis Travis Bickle samples. Al visualizes himself as a loner wandering the streets, ""stumble out the bar, vision blurry/ Humphrey Bogart, face underneath the rim of my derby."" Oh No adds, ""It's looking like a scene out of Vegas/ It's nighttime, and the jazz jukebox is playing."" It offers a glimpse of what Gangrene could be if it was more than just headnod music stuffed with weed jokes. </span><span>Both are more than capable of crafting memorable hip-hop music, even if they're too focused on cranking out bangers at an industrial rate to notice whether anything they've made stands out.</span></p></div>"|20894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20894-you-disgust-me/|6.9|Mosi Reeves

It was created not by pasty knob-noodlers or bros in culturally-appropriative headgear, but a multiethnic, pansexual community of revelers interested in an almost spiritual loss of self, an out-of-body escapism that could only be achieved through electronics, dancing, and the occasional hit of very potent psychedelics. Good techno, inherently, does not forget that heritage. <i>Persuasion</i>, a new three-song EP by New York City-based duo Blondes, is good techno.</p>
<p>Their newest offering since a <a href=""blondes.bandcamp.com/album/rein"">one-off collage</a> and 2013's gangly soundscape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18261-blondes-swisher/""><i>Swisher</i></a>, <i>Persuasion</i> sees Blondes turning their massive live show inside out and reconstructing it in a studio setting. It's more visceral and immediate than what they've been releasing in the past few years, condensing their more pensive moments into 25 minutes of purified dance. Title track ""Persuasion"" starts off with a shuffleboard beat and a synth blip that sounds almost exactly like the default iPhone text message alert tone, until the main synthesizer loop tickles its way in and the rest of the track bubbles over an eight-minute build. It's what Blondes do best: expertly guide their audience to that place beyond the dancefloor, grabbing their cerebrums with sound and forcibly lifting them to the heavens, or at the very least to the top of the DJ booth.</p>
<p>""Son"" is centered around a runaway timpani chased by swirling synth stabs, landing only a few thumps short of Afrobeat in the process. A third of the way through, reverberated and outstretched vocals punctuate the mix. It's a daring touch that pays off, imbuing the track with an element both human and distinctly alien. As ""Son"" slows down and comes to a close, the kettledrum finally loses its steam and a lone hi-hat struggles past the finish line—a witty fake-out, as it happens, as third and final track ""Inner Motive"" gears up in a swell of muted beats and modulated synths. This is the closest the EP comes to customary Blondes, a pulsating, multi-layered beat accompanied by a multitude of overlapping squiggles. Much like the techno of yore, <i>Persuasion</i> serves its primary purpose as dance music, but is also intelligent, experimental, and above all, fun—all qualifiers that many of Blondes' compatriots could learn a thing or two about.</p></div>"|20936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20936-persuasion-ep/|7.3|Cameron Cook

For years, the elusive Berkeley rapper has built a cottage industry out of making invention-in-real-time the focal point and pleasure center of his music. Process is foregrounded, not sublimated; there is no desire to pull anything, in particular, <i>off</i> with a given song, just to tap into a mindset and atmosphere. This is part of what has made Lil B's unconventional style so maddening to traditionalists: Normally, the success of a freestyle is gauged by the degree to which it sounds too ""good"" to be one<span>—</span>by the rapper's ability to keep up steam. In B's world, the approach is hands-off, quasi-Eastern-philosophical; steam, as a concept, is rejected completely. Vulnerability is the Based God's most important tool: He tunnels into his moments of non-proficiency, like a free jazzer might lean into a bad note to justify it. This is, in a nutshell, B's ""Based"" state of mind, which was, before it became the stuff of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9098-fanbased/"">hip-hop's most legendary meme culture</a>, just an adjective describing a musical procedure.</p>
<p>With Lil B, the creative environment automatically creeps into the listening experience. Since his multiple-MySpace days in the late '00s, Lil B's music has conjured the image of a lone wolf at his laptop in the basement of his Berkeley villa, leaving the Record button red for an hour or two at a time, ripping songs to MP3 without even listening back to them. While this lonesome vision has heightened the ""Based God"" mystique, it also makes some of B's music feel cramped and ritualistic<span>—</span>a one-man-show confined to too small of a stage.</p>
<p><span>Recently, it seems as if B, too, has been feeling the claustrophobia.</span> Tapes have been arriving at a diminishing rate, with a paltry three last year and nothing in 2015. He's been getting out of the house more<span>—</span>not only to do tours and motivational lectures, but to <a href=""http://hypetrak.com/2015/06/kehlani-iamsu-g-eazy-lil-b-champion/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">work</a> <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/07/23/keith-jackson-lil-b-makonnen-pussy-money-dope"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57923-frank-ocean-lil-b-in-the-studio-together/"">others</a>. His new six-song <i>Based Freestyles</i> mixtape with Chicago superstar-in-the-making Chance the Rapper is the first major yield of this more social period, putting B back in human space and time to a degree we haven't heard since the days of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"">Soulja Boy</a> collaboration<i> Pretty Boy Millionaires</i>.<b> </b></p>
<p><i>Free, </i>initially, highlights the Based elements of Chance's style, though he is usually more associated with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick</a>'s more athletic tongue-twisting. Chance, like B, is interested in tapping into the rhythms and cadences of speech in his rapping: see the dialogue-y features he contributed to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5kqg-9JMxw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVP_w1rQweE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>'s recent projects. Both rappers, in their own ways, frequently make their bits of doggerel feel almost-cogent and sometimes beautiful. </p>
<p>But it's essential for any great duo to be foils to one another, and <i>Free</i> is propelled by the differences between the two young rappers as much as their shared agenda. Though Chance is a known studio rat, his art comes from a very live and extroverted tradition—the open mic stage. So while B's verses gradually dissemble instead of building in clear trajectories, Chance's are a series of razor-sharp gestures, monologues delivered to hypothetical stadiums. The younger rapper is a more apt rhythmic stylist, or at least a more hyperactive one, with a unique sense of daubed-on phrasing and improvisational timing. For Chance, the musical squiggle comes before the thought, whereas for B, rhythms get weird only when the words do. This is particularly evident on the faster tracks, ""Do My Dance"" (with an acid-jazz-trap beat in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/""><i>Acid Rap</i></a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bigsk2g7xO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chain Smoker""</a>) <span>and the demented, strip-club-anthemic ""Rare,"" </span>where Chance enters with a swaggering half-hook before devolving into yips and screech ad libs. In some of these pre-verbal moments, it feels like one is truly witnessing something previously unnoticed at the heart of these rappers' artistry—what is at the root of ""songwriting"" for them.</p>
<p>What really makes this release replayable, though, are the gold foibles: the moments where both artists—especially Chance, who's not as used to this sort of thing—surprise themselves. In ""First Mixtape"", the most fun-loving and directly collaborative track, Chance categorizes his own rapid-fire flow almost by accident (""Need a gas mask just to rap ass fast/…As Eminem back in '96""). He breaks off, stunned, as B in the background responds with a long ""Wooo!"" in amazement. ""Who you think you rhyming with?"" Chance explodes enthusiastically, laughing. ""You don't got a mixtape with Lil B!""</p>
<p>Likewise, on his half of the nine-plus-minute mellotron dirge ""Amen"", Chance sings with a soulful, beatific air, but as he heads more and more uncontrollably into the inexpressible, his phrases become stifled by giggles: ""It's like God is my...on the side of my ear and I watch him talk into the shit/ I can't get into the shit, but understand that I'm blessed...God, just say 'yes.'"" B, naturally, swoops in to play the Creator: ""Yes, yes."" Meanwhile, in the background, there are mutterings of friends coming into the studio, getting introduced to one another, and leaving, possibly weirded out (""What happened to my bros?"" Chance cries out at a certain point, as if desperate for something to ground him).</p>
<p>All of the tracks feature engaging microdramas along these lines. To make a record of this sort— both intimate and compelling—is no small achievement: Anyone who's ever recorded themselves jamming with friends, and then forced their other friends to listen back to it afterwards, will realize this.<b> </b>On all fronts, Chance and B deliver, with an extra helping of humor and lust for life—even beyond the degree we might have expected from these two. When B stops ranting about how it's okay to get ""a Buick or Ford"" and ""liv[ing] with the Lord"" to turn on a dime and ask, earnestly, ""How you doin' today, Chance?"", I would defy anyone not to laugh, and resist the urge to play the exchange right back again. No, this is not the stuff of genius, but it's enough to save anyone's bad day.</p></div>"|20955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20955-free-based-freestyles-mixtape/|7.7|Winston Cook-Wilson

<p>As Descloux drifted between simultaneous relationships with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a> and various other artists, she and Esteban split but maintained a close personal and creative bond. She acquired a Fender Jazzmaster, and formed Rosa Yemen with Esteban’s brother, Didier, just around the time of the legendary Artists Space noise series immortalized in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2105-no-new-york/""><i>No New York</i></a> compilation. Following unhinged gigs at the Kitchen and the Mudd Club where Descloux would scream herself silly and wrap the mic cable around her throat, the duo (named in honor of European activists like Rosa Luxembourg and the Baader-Meinhof group) consecrated their fractious musical relationship in a 12-inch, <i>Live in N.Y.C. July 1978</i>. It became the fifth release on the nascent ZE Records, which Esteban had founded earlier that year with the British writer Michael Zilkha.</p>
<p>On that 12-inch, only ""Decryptated"" has any significant percussion, which sounds like it was slapped out on an empty bucket. The record is a clash between two guitars, the lead needling with the intensity of a polygraph test administered by a fascist regime, the loose rhythm taking its cues from dub. It’s beginners’ stuff, very much in the vein of Rosa Yemen’s destructive no wave peers, though the atmosphere is consummately terrifying, fraught with the danger of illicit negotiations on dark street corners. ""Herpes Simplex"" starts with the sound of gasping and frantic footsteps, and then Descloux comes in, yelping about the STI in fractured hysterics. She shudders the word ""<i>metabolisme!</i>"" like Dracula rising from his coffin.</p>
<p>There are probably dozens, or maybe even hundreds of records like <i>Rosa Yemen Live in N.Y.C.</i>—gripping if unexceptional also-rans that may find an audience as reissue culture has to dig deeper. <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light In The Attic</a> has appended these songs to the first in their Lizzy Mercier Descloux reissue series, which focuses on <i>Press Color</i>, the first album under her own name, and one that warrants the marquee billing. In February 1979, as Sid Vicious was being sprinkled on Nancy Spungen’s grave, Descloux, Didier Esteban, Erik Eliasson (from Marie et les Garçons) and Jimmy Young headed into the third room of Bob Blank’s Blank Tapes studio at 37 West 20th Street for 10 days of intense recording. It was still under construction at the time, but then so was Descloux. Where Parisian studios would have scoffed at this bunch of amateurs, Blank welcomed their naïve creative impulses.</p>
<p><i>Press Color</i> was originally intended to be a group release, but ZE decided that Descloux’s name and face was a better selling point. At the time they were pushing their ""mutant disco"" aesthetic on their less fully formed artists. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/934-cristina/"">Cristina</a>, Zilkha’s wife, had released ""Disco Clone"", which sent up the interchangeability of women within the scene. Descloux was working within the label’s prescribed sound, but she emerges here as a unique, instinctive voice, abandoning the harrowed yelps of Rosa Yemen to trill and jabber with glee. Uninterested in the conventions of rock, she pursued her guitar playing just the same way.</p>
<p>As a New York newcomer, the failed '60s dream didn’t oppress Descloux in the same way as it did her new peers: she rose early to browse the fish market, swam in Central Park’s Lasker Pool, and scaled rooftops for the views. Her peers and boyfriends recall her as the only person who wore bright colors in a monochromatic scene. And so <i>Press Color</i> is full of joy and possibility rather than psychic pain and bankruptcy, opening with a shimmying cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/562-arthur-brown/"">Arthur Brown</a>’s ""Fire"" that moves at the pace of an enervated woodpecker. Descloux’s strong French accent just adds to the charm: ""You’ve been so blind! You fall be’ind!"" she explodes amidst the glittering whirl.</p>
<p>There are more covers: a skeletal take on Lalo Shifrin’s ""Mission Impossible"" theme and ""Jim on the Move"", where Descloux seems to vocalize every twitch of her tongue. A strain of no wave malevolence lingers in ""Torso Corso"", ""Wawa"" (whose tumbling bassline deserves to be fully iconic), and the dubbed-out ""Aya Mood"", which show off the band’s nimble, minimalist interplay. Her shuffling, splayed redux of Peggy Lee’s ""Fever"" as ""Tumor"" has an obvious morbid humor, though it’s the original ""No Golden Throat"" where her disposition and tastes come through most strongly.</p>
<p>By all accounts, Descloux wasn’t into slogging away in the studio, and resisted Michel Esteban’s attempts to get her to sing properly. ""Right now I’m not at all a writer of words,"" she told <i>New York Rocker</i> in the summer of 1980. ""I’m using the words completely for what they sound like, how they fit with the rhythms… What’s beautiful is that I don’t speak perfect English but I can get lost in the dictionary and just <i>discover</i> the words."" ""Golden Throat"" is her protest at being asked to fit any idiom: she repeats the line ""I’ll never have a golden throat"" a dozen different ways, seducing it, mocking it, playing her voicebox like a plastic slide whistle. Phonetic chatter litters the relaxed reggae guitar, prefiguring the direction she would pursue later in her career as she recorded in Nassau and apartheid-era Soweto. She never met <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">the Slits</a>, but they shared a love of reggae and silliness. European avant-garde artists are often self-serious, or considered to be, but Descloux and Ari Up (along with Palmolive and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/"">the Raincoats</a>' Ana da Silva) brought a welcome playful streak to what could be an austere scene.</p>
<p>Compared to 1979’s major punk releases, it’s not hard to see why <i>Press Color</i> didn’t make much of a dent in the U.S., UK, or even France. Next to the likes of <i>Fear of Music</i>, <i>Entertainment!</i>, <i>The B-52s</i>, <i>Tom Verlaine</i>, <i>The Raincoats</i>, <i>This Heat</i>, <i>Broken English</i>, <i>Metal Box</i>, <i>London Calling</i>, <i>Cut</i>, and <i>Y</i>, it’s a vivid curio and cool personality splatter rather than a cultural landmark. Descloux would make those later (even if their recognition remains overdue). What <i>Press Color</i> does is distill our collective excitement and unceasing wonder at a scene that’s almost four decades old. New York's no wave and punk’s protagonists were down in the squalor, waging a brutal, draining fight against their city, their country, the commoditization of their sound. As an outsider, Descloux was able to soak up their energy and revolution and use it to fuel the discovery of her own cultural identity and purpose. <i>Press Color</i> isn’t wildly original, but it’s the making of one.</p></div>"|20767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20767-press-color/|8.2|Laura Snapes

That was its chief attraction, but also its chief flaw. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17478-loyal/""><i>Loyal</i></a> offered track after track of beatless shimmer, and it was gorgeous, but after a while, you could be forgiven for wanting something a little more substantial to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p><i>Body Complex</i> retains <i>Loyal</i>'s delectable lightness but wisely injects a little more variety and a lot more physicality. Per the new album's title, you can actually <i>dance</i> to many of these songs. Although the rosy glow of his synthesizers remains the music's organizing principle and main attraction, six of the new album's 10 tracks feature crisp, boom-tick drum programming. His beats aren't terribly ornate or advanced, but they're utilitarian in a way that suits listening as well as dancing. Like a square black frame around a watercolor, they help to delineate all the washed-out frequencies they contain.</p>
<p>The shoegaze- textured ""Personal Kiosk"" balances murky chords with scraped cymbals, while ""Perfume Catalog"" attaches a muffled machine beat to gauzy choral pads and high-end shimmer; it sounds a little like some heavenly fusion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/17104-10cc/"">10cc</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdCY0CgMoq8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Not in Love""</a>—or the first few seconds of it, anyway—and Newworldaquarium's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3p3ZdnmCYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Trespassers""</a>, still the high-water mark for the treble register in techno. ""Warm Air Estate"", featuring a singer named Outerbridge, points to a possible next step for Alexander's project: actual songs. His vocals remain indistinct, but the mere presence of a voice, with a clearly defined bassline, makes for the most corporeal music Heathered Pearls has made yet. </p>
<p>Still, the atmospheres remain Heathered Pearls' selling point, with their tantalizing combination of magic-hour sunlight and gooey haze. ""Cast in Lemon &amp; Sand"" and ""Artificial Foliage"" both sound a lot like <i>Victorialand</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> with the attack softened and the reverb blown way out. Cocteau Twins are, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>, one of those acts that far too many artists try to emulate without really understanding what makes them tick, but Alexander gets it. Maybe that's not surprising, given that his alias sounds like a mockup for one of Vaughan Oliver's <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Cocteau-Twins-Head-Over-Heels/master/5508"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sleeves</a> for 4AD. Alexander, who A&amp;Rs for <a href=""http://www.ghostly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostly</a> and selects music for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28474-tycho/"">Tycho</a>'s design-centric <a href=""http://blog.iso50.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ISO50</a> blog, is nothing if not knowing when it comes to the combined power of word, music, and image, which makes his choice of song titles a little bit surprising. ""Perfume Catalogue"", ""Sunken Living Area"", ""Holographic Lodge""—they read almost as parodies, as ironic commentary on ambient music's frequent role as a kind of lifestyle accessory. Fortunately, <i>Body Complex</i> never gets bogged down by ambient music's wallpaper associations. This isn't music for living rooms; it's music for living <i>in</i>.</p></div>"|20895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20895-body-complex/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

But upon the celebration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8293-team-sleep/""><i>Team Sleep</i></a>'s 10th anniversary this past May, the band's only record, released in 2005 on a now-defunct major label, has taken on a <i>Wet Hot American Summer</i>-style, retroactive ""wow"" factor, both for its mere existence and the subsequent accomplishments of its already impressive cast. It now serves as the common link between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright"">Rufus Wainwright</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3316-pinback"">Pinback</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32045-ex-hex"">Ex Hex</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips"">Death Grips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole"">Hole</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1441-faith-no-more/"">Faith No More</a> (Melissa Auf der Maur and Mike Patton's contributions never made the final cut). That alone justifies revisiting <i>Team Sleep</i>, which is the ostensible purpose of <i>Woodstock Sessions, Vol. 4</i>. An intimate collection of album tracks and unreleased material recorded in front of a small live audience, the result is much more cohesive record than <i>Team Sleep</i>. It is also a less compelling one.</p>
<p>Mary Timony, Rob Crow, and producer Greg Wells (responsible for the Wainwright and, um, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5220-mika/"">Mika</a> connection) did not make it to upstate New York. It's just as well. <i>Team Sleep</i> was slapdash by default<span>—</span>it was nearly 10 years in the making and reconfigured after its planned 2003 release was scuttled by a leak. Downsizing the personnel rips out much of the inert stuffing that padded out <i>Team Sleep</i>'s nearly hourlong runtime<span>—</span>Timony's solo cut (""Tomb of Liegia"") was proof enough that any vocalist can sound fairly anonymous doing Sneaker Pimps-style deadpan trip-hop, while the explosive anti-chemistry on ""King Diamond"" showed how much Moreno can embarrass himself without <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThg2FgIKuI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">actually</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHLHF-nUEzQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rapping</a>. And while Zach Hill's participation technically qualifies Team Sleep as a retroactive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56831-death-gripsdeftones-supergroup-team-sleep-reunite-for-new-album"">Deftones/Death Grips supergroup</a>, his metallic, skittering breakbeats mostly worked against Moreno rather than with him<span>—</span>the Deftones songs after which Team Sleep was modeled (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgLt5u8Lzrk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Teenager""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0TUPD158ns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lucky You""</a>) tended to be muted, free of distorted guitars and all the better for it.</p>
<p>Hill has been replaced by Gil Sharone<span>—</span>a former member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"">the Dillinger Escape Plan</a> who already has experience replacing a percussive maniac in a high-profile, alt-rock side project due to his time in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nWv2Hz_GXs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">+44</a>. He ably recreates Hill's parts, but the wise selection of <i>Team Sleep</i> cuts ensure this is meant to be a more traditional rock record. Prior highlights ""(Ever) Foreign Flag"" and ""Princeton Review"" unlock themselves from a machinistic grid and take on an airy, major-key expansiveness that Moreno never quite achieved with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11889-palms/"">Palms</a>, even if they were focused on doing just that. Likewise, ""Blvd. Nights"" is angular, angry, and alive, while ""Live From the Stage"" stretches out to become the massive show closer it never had the chance to be.</p>
<p>While the Mo' Wax-worship on <i>Team Sleep</i> can be now seen as both its definitive feature and inherent flaw, the same could be said of Moreno's vocals on <i>Woodstock Session</i><i>s</i>. No matter the context, as long as Moreno is singing, you will be forced to compare it to Deftones. Dude can't help it<span>—</span>he's one of the most immediately identifiable stylists in mainstream rock from the past two decades, his vaporous, wavering melodies nearly impossible to trace and usually conveying a highly identifiable mix of sensuality and menace. This is even more true of Team Sleep than it was in <span>†††</span> and Palms, so even the best work here ends up sounding like a weakened version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrinSSJT97o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempest""</a> that wouldn't be capable of soundtracking <i>Furious 7</i>.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of Moreno's non-Deftones work: Moreno's outside projects do one thing, whereas Deftones are successful synthesists, playing up dynamic contrasts that come off as innovations. <i>Woodstock Sessions</i> is the third Moreno-fronted record to be released since <i>Koi No Yokan,</i> and it's the first where a new Deftones album is within view<span>—though </span>the <i>when</i> is unclear, they had promised a <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deftones-prep-heady-outside-the-box-new-album-20150310"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">September due date</a> back in March, and they officially finished recording <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/deftones/posts/10153494656322491"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about a month ago</a>. As such, it's hard to feel disappointed in <i>Woodstock Sessions</i> or view it as a distraction. It just confirms what we keep finding out about Moreno's music outside of his main gig<span>—i</span>t sounds either too much like Deftones or not enough <i>unlike</i> them.</p></div>"|20907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20907-woodstock-sessions-vol-4/|6.0|Ian Cohen

This sanguine, if-you-love-something-let-it-go philosophy is in line with her career. She's traded in leading the charge for garage-rock quintet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31036-feeding-people/"">Feeding People</a> to actualize her visions of radiant pop grandeur. It's a smooth transition for Jones, whose versatility as a vocalist alone is enough to warrant her place in the spotlight.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On her solo release, she comes across as the best advocate you could have for not taking shit from anyone. But she also spins intoxicating tales that reveal her spiritual perspective on life. Her hippie-influenced outlook is partially why her name has been mentioned in the same breath as Janis Joplin, but her syrupy mew is closer in sound to indie-pop peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29482-alex-winston/"">Alex Winston</a>. Opener ""Sugar-Coated"" recalls a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16354-alex-winston-king-con/""><i>King Con</i></a>-era Winston, as Jones builds the sprightly pop song with her deceivingly innocent voice before skyrocketing to carry the anthemic chorus. She plays with tension and release vocally on the rapturous ""Lady La De Da"".</p>
<p>Mottled with giddy tambourines and spattering drum fills, the album is a little bipolar in its approach to instrumentation, but it isn't messy. ""Quicksilver Screen"" is anchored by jangly riffs, letting a squealing synth lead drop into deeper, wonkier ones that bob up and down with resilience. Jones flirts with brassier proclivities on ""Twelve Hour Man"", as rollicking horns steal the show, racing jazzy percussion and fluttering piano chords to the finish line. Closer ""Mental Illness"" is the album's biggest outlier but also one of its biggest successes. Suddenly we're placed in Jones' bedroom, as she nearly whispers in your ear, ""My mental illness/ There's nothing wrong with it/ Sick of my feelings, tired of faking it/ Crying so hard, I can't explain it."" She repeats this over a few bare riffs until her singing smudges into echoes. It's a stark jump from the up-to-mid-tempo psych-pop that precedes it, but it's a self-titled record for a reason. Jones wants to give her all, even if her moment of vulnerability is only a brief glance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""La Loba"" is another anomaly, though a less severe one. It's a flamenco song that feels like an ancient fable put to music. Jones' voice snakes luxuriously around a few low, slick chords, a violin weeping. She grows increasingly desperate and unrelenting as the track builds, howling across zipping guitar lines, the pressure bubbling over like a pot of boiling water. It's a testament to the formidable range she never got a chance to fully realize during her time in Feeding People.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-94bc80a2-fbff-a3b7-019d-a50392b9bbb6""><i>Jessie Jones</i> is a well-rounded introduction, one that holds little back. When <a href=""http://flavorwire.com/526556/the-intake-form-jessie-jones-should-be-the-new-face-of-psych-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked </a>about her personal philosophy, Jones is frank. ""Love yourself and speak your truth. I believe in individualism, I'm not anything but who I am is only something I live with."" This album's inconsistencies are deliberate. Without them, she would be presenting a false identity, an incomplete version of herself. With them, we can more fully work toward understanding Jessie Jones, the individual.</span></p></div>"|20883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20883-jessie-jones/|6.9|Tess Duncan

That line, about sticking to your given path as a lifer, shows up on Wolfe's fifth full-length, <i>Abyss</i>, during the smeary, intense late-album standout ""Color of Blood"", and it's a fitting sentiment for her heaviest (and best) collection to date.</p>
<p>Wolfe has incorporated metallic elements into her music since the beginning—especially on 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18456-chelsea-wolfe-pain-is-beauty/""><i>Pain Is Beauty</i></a>—but she's never really gone full-on metal. And, honestly, she still hasn't, but on <i>Abyss</i> she comes closer than ever, externalizing those tendencies. She's thrown in moments of distortion, animal-like growling, or hiss on her other records, but it could come off like an affectation or add-on; here, it's built into, and integral to, the music, which frequently booms with distorted doom-metal guitar. </p>
<p>Recorded in Dallas by John Congleton, <i>Abyss</i> features Wolfe's longtime collaborator, multi-instrumentalist and co-writer Ben Chisholm, plus regular drummer Dylan Fujioka and viola player Ezra Buchla. The real difference is Mike Sullivan, guitarist for mostly instrumental Chicago post-rock band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4785-russian-circles/"">Russian Circles</a>. Wolfe sang on the sole vocal track on Russian Circles' excellent 2013 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18675-russian-circles-memorial/""><i>Memorial</i></a>; he returns the favor here, adding an anthemic dimension to a handful of the tracks that you won't find in her other work. <b> </b>Overall, this is the first time you feel like the music consistently lives up to the power of her voice.</p>
<p>The other big difference: She previously produced her albums with Chisholm, and they've done a fine job, but Congleton makes everything sound so much bigger. The production is ambitious—in the past, it could sometimes come off as a bit ill-fitting or unnatural. On <i>Abyss</i>, the sound is fully realized, her voice always at home. Congleton is a prolific producer, who's worked with the likes of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>. If you focus on that small sampling, you'll have an idea of what Wolfe sounds like on here: The songs don't wait around, or take time to build—they are immediately full on, and never stop raging. Wolfe's early work felt solitary, like it was made, and meant to be listened to, alone. The music here is expansive, and teeming, and you can easily imagine it on a large stage, with a crowd singing along.</p>
<p>The songs are long and dynamic, pushing their boundaries to the limit while maintaining spaciousness. ""Survive"", which opens with a bluesier feel, sprouts Swans-like tribal drums, ghostly and vicious feedback, a super-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"">Mudhoney</a> bass, and a forceful bit of noise that comes off like a football stadium full of cheering zombies. The gorgeous ""Iron Moon"" was inspired by a Chinese factory worker, and poet, who killed himself because of the monotony of his daily grind and a failed relationship: It explodes in a way that didn't seem possible for Wolfe previously. ""Dragged Out"", a proper doom track that comes off like a more interesting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31193-windhand/"">Windhand</a>, folds in noise, a tolling bell, haunted ghost howls and squeals.</p>
<p>She's said these songs were inspired by sleep paralysis, something she's dealt with her entire life. It's a condition where you want to wake up but can't, and when you finally do, you can't move, and there are a number of lyrics about the different sides of sleep (""In sleep there is no sorrow,"" ""When I dream it steals my wonder,"" ""I’ve been waiting/ In this silence/ While you’re sleeping"") and being unable to escape from it (""I’m screaming/ But I can’t wake up,"" ""Set me free from my slumber,"" ""Chasing the sun/ I can’t wake up""). <i>Abyss</i> is night music. As Wolfe put it, ""<i>Abyss</i> is meant to have the feeling of when you’re dreaming, and you briefly wake up, but then fall back asleep into the same dream, diving quickly into your own subconscious.""</p>
<p>The previously mentioned ""Color of Blood"" is not that far off from early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a>, and it's interesting to see that, where Nika Roza Danilova has downplayed her goth tendencies on her more recent, big-pop albums, Wolfe has found a way to remain backed by candelabra and decked in minimalist corpse paint and still locate pop melody alongside the bombast. The sultry ballad ""Simple Death"" is dark, but it's also gorgeous and catchy: Wolfe is not simply going heavier for heavier's sake, she's mastering her craft, writing songs that you remember immediately, and that you'll find yourself humming now and then. The bigger sound is what the source material, her sleep/dream issues, needed. Which brings to mind that line about letting your hair grow as you get old, of not changing your course. We're all frail and imperfect, and that's fine. But instead of inventing a persona or finding an easier way, Wolfe went deep into herself, doubled down on the horrors of life, and came back with a bleak, beautiful masterpiece—she kept going, especially when it started to hurt.</p></div>"|20866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20866-abyss/|8.1|Brandon Stosuy

The answer is complicated. Reissue culture in general has kicked into overdrive, as music across the spectrum gets rediscovered and re-packaged at a pace we've never seen before. The line between ambient music with cultural cache (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>, spacey krautrock) and relaxation tapes for the bourgeoisie has grown blurrier, not to mention the mainstreaming of yoga, locavore eating, and sustainable culture, all of which focus on the body and the senses as a ballast for data-driven digital reality. And there's also the fact that the idea of ""functional music"" in the playlist era has become so widely accepted. In this climate, it makes sense that mellow music designed for meditation and relaxation would wind its way back around.</p>
<p>Into this context, enter Laraaji. Born Edward Larry Gordon, he knocked around several creative spheres in New York in the 1960s and '70s, working as an actor, comedian, and musician. Always a spiritual seeker, he had an epiphany in the '70s that caused him to trade in his acoustic guitar for a zither, and in the latter part of the decade he began busking in Brooklyn and Manhattan and releasing some of his home-recorded improvisations on small-run tapes. Laraaji's first wider notice came when Brian Eno heard him playing in Washington Square Park and asked if he wanted to record an album as part of Eno's <i>Ambient</i> series. <i>Ambient 3: Day of Radiance</i>, released in 1980, has always been a bit of an outlier in terms of Eno's ambient discography, because it sounds like no other music he was ever involved with (Eno produced, but it's a Laraaji album all the way). The intense energy of the hammered dulcimer on the record's first side could be trance-inducing, but it in no sense slips into the background.</p>
<p>For many observers, <i>Ambient 3</i> was Laraaji's big moment, but he has released many dozens of albums since, most of which were not marketed to the broader music-buying public. For many years, if you walked into a new age shop anywhere in the United States, from Santa Cruz to Burlington, Vt., you'd find a rack of tapes for meditation and relaxation that you'd never find in a regular record shop. And among these you might find a release from Laraaji. Only recently, with several reissues and the release of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16056-frkwys-vol-8/"">excellent collaboration with Blues Control</a>, has Laraaji's work started to reach beyond those origins. This history is part of what makes this particular set interesting: three early Laraaji releases are being put out, on tape, by <a href=""http://leavingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving Records</a>, a <a href=""https://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> subsidiary co-run by L.A. beatmaker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28977-matthewdavid/"">Matthewdavid</a>. Where they were once presented as music for a specific purpose and offered for sale to those heavily invested in new age culture, they are now re-presented to an audience who hears them mostly as strange and obscure music to be collected.</p>
<p>The earliest tape in the set, <i>Lotus Collage</i>, which Laraaji issued himself in 1978, situates his music at an intersection of drone and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>-style minimalism, with a bent-note attack that draws in the music of India. Laraaji described his musical epiphany in terms of a universal vibration, and his music seems especially attuned to the feeling of matter moving rapidly in space. It has an elemental quality and the textures are metallic (his zither is outfitted with a pickup, and tuned to favor open strums and drone), bringing to mind oud, harp, guitar, dulcimer, bells, mbira, chimes, and singing bowls. At points on <i>Lotus Collage</i> he'll break into a strummed rhythm with damping that almost sounds funky, but these more propulsive moments are gradually subsumed into the drift. The overall feeling is one of relaxed contemplation, but <i>Lotus Collage</i> is ultimately a dynamic set, with intense peaks and lulling valleys. Like the other pieces here, it was clearly designed with tape in mind—two pieces, each just under 30 minutes, perfect for a C–60.</p>
<p><i>Unicorns in Paradise</i>, from 1981, was presumably issued on a C–90. Over two 40-plus minute tracks, Laraaji makes use of a Casio keyboard to flesh out the buzzing zither with softer, rounder tones. The sharp attacks of <i>Lotus Collage</i> are nowhere to be found, and instead, aside from some repetitive keyboard parts deep into the second side, the record as a whole is very open-ended and free, as if it's a seed being blown along by a gentle breeze. It's a less cosmic sound than the earlier release, more atmospheric and diffuse, and it seems designed to give a room a certain tint rather than being a vehicle for close listening. You could isolate any two-minute section of the whole and have no idea whether it comes early or late on the album, but in this case that doesn't seem like a negative.</p>
<p><i>Connecting With the Inner Healer Through Music</i> gathers two very different pieces that have never appeared on the same tape. The first side, a multi-part piece called ""Trance Celestial"", is a gorgeous collection of drones that <span>feel richer and more fully formed than his earlier work</span>. Here the divisions between individual instruments all but disappear, and everything feels integrated and focused. At times, the effect is close to the blissed-out post-shoegaze of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4605-windy-carl/"">Windy &amp; Carl</a>. The second side is a 35-minute piece with Laraaji on vocals offering a kind of guided meditation over plings and trails of synth.</p>
<p>The sound of Laraaji's voice, intoning over wisps, underlines just how differently we listen to this music today, in contrast to the the spiritual seekers who presumably bought it in 1983. Bad-vibes films and television shows from ""True Detective"" to <i>Inherent Vice</i> have cast this kind of calm, echo-laden speech in a very different light, highlighting the creepiness and cultish aspects over the presumed search for spiritual enlightenment. It's also a reminder of how new age spirituality is so easily twisted into something dark, since it does, after all, involve people at their most open and vulnerable. But none of this speaks to Laraaji's intentions; 30 years later, he is still making the rounds of yoga and meditation centers, putting on workshops that emphasize the healing power of laughter. This is not an artist who takes himself too seriously. And the fact that his music is returning 30 years later into a new world to reach people in a new way is an inspiring tribute to our highly cyclical world.</p></div>"|20839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20839-all-in-one-peace/|8.0|Mark Richardson

They had the songs, they had the chops, but they just never quite got the timing right. Their brief dalliance with the majors was, by most accounts, an unmitigated disaster; Atlantic so badly botched—and then quickly abandoned—1993's would-be breakthrough <i>El Moodio</i> that the band issued a director's cut of sorts, <i>New Moodio</i>, in 2013. They may not've found the fame they deserved in the post-<i>Nevermind</i> land grab, but the years that followed have been awfully kind; widely beloved among indie rock's older guard, with 12 good-to-great records to their name, they've found the freedom to follow their own serpentine path wherever it leads. In the wake of <i>New Moodio</i>—a record that may've just put all that ""what if?"" talk to bed—EDD seem revitalized<i>: Works for Tomorrow</i>, their latest, is their fieriest record in years, and among their finest ever.<br/><br/>Produced by keyboardist Mark Greenberg, <i>Works</i> is a crisp, punchy-sounding record, not far from the unfussy, live-in-a-room feel of early triumphs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2742-prairie-school-freakout/""><i>Prairie School Freakout</i></a>.<i> Works</i> came together quickly; on their first day alone, they'd tracked 13 songs, 10 of which show up here. <i>Works</i> is also the first Eleventh Dream Day record in two decades to feature a second guitarist with Jim Elkington of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32512-tweedy/"">Tweedy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27789-the-horses-ha/"">the Horse's Ha</a>. Elkington and singer/guitarist Rick Rizzo have an immediate on-record chemistry. Rizzo's gloriously ragged, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>-jocking leads have long been EDD's signature, and with Elkington at his side, they can kick up twice the dust.<br/><br/>Works charges out of the gate with ""Vanishing Point"", in which Janet Beveridge Bean does her damnedest to earn whoever's listening a speeding ticket. Every time she wails ""I'm gonna take it from the inside, I'm gonna take it slow,"" the song's taut, krautrock-indebted pulse seems to quicken. Bean's never held back, exactly, but the way she tears into ""Vanishing""—and her searing mid-LP cover of Judy Henske and Jerry Yester's psych-blues stomper <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vpWds0u-nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Snowblind""</a>—is something else entirely. Rizzo, as ever, is a quizzical, around-the-beat singer. The pair's frequent harmonizing has only deepened with time, so that the slightest shift in affect from either one changes the entire feel of the line. The raucous, gospel-tinged ""Go Tell It"" finds Rizzo doing his best Lou Reed, with Bean answering with an even-better Merry Clayton, while plainly gorgeous late-LP highlight ""Deep Lakes"" finds the pair sighing their way through a perserverer's anthem: ""I'm alive, we survived,"" they sing, with striking calm.<br/><br/><i>Works</i>, Rizzo's said in interviews, is his attempt to locate the source of some recent emotional turmoil. ""My mom's side is northern Europe Swedish and my dad is Italian,"" <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/kot/ct-eleventh-dream-day-janet-bean-rick-rizzo-20150723-column.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the <i>Chicago Tribune</i></a>, ""so you've got the Italian emotional half, and on the Swedish side, there's this attitude that you don't talk about the past. That warm front, cold front collision ends up causing a storm."" Never is this clearer than on closer ""End With Me"", which finds Rizzo out east, visiting relatives' graves, trying to figure out why everything behind him seems to be getting in his way. By digging into—and then letting go of—that past, Rizzo can finally reckon with the present. Even if he hadn't spelled it out, that feeling's all over <i>Works for Tomorrow</i>: what's done is done, but right now, things are looking up.</p></div>"|20906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20906-works-for-tomorrow/|7.4|Paul Thompson

<p>Originally released by <a href=""http://www.lorecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lo Recordings</a> and <a href=""http://www.k7.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">!K7</a>, Sam Grawe's debut <i>Colors of the Sun</i> has since been resuscitated by upstart UK reissue imprint, <a href=""http://bewithrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Be With Records</a>, whose catalog ranges from yacht rock demiurge <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32317-ned-doheny/"">Ned Doheny</a> to South African singer Letta Mbulu. But most fascinating are the albums that Be With zero in on from the '00s, when compact discs remained the medium of conveyance and pressing up vinyl was cost-prohibitive. So far, Be With has done vinyl reissues of everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3959-the-streets/"">the Streets</a>' <i>A Grand Don't Come for Free</i> to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> <a href=""http://bewithrecords.com/product/the-autumn-defense-the-autumn-defense-2lp/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">side project</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10905-cassie/"">Cassie</a>'s prophetic minimalist nu-R&amp;B classic.</p>
<p>Where Hatchback's debut fits in amid this eclectic, baffling roster is hard to gauge. Even as a fan of everything nu-disco/Balearic of that era, I'm only familiar with Hatchback's music via a 17-minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZcN3aFwQq0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas</a> (these remixes were almost de rigueur circa 2007). His music occasionally recalls the vintage keyboard squiggles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27705-lindstrom-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas &amp; Lindstrøm</a> or else that of Klaus Schulze. </p>
<p>Perhaps Grawe's perspective from Northern California gives such German and European electronic influences a touch of sunshine and open air here, a surfer's mentality informing both his Hatchback persona as well as duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26440-windsurf/"">Windsurf</a>. ""Everything Is Neu"" might wear its krautrock heritage on its sleeve, but rather than the Autobahn, it suggests a leisurely drive down the PCH, detouring from that motorik beat with piano-laced breakdowns suggestive of Michael Rother's post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> albums. ""Comets"" and ""White Diamond"" both begin as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> homages, before Grawe astutely adds other layers—a laidback guitar figure, a contemplative synth melody—that take the tracks into more rarefied air. And had <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> decamped for the West Coast from Scotland, they might have made something like ""Closer to Forever"".</p>
<p>In hindsight, it's easy to see how the album might have not gotten a fair shake, favoring low-key melodic turns and gentle movements rather than the grander moves of his contemporaries. Outside of a 2013 single, there hasn't been much heard from Hatchback since 2011's follow-up, <i>Zeus &amp; Apollo</i>. A quick search turned up the fact that Grawe worked first at Dwell and now serves as editorial director for furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, whose ergonomic <a href=""http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/performance-work-chairs/aeron-chairs.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aeron chair</a> I'm currently sitting in as I type this. It makes a certain kind of sense that Grawe gravitated toward modern architecture and design, in that <i>Colors of the Sun</i> suggests an astute sense of craft, even if its expert design becomes almost imperceptible due to its functionality.</p></div>"|20852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20852-colors-of-the-sun/|7.3|Andy Beta

Crack built his reputation as a solo artist off of a couple of infectious and irreverent mixtapes—2013's<i> Kitchen in the Bassment</i>, last year's <i>Kickin' It Wit TW</i>, and a couple of collaborative projects with noted ""soultrap"" architect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"">Tree</a>—which set up the basic parameters of his style: wall-to-wall soul samples (and maybe not much else), a cutting, nasal delivery, and bars that sound as spontaneous as they are aggressive. Like like-minded fellow Chicago MC and frequent collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32727-vic-spencer/"">Vic Spencer</a>, Crack pumps out constant musical product—an overwhelming amount of loose, often-hookless rap songs. It's hard to keep up with and organize; songs are tweeted only once, and downloads come with no artist tags and different titles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>From his freestyling strings of verse, to the unimpeded, personable directness of his delivery, to the </span><i>au naturale</i><span> quality of his production, Crack's music is intended as comfort food. He's not aiming for perfection from song to song, but to access and inhabit a specific atmosphere and posture consistently: His own. On every level, this is music that is about just living, moving forward and getting by, told from the perspective of a proverbial Lothario and party-hunting nomad, loose in the city at night.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Public Domain 4</i>—which is, despite his constant <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/newdealcrew"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SoundCloud one-offs</a>, Crack's first full-length project of this year—feels like an apt and well-rounded representation of his personality. The title is a tribute to the legendary series of mixtapes by Harlem icon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29628-max-b/"">Max B</a> (Crack even channels Bigavell directly in his detuned hook for the Tree and Spencer-featuring ""Again""). The tape is a strikingly smooth listen—an extended, lightly psychedelic tour through backseat smoke sessions, liquor store lines, and other peoples' girlfriends' bedrooms. Crack juggles snaking, off-the-dome flows with more regulated, motormouth patterns: Southern-styled flows you can set your watch to. The vinyl-treated backdrop (coming mostly courtesy of Crack's extra-talented affiliate and soul buff Tmthy Trtl) either lies back to give the rapper space, or feeds his fire.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the most part, Crack manages to be engaging without locking into clear narratives or hitting on much in the way of revelatory wisdom. The best moments come when he edits his goofiness a bit to arrive at sharper, more quotable lines: ""I kick it colder than a snowblower/ Chi-town, mid-December with my Colt open/ With no shoes, Devin the Dude on Pandora/ Rays feeling my aura, I be worse than a Taurus."" (Indeed, Crack himself could reasonably turn up on that station, as a modern-day RIYL.)</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-470a19e1-02ee-5048-5003-3ec82dbff37a""><span>Crack's music works best if you kick back with it, tune in and out, <span>half-following trains of thought and embracing the diversions</span>. He appreciates fine liquor, Willie Hutch, and good conversation, and he's not too big to rhyme ""Jacuzzi"" with ""booty."" Imagine you're shooting the shit with an old friend—your most low-maintenance one. These raps have nothing profound or ""new"" to offer in their particulars, but the music in sum seems to embody how one might always prefer life to always be. In actuality, unfortunately (to paraphrase a noted </span><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=w1KP1fpepAcC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=1SFeHevY1L&amp;dq=harriet%20schechter%2090%20maintenance&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>self-help writer</span></a><span>), it's 90% maintenance, 5% grief, and only 5% that Chris Crack sort of vibe. So ride the wave while you can.</span></span></p></div>"|20919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20919-public-domain-4/|7.2|Winston Cook-Wilson

It's exactly this bruised-but-headstrong expertise, built up over two decades as a writer and performer, that imbues Robyn's music with a sort of welcoming trust. So, when she takes a step back in the thumping opening track of <i>Love Is Free</i>, ""Lose Control"", to say, ""Hey, tell me all about your mistakes/ Tell me 'bout the love and the pain/ I know somebody hurt you some way,"" you might believe her and give it all up.</p>
<p>On this debut EP with new music group La Bagatelle Magique, formed with her keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt and the late producer and Swedish club music veteran Christian Falk, Robyn cuts to the chase with what she wants from you (and herself). La Bagatelle Magique aren't trying to reinvent the wheel here. The group is meddling in music history, cranking out five familiar tracks that are too hard<i> not</i> to dance to.</p>
<p>""Got to Work It Out"" plays like an amped up, big beat version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUQEmXcu6q8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debbie Deb's 1983 single ""When I Hear Music""</a>, with a twinkling, childlike xylophone melody buried under the track's trance-y basslines and Vocodered, aggressive vocals. And the standout single featuring rising singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28165-maluca/"">Maluca</a>, ""Love Is Free"", is ballroom-ready, steeped in a yippy, acid house groove that finds Robyn asserting physical boundaries while preaching free love. ""Imma give it to you baby/ Imma give it when I'm ready,"" she raps over the beat.</p>
<p>A charming, un-slick outlier here is ""Tell You (Today)"", an eccentric, sample-heavy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-OZokZbaUs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Loose Joints cover</span></a> that mashes together instrumentals of the genre (horns, Heatwave-approved harp, disco lasers, etc.) to dizzying effect. The song sounds like someone was smashing their hands against a well-stocked sampler, even when it comes to Robyn's vocals. They're a little stilted in their delivery, as if every word was programmed on its own and played back to form sentences, but the lyrics still reel with the excitement of finally telling someone how much you love them.</p>
<p>What <i>Love Is Free</i> does so well, and so simply, is hone in on just the beauty of finally letting <i>go</i>, physically and mentally. On ""Set Me Free"", there's a moment when the lyric ""Free your body"" repeats, getting clearer and clearer until it just hangs there in the middle of the track while the kick-drum pounds after it, punctuating it like a stream of trailing periods. For Robyn and La Bagatelle Magique<i>,</i> the simple request might not be the answer to all your problems, but it's sure as hell the start.</p></div>"|20902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20902-love-is-free/|7.2|Hazel Cills

They both arrived at around the same time with provocative, fresh-faced takes on the sometimes-stiff sound. The specifics of exactly what they did were, of course, very different. Where Krallice favored long-form dioramas built from two tessellated guitars and a bedrock rhythm section, Liturgy favored shorter, screeching numbers that hinged around the band's ability to make time seem flexible, as though it might be expanded and contracted at will. Still, they were members of the same promising freshman class.</p>
<p>In the seven years since Krallice and Liturgy issued their debut recordings, though, the distinctions between the two have only grown. Liturgy have, as if by design, emerged as the flashpoint, pairing their radical ambitions with a soap-opera-like tendency for drama. Krallice, meanwhile, have become a workmanlike squad, steadily releasing albums that have increased the complexity and scale of their sound without ever recasting it completely. There have been no breakups, no public feuds, no manifestos and no grand announcements. But when Krallice delivered their first album in three years late last month, the riveting and delirious <i>Ygg Huur</i>, the six songs arrived <a href=""https://krallice.bandcamp.com/album/ygg-huur"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as a simple Bandcamp download, sans all advanced notice</a>. <i>Ygg Huur</i> is by far more nuanced and developed than Liturgy's unsteady <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20313-the-ark-work/""><i>The Ark Work</i></a>—a byproduct, it would seem, of Krallice's steadfast, head-down evolution.</p>
<p>By Krallice standards, <i>Ygg Huur</i> is a tiny album. It's about half the length of each of Krallice's four previous records and short enough to fit on a single LP when it gets a physical release from <a href=""http://www.gileadmedia.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gilead Media</a> later this year. <i>Ygg Huur</i> isn't as punishingly loud as 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17100-years-past-matter/""><i>Years Past Matter</i></a>, either, an album on which all of the instruments seemed pushed firmly against some invisible volume ceiling. Those changes only make it easier to notice that this is the densest Krallice material ever, with all those hyperactive and coordinated guitars tucked inside sub-seven-minute windows and accompanied by a rhythm section more audacious and commanding than ever.</p>
<p>Despite including the dazzling technicians Colin Marston and Mick Barr, Krallice's past releases could seem, if not simple, easy enough to follow, even during 16-minute marathons. But most everything on <i>Ygg Huur </i>works as a wondrous, complicated blur. Lev Weinstein's drums sometimes switch tempos so that you barely notice at all and sometimes redirect the momentum to the point of whiplash. The guitars and Nicholas McMaster's bass spiderweb around his beats, moving up, down and around central riffs so quickly that they appear forever suspended in motion. The switchbacks toward the end of ""Tyranny of Thought"", for instance, are impossibly precise and precarious. During ""Idols"", the four pieces slide in and out of sync with one another, gliding past each other only to reconnect like the separate strands of an automated cat's cradle.   </p>
<p>Krallice named <i>Ygg Huur</i> for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoLeHHDxPOI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a three-piece suite</a> by late Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi, remembered <a href=""http://www.hydramag.com/2010/04/05/giacinto-scelsi-massive-interiors-and-microtones/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most for his creeping, miniscule movements around a single pitch. </a>His original <i>Ygghur </i>suggests the slow, barely wavering drones of <a href=""http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4639"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yoshi Wada's earth horns</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6vYzrD9eBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glenn Branca's guitar symphonies</a>, except limited to a single cello. It is a fitting reference point for what Krallice has become. On these six songs, they de-emphasize the rock'n'roll role of riffs to the point that this music works as sets of ever-shifting rhythms, gilded by slight fluctuations in pitch. ""Wastes of Ocean"" scans like a competition to see who can navigate constant changes of pace the best; even the vocals are forced to slip between the stop-and start volleys. During ""Over Spirit"", Barr, Marston, and McMaster move so rapidly and exactly between each note that the guitars and drums trade places; the drums provide the movement as the amplified strings provide the more stable framework. A colossus, <i>Ygg Huur</i> reflects the accretion of a thousand minute decisions, not unlike the microtonal work from which it takes its name.</p>
<p>Liturgy's <i>The Ark Work </i>and Krallice's <i>Ygg Huur </i>do reveal one new connection between the fellow former upstarts, however unintentional. In their return to the studio and stage, Liturgy have insisted they are not playing black metal, a point reinforced by Hunter Hunt-Hendrix's strained rapping. And though Krallice have made no special effort to say as much (in fact, their <a href=""https://krallice.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp page</a> still describes this and every previous album as black metal), Krallice don't, either. Sure, these six songs examine oblivion and apocalypse, arriving at McMaster's closing proclamation that ""No matter what, it ends this way/ With me taking your body to the fire."" But there is little atavistic rage here, and there are no grand, horn-lifting moments. Instead, these six songs have as much to do with modern composition and prog rock as they do with the black metal mold from which they came. It's been three years since the release of Krallice's very good last album, the longest gap ever in their otherwise clockwork catalogue. It was time well spent, at least: <i>Ygg Huur </i>is more vivid, vexing, and meticulous than most of what the band's old peers still call black metal—a sentence Krallice no longer need to share.</p></div>"|20904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20904-ygg-huur/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Really, when was the last time you encountered a record that took <i>legitimate, </i>potentially career-altering risks? Most of the time, an artist's ""bold new direction"" manifests in well-placed interview quotes and imperceptible effects on their actual music. Or, ""challenging art"" will come from outsiders of whom such abrasiveness is expected. Or, it'll be a hard left from a pop star or critical darling who gets the benefit of the doubt and is assumed to be one step ahead of the game.</p>
<p>Winston Yellen is none of those things: his Night Beds debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17656-country-sleep/""><i>Country Sleep</i></a> was a modestly successful and kindly received batch of folk-friendly indie rock that figured to set him on the path of quietly successful, critically acclaimed labelmates such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent </a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5319-bowerbirds"">Bowerbirds</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5715-the-tallest-man-on-earth/"">the Tallest Man on Earth</a>. He's followed it with a 65-minute opus where he sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">Weeknd</a> in Dixie approximately 85% of the time and becomes the first guy to actually <i>earn</i> the distinction of ""PBR&amp;B."" We often talk of artists switching lanes or taking a leap of faith<span>—</span><i>Ivywild</i> is a guy skydiving without a parachute, firmly believing he can stick the landing if he just times it right.</p>
<p>It's a free-fall captured in painful slow-mo, perversely gripping in the way it allows you to share Yellen's tunnel vision; there are many times where you might also think, ""yeah, I <i>can</i> totally see how he might've pulled this off."" He flexed raw skill and potential on <i>Country Sleep</i>, particularly a rangy, chameleonic voice<span>—</span>in a dusky lower register, he sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams"">Ryan Adams</a>, he could also channel makeout music mystics like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley"">Jeff Buckley</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a> and when it went straight up alt-country, well, he also sounded like Ryan Adams. But he nonetheless possessed a rare assertiveness that puts him in a position to succeed when taking on pop and R&amp;B.</p>
<p>He's also been blessed with legitimate inspiration. Yellen endured a hard breakup, the subsequent, requisite heat-seeking tailspin, and an artistic course correction that found him being more honest about his tastes. In addition to the Weeknd, he's gone heavy on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo"">D'Angelo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west"">Kanye West</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus"">Flying Lotus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla"">Dilla</a><span>—</span>no one should act surprised, let alone <i>outraged</i> that any 26-year old is seeking inspiration from these acts.</p>
<p>Whatever the temptation may be to question an alt-country dude from Nashville about appropriation, put it aside because the major flaw of Yellen's planning stage is more simple. Pop, hip-hop, R&amp;B, and electronic music have an expectation of being contemporary and even futuristic forms, whereas Night Beds works on a two-year album cycle. Notice that his frame of reference more or less cuts off at 2013<span>—e</span>ven if <i>Ivywild</i> were a flawless integration of his influences, it likely would have sounded dated mere months after <i>Country Sleep</i>. Moreover, all of the aforementioned have styles that are so distinct and proprietary, any slight deviation could be taken as parody.</p>
<p>And Yellen emerges from his immersive listening having integrated the most easily parodied aspects, mostly those of Abel Tesfaye<span>—</span>toggling between a wounded moan and a needy yelp at tempos which progress with the excruciating stubbornness of a hangover, utilizing drug metaphors which would've been better off as similes or just direct references. And, of course, any trace of levity can only be provided by the listener, a humor derived from <i>Ivywild</i>'s utter lack of humor. More deadening than the suffocating arrangements and production or the nonexistent hooks is a tiresome perspective that goes beyond the Weeknd and connects to a celebrated lineage of male authors who assume an inherent profundity in treating a psychosexual crisis of mid-twenties masculinity as miserably as possible. Maybe it's meant to accurately mirror Yellen's state of mind during its creation, maybe the utter lack of catharsis or even sensuality is meant to drive home the destitution of it all.</p>
<p>Either way, Yellen still takes it upon himself to express <i>Ivywild</i>'s conquests as burdens; drink and drugs must take on overwrought, sacramental connotation (""Five quarts won't harm us/ But these lines always cross us""). Elsewhere, the pillow talk fails on a fundamental level. For example, delivering ""If I give all my time/ Can I live in your thighs?"" in a Thom Yorke-ian whimper should make everyone who criticized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead"">Radiohead</a>'s lack of carnality apologize for their position. Or, Yellen emphasizing his isolation on ""Sway(ve)"", which slow-grinds with two left feet; there was no one who either could or would talk him out of not only making a song called ""Sway(ve)"", or using that incompatible portmanteau as a hook. That's also the only way to explain the chorus of ""Eve A"", which either scans as ""E A I O U"" or ""Eve A, I fuck you"" and it's actually <i>both</i>. There's nearly a half hour left after that. What more do you need to know really?</p>
<p><i>Ivywild</i> wasn't created in seclusion<span>—</span>more than 25 people contributed, including Yellen's brother Abe, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6HwQuLwoDw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a YouTube find</a>, and whoever's responsible for the strings, horns, samples, and harmonies that clutter the admirably confrontational, six-minute opening gauntlet of ""Finished"". Regardless of the help, Yellen has been granted the leeway of not just an auteur, but a genius.

For the last decade, drummer Joe Plummer has been one of those guys, splitting his time between bands around the West Coast. Among his more notable gigs: He manned the kit for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/374-the-black-heart-procession/"">Black Heart Procession</a>, traveled with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> during their boom years, replaced Jesse Sandoval after James Mercer rebooted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">the Shins</a>, backed Michael Cera in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"">Mister Heavenly</a>, and, most recently, became the latest addition to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4974-cold-war-kids/"">Cold War Kids</a>. He may not be a big name, but he could probably write a pretty decent memoir one day.<br/><br/> Plummer carries over some lessons from all of those bands on his debut solo album <i>Built In Sun</i>, which delivers exactly the kind of open, upfront Pacific Northwest indie rock you'd expect from a guy who's long made a living playing it. The album wasn't originally intended to be such a direct reflection of his resume. Plummer had conceived it as a cinematic instrumental work, but began fishing the songs out to some of his singer pals once his focus shifted to more familiar territory. One of them responded so enthusiastically he became the project's designated voice: Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins, whose band had quietly gone on hiatus in 2013. <br/> <br/> Compared to some of the singers in Plummer's circle, Jenkins isn't an especially glamorous recruit. He lacks the star power and dynamism of James Mercer or Isaac Brock, and <i>Built In Sun</i> probably would've been a more interesting album if Plummer had gone the rotating-vocalist route instead. But he and Jenkins have an easy chemistry that flatters his casual tunes, and Jenkins is a more versatile singer than Black Heart Procession's albums let on. That band usually confined Jenkins to the role of a sullen doomsayer, a part he played so convincingly it became difficult to imagine him as anything other than a buzzkill. Here Jenkins goes wherever the songs let him, relishing the chance to stretch out a bit.<br/> <br/> Jenkins announces his gameness on opener ""Honeybear"", a hurried garage-rocker, crooning over Plummer's piping organ with gregarious abandon. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4833-david-bazan/"">David Bazan</a> and Cody Votolato sit in on the woozy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a>-ish ""Winters Fall"" and he leads them through a merry sing-along chorus. And though Jenkins smuggles his share of macabre images into the album, with lyrics about arrow-pierced skin, broken bones, and abandoned dreams, he sings even the bleakest of them as if swinging a raised pint. Even ""13 Souls"", the closest <i>Built In Sun</i> comes to Black Heart territory (just look at that title), is bright and cheery, a lament that's played for a laugh. Only ""Due to Rain"", a detour into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd"">Public Image Ltd.</a>'s claustrophobic dub-rock, teases the darker, more experimental turn these sessions could have taken.<br/> <br/> Plummer has made an album like this before. His 2003 self-titled release with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2642-magic-magicians/"">the Magic Magicians</a> had a similar setup, pairing the drummer with another regional indie vet, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=764-hero"">764-Hero</a>'s John Atkins, for some very low-stakes rock'n'roll. That album didn't make much of a splash at the time and it's barely remembered today, but it's still a pleasure to revisit, precisely because of the same casual attitude that made it so easy to overlook. <i>Built In Sun</i> will probably sound good a few years from now for the same reason. It's a likably modest work from a musician who has spent the bulk of his career backing distinctive songwriters with complicated visions, without forgetting the rewards of making carefree music just for the sake of it, too.</p></div>"|20886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20886-built-in-sun/|6.0|Evan Rytlewski

True, the Irish producer's debut album, 2000's <i>Growing Up in Public</i>, was an exquisitely restrained array of blips and digital crackle, but that turned out to be a red herring once you looked past the clicks. His 2001 album <i>Together Is the New Alone</i> was an example of ambient music at its most emotionally resonant, and from there he really broadened his horizons. <i>Colorseries</i>, his crowning achievement to date, sprawled across 10 different 12""'s that wrung every last drop of incandescence from a lean machine setup.</p>
<p><i>Love From Dust </i>is Costello's first album in five years. It marks his return to making music after unspecified circumstances in 2010 led him to sell off his studio and abandon music entirely. A more fortuitous set of circumstances brought him back: a custom-built EMS Synthi A, a rare analog synthesizer, finally became available to him after 13 years with his name on the waiting list. Costello's attempt to <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/donnacha-costello-love-from-dust-album-project#/story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowdfund</a> the costs of recording a new album didn't meet his goal, so, alas, no Synthi. But he did raise enough to buy his backup choice, a Buchla Music Easel, which constitutes the album's entire instrumentation, save a pair of effects pedals.</p>
<p>While it's not a concept album, it's very much an album determined by a specific set of constraints. The Music Easel is designed to be played in real time—the Philadelphia musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32909-charles-cohen/"">Charles Cohen</a>, who also recorded his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20546-brother-i-prove-you-wrong/"">most recent album</a> on the device, has described the instrument's benefits as ""complicated control over simple sounds, as opposed to many other instruments, where you have very, very complex sounds but only simple control""—and to that end, Costello recorded his album live in single takes with no overdubs. It's striking that a synthesizer this obscure should turn up as the sole instrument on two albums in the same year, but the two records couldn't be more different. Where Cohen's music is wiry and alien, evoking transistors with indigestion, Costello's is gentle, elegiac, soft as a well-watered lawn in the shade.</p>
<p>He favors slow-moving chord progressions and consonant tones and extreme repetition, and each of the album's seven tracks is built around a single repeating figure. (The bookending songs ""Niigata Moment"" and ""Unconditional"" are variations upon the same theme, which lends to the sense that the album is best absorbed in a single sitting—or, better yet, while dropping off to sleep.) The wistful ""Ten Ton"" patiently follows organ-like tones through a softly cycling chord progression; ""Farewell"" evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> at their dreamiest, with silvery filaments that seem to dissolve in thin air. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i> is another obvious antecedent, both for its warm analog tones and its naïve melodies.</p>
<p>Structurally, each track is a one-way street, repeating the same figure for so long that it's easy to forget that it's even playing. But then a note jumps up or down an octave, snapping you out of your reverie. And if you skip from the end of a track back to the beginning, you may be surprised to find how much has changed without you noticing, as the waveforms have grown teeth and toughened up, going from a lowing drone to a ragged growl. It all builds to a head with ""Everything Is Going to Be"", the album's penultimate track, and its longest. There's something about the distortion that makes its resolving chord progression feel even more satisfying; the tension registers as a physical vibration, and the release is just as visceral. At the music's peak, the tone is almost obscured by the buzz; it's like trying to catch a glimpse of a gorgeous landscape through narrowing blinds. It's a small moment that feels huge, a mark of Costello's talent not so much as a minimalist as an illusionist.</p></div>"|20868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20868-love-from-dust/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Even after he helped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>, his stepbrother, carve out a career-long groove with his sample selections for <i>The Chronic</i>, Death Row wanted nothing to do with him until he churned out his own Def Jam single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plPyJdXKIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Regulate""</a>, which they happily slapped their logo on after the fact. The song was his first major hit—his production and collaboration with Nate Dogg on Mista Grimm's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXrz6rJdMtE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Indo Smoke""</a> notwithstanding—and it has rightfully endured as his biggest.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But ""Regulate"" also overshadowed the rest of Warren G's output, so cleanly encapsulating G-funk that the song has become a deceptive stand-in for a frequently nuanced career. The album,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rolling-on-dubs/9413-warren-gs-regulate-g-funk-era/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Regulate… G Funk Era</i></a>, was also released two years after Dre's solo debut, a post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"">N.W.A.</a> team effort that pioneered a similar sound and is more frequently celebrated as a benchmark. But <i>Regulate… </i>was still momentous, hyper-local and ripe for national appetite at once, a sudden beam of light pointed directly on Long Beach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Making a sequel to such a career- and genre-defining record might smack of desperation elsewhere, but Warren G is sincere with <i>G Funk Era Part II</i>. A year past the original album's 20th anniversary, this record may have missed its most marketable moment; in another way it's also perfectly on time. In a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6620370/warren-g-regulate-g-funk-era-part-ii-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Billboard</i></a>, Warren G made a familiar veteran-rapper promise about bringing back a ""sound that has been missing [in] hip-hop,"" but if anything, his return comes in the midst of a minor G-funk renaissance. Kendrick Lamar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17380-kendrick-lamar-king-kunta/"">dabbled with and dissected the genre on <i>To Pimp a Butterfly,</i> </a>and YG hit an unexpected stride over a Terrence Martin G-funk beat for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17589-yg-twist-my-fingaz/"">his first post-shooting single last month</a>. Meanwhile,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19930-dj-quik-the-midnight-life/""> DJ Quik is still tweaking</a> and Snoop Dogg dropped the raps (again) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20435-bush/"">on his last album</a> for a smoother, adult-contemporary revision of the sound. The resurgence is part of a larger refocusing on California hip-hop, but G-funk has been brought along for the ride.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As advertised, <i>Regulate... G Funk Era Part II</i> sticks squarely to Warren G's roots. The production is clean, lush, and familiar, and with four tracks running just under 15 minutes long, it is pleasantly unambitious. There's no misguided attempts at recreating the original, and there also isn't a dud in sight. ""My House"", the first single, flips Madness' '80s hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXA6CLTDekw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Our House""</a> into a bouncing stomper. It's the same trick Warren pitched with ""Regulate"" and has been his strength all along, upending weirdly obvious records into unexpected slappers. Nate Dogg rebuilds Madness' hook into a dramatic street anthem and Warren, whose rapping has always been confidently breezy, lays claim to everything in sight.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The EP also serves as a tasteful tribute to Nate Dogg, who is featured on every track. ""Saturday"", the most upbeat number here, could anchor a barbeque anywhere in California, and Nate Dogg's vocals on the song bear out his mark as a stylistic innovator. Because of his most familiar riffs, Nate Dogg is sometimes pigeonholed as a monotonous baritone, but songs like ""Saturday"" not only stretch his upper register, they showcase his constant runs and clever vocal riffing. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thankfully, this sequel rarely fetishizes Nate Dogg or his passing, and most of the songs breeze by with no mention of his death. It's best that way, as a restrained, unceremonious showcase. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>'s verse on ""Keep on Hustlin'"" is an exception, opening with a handful of bars eulogizing Nate Dogg, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">Biggie</a> at once before dropping an unfortunately dated reference to freeing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32643-boosie-badazz/"">Boosie Badazz</a>, who has been out of jail for more than a year. The verse breaks the mood, but it's only momentary, and the rest of the EP could have believably been released at any point in the last ten years. That might be the best thing about <i>G Funk Era Part II</i>: it's not strained or pandering, as much as an effortless continuation. The EP might not be a foundation shaker like its namesake, but Warren G is proof that sometimes music is best when it stands still.</p></div>"|20901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20901-warren-g-regulateg-funk-era-part-ii-ep/|7.4|Jay Balfour

With Scott, it's mom-and-pop, all-you-can-eat R&amp;B; sexy fun for grown folk over the age of 40, like speed dating at church.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Woman</i>'s first track, ""Wild Cookie"", initially seems like a spoken word ode to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2Owa9-278I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Empire""'s Cookie Lyon</a>, but the lyrics quickly suggest that ""Cookie"" is a euphemism for the vagina. ""Wild Cookie choices lead to lonely pregnancy,"" Scott says over strings and drums. The vagina in ""Wild Cookie"", personified, acts on its own. Desirous, it does not have a mind of its own, but it would seem that way. ""Just the other day my girlfriend said she was watching TV and her wild cookie detached from its seat."" That detachment, that Jill speaks of—that desire—is a magnetizing energy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Beyond ""Wild Cookie"", there are other food references. After all, Scott perpetually sings like she's about to cook dinner for a family that isn't even hers. She wants domesticity, craves it. ""Prepared"", the track that follows the intro poem, has the lyrics ""I've been getting recipes off the Internet"" and ""I've been eating more greens"", which come as no surprise for anyone who's ever listened to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCerHrqWQkQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Way""</a> off her first album. Food is a big part of Scott's music. Additionally, in the track ""Closure"", Scott sings about not making a man quiches and homemade waffles anymore, how he shouldn't expect breakfast.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""I'm on my way, I'm almost there,"" Scott sings in ""Coming to You"", a percussion-laden, breathless track, the most urgent on a decidedly slow record. ""Coming to You"" is a funky, upbeat jam, but for a faster song, it's not necessarily more fun. The fun tracks are the ones that shimmer. </span>""Fool's Gold"", arguably the best song, is about a disillusioned Scott who finds herself in a relationship that might as well have been a pipe dream. ""I was living the dream/ Believing things that just ain't true/ Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you/ Had me chasing fool's gold,"" she sings over a bouncy, enchanting instrumental. Another strong track is ""Lighthouse"", a somberly reassuring lullaby of a ballad about supporting a lover through trying, burdensome times. ""I'm your shelter,"" Scott sings like an overprotective siren, striking a balance between sexy and soothing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Intimate and slow-moving, </span><i>Woman</i><span> is good but underwhelming. </span><span>It</span><span> lacks the dynamism of </span><i>Who Is Jill Scott?</i><span><i>,</i> the rap features of </span><i>Light of the Sun</i><span>. What was new, interesting, and different 15 years ago isn</span><span>'</span><span>t anymore. Scott</span><span>'</span><span>s mastered the formula of candlelit, slow-cooker music. Her sense of humor and sensuality, fine-tuned, endearing and bold, is infused throughout this album, but it doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel like enough. It misses the mark, like a lot of great music does, because it</span><span>'</span><span>s less inventive.</span></p></div>"|20819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20819-woman/|7.1|Safy-Hallan Farah

But four years may as well be 40, and the Mustardwave has long since crested. While the sound he pioneered has lingered well past the average trend life-cycle, ""ratchet"" as a buzzword has all but gone the way of the dodo; even the @DennysDiner social team has moved on to fleeker pastures.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If Mustard's latest full-length, </span><i>10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1</i><span>, sounds familiar, it's because it shares a title with his 2014 </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19709-dj-mustard-10-summers/""><span>debut album</span></a><span>. It's also because you've heard approximations of all these songs before, over and over, everywhere you go, for years. The central conceit of this mixtape series is that Mustard's dominance will ride out for a full decade, and if anyone could pull off that kind of endurance feat, it's the Dijon Don. But that claim's starting to feel like an empty gesture, even if it's not entirely unfeasible; does anyone really need <i>that</i> much Mustard on the beat?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To be fair, Mustardwave hitting critical mass was spurred on by opportunistic imitators as much as the producer himself. Aside from Omarion's still-buzzing 2014 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPxVSCfoYnU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Post to Be""</a>, the most Mustard-y Top 40 single right now is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33095-jidenna/"">Jidenna</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsiN0W15w0U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Classic Man""</a>, which isn't actually his production at all: it's built around a sample from Iggy's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fancy""</a>, the most high-profile, blatant Mustard rip-off to date. In other words, it's become impossible to tell the simulacra from the real deal. The Mustardwave singularity is upon us, and at this point, these beats may as well be self-replicating ad infinitum.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not that <i>10 Summers</i> isn't <i>good</i>, per se. While it's significantly less star-studded than last year's album, and less explosive than 2013's well-timed <i>Ketchup</i> tape, the dip in quality isn't all that extreme. Besides, who wants to hate on low-stakes party music? There's no need to overanalyze the tape's 17 passable-to-solid tracks; all you really need to do is dance to them a couple Mangoritas deep in a backyard. But I want to believe Mustard has more up his sleeve than this: slight alterations of the same snaps, single-finger piano prods, and bassy synths, with a corral of just-fine Pushaz Ink rappers passing through. Even longtime muse <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>'s switched his style up post-<a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/""><i>My Krazy Life</i></a>, with the Terrace Martin G-funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17589-yg-twist-my-fingaz/"">""Twist My Fingaz""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">YG doesn't show up at all on <i>10 Summers</i>; the tape's highest-profile feature is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"">the Game</a>, which speaks volumes about the kinds of half-assed attempts at the zeitgeist here. There are a handful of pretty great guest spots, for what it's worth, mostly from L.A. locals. On ""Trippin Off Hoes"", Pushaz Ink affiliate and charming dirtbag RJ goes off like a bomb over the beat's guttural growl: ""Gettin' rich though! She a trip though! Credit cards with somebody else info!"" The track's only two minutes, but it doesn't need to be any longer; it's the type of efficient, mercenarial slapper Mustard redefined. ""You Know It"", the best rap song here, showcases buzzing Vallejo newcomer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32950-nef-the-pharaoh/"">Nef the Pharaoh</a> and houses the tape's best one-liner from relative unknown Big Mike: ""On my money, I'm a opportunist/ Off my meds, I'm a orthodontist."" But most of the project's first two-thirds passes in a forgettable blur, and if the overwhelming sense of facsimile wasn't enough, a rapper named DrakeO—<i>DrakeO!</i>—is prominently featured.</p>
<p>To be fair, Mustard's R&amp;B production has easily outshined his rap production post-<i>My Krazy Life</i>, and <i>10 Summers</i> is no different. Most of the tracks with any significant replay value here are the loose, wispy cabana R&amp;B jams that comprise the tape's tail end. ""Overdose"", with TeeFlii, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"">Iamsu!</a>, and Choice, slides into an understated, liquid groove that draws from G-funk, yacht rock, and twinkly early-'00s Nelly ballads. ""Ice Cream"" channels the new jack slickness of Soul For Real's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx0xzO73Amo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">candy-coated raindrops</a>. It's clear the guy still has ideas, and maybe he's saving the good ones for when the stakes are higher. Last week, he released <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dj-mustard-1/why-call-f-ty-n-makonen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Why'd You Call?""</a>, a SoundCloud loosie featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">Makonnen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> that exists somewhere between '80s electro and Based World, complete with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>-esque EDM breakdown. It's not necessarily the most inspired direction for Mustard, but at least he's venturing out of his comfort zone.

It’s true that 2009’s slimy sample-heavy <i>Contempt!</i> wasn't about to find a mainstream audience, though the crux of his self-styled myth hangs on Paper Bag rejecting 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19979-slim-twig-a-hound-at-the-hem/""><i>A Hound at the Hem</i></a> for being too far out, which feels off when you consider the rest of their <a href=""http://paperbagrecords.com/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">roster</a>. Compared to his previous records, <i>Hound</i> was Slim’s most accessible release: A concept album loosely themed around <i>Lolita</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/""><i>L’Histoire de Melody Nelson</i></a> that conjured <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/"">L.A.’s chamber pop weirdos</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"">Van Dyke Parks</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3092-harry-nilsson/"">Harry Nilsson</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> in a dank, oily guise. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a> provided string arrangements. Slim eventually issued the record on Calico Corp, the label he runs with his wife, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29681-us-girls/"">U.S. Girls</a>’ Meg Remy, and DFA Records saw fit to re-release it last year. They offered Slim a deal for new work, and <a href=""http://www.audiofemme.com/artist-interview-slim-twig/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">encouraged him</a> to ""keep the music as weird as possible."" In the meantime, he had released the milder <i>Sof Sike</i> to appease Paper Bag, a compromise he says he didn’t mind.</p>
<p>For all Slim’s off-kilter aims, <i>Thank You for Stickin’ With Twig</i> fits right into any number of very timely pop cultural concerns. His desire to emulate and kill his idols—audibly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/"">Zappa</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Beefheart</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"">Zombies</a>—paired with an abiding love of classic melodies and psychedelic murk aligns him with self-conscious, costumed rock’n’roll stylists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/"">Father John Misty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>. Both FJM and Pink use bad taste and misogyny in an attempt to radicalize the traditional realms in which they work, and are credited as complex artists for it, though, as NPR’s Ann Powers highlighted in a recent <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/02/28/389569706/sympathy-for-the-devils"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">essay</a> on Josh Tillman, it’s a marketing ploy as much as any potentially genuine creative impulse: ""Maybe for that reason, outrageousness now doesn’t seek to change much beyond itself. It’s provocative, but not necessarily oppositional or even that unconventional at its core.""</p>
<p>With <i>Thank You</i>, Slim rejects FJM and Pink’s rejection of good taste, positioning himself as an ally on gender and wage equality, a woman’s pleasure, and an advocate <a href=""http://www.audiofemme.com/artist-interview-slim-twig/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for</a> ""dragging an appropriation of rock’n’roll kicking and screaming into a place free of cliché, sexism, and trod on association."" It’s a big claim. And yet, Slim appointing himself as a corrective sits almost as uncomfortably as Pink’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56089-ariel-pink-i-got-maced-by-a-feminist/"">""maced by a feminist"" story</a> and FJM's cultivated chauvinism. Pitchfork contributor Jes Skolnik <a href=""http://themodernistwitch.tumblr.com/post/125176708188/why-i-dont-trust-feminist-mentmproblems-with"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> recently about ""[recoiling] from men who are extremely keen to tell me exactly how Feminist they are."" She continued, ""[trust is] not something that comes with hardcore lyrics about the Right Topics."" Given that Slim has <a href=""http://montrealrampage.com/interview-with-slim-twig-knowing-the-artist-through-art/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about</a> admiring ""a lot of artists who would be considered assholes or even criminals like Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, and Phil Spector,"" it’s hard not to raise a skeptical brow at his foregrounded activism on behalf of the disenfranchised. </p>
<p><i>Thank You</i> comes at a time when we greet any art that basically musters the Bechdel test with the enthusiasm of serfs receiving crumbs from the master’s table. Type ""<i>Magic Mike</i> female pleasure"" into your favorite search engine and there’s a whole page of essays from high-profile outlets praising the film’s portrayal of women’s satisfaction. This is where <i>Thank You</i> starts, with ""Slippin’ Slidin’"", a desperate, sleazy devotional where Slim puts himself at the mercy of his sexual partner, his distorted voice matching the guitar’s gravelly thrust. That it sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"">T. Rex</a> is surely meant to make some audacious point about a cock-rocking song concerning female pleasure, a level of extra-textural interest that <i>Thank You</i> assumes of its listeners. (Cop the <a href=""http://store.dfarecords.com/products/dfa2472?variant=3602113665"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extensive explanations</a> that accompany its page in the DFA web store.)</p>
<p>Better is the subsequent ""A Woman’s Touch (It’s No Coincidence)""—co-written with Remy—which confronts Yoko haters and attributes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>’ wives with significant responsibility for their husbands’ success. <i>This</i> feels like a well-judged feminist statement coming from a male artist messing with rock’n’roll signifiers. It also sounds like a dub remix of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zedq1VhaS90"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Roobarb and Custard""</a> theme tune that’s as irritating as it is fun. Also strong is ""Fog of Sex (N.S.I.S.)""—if it were less corroded, its sharp lyrics might forge an anthem for gender fluidity: ""Gender please/ Standardized questionnaire fee/ Simply mark which one you are/ Yet no option applies to me,"" Slim sings with Remy.</p>
<p>""A Woman’s Touch"" and ""Fog of Sex"" are the opening book-end to a bog of courtly baroque interludes (""She Stickin’ With Twig""), twisted junkyard carousel songs (""Stone Rollin’ (Musical Emotion)""), doomy stutter (""Trip Thru Bells""), and drawling electric guitar that magically captures the gleeful menace of Captain Beefheart’s voice (""Textiles on Mainstreet""; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbLSYXfc0Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">see also</a>). Everything is doused in unkempt psych sleaze; the middle section is in desperate need of a corset.</p>
<p>Amidst it is ""Roll Red Roll (Song for Steubenville)"". It starts as a murky waltz that veers again into that louche guitar tone, heralding inaudible lyrics that evoke the grim situation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steubenville high school football team rape case</a>—all uneasy come-ons that don’t contain the option to say no: ""You ever been a mule hon?/ You ever make it past the line?/ Even in a school zone/ I see you look just fine."" Perhaps Slim has very personal reasons for wanting to inhabit this horrendous incident, but at the same time, the lyrics don’t convey a complex handle on its gravity. The only nod to Steubenville is in the title, which feels like another pat on his own back; outrageousness—masquerading as tribute—not seeking to change much beyond itself, again.</p>
<p>The empty Big Ideas continue: ""You Got Me Goin..."" features a slurped sample of the Chi-Lites’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koiSiWLq3ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stoned Out of My Mind""</a>, which is rekindled again later on ""Out of My Mind"", with added woodwind. Following the genuinely clever and brilliant <i>Hound</i>, the mess is wildly frustrating. ""The trouble is once having killed one’s idols, there’s a tendency to also do away with melody, structure, clever lyrics, and a more ambitious approach to production,"" Slim <a href=""http://www.audiofemme.com/artist-interview-slim-twig/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> one interviewer of his attempts to avoid doing that. He wasn't particularly successful. It’s no surprise that he <a href=""http://slimtwig.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/my-musical-2014-in-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">named</a> the supreme self-sabotage that was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32518-julian-casablancas-the-voidz/"">Julian Casablancas and the Voidz</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19856-julian-casablancas-the-voidz-tyranny/""><i>Tyranny</i></a> as one of his albums of 2014.</p>
<p>Perversely, the song where Slim confronts the tension between himself and his dearly held inspirations is both the least original and best of <i>Thank You</i>. The jaunty, confident guitar hook of ""Live In, Live On, Your Era"" evokes both the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Stones</a>’ ""Rocks Off"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a>’s ""Rebel Rebel"", and sails through proggy patches as Slim delivers acutely written lyrics about the vital challenge of originality: ""This ain’t the time to be cribbing in class/ One’s own voice is a great deal rarer/ With that in mind, start living out your era."" As if to make—or break?—his point, he follows it and closes the record with a hoary cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Serge Gainsbourg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4991-jean-claude-vannier/"">Jean-Claude Vannier</a>’s ""Cannabis"". ""On and on, the jokes and meta-sonic rock commentary continue like so many Zappa-esque indulgences,"" state the notes that accompany the album. But in Slim Twig’s incessant and overbearing winks to the camera, he’s lost sight of his own potential.</p></div>"|20740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20740-thank-you-for-stickin-with-twig/|5.4|Laura Snapes

On the L.A.-based, Pennsylvania-bred artist's new album <i>RIP III</i>,  you'll hear the cult '90s kids show ""Land of the Lost""'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwvguf_0kUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theme music</a> interpolated as ""Land of the Goths"" and the sky described as ""green, like Mountain Dew."" Like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>, with whom he's often compared, Stasis mines the sun-bleached sounds of '70s AM radio for inspiration, while also weaving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3632-martin-rev/"">Martin Rev</a>'s pre-industrial grind and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30013-cleaners-from-venus/"">Cleaners From Venus</a>' psychedelic guitar work into his tapestry of outsider pop. He used to be involved in a band called Snowboarder while living in the Bay Area, but<a href=""https://freemusicarchive.org/curator/CCcommunity/blog/Snowboarder_Snowboards_Like_the_Beach_Boys_Surf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> told an interviewer</a> he'd only snowboarded once. He's the type of artist fans will try to one-up each other with where-they-heard-him-firsts as they attempt to accurately retrace a career that's brought Stasis from Philly to New York to the West Coast.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, those fans would barely fill a Highland Park living room. Not only is Michael Stasis not particularly famous, he's essentially unknown outside a small subset of the California DIY scene. That leaves <i>RIP III</i> in the difficult position of serving as both a de-facto debut and a greatest hits collection for an artist with precisely zero ""hits."" As it turns out, <i>RIP III</i> is actually the third in a series of compilation albums, all of which draw from Stasis' home recordings, cassette releases, and other ephemera. <i>III</i>, however, has the unique distinction of being the first Stasis album released via <a href=""http://arbutusrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arbutus</a>, the Montreal label that has served as a launchpad for alt-pop heavyweights <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"">Majical Cloudz</a> and remains home to underground faves like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31231-sean-nicholas-savage/"">Sean Nicholas Savage</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32071-tonstartssbandht/"">Tonstartssbandht</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fortunately for Stasis, <i>RIP III</i> shows not only that he deserves the larger audience, but that it's a surprise he's stayed under the radar so long. ""The Necklace"" is a love song whose haunting, hummable chorus is darker and weirder than first appears. ""This I'll hang on you,"" Stasis sings, irony saturating each drawn-out syllable, the twist being that what Stasis has to give is both a gift and a curse. Another parallel between Ariel Pink is Stasis' friendship with Jorge Elbrecht, known for having helped shaped some of the past decade's best experimental pop. Though <i>RIP III</i> is mostly self-recorded, Stasis' production, especially on songs like ""The Necklace"" and ""Little Devil"", hews close to Elbrecht's pillowy aesthetic. ""Brown Cow"", a track that appears to have no deeper meaning than describing a literal cow in a field, has a motorik groove that hits like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu6f4dAaXpc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wilco's ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)""</a> if you listened to it at a Club Med on mushrooms. That the effect is charming, rather than just confusing, is a testament to Stasis' ability to sell even his strangest left turns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As one might expect from an album recorded under varying circumstances and in different places, <i>RIP III</i> has radical changes in sound and production quality from track to track. It's not an exaggeration to say that, without some background info, you might not recognize that it's the same dude behind all these songs. ""Crushed"", for instance, is a bit of rollicking '60s surf rock that slams headlong into ""All the Ways"", a wobbly slow-burner that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade</a>. ""Surface Area"", on the other hand, is a foray into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"">Magnetic Fields</a>' territory that's surprisingly affecting and totally unlike anything else on the rest of the record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though disjointed, <i>RIP III</i>'s eclecticism is part of its charm. Rather than coming off as haphazard, the album has the feeling of surfing between public access channels with a one-hitter at hand. Nothing in particular unites the images, but a singular mood blankets the activity. The danger for Stasis is that his more satirical side will overshadow his skill as a songwriter, or, worse, that he'll be seen as a dilettante without a clearly-defined aesthetic of his own. But if playlists are indeed becoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/"">as important as albums</a>, <i>RIP III</i> shows that an individual songwriter can contain the same multitudes. On album opener and highlight ""Venus of Soap"", the chorus, huge and ecstatic, repeats the phrase ""I'll just laugh it off."" For Stasis, it's a mantra. But the joke's on us if we do the same.</p></div>"|20853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20853-rip-iii/|7.3|Nathan Reese

That's where Mac DeMarco lives on the water, when he's not busy gallivanting in the Brooklyn scene or touring across the world. At the end of his new mini-LP, <i>Another One</i><span>, he tells us his address, and invites us to come over for a cup of coffee, so that in the process of taking that long train ride, toward boardwalks dusted with white sand and the ocean stretched for miles and miles, we might come closer to understanding his slacker-poet point of view.</span></p>
<p>At first sight, DeMarco seems impossibly ""chill,"" that meditative state achieved by studying Buddhism or popping a few Oxys, only it’s more complicated than that. He connects not simply because he's ""chill,"" but because his relaxed self seems borne of extreme self-confidence. His music isn't for situations that are laidback in and of themselves. They're for the unguarded moments you might share with another person where the both of you are comfortable without reservation. Music made for the end of a rooftop barbecue, when the sun dips, the beer is nearly gone, and everyone who doesn't want to be there has already gone. Here, you can be honest, goofy, even silent; all of it is accepted without a dissenting word. This type of sincerity without precocity is rare in art, and the contrast between the content of DeMarco's music and the content of his character only highlights his singularity as someone whose contradictions build toward a vibrant self, rather than collapsing in disarray.</p>
<p>Which means: If you like DeMarco, you'll like <i>Another One</i>. It's like a novella, or a made-for-TV movie—something to chew on while we wait for the next major project. It riffs on his established formula: the same rinky-dink guitar tone, funky basslines, air-tight percussion announcing a band with enough experience to avoid fucking up the vibe. There are four slow songs and three songs that are a little less slow but still plenty relaxed, all of them filled with little details to catch your ear. The solo in ""The Way You Love Her"" was written with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robbie Robertson</a>'s strictured tone in mind, even as it ends up a few steps closer to the nu-reggae swing of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIh2xe4jnpk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magic!'s ""Rude""</a>. Few will sound as comely or as inviting as DeMarco does on ""No Other Heart"" when he sings, ""Come on and give this lover boy a try/ I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes/ What could you lose?""</p>
<p>The twinkling chord progression on ""Without Me""—amongst his prettiest songs ever recorded—is buttressed by a cloud of washed out synthesizers, creating a lovesick feeling as he sings about accepting that a woman is better without him. ""Just to Put Me Down"" has a future as an extended set closer, with the refrain of the song title warping ever so slowly as he sings it over and over again, his guitar bursting into peals of expression. The wink of the album's title turns introspective on the title track, with a deeply languid DeMarco ruminating about the uncertainty of his relationship while wondering if ""another one"" is knocking at the door of his beloved.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-572ac25e-f3e8-b0e1-a3fe-deb3bcd0074e"">DeMarco is an unusually sensitive songwriter, capable of ferreting out what someone else might be feeling even as he’s absorbed in his own perspective. He’s what sex columnist Dan Savage refers to as ""GGG"": good, giving, and game. When I saw him at this year's Primavera Sound Festival, his band dropped in a few minutes of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>'s ""Yellow""—the joke, of course, being that ""Yellow"" is fairly close to a song that DeMarco would've written. Chris Martin says the stars shine for his lover; DeMarco says they call for him, only he'd rather stay with his woman. <i>I know I'm special</i>, he sings, <i>but I want you to be a part of it, too</i>. And so he continues to write another one and another one until we're convinced. </span></p></div>"|20862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20862-another-one/|7.3|Jeremy Gordon

One might grow a tail or shed their skin, or sprout a tiny mouth below the collarbone that whispers secrets while you sleep. Some kids become extremely deformed, while others manage to hide their disfigurement beneath bandages and clothes. </span><i>Black Hole</i><span> was the inspiration behind La Luz</span><span>'</span><span>s </span><i>Weirdo Shrine, </i>and there are oblique references to Burns' work littered throughout: its title alludes to the artwork built out of trash and human parts that<i> Black Hole</i>'s characters stumble upon in the forest, and lyrics like ""Cool kids/ Telling lies/ I can't hold their gazes in mine,"" (from opening track ""Sleep Till They Die"") hint at the shame and deceit in Burns' world.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What makes <i>Weirdo Shrine</i> interesting is that all this existential dread is wrapped up in classic-sounding surf rock, topped with enough ""ooohhhs"", ""aaahhhs"", and vocal harmonies to fill your girl group quota for an entire year. Lead singer and guitarist Shana Cleveland tosses out bright, airy guitar riffs, tinged with just the right amount of reverb, as easy as breathing. But the surfer girl guise is a front. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-2694399a-f40e-7acf-c796-a9a1b9201679""><span>If La Luz are a rum punch drink served in a pineapple, be careful lifting the tiny drink umbrella: There's probably a black widow spider underneath.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nowhere is this more apparent than the ballad, ""I'll Be True"". Cleveland croons, ""No one else treats me like you do/ And I'll be true to you/ Just as long as you want me to,"" while keyboardist Alice Sandahl tries to wrestle the good name of organ solos from the hands of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Manzarek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ray Manzarek</a>. But the lingering effect of the song is not the declaration of loyalty, it's the minor chord progression that blends with the ladies' descending voices. It begs the question: If the love in the song is so pure and innocent then why does it come tinged with such eeriness? </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">La Luz recorded<i> <a href=""https://laluz.bandcamp.com/album/its-alive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It's Alive</a></i> in the back of their friend's trailer. For <i>Weirdo Shrine</i>, producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> constructed a makeshift studio out of an old surfboard factory. At first, this tactic can come across almost like a cheap gimmick, a soundbite for press releases. But once you realize Segall also chose to keep a persistent hissing overlay on the entire record (it's hard to ignore once you hear it)—the occasional, lingering odd note or glitch will also tend to appear during the transitions between tracks—his methods become less a cute anecdote, and more a way to keep the group firmly grounded in their DIY roots. The ladies might have perfect pitch, but this is not an album for cleaning up mistakes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It</span><span>'</span><span>s frustrating that the record doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t fully convey the energy of La Luz</span><span>'</span><span>s live shows, where the band members will crowd surf and request the audience make space for a line dance à la ""Soul Train"". But if you choose to </span>focus on La Luz's doo-wop harmonizing, then you're only looking at the frilly, pink bow that tops the whole package. The undercurrent of darkness in La Luz's music is what makes their work so fierce and intelligent. You could blink and miss their sneaky, underhanded way of slipping unease into their cheerful-sounding songs. Which is why you should give them more of your attention. Much like a car accident, it's always the ones we didn't see coming that hit the hardest.</p></div>"|20781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20781-weirdo-shrine/|7.1|Lindsay Hood

And we’re not talking a subtle nod to the Sisters of Mercy or Killing Joke sprinkled here or there. No, this would be candle-lit-bat-cave, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2868-peter-murphy/"">Peter-Murphy</a>-drinking-merlot-out-of-a-human-skull levels of goth.

However, with song titles like ""Pain Iz Pleasure"" and ""Punishment (Only a Victim)"", it's not so clear where appreciation ends and pastiche begins. That's not a dig, actually—few scenes are more susceptible to parody than goth music, and for good reason; it can always feel embarrassing to celebrate negative emotions, but that's also what makes it deliciously indulgent.</p>
<p>Grave Babies' music has always flirted with darkness, but the alienation and misanthropy of <i>Violence</i> feels new. Part of this shift may be attributed to personnel: Sometime between the releases of <i>Crusher</i> and <i>Violence</i>, frontman and songwriter Danny Wahlfeldt overhauled Grave Babies' permanent roster with Bryce Brown of Crypts on bass, Claire Haranda on synths, and the key addition of Mark Gajadhar from cult post-hardcore poster boys <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/396-the-blood-brothers/"">Blood Brothers</a> on drums. Gajadhar duly takes his place as <i>Violence</i>'s MVP, his precise, no-nonsense style (intertwined throughout the album with drum machines) propulsing everything forward, step by step, as Wahlfeldt's controlled chaos shudders and swirls around him.</p>
<p><i>Violence</i> opens with the near-shoegaze distortion of ""Eternal (On &amp; On)"", with layer upon layer of guitars and synthesizers washing over Wahfeldt's echoing, distorted baritone: ""A life that leaves without a purpose/ And on and on and on it goes..."" It would be easy to imagine it as the soundtrack to a sci-fi film where teenagers in bondage gear roam a dystopian wasteland. ""Try 2 Try"" brings the tone even lower with heavy, syncopated guitars swamping through the mix as Haranda's keyboard line struggles to pop through. It works, giving the music the needed edge to create density without slog. ""Something Awful"" owes a whole lot to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/""><i>Disintegration</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>, or even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hook"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hook</a>, as Brown's buoyant bass takes center stage, carrying the album into its middle stage, which, like with many goths themselves, can get awkward. It's not a lack of direction, or even musicianship, that causes <i>Violence</i> to ultimately lag. It's perhaps not even a lack of tunes, as ""N2 Ether"" and its warbly vocal hook make for a welcome pick-me-up further down the tracklisting.</p>
<p>It's just at some point, the album loses its flavor, and songs begin to mash and bleed into each other in a not-exactly-purposeful or interesting way. It's not unlistenable, far from it, it just gets slowly (very, very slowly) bogged and drowned under its own ideas. In a landscape where bands are encouraged more and more to play it safe and appeal to their same couple thousand Twitter followers over and over again, it's commendable that Grave Babies took this leap of faith and changed their direction so drastically. In the end, though, <i>Violence</i> comes off as transitional, a building block for a bigger, darker, blacker record that may be in Grave Babies' future. </p></div>"|20863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20863-holographic-violence/|6.4|Cameron Cook

But Trae tha Truth's might be the most unique—a rasp carrying so much weight he might be Houston's version of Big Rube, if Rube decided to rhyme. He's also never really broke all the way through like his contemporaries from the class of 2005, or escaped the local hub of the Screwed Up Click. There is a darkness to his music that might put off outsiders. Sometimes he even discomfits his own city: He was banned by Houston's most-recognizable hip-hop station for a sustained period of time because of an inane allegation he incited violence via his annual Trae Day, a local, charitable holiday (officially recognized by the mayor!). In other words, his art is so gut-level effective it nearly blacklisted him from a city he has represented tirelessly for over a decade. No one's realer than Trae.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>However, true to Houston form, he can't quite sustain a full-length album. Between a solo run and his work with ABN, Trae's established a personal canon, but you'll be hard-pressed </span><span>to hear a song of his after Fat Pat's ""Tops Drop"" and Chamillionaire's ""Ridin'"" during a best-of-Houston playlist</span><span>: he's so prolific that in recent years he's spread his catalog thin. That there's no strong Houston presence on Tha Truth, Trae's first record in four years, is not a surprise, because he's always been the odd-man-out of the nationally-recognized Houston crew, and his affiliation with T.I.'s Hustle Gang makes some locals bristle. But it unfortunately lends a major-label-rap sameness to </span><i>Tha Truth</i><span>, his </span><span>seventh official</span><span> studio album, that is kryptonite to someone as unique as Trae.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some moments work better than others, but the album feels shuffled rather than sequenced.  Problem, a good rapper, is sorely mismatched with Lil Boss, one of the few features (and only local one) to leave a mark, on solid first single ""Yeah Hoe."" Trae lets DeJ Loaf get the last word on this record, on the excellent closer ""Realigion,"" and the fit makes sense: DeJ works the same anti-social angle Trae has trafficked in for years. Surprisingly, the J. Cole collaboration is the most affecting song. Cole's strained gravitas works in small doses, and it does on ""Children of Men,"" a soulful lament that runs through familiar themes of violence and poverty but manages to twist them afresh in Trae's husky presence.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-15bc84b5-f65e-063f-8764-8a8a02688b18""><span>When not basking in the highs of ""Children of Men"" or the lows of ill-advised sex jam ""Late Night King"" (with a badly Auto-Tuned Jeremih on the hook), </span><span>Tha Truth</span><span> just hovers in the Houston-street-rap middle. On the intro, Lil Duval insists, ""ain't no music out here for the struggle right now...that's what the people need."" And Trae stays to true to his word. ""Why"" is a somber reflection on gang violence, but it doesn't resonate after it's over. ""Tricken Every Car I Get"" with Future and Boosie, is a good single, but it's mostly telling  for how hungry Boosie sounds: ""Spray that thing candy but might wreck the whip the next day/Peanut butter insides covered up in plastic/stash spots everywhere, ride fly everywhere."" These are fun lines that stick in your head on first listen, and they capture more vitality in a few seconds than Trae does for the entire record.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Showmanship has never been Trae's trademark, and that can be an issue. He's still rapping well enough over good beats, and he earns points for not shoehorning a Kirko Bangz hook or Travis Scott verse in somewhere. Yet </span><span>Tha Truth</span><span> doesn't feel vital, and, at his peak, Trae was arguably the most vital Houston rapper—anchoring a scene that featured the antics of Mike Jones and Paul Wall, he was the lyricist's lyricist, the conscience of the underground. Trae doesn't have to prove to anyone he's a necessary voice in hip-hop, but between Slim Thug's surprisingly solid twin </span><i>Hogg Life</i><span> records from this year, or the consistently mellow output from fellow ABN member Z-Ro, for now anyway, he's been outpaced.</span></p></div>"|20882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20882-tha-truth/|6.7|Matthew Ramirez

They're indebted to the black metal of two Canadian bands, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blasphemy</a> and <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Conqueror/3502"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conqueror</a>, as well as the Brazilian primitivism of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarc%C3%B3fago"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarcofago</a>, but play with a looseness not quite fitting any of those groups. Even by the lo-fi fetish standards of black metal, Deiphago commit to a chaos few bands could match. A more polished Deiphago record seems antithetical, but that's what <i>Into the Eye of Satan</i>, their fourth full-length, is to an extent. In the hand of noted metal producer Colin Marston, we see a more complete version of the band. </p>
<p>In <i>Eyes</i>, the chaos isn't squelched, just illuminated. From ""Evil and Adverse"", it's obvious their actual playing hasn't changed much, but Marston's production makes you better appreciate their muscularity. Guitarist Sidapa's leads are more prominent in the mix. ""Bloodbath of Genocide"" features wah-wah swaths in the beginning that would have gone unnoticed before, and these minor details add up. His mini-solos in ""6x6x6/3"" sound more like the playing of a college kid obsessed with free jazz and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"">Thurston Moore</a> than conventional shredding. Sidapa sounds most bizarre in ""Calculated Acts of Cruelty"" and the title track closer, abandoning any conceits of fluidity. Peaks become valleys without warning and notes criss-cross into tangled weaves.</p>
<p>With improved production, <i>Eye</i> inadvertently reveals the hardcore influence—especially that of d-beat groups like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discharge</a>—that's always been latent in Deiphago's music. Drummer Savnok opts for a looser, punkier style. Vocalist/bassist Voltaire 666's bass may sound less distorted, but it's never sounded meaner. Deiphago may be the true successors of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Venom</a>, who brought endearing sloppiness and fuck-all attitude to the creation of black metal. All this, combined with Sidapa's guitar work, finds Deiphago oddly, if pleasingly, working against their own credo. They're not afraid to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/666division/posts/771843329568951"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">proclaim</a> ""Fuck off to the false!"", but <i>Eye</i> is less straitlaced than many of their peers' works. Deiphago's other records may have served as a litmus test for how much discordance you can handle in metal; this is where you fully realize just how serious they are.</p></div>"|20788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20788-into-the-eye-of-satan/|7.3|Andy O' Connor

Of all the acts that Trent Reznor picked to open dates on that tour, HEALTH seemed the like the most obvious heir apparent—a band using bizarro configurations of electronics and guitars to pummel the audience into submission. Theirs appeared to be a very Reznor-approved pursuit: technology employed in service of exploring some of the most base human impulses—to incite, to destroy, and to possibly cause deafness. </p>
<p>It says something about the nature of HEALTH's music that of their now six proper full-length releases, two are remix albums (2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11534-disco/""><i>Disco</i></a> and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14348-disco2/""><i>Disco2</i></a>) and one is the soundtrack to a video game (2013's surprisingly excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16646-max-payne-3-ost/""><i>Max Payne 3</i></a>). In fact, their music has often flourished best in remix form. Hearing the band's music stripped and reworked by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"">Gold Panda</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/"">Crystal Castles</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9780-cfcf/"">CFCF</a> (whose sinewy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmDXE3awwKs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reworking</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13409-get-color/""><i>Get Color</i></a>'s ""Before Tigers"" remains a standout) shone a light on just what was frequently hidden underneath all of HEALTH's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a>-esque roar: namely vocalist Jacob Duzsik's feathery vocals and the band's nascent ear for melody. Given room to breathe, HEALTH's music reveals itself to be much more than ""industrial disco""—it's also pop music.</p>
<p>It's been over half a decade since they released a studio album, and <i>Death Magic</i> is a bold, albeit occasionally jarring, step forward. In a recent Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9630-game-over-health-finish-first-album-in-six-years/"">interview</a> the band happily extolled the virtues of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a>, all of which makes the outré pop leanings of <i>Death Magic</i> more understandable. Given the early singles teased from the album, there was every reason to think that <i>Death Magic</i> might just be business as usual—and in some ways it is. The first single,""New Coke"", materialized via a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3_dedjucgM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music video</a> that featured high-intensity blasts of rafter-shaking low-end (not to mention the most lovingly filmed slow-motion vomit shots ever captured in a music video). Similarly, ""Men Today"" is a riot of barely corralled tribal drums, overdriven synths, and unpredictable beats. The track is pristinely produced and appropriately mountain-sized (Andrew Dawson and Lars Stalfors contribute production duties throughout), but it's not exactly a radical reinvention. Once you dig deeper into the record, however, the dark clouds begin to part.</p>
<p>On <i>Death Magic</i>, the band finally embraces the pop impulses that seem to have always been lurking in their DNA. ""Flesh World (UK)"" comes swinging out of the gate like a house track—a dancefloor appropriate number with an appropriately grim chorus (""We die/ So what/ We're here"") that only occasionally pauses to slam the listener face first into a wall of white noise before advising ""Do all the drugs/ But don't hurt the ones you love."" ""Dark Enough"" is a goth-pop power ballad in which Duzsik sings, ""Does it make a difference if it's real?/ As long as I still say I love you?"" It's the kind of sideways romantic admission that would have sounded out of place—or perhaps just totally unintelligible—on a previous HEALTH record.</p>
<p>The band's biggest and most shocking pop moment comes just halfway through on ""Life""—a song that flirts with stadium-size pop sentiments that would not be out of place on mainstream radio or, say, playing during the closing credits of a teenage romantic comedy. To hear a band like HEALTH offer the sentiment—""Life is strange/ We die and we don't know why/ I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what want/ Nobody does""—feels both exhilarating and perverse. Longtime fans and noise purists might balk, but it's refreshing. The more vulnerable, pop-friendly moments on ""Life"" and the sparkly ""L.A. Looks""—in which Duzsik admits,""It's not love, but I still want you""—make for a much more dynamic and oddly compelling listen than just 45 minutes of synthetic squall.</p>
<p>Though they might bristle at the obvious comparison, it's hard not to notice the Reznorian qualities of <i>Death Magic</i>. With Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor married the formlessness of industrial music to radio-friendly pop melodies. The 12 tracks on <i>Death Magic</i> do much the same, neatly splitting the difference between exquisitely detailed bombast (more than anything they've done before, it's a record that demands a huge stereo system and/or an excellent set of headphones) and something more human. While they still don't have to worry about somehow getting accidentally swept up in the mainstream—a fate unlikely for a band still making scary songs about drugs and releasing vomit-soaked visuals—with <i>Death Magic</i> HEALTH wisely manage to sidestep the errors of so many other ostensibly ""heavy"" bands, who often chase after extremity to the point of becoming humorless cartoons. After a while, even unremitting noise and relentless nihilism becomes rote and, frankly, kind of boring. Without the occasional beam of light, it's hard to actually appreciate how dark—or how good—a band like HEALTH can actually be.</p></div>"|20861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20861-death-magic/|7.8|T.

But if <i>Bahdeni Nami</i> is any indication, the man who's become the frontrunner of Syrian techno dabke is, among other things, a human being, who like anyone else is prone to heartbreak.</p>
<p>Souleyman's last release and first ""proper"" studio album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18665-omar-souleyman-wenu-wenu/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Wenu Wenu</i></a>, produced by Kieran Hebden (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>), was colorful in its exuberance, a headlong rush into new love. But if <i>Wenu Wenu</i> was the upswing, <i>Bahdeni Nami</i> is the immediate aftermath, which isn't necessarily pretty and isn't always fun to listen to. It's still dabke—the popular Levantine Arab music traditionally accompanied by circle and line dancing—but it's heavier this time, both lyrically and musically.</p>
<p><i>Bahdeni Nami</i> was recorded closer to home, in Istanbul instead of Brooklyn where <i>Wenu Wenu</i> was made—though Souleyman is still in exile from his native Syria. Signed to Berlin producer duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"">Modeselektor</a>'s Monkeytown Records, Souleyman has enlisted a slew of producers for this second full-length studio release, including Four Tet, Gilles Peterson, Modeselektor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29894-legowelt"">Legowelt</a> (for an out-of-place haunted house remix), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a>' Cole Alexander (for a purported upcoming remix). Unfortunately, <i>Bahdeni Nami</i> as an album isn't stronger for their handiwork. And it's not that their production styles overshadow Souleyman's sound, but rather that as the album progresses, the music becomes static and, in most instances, redundant.</p>
<p>There's still a lot to be said for the mind-bending keyboard work of long-time collaborator Rizan Sa'id and the saz (long-necked lute) skills of Khaled Youssef, who create the bulk of the sound. The opening track, ""Mawal Menzal"", finds the singer professing his undying love for a woman who has ostensibly left him. <span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">It's a mawwal, a sung passage in Arabic music that traditionally involves a vocalist improvising the melody of a poetic text, usually while an instrumentalist intersperses corresponding lines.</span> That kind of dueting is ubiquitous on <i>Bahdeni Nami</i>, alternating predictably with longer stretches of keyboard/saz solos. </p>
<p>It's a formula that helped propel Souleyman to electro-dabke stardom in the first place. And on the album's title track ""Bahdeini Nami"", it still works. Produced by Four Tet, it's the most light-footed of the lot, and the most communal. Throughout the song, men throw ""Yey!""s and ""Hey!""s into the air. Even the stomping bass has a sort of upward lift, buoyed in part by lilting toy-Casio-esque syncopations. By contrast, on the dirge-like ""Darb El Hawa"", synths drone like distorted bagpipes above a lumbering bass drum and staid handclaps. Souleyman drags his voice like tired feet, intoning in Syrian Arabic, ""The road of love tortured me/ For so long, I've been waiting for a letter from my loved one."" His words echo and ricochet into the distance as he plays and replays his own grief back to himself. Save for saz, voice, and sometimes claps, everything here is simulated on keys, which is how Souleyman and Sa'id have always worked. But there's something poetic this time about the fact that nearly all the instrumentation is simulated; love is often an illusory thing after all.</p>
<p>That said, on much of the album, repetition crosses into redundancy, especially true on the two Modeselektor-produced tracks, ""Tawwalt El Gheba"" and ""Enssa El Aatab"". Both have a four-on-the-floor thump that imitates migraine pain above all else. It's not <i>because</i> of the  four-on-the-floor though; it's because the music keeps cycling back on itself without a sense of having moved anywhere or varied much. This monolithic feeling ends up overshadowing some of the more interesting '80s synth music and acid house moments on the album, where the tightly-coiled keyboard solos recall variously a reedy mijwiz (a double-pipe reed instrument), a distorted psych rock guitar, even a Moog. Listening to <i><i>Bahdeni</i> Nami</i> as a whole can feel borderline-masochistic. But then again, maybe that's the point; longing for or stewing over the memory of someone you've lost <i>is</i> its own kind of hell.</p></div>"|20830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20830-bahdeni-nami/|6.2|Minna Zhou

The EP is bursting with blues-rock and blissed-out psychedelia. Charles is not a frontwoman whose voice soars over her band—she favors shadowy harmonies. Bedding every track with cooing ""ooh""s and ""ah""s, she buries her strongest writing in the midst of splashy drumming and cutting power chords. ""What can I say to make you walk away?/ And make you understand that I don't wanna hold your hand?"" she sings on ""What Can I Do"", rejecting the Beatles' decades-old proposal with indignance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Charles' record takes cues from movements all over the American map. There are hints of Southern folk and alt-country, Midwest Americana, and West Coast acid rock. She tugs at these sounds with her smoky alto, which gives off the kind of sensuality we associate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>. The femme fatale described in ""Idea to Her"" sounds like she could have been plucked from Del Rey's songbook, Charles' voice similarly toothsome and her tone nearly as coy. The seductress role looks good on Charles, and she takes it on again alongside driving rhythms on the rootsy ""I Ran So Far"". She coaxes her lover to trust her with their secrets, but in such a way that both she and the listener know she's lying through her teeth. When she vows, ""Won't tell nobody else,"" it's easy to picture thick smoke curling away to reveal a devilish grin on her face.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When she recedes from the spotlight, the EP gets a little vague. ""Night &amp; Day"" is </span><span>Pearl Charles</span><span>' most diverse cut, with a jaunty surf-rock chord progression leading into a twinkling piano glissando into spiraling, bluesy guitar lines. But Charles hits a snag, relying on the arrangements to carry her through dull lyrics and tedious ""dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum""s. On the p</span>rismatic psych-folk track ""Indian Burnout"", Charles leans into then out of her words, singing with a slight Southern drawl recalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"">Emmylou Harris</a>. It's a shaky ride but a magnetic one that doesn't reach for heights that would overpower it or push things too far.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-f4003c4c-e132-abca-14e1-eeaf134e34ff""><span>The missteps are small and forgivable, especially considering her affinity for unexpected—but measured—choices. There are small but potent style decisions in many of these songs—rolling, ominous piano notes on ""Idea to Her"", rubbery, countrified strings on ""I Ran So Far"". It bodes well for a future full-length release.

Centered on the wiry guitar lines of Jack Cooper (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28169-mazes/"">Mazes</a>) and James Hoare (<a href=""ork.com/artists/28156-veronica-falls/"">Veronica Falls</a>), their economical three-minute songs echoed the patient melodies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground's</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20015-the-velvet-underground-the-velvet-underground/"">self-titled third album</a> and the workingman's garage-pop of New Zealand bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5411-the-chills/"">the Chills</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/616-the-bats/"">the Bats.</a> <i>Ultimate Painting</i> was winningly casual, the sound of two congenial dudes psyched to roll out easygoing melodies. But repeat listens revealed intriguing tensions inside basic templates.</p>
<p>The group's follow-up, <i>Green Lanes</i>, sounds even more casual. It's mellower and more subdued, with most songs ticking along at medium tempo or slower. At first it even seems that Ultimate Painting might have gotten too relaxed, drifting into zoned-out territory (they did recently use a modified <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Grateful Dead</a> logo as their Twitter avatar). But much like its predecessor, <i>Green Lane</i>s grows more interesting and distinctive with each subsequent rotation. Cooper and Hoare's deceptively simple interplay slowly worms into your synapses, as their seemingly anonymous melodies gain personality.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That's part of what makes </span><i>Green Lanes </i><span>so cohesive, since its lyrical themes are as simple as its moods. Many songs focus on the austere pleasures of nature—words such as ocean, beach, fog, and sun recur—as well as the plain details of daily life. One of the catchiest tunes, the lament </span><span>""(I've Got the) Sanctioned Blues"",</span><span> plays like <span>the song about unemployment benefits VU never wrote</span>. </span></p>
<p>Songs like that could easily come off as run-of-the-mill, but Ultimate Paining infuse their short, spartan verses with deep contemplation. Just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a>'s music gathers meaning in nostalgia, Cooper and Hoare tap into universal experiences that approach profundity rather than mundanity. This gives their songs a vintage hue, most obvious in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>-esque piano of ""Break the Chain"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>-like vocal harmonies of ""Paying the Price"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Such classic reference points make it tempting to call </span><i>Green Lanes</i><span> a low-stakes record. Music this devoid of attention-seeking flash or overt ambition can sometimes appear risk-averse. But truly committing to any style means taking a chance, even if that style is inherently low-key. </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/75-american-analog-set/""><span>American Analog Set</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/""><span>Low</span></a><span> built a wide palate with an understated approach, and the quietude of that third Velvet Underground album seemed daring at the time. Ultimate Painting are similarly devoted to a calm, subtle cause, and on </span><i>Green Lanes </i><span>that humble gamble again pays off handsomely.</span></p></div>"|20842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20842-green-lanes/|7.4|Marc Masters

<p>But those albums are a footnote inside the wider, weirder world of Mike Cooper. He also provides live music for silent films, paints and does collage, and releases albums of experimental, loop-based guitar music that sound like tropical-kitsch recordings from the mid-20th century drowning in soup. <i>Fratello Mare</i> is one such album: Cooper’s chosen instrument is a 1930s National Resophonic guitar that he has rigged with a series of effects pedals and loopers. He generates a slightly nauseous, shimmery river of sounds with it, fragments of pearly guitar notes that resemble Hawaiian slack-key guitar floating in a viscous solution filled with chattering incidental noises. On ""On Passing Bamboo"", there is the woody thunk of some mallet percussion, and in ""A House in Bali"" some pre-recorded wind chimes loop nightmarishly.</p>
<p>Cooper has a fascination with Pacific culture, with tropical kitsch and folk music (he is a devoted collector of Hawaiian shirts), and the chatter of birds fills the background of almost every piece here, as well as the cries of other animals, while his improvisatory guitar peals quietly. The energy coursing through these warped recordings is that of a strange, terrible dream you might have after a luau. There are field recordings scattered through the album that Cooper made himself on the islands across South East Asia and the Caribbean, and they surface in fragments, sometimes recognizable (the <i>riiip</i> of a motorcycle engine tooling away from us), often not. </p>
<p>Cooper’s music, in any of its forms, seems drunk on the intermingling of folk traditions, searching for a spot between them all that renders the strange familiar and vice versa. He is an improvisatory musician, one who generates his music in sheets, loops, and layers, and he seems to accrete these found-sound albums like a spider spins silk, or a vine grows pumpkins. They just appear, fattened and ripe, the fruits of his memories, travels, and idiosyncrasies.</p></div>"|20793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20793-fratello-mare/|6.9|Jayson Greene

You can sidestep hype and release a juiced-up approximation of your pre-album mixtapes, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> did this year on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/""><i>Barter 6</i></a>, a stunning but low-stakes offer that didn't seek new listeners so much as drag them in with sheer oddball magnetism. You can play ball with terrestrial radio, genuflecting to popular regional sounds and shopping for chart-topping guests with label money but also running the risk of losing sight of what made you intriguing in the first place. This is a well-trodden path littered with experiments too awkward to fly but too funded to fail, ill-remembered debut albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"">Wale</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"">Meek Mill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27692-bob/"">B.o.B</a>, and the like that it would take dedicated stylistic retrenchments to undo. Another strategy is to forsake fan and label expectations to charge full bore into something scary and new. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"">Vince Staples</a> and No I.D.'s anemic, apocalyptic dance party <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20719-summertime-06/""><i>Summertime '06</i></a> was a challenging, unexpected gear shift, jarring and immediate as shin splints.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Yung Rich Nation</i>, the debut album from Atlanta's Migos, toys with a few of these methodologies. Throughout, the group leverages a further push toward pop sounds initiated on last fall's <span><i>Rich Nigga Timeline</i><a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/30538/migos-rich-nigga-timeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></span>with the harder edged meat-and-potatoes street rap of last spring's <i>No Label 2</i>. But what's missing is a lot of the goofy spirit and momentum of 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18264-migos-yrn-young-rich-niggas/""><i>Young Rich Niggas</i></a>, which drilled the group into the national consciousness with the madcap <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjTVmv8p7vo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hannah Montana""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Versace""</a>. The first five songs on the new album establish a plodding brutality, thanks in large part to darkly cinematic production from the Honorable C.N.O.T.E.; the lyricism is sharp and the cadences more varied than usual, but grim early album autobiographical cuts like ""Migos Origin"" and ""Street Nigga Sacrifice"" will likely scare off a casual listener drawn to the group by a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsVnUpl2IKQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fight Night""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lNyCSeO3BM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Handsome and Wealthy""</a>. These are all solid album cuts, but laid out in a row at the top of the tracklist, they're uninviting.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album opens up around ""Highway 85"", a white-knuckle cop chase sequence on the interstate highway that runs from Virginia through the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama aided by a C.N.O.T.E. production mining the sparse, Moogy funk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a> hasn't made much since the second <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"">N.W.A.</a> album. Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff's tales of cruising out of run-ins with the law are gripping exercises in verse-length storytelling from a group whose lyrics tend to get absorbed line by outrageous line as humor. This classic gangsta rap sound is <i>Yung Rich Nation</i>'s most intriguing fit; ""85"", along with ""Gangsta Rap"" and ""Street Nigga Sacrifice"", serves up a poignant reminder that Southern rap and West Coast rap have commonalities that stretch back decades before <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a> hopped on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a> beats. They also prove that the Migos don't need a big ugly trap beat to get busy. (See also: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32988-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment/"">Social Experiment</a>'s ""Familiar"".)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Lead single ""One Time"" pops up in the middle of the album suggesting that </span><i>Yung Rich Nation </i><span>could've been sleek and mercenarily hooky if the group wanted, but then the Chris-Brown-by-numbers rap&amp;B collaboration ""Just for <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_1228505634""><span class=""aQJ"">Tonight</span></span>"" follows, illuminating what happens when an impressionable act courts spotlight too openly. The one is effortless and fun-loving; the other, labored and unnatural, like Migos guesting on someone else's album instead of the other way around. Neither one carries that feeling, which was so palpable on their early mixtape hits, that the Migos had arrived at radio thanks to a magical collusion of undeniable skill and personality. They feel like concessions.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-2b8431d6-e0a2-6b5d-8e2d-4f8bce56d72c""><i>Yung Rich Nation</i><span> avoids many pitfalls that render major label rap debuts forgettable or else regrettable but sacrifices a world of possible intrigue in sticking to its guns. It hints at weirder records it could've been but, in choosing the sampler platter over a more brash dish, ultimately comes across as safe. Peppering what seems to want to be a street album with quirky little singles that jut out perpendicularly from the rest of it makes for a record unsure of whether it should shirk commercialism or embrace it. In a time where we're keen on young Atlanta talent but casually disinterested at the first indication the hit parade's about to subside, there's not much room left for the Migos to keep figuring out how to present themselves in a mainstream field of play. The rhyme skills and lurid way with imagery that first brought the group to national attention remain on display throughout the album, but </span><i>YRN</i><span>'s warring agendas suggest a few more tries are in order for the Migos to get their formula sorted.</span></span></p></div>"|20843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20843-yung-rich-nation/|7.0|Craig Jenkins

(</i>The alternate title could be<i> When the Pawn Hits the Devo.) </i>The Coneheads are nothing if not self-aware. The Northwest Indiana punk trio actively resist the goofy mechanics of the music industry in 2015, cobbling together bits of late-'70s popular and unpopular culture to create their own hidden galaxy. Their first vinyl release is actually a comp of two 2014 mean, crude, and acutely hilarious tapes: <i>Canadian Cone</i> and <i>Total Conetrol</i>, the latter of which is curiously <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/sell/item/255950522"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">going for $200 on Discogs</a> now (hopefully just another outsized joke).</p>
<p class=""p1"">If those newfound close-ups of the most-distant Pluto had a cartoonish soundtrack, it could be Coneheads—this is some of the most extraterrestrial rock music around. (Referring to your audience as ""peoplepunks"" seems like calling fans ""earthlings."") Coneheads do steal from the art-rock of their Midwestern forebears—a previous band of theirs did <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUEE-ykdc5k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a hardcore cover of ""Mongoloid""</a>—but they<b> </b>mutate those robot sounds with a raw, rare grasp of punk history and a breakneck sense of pacing. It sometimes sounds like a four-track has been set up inside of a cardboard box with three people playing three different songs, including unlikely nuggets such as ""I Used to Be a Cheesepuff"", the tale of a guy who ""[goes] to school in studs and leather."" Just as you think a minute-long track has run its course, a demented riff will jump back in for the final three seconds. Though skilled players, they use their instruments in a way you might if you'd just landed on Earth and never held one before—so while Coneheads may ""rip off Devo,"" per the title, their weirdness seems more spirtually akin to, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3751-shaggs/"">the Shaggs</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When he sings, vocalist/bassist Mark Winter actually sounds like a Conehead, his voice flat and nasal, with words spit so fast as to make the listening process a delightfully obnoxious blur. But Winter's words are pissed as hell, brimming with disdain for authority, the ""chumps"" of the outside world, and himself. On the angry 67-second blast ""Violence"", he smugly references the ""pathetic human race"" alongside a thick, rubbery, rocketspeed bassline (a mere 10 seconds is reserved at the end for a guitar solo). ""Hack Hack Hack"", a song literally about taking an axe to your enemy, appears in two versions—one of which is a creeping minimal synth rendition—because why not? The best tune here must be ""Big City Baby"", clocking in at 41 seconds, a middle-finger to the bourgeois faux-intellects of major cities: ""I got a big city baby, she's just like me/ We both listen to the Smiths, ain't that interesting?"" But cities are not restricted to geography in 2015; earlier he snarls a warning at his critics, ""You don't even know who the fuck I am/ You and your Internet snooping can burn in hell."" (True to form, they make fun of Pitchfork on the album sleeve.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Make no mistake, Coneheads <i>despise</i> big cities. For a band that clearly takes the ethos of ""what we do is secret"" to heart, the closer ""Way Things Am"" is an anti-mission statement: ""I like the way things am/ I can stay with any luck/ An uninteresting jaded fuck... When it comes to all good things/ I'm the sole authority/ So shove it."" The band steam-rolls through a genius, hyper-compressed cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a>' ""Psycho Killer""; while David Byrne is busy shaking his fist at a cloud because New York has changed, Coneheads are laughing all over his song. If Kurt Cobain could hear Coneheads' recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAq-bURP5c8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of ""In Bloom""—rudimentary and unrecognizable—he might cry tears of joy at their terrible racket.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It behooves us to remember that <i>Coneheads</i>—with its premise of clowny aliens stranded on Earth—<a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/4187"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">started as an ""SNL"" skit in 1977</a>, just as punk was taking shape, and the reference hangs over this analog outsider music like a gravitational pull towards that era. Coneheads, however, are the center of their own tiny local scene alongside Big Zit, CCTV, and Liquids, as documented on their own compilations: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Eq3a3knG9Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cool Bands</i></a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kWr2GSMYI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cool Bands 2</i></a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWUfIS49WoY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cool Bands 3</i></a>. This crew has ties to Chicago hardcore, but Coneheads' alien approach and bizarro time signatures remind me of late Vermont synth-pop freaks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30550-blanche-blanche-blanche/"">Blanche Blanche Blanche</a> more than anything going on in hardcore. Their cult and deliberate enigma are palpable: they included ""I Am a Coneheads Fan"" bumper stickers with the album, and they share phone numbers on their releases that you can text to inquire about new material, or whatever. (This spring, to learn more, I tapped out a text message to one of the numbers, found inside a Liquids tape, but it felt more like dropping a letter into a well or unleashing a carrier pigeon.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Since the release of these two endearingly peculiar cassettes, Coneheads have been subject to the nebulous and perennial cycle that is ""punk hype""—an odd elixir of divisive chatter on blogs, message boards, and word of mouth that can go far in 2015—but not without good reason. It's true, for instance, that Coneheads turned down an opportunity to work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a>'s Third Man Records. And Coneheads' appeal is not dissimilar to the stranger side of a New York band that recently worked with the label: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>. This album has been ""released"" in the most minimal sense imaginable—it first surfaced earlier this year from small German label <a href=""http://erstetheketontraeger.blogspot.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erste Theke Tontraeger</a>, also responsible for a collection last year by Coneheads comrades Lumpy and the Dumpers, and is now, apparently, fleetingly available stateside from the band at shows, but who knows. They do not sound like they want to be found.</p></div>"|20701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20701-lp1-aka-14-year-old-high-school-pc-fascist-hype-lords/|7.7|Jenn Pelly

But it played host to a unique performance this past June, one that closed the week-long <a href=""http://www.kingstonontheedge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kingston on the Edge</a> art festival. Bandleader and legendary reggae artist Earl ""Chinna"" Smith, alongside more than a dozen singers, drummers, members of the Jamaican Philharmonic, and a local opera singer, made up the ""Binghistra"", providing a combination of Rastafari nyabinghi drumming and classical music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This concert was hardly the first time the historic Ward had showcased the nyabinghi style. The 4/4 shuffle of its rhythm, which stems from three specific drum sounds (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akete"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">akete</a>, funde, and bass) was first heard in the theatre back in the 1950s, when bandleader Count Ossie, hailing from a Rastafari camp in the hills of East Kingston, was first invited to perform as part of a Christmas variety show. <i>Rastafari: The Dreads Enter Babylon 1955-83</i>, <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a>'s most recent in a line of high-quality compilations, provides a window into Kingston's past, acting as a soundtrack to this narrative that reaches back to Count Ossie's first and subsequent performances at the legendary Ward to draw a line directly from Rastafari to the rise of reggae as an internationally recognized type of music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is nyabinghi drumming that provides the foundation for reggae, and Soul Jazz makes this argument explicit by kicking off the compilation with Count Ossie and the Rasta Family's ""Africa We Want Fe Go"", taking the traditional Rastafari nyabinghi chant and drumming and adding electrified reggae bass. This sets the tone for all selections: to demonstrate that link between the spirituality of Rastafari and the development of the unique sound of Jamaican music. Reggae may have developed into genres other than Rastafari music, as any listener to dancehall or lovers' rock reggae can attest, but none of these types of music would exist if it weren't for those origins in Rastafari.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cementing this fact, a quarter of the tracks feature Count Ossie alongside various drummers and musicians. Tracks with the Mystic Revelation of Rastafari and the Rasta Family provide more traditional approaches, with the ""Tales of Mozambique"" and ""Narration"" pairing historical recounting with rich, percussive background. Organist Leslie Butler and vibraphonist Ronald Downer accompany Count Ossie's drum group on two separate tracks that place soulful reggae and jazz sounds alongside the Rastafari rhythms. These were both produced in the early 1960s by Sonia Pottinger, who went on to become a successful reggae hitmaker throughout the 1970s, producing classics such as Ken Boothe's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLk4avoM-mI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lady with the Starlight""</a> and the Melodians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyy3oXnLckk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Swing and Dine""</a>. Further focusing on the importance of the drum, the compilation contains two tracks with Bongo Herman, a man whose name reveals exactly the talent for which he is known. The bongo complements snippets of harmonized chorus and praises to Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The telltale layered drums of nyabinghi are deceptively simple, with their foundational bass hitting on the 1 and 3, but there are improvisational opportunities everywhere, from the creativity of the akete</span><span> player to the endless variety of chants and songs, spoken word and harmonizations, that can all find accompaniment. And this compilation is full of this rhythmic storytelling, reaching back to the roots of African drumming while demonstrating the innovations of Rastafari.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The mid-'50s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NWpJZ0t48k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mento</a>-sounding ""Ethiopia"" of Lord Lebby and the Jamaican Calypsonians pairs banjo and bongo bounce with lyrics about the centrality of the East African nation to Rastafari belief. Though there are about 10 years between the late-'60s ska of ""Haile Selassie"" by Laurel Aitken and the 1970s roots reggae ""His Imperial Majesty"" by Rod Taylor, both point to the importance of Ethiopia's last Emperor to the Rastafari movement. ""Hail the Words of Jah"" is a hagiography of Haile Selassie presented in soothing falsetto by Congos member Ashanti Roy and an early drum-accompanied Mutabaruka poem, ""Say"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The interesting addition of the youthful voices found on child star QQ's ""Betta Must Come"", raises some questions about the time range of the title, given that it was recorded in 2005. But it demonstrates how the nyabinghi sound extends into a new generation. The inclusion begs the question of other pertinent additions: Recent reggae revivalists like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoHzqwLxk_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chronixx</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmux6zIUko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kabaka Pyramid</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge1KbMB2RrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jah9</a>, to name but a few, have also kept the sound current. There are artists who gained fame in the 1990s and have claimed affiliation to the Rastafari movement, such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqYankgih54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buju Banton</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JvsImWF8-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Capleton</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xy27Z6bf6U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sizzla</a>—all who make use of Rastafari rhythms as well as themes. Their absence feels like a missed opportunity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>However, the 40-page-plus accompanying booklet touches on the music post-1983, suggesting that this might be part one of a series of compilations—given the power of the music, </span><span>one can only hope. The extent of the information provided in the liner notes is as good as can be when the goal is to encapsulate over a century of spiritual, socio-economic, and cultural history, not just of Rastafari, but of both colonial and independent Jamaica and Jamaican music as well. Yes, it's a reasonable introduction, but it might have been an idea to point to some of the many, many additional sources on Rastafari. This would reflect the reality that Rastafari, much like the music of this compilation, is dynamic and varied, consistently resisting any efforts to pigeonhole.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And although the tracklisting jumps around a little between decades, making it difficult to get a sense of chronology, it's clear that Rastafari consciousness has found its way into just about every type of Jamaican music, from drum compositions to calypso, mento, ska, reggae, and beyond. As the title says, ""the dreads enter Babylon""—and they leave no stone (or style) unturned.</span></p></div>"|20777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20777-rastafari-the-dreads-enter-babylon-1955-83/|7.5|Erin MacLeod

Instead, over 10 highly individualized tracks, the band veers across a diverse  spectrum, mixing the avant-garde with the melodic. In some ways, <i>Pain</i> can be considered a 30-minute history lesson of the last 40 years of proto-punk, punk, and alternative rock music.</p>
<p>Despite their relatively low profile, Deaf Wish have been recording and performing music for eight years and seem to have a handle on where their individual strengths lie. As a group, their approach to making music comes off as defiantly democratic, with each member given the opportunity to take hold of the microphone and exert their own measure of control. Considering this approach, it’s amazing how effectively they bring the varying tones and textures together.</p>
<p>On the opener, ""The Whip"", guitarist Jensen Tjhung steps up with a voice that sounds strikingly similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a>. He guides the band through the plodding funeral procession: over time it builds from a simple two-note riff and multi-layered vocal combination to a full-on hurricane with crashing cymbals and frenetic guitar scratchings fighting against each other to break out into the forefront. (Speaking of Iggy Pop, ""The Whip"" sounds like it has a fair amount of the song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wIuwzOK-EU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Will Fall""</a>, from the Stooges' 1969 self-titled debut, mixed into its DNA.)</p>
<p>The pace then accelerates with a one-two follow up of punk rock in the form of ""Newness Again"" and ""They Know"". There isn’t that much differentiation between the two songs. Both are played at warp speed and carry a heavy dose of manic anti-solo guitar parts threaded underneath; however, on the first, bassist Nick Pratt spits out vocal lines with a rapid, Johnny Rotten-esque fierceness, while on the latter, guitarist Sarah Hardiman moves the feeling into an opposite direction by bringing a degree of harmony and melody to the tornado of notes. It’s probably the definitive example on <i>Pain</i> of Deaf Wish’s built-in capability to alter the sound and feel of their music with a simple personnel swap.</p>
<p>That’s essentially the playbook for most of the album, with Pratt delivering hypersonic old-school punk rock like on the title track, a song that bears a striking resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">the Replacements</a>’ classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTB5jpDViaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We’re Coming Out""</a>, Hardiman adding a measure of airiness like on the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>-reminiscent ""Sex Witch"". Tjhung ties both ends together with a subversive, sneering pop affectation.</p>
<p>The formula holds out until you reach the penultimate track, ""Dead Air"", which is introduced by Hardiman with the disaffected line ""In my heart there is only blood"" before the band rages into a six-minute wall of guitar feedback and distortion. It’s an inferno of twisted sounds and whammy bar dive bombs cascading over plodding, melodic bass chord changes with no let up. There’s an urge to skip through it to get to the more traditionally framed album closer, ""Calypso"", but there’s something indefinably enigmatic about the intense soundscape that makes you weather the assault.</p>
<p>It’s evident that Deaf Wish can adopt just about any sound or style that they want to, and that’s what they seemingly tried to do on <i>Pain</i>. For many other bands, that approach could muddy the waters or create a convoluted listening experience, but this doesn’t happen here. They choose to be themselves—each one of them—and it works.</p></div>"|20804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20804-pain/|7.6|Corbin Reiff

The folk singer, who died in 2011, often wrestled with the torment of young lovers and restless souls in his lyrics, but those worries came in near-perfect packages, in which the blues and intercontinental folk, jazz, and pop moved together with riverine fluidity. When a New Weird America contingent<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57270/jansch-gets-a-lift-from-orton-banhart-on-new-cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> led by Devendra Banhart and Noah Georgeson worked to revive his career with the <i>The Black Swan </i>LP in 2006</a>, it made sense; he and his band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"">Pentangle</a>, were godheads for pockets of that scene. It was, however, an odd fit, since Jansch, even as the young man who had made <i>Birthday</i> <i>Blues</i> or <i>It Don’t Bother Me</i> 40 years earlier, never seemed one for letting loose and getting wild. There was very little freak in his folk.</p>
<p><i>Live at the 12 Bar</i>—a 16-song set from 1996 that <a href=""http://www.earthrecordings.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earth Recordings</a> has resurrected for the launch of an extensive series of Jansch reissues—is not some unbridled onstage affair. An intimate solo show, Jansch plays without much pause for about an hour, laughing at himself when he doesn’t leave the stage ahead of the encore. The sound of his amplified acoustic guitar is thin and modest, and his voice ranges from furtive murmur to broad-shouldered bellow. He speaks softly to the audience, and he doesn’t indulge in the great between-song yarns endemic to such releases.</p>
<p>You do, though, get a sense of Jansch’s modest personality, wry wit, and self-effacing charm. He momentarily forgets song titles and awkwardly stumbles through a birthday greeting for a gleeful audience after his definitive take on ""Blackwaterside"". He flubs or altogether drops some notes in the turnarounds of the gorgeous aubade, ""Morning Brings Peace of Mind"", and he strums hard enough during the protest number ""Let Me Sing"" to break the reverie his music inspires. For such an on-the-record perfectionist, Jansch sounds humble and approachable during <i>Live at the 12 Bar</i>. On this ""authorized bootleg,"" a fan favorite for years, he lets the imperfections stand. The errors give his precise work a newly human touch, spotlighting the deep folk origins of his tender tunes.</p>
<p>There are nearly a dozen live releases crammed into Jansch’s catalogue. <i>Live at the 12 Bar</i> stands out in part for the sweep of its songs, a range that reflects the roots of his work and how much he was able to grow within its traditions. He moves from the impetuous opener of his 1965 debut, ""Strolling Down the Highway"", to ""Walk Quietly By"", the beautiful and bothered beginning of <i>When the Circus Comes to Town</i>,<i> </i>the album he released not long before this show. He saunters and pleas through <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwJXav5Y9Qw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American R&amp;B (""Come Back Baby"") </a>and stands at the threshold of loneliness and love for an endearing turn on the Irish standard, ""Curragh of Kildare"". He picks gracefully through the transcontinental standard ""The Lily of the West"", and he seems to smile through the blues of ""Trouble in Mind"".</p>
<p>Four years after his death, Jansch’s legacy often revolves around his guitar playing. Frequently presented as an other-side-of-the-Atlantic foil to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>, Jansch is the less deliberate of the two. Where it felt like Fahey was often pulling notes from his instrument, Jansch’s skill seemed to be holding their flow back long enough to articulate their shape. But this career-spanning set from a late London club known as an incubator for great songwriters is a welcome reminder of his skills in that regard, too. He plunges into romantic neuroticism for ""A Woman Like You"" and moves between sensuality and sensitivity for ""Fresh as a Sweet Sunday Morning"". In turn, he gets mad, sad, and nostalgic, feelings he communicates as capably with his underrated voice as he does with his fingers and strings. No, <i>Live at the 12 Bar</i>, unlike much of Jansch’s catalogue, isn’t perfect. You hear mistakes, clumsy knocks at the microphone stand, and even his breath as he plays. But mostly, you hear this master traversing a musical map of his life, hard times and all. </p></div>"|20716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20716-live-at-the-12-bar/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

Three years ago, they set out on a mammoth mission to recruit their friends, contemporaries and tour-mates and forge The One Punk Album To Rule Them All. Of <i>course</i> Dave Grohl signed up; from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28149-them-crooked-vultures/"">Them Crooked Vultures</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17810-dave-grohl-sound-city-ost/"">Sound City Players</a>, the Foos frontman's got a veritable addiction to side projects. Jello Biafra, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30184-lamb-of-god/"">Lamb of God</a>'s Randy Blythe, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s Nick Oliveri, Slipknot's Corey Taylor: the roster might as well be metal's answer to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masked_Marauders"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Masked Marauders</i></a>, except the Teenage Time Killers are entirely real, and unfortunately, wholly underwhelming.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Over 20 individual vocalists scream, sing, bark (and in Biafra's case, ramble about Sean Hannity) on <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 </i>backed by various guest musicians; Grohl takes on bass duty on over half the tracks, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24732-goatsnake/"">Goatsnake</a> guitarist Greg Anderson plugging in for similarly long stretches. Listening to the humdrum backbeats of ""Ignorant People"" and ""Plank Walk"", you'd have difficulty picking these two out of a lineup. This vagueness carries over into the album's instrumentation as a whole, with some exceptions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/276-bad-religion/"">Bad Religion</a> guitarist Brian Baker brings some timeless So-Cal punk to ""Barrio"", an album highlight featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/53-alkaline-trio/"">Alkaline Trio</a>'s Matt Skiba that's practically written for top-down summer drives, and the thrashy, ever-so-sludgy fretwork on ""Ignorant People"" instantly belies the involvement of Anderson.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And so proceeds <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 1</i>, not so much a punk album as it is a pageant. One minute, Clifford Dinsmore is staging a tepid, one-man <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_(American_band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BL'AST!</a> reunion on ""Power Outage""; the next, Jello Biafra is stumbling onstage to deliver a minute-and-a-half ""Ode to Sean Hannity"" (yes, dude, we know Fox is evil). The LP's second half is a doldrum of reheated hardcore (""Big Money"", featuring Fear's Lee Ving) and second-rate sludge (""Your Empty Soul"", with a grumbled lead from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26973-red-fang/"">Red Fang</a> vocalist Aaron Beam). When the self-titled closer, a TV theme song of sorts, barrels in to whisk the entire thing away, it feels like a last gasp rather than a final hurrah.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mullin et al had the chance to make something truly epic—who wouldn't want to hear a heavy-as-fuck response to ""We Are the World"" from dozens of metal's finest? Instead, the 20-track album plays out like a more dudely version of that <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbhxuu_rock-of-love-superfan-challenge_shortfilms"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rock of Love"" episode</a> where contestants have 30 minutes to bang out a killer tune for Bret Michaels' amusement. Rather than build off each other's styles and arrive at a cumulative, comprehensive sound, <i>Teenage Time Killers</i>' revolving cast have conflated quantity with quality, resulting in a pedestrian product that, at best, offers a decent soundtrack to throwing back beers at Punk Rock Bowling.</p></div>"|20835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20835-greatest-hits-vol-1/|4.0|Zoe Camp

His precise lyrics and fluid rap style reflect the studious flows and manic personalities of hip-hop in the late 1990s—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5204-redman/"">Redman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"">Busta Rhymes</a>, or Rawkus-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>. Had his debut album emerged in those years, he might have become a larger-than-life star. As it stands now, he is more living anachronism than <i>Living Legend</i>. The MMG rapper's Def Jam debut is being released four years after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqWMfzY6nZk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rollin""</a> first sparked his street buzz nationally. Anyone expecting a classic in the vein of <i>Muddy Waters</i> will leave disappointed; for a charismatic rapper with a bombastic presence, his official debut feels slighter than it should, less a late '90s renaissance than a fading reminder.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Living Legend</i> isn't bad, exactly. It's a consistent release with no substantial misfires, full of densely packed verbiage and grand gestures, reminiscent of a time when technique, style, and personality seemed inseparable, interrelated qualities in a rapper's arsenal. The best songs have a profundity that transcends the packaging around them: the wistful Miami sunset of ""Just Won't Do"" recalls his earlier career highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuY5h1tTko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bible on the Dash""</a>, its opening lines mirroring that song's most famous couplet (""I asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to heaven…?"") before shifting into a spare narrative that sketches the hard-earned wisdom of a damaged man onto a twilight canvas. The recklessness of his public image—and sometimes, his real public behavior—belies, even magnifies, the earnest reflection that illuminates moments like these.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He recaptures this potency only occasionally. Closer ""Dark Dayz"" comes closest, with no wasted lines and artful, writerly composition that suggests simultaneous moods of pride and torment: ""Happy-face sticker on the brick, still feeling miserable."" Images pop, as he shifts effortlessly from the visual to the abstract, an interconnected web of ideas that suggests the craft of a detail-obsessed aficionado. As a writer, Gunplay is one of the best in rap, when he wants to be. And he's not limited to ""deep thoughts""-type records; on more brolic cuts, like ""White Bitch"", his lyrics are vividly original: ""Skinny as pasta with a big ol' mossberg/ Squares in my trunk and white all in my nostrils.""  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's midsection sags under its relative banality: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> feature ""Be Like Me"" sounds like a generic version of records Ross has been releasing over the past four or so years. And ""Chain Smokin'"" wastes a clever hook with a song that feels like a kush coma for more than three minutes, a must-fast-forward dead zone until Gunplay's verse. Lead single ""Wuzhanindoe"" is solid, but also dated, a cutting-room-floor version of guest rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>'s spring 2014 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/""><i>My Krazy Life</i></a>. It also draws attention to the relative disparity in quality between the two artists' album statements. By any standard, Gunplay is the superior talent: bar-for-bar, emotional resonance, depth of feeling. But while his lyrics fill the page with evocative, fully-rendered ideas, his album feels like a half-step; YG's revitalization of '90s West Coast tropes, meanwhile, found the rapper exceeding his limitations song after song.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e217a72e-d682-d789-b2b1-095bbf1843b1"">And that's Gunplay's major weakness: his art is focused on some powerful particulars at the expense of the whole. Perhaps, as a 36-year-old rapper who's lived quite a life—most of it, in fact—outside the studio, it's unfair to expect more. The distance between his standout records—""Rollin"", <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXfXJsNlyT4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jump Out""</a>, ""Bible on the Dash""—and the average Gunplay song is considerable. Concept-driven cuts like ""Tell 'Em"" and ""White Bitch"" are lyrically strong, but are easily forgotten once the album has receded. The pathos of his unrealized potential deepens the colors of his best work, hinting at artistic depth that remains out of our sight.<br/></span></p></div>"|20807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20807-living-legend/|6.5|David Drake

Her debut effort with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"">Junior Boys</a>' Jeremy Greenspan was a well-produced, confident effort that nonetheless was at times a bit too restrained, if only because Lanza's vocal power was otherwise so apparent in the few instances in which it was allowed to shine through. Those hints seemed to suggest there would be more of her in future efforts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On Lanza’s new EP, <i>You Never Show Your Love</i>, on UK-based label <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub</a>, you can hear those same glimmers of promise. Lanza’s voice on the EP’s title track is light and smooth, floating over the languid beat in a way that almost brings to mind a sunnier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a>. The EP was produced by <a href=""http://www.teklife57.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teklife</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32321-dj-spinn/"">DJ Spinn</a> and Taso, and the beats are pure footwork. While the title track is more of a slow jam, the beat slowly orbiting Lanza’s vocal, the rework, featuring founding Teklife member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>’s beats used posthumously, is up-tempo and glitchy, contrasting with Lanza’s floating vocal to great effect. This chameleon-like quality is one of Lanza’s signatures—her vocals are versatile, and tend to melt into a mix rather than overpowering it. This is a commendable skill, especially in a house singer, but there are many moments when you wish the music would be more about her, and less about the beat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the EP is atmospheric, it does nothing to separate Lanza from the scene that has grown up around her. Her vocals skew more purely house than <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31651-banks/"">Banks</a>, but she lacks their same showmanship or melodrama, and it's difficult to imagine the niche she would fill. <i>You Never Show Your Love</i> is a small sampling of the Canadian vocalist's work, however, and her choice in producers speaks volumes to her curatorial vision. If That Voice were to assume a place in the forefront of the engaging, boundary-pushing beats she picks for herself, she could sound larger than life.</p></div>"|20848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20848-you-never-show-your-love-ep/|6.2|Maud Deitch

Soon followed a parade of artists with names like Rocha, Efeel, the Sonic Aesthetic, Bepu N’Gali, Parada 88, Boys From Patagonia, and Young Gentlemen’s Adventure Society, each treading the squishy ground between downtempo and nu-disco, favoring the sorts of sounds that Europeans on holiday would recognize as ""Balearic."" A few years on, the imprint up and relocated to the island of Ibiza and soon after, most of these works were revealed to be the work of labelhead Mark Barrott, who went with his own name for last year’s breezy <i>Sketches From An Island</i>, which compiled two earlier EPs.</p>
<p>Recently, Barrott announced the release of the third installment of his <i>Sketches From An Island</i> series via <a href=""http://sketchesfromanisland.com/drip-a-new-way-of-doing-things/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Drip subscription service</a>, explaining the digital fan club thus: ""For me, my ‘moments of joy’ come from making music in a studio and then attempting to reach out with that music and communicate with like minded souls to form a connection."" The four-song EP, which is now getting a physical release via International Feel, continues along the same trajectory as the previous album, to the point where the library funk of opener ""Right 4 Me"" brings to mind <i>SFAI</i>’s opener <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz44DkW7uxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby Come Home""</a>, right down to the melody being conveyed via a flute plug-in. Charming as the ditty is, it feels like a retread.</p>
<p>Titlewise, ""The Mysterious Island of Dr. Nimm"" scans as a sequel to the prior album track ""Dr Nimm's Garden of Intrigue &amp; Delight"".

Soon followed a parade of artists with names like Rocha, Efeel, the Sonic Aesthetic, Bepu N’Gali, Parada 88, Boys From Patagonia, and Young Gentlemen’s Adventure Society, each treading the squishy ground between downtempo and nu-disco, favoring the sorts of sounds that Europeans on holiday would recognize as ""Balearic."" A few years on, the imprint up and relocated to the island of Ibiza and soon after, most of these works were revealed to be the work of labelhead Mark Barrott, who went with his own name for last year’s breezy <i>Sketches From An Island</i>, which compiled two earlier EPs.</p>
<p>Recently, Barrott announced the release of the third installment of his <i>Sketches From An Island</i> series via <a href=""http://sketchesfromanisland.com/drip-a-new-way-of-doing-things/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Drip subscription service</a>, explaining the digital fan club thus: ""For me, my ‘moments of joy’ come from making music in a studio and then attempting to reach out with that music and communicate with like minded souls to form a connection."" The four-song EP, which is now getting a physical release via International Feel, continues along the same trajectory as the previous album, to the point where the library funk of opener ""Right 4 Me"" brings to mind <i>SFAI</i>’s opener <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz44DkW7uxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby Come Home""</a>, right down to the melody being conveyed via a flute plug-in. Charming as the ditty is, it feels like a retread.</p>
<p>Titlewise, ""The Mysterious Island of Dr. Nimm"" scans as a sequel to the prior album track ""Dr Nimm's Garden of Intrigue &amp; Delight"". But while the latter is taken at a leisurely pace, this EP track features darker bass and layers of clattering percussion, bamboo flutes, chimes, and bird calls, reminiscent of jungle foliage.

His music is unvarnished and thick with distortion; most tracks feature a single drum machine and a synthesizer or two, and they swim in line noise and tape compression. But that gritty affect is a means, not an end. He can be bruising, as on the recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y0lO7qdEbA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Discotag""</a>, where he flips vintage rap samples and petulant bass buzz into a contemporary take on hip-house, and tender, as on last year's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5Fs8sppHiY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feelin""</a>, with its melancholy hook, ""I can't stop this feeling."" He can be eerie: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqarAKhMNuA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bridge""</a>, from a recent <a href=""http://wtrecords.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WT Records</a> release, pairs wind chimes with a thudding kick drum in a way that suggests a record left skipping its run-out groove long after all the people have gone home. And he can be unrelenting: On last year's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyftDWoYrUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Head""</a>, the steady rattle of a fire-alarm bell rings for minutes at a time—mixed, to deliriously dissonant effect, with the whine of rubbed wineglass rims.</p>
<p>Until now, Kupfer has recorded mostly for labels like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a>, <a href=""http://www.rushhour.nl/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rush Hour</a>'s No 'Label' offshoot, and Willie Burns' WT Records—a small circle of likeminded peers who share his suspicion of the shinier, happier aspects of mainstream dance music. His <i>Explora </i>EP appears on Technicolour, the house- and techno-oriented singles label under electronic heavyweight <a href=""http://ninjatune.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Tune</a>, but he keeps his cards as close to his chest as ever. In fact, it's probably the heaviest, most brain-bending thing he's done yet.</p>
<p>""Explora (Slave)"" sets the record's abject tone with an invitation that quickly turns menacing. ""Explore your fantasy,"" coos a sensual voice, but it dissolves into a cyborg's growl; tri-tone synth stabs drip like the stalactites of a sex dungeon. It's slow to get going: two-and-a-half minutes pass before the beat drops in earnest, and once it does, all that introductory tension is channeled into shuddering machine rhythms and scissor-handed hi-hats. Flecked with acid and analog to the bone, it's reminiscent of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZCmt38liQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bam Bam's ""Where's Your Child""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n1W9Ort3Os"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phuture's ""Your Only Friend""</a>, and other '80s Chicago house cuts where pitched-down voices and bad vibes ruled the dancefloor. But its sleazy, sinister energies are a walk in the park compared to the beaten-down resignation of the next track, ""Headpiece"". This one shuffles along at a dirge-like 57 beats per minute, and its listless drum track might as well be a screen door swinging on its hinges in heavy weather. The opening notes, bulbous and blown out, sound a little bit like the electric bass melody of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djr7fp_JxgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swans' ""In My Garden""</a>—surely a coincidence, but the comparison feels appropriate, if only because industrial music's blasted affect plays such a key role in Kupfer's music; he's as much a student of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_Trax!_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wax Trax</a> as he is of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trax_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trax</a>. The real magic is in the way it builds over the course of its long, exhausted haul, distortion and dub delay and the EQs all flickering unsteadily, soaking up the unmistakable energy of the live-in-one-take jam.</p>
<p>""Brute Force"" is the slightest of the EP's four tracks, to the extent that it sounds a little bit tossed off; it's a monotone eighth-note synth chug set against muted kicks and a ragged open hi-hat. (It does sound a little bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32510-barnt/"">Barnt</a>'s ultra-stripped-back jams, but it lacks their gonzo energy, having neither dynamics nor development.) But he makes up for it with ""Shpel"", the EP's final cut. It's the record's most bare-bones track, but also its most engrossing. Here's where he really gives into his industrial leanings, wreathing sumptuous wooden thumps in pitched-down shrieks and gravelly voices slowed to the point of unintelligibility. This one goes on for nearly 12 minutes, and while nothing ever really happens, it doesn't need to; for fans of atmospheric dread, its whiff of freezer burn is plenty exquisite. This one isn't even obviously analog in nature; any number of techniques might be responsible for its resonant central tone. But the track takes away an important lesson from Kupfer's lo-fi studies: sometimes, learning to do without is the best way to find your focus.</p></div>"|20860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20860-explora-ep/|6.5|Philip Sherburne

From 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/""><i>First Impressions of Earth</i></a> onward, they’ve sounded like a band constantly second-guessing itself—one that knows it has to evolve beyond a signature sound, but unwilling to commit to a direction. That erratic behavior has extended to frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7320-julian-casablancas/"">Julian Casablancas</a>’ sideline pursuits, whether it as a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uQMwRMHcs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk-approved</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_h5DMHh5_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">synth-pop singer</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19856-julian-casablancas-the-voidz-tyranny/"">polarizing prog-punk provocateur</a>. But the solo career of guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. has emerged as a beaming ray of light poking through these turbulent skies—as his main band sounds more confused with each new album, his own songwriting has turned more precise and concise.<br><br>That said, the refinement in Hammond’s work is less a reaction to the Strokes than the result of significant changes in his personal life. In contrast to the art-pop aspirations that fuelled his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9509-yours-to-keep/"">first</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11989-como-te-llama/"">two</a> solo albums, Hammond’s 2013 EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18600-albert-hammond-jr-ahj-ep/""><i>AHJ</i></a>, was a slight, scrappy four-song affair. But it bore the weight of considerable baggage: he spent much of the record’s press cycle coming clean about going clean, kicking a prolonged addiction to cocaine, heroin, and ketamine he claimed was draining him of $2,000 a week. If <i>AHJ</i> was a tentative toe-dip back into solo recording, <i>Momentary Masters</i> is a confident full-body dive.</br></br></p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the new album isn’t afraid to draw comparisons to Hammond’s day job; rather than try to establish an identity separate from the Strokes, it reasserts the carefree charm and hooky immediacy that’s gotten lost amid the band’s latter-day experimentation. And unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15230-angles/""><i>Angles</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/""><i>Comedown Machine</i></a>, <i>Momentary Masters</i> manages to inject a little funk and finesse into the Strokes’ wiry rock schematic without forcing the issue, interlocking Hammond’s signature, spidery fills with ""Tetris""-tight rhythms that will have you double-checking the liner notes to see if Nikolai Fraiture and Fabrizio Moretti were recruited for the record. (They were not—that’s <i>AHJ</i>-era touring bassist Jordan Brooks and drummer Jeremy Gustin doing the yeoman’s work.)</p>
<p>For an album reportedly inspired by Carl Sagan, the 10-song, 36-minute <i>Momentary Masters</i> is remarkably lean and focused. The title refers to the famed astronomer’s description of our infinitesimal standing in the universe at large; it could also scan as a comment on the Strokes’ own experience as one-time hype magnets, and the struggle to stay relevant after the spotlight points somewhere else. ""Sometimes, the sun goes behind the clouds/ You’ll forget the warmth that could be found,"" he laments on the opening ""Born Slippy""—not a cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFrCbQGyvM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Underworld classic</a>, but perhaps an oblique, cautionary evocation of that track’s hedonistic <i>Trainspotting</i> associations. If the song draws from the same well of influences as the Strokes—the chorus is even underpinned by a rewrite of the ""Marquee Moon"" riff—Hammond forsakes Casablancas’ disaffected cool for a down-to-earth humility befitting of a former next big thing, and the seize-the-day urgency of a recovering addict who no longer takes anything for granted. And just when you think you’ve got a handle on the song’s A/B structure, Hammond introduces subtle but substantial changes—a pointillist guitar-solo breakdown, new variations on the chorus melody—that transform the song’s scale from modest to majestic.</p>
<p>At the outset, <i>Momentary Masters</i> suggests a parallel history for the Strokes if they had signed to <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> instead of <a href=""http://www.rca.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RCA</a>, with the louche groove and synthesized disco strings of ""Power Hungry"" bridging the early-2000s divide between L.E.S. rock dives and Williamsburg warehouse parties. The album even boasts a spiritual successor to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Losing My Edge""</a> in ""Losing Touch"", though, buoyed by the song’s spirited new-wave sprint and towering chorus, Hammond sounds happy to be leaving hipsterdom behind. That sentiment is reinforced in more plaintive fashion on a drum-machined cover of Bob Dylan’s ""Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright"", which initially seems like an outlier on the album, but proves to be its thematic centerpiece. Embracing the song’s don’t-look-back sentiment, Hammond blazes through <i>Momentary Masters</i>’ breathless second half with a series of direct-hit power-pop pick-me-ups that channels the guttersnipe grittiness of vintage Strokes—from the double-timed ""Modern Age"" stomp of ""Razors Edge"" to the ""I Can’t Win"" echoes of ""Side Boob""—but with a tuneful flamboyance that reminds you Hammond is the biggest Guided by Voices fan in the group. (And, no doubt, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"">Bob Pollard</a> would approve of a nonsensically evocative title like ""Drunched in Crumbs"".) ""Now that we’re not perfect, we have to be good,"" Hammond sings on ""Touché"", like someone who’s being extra-careful to not squander their second lease on life, but who’s liberated from the pressures and anxieties that drive one to bad habits in the first place. As the song’s taut rhythmic drive loosens into a gloriously goofy chicken-scratched guitar solo, Hammond reinforces the notion that, while rock'n'roll may be the gateway to a lifetime of vice, it can also be the most effective form of rehab.</p></div>"|20847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20847-momentary-masters/|7.3|Stuart Berman

They spring to mind as soon as the first notes slip out, and the music reaches the same core of beatific sadness. But it gets there in its own way. After all, Budd played live on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror</i></a> and <i>The Pearl</i>, filling metronomic piano lines with human presence, while Basinski doesn’t play a note on <i>Cascade</i>. The tape-loop-and-delay technique that produced it is more akin to Eno’s on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i></a>, though again, Basinski does it his way. Instead of a plush, pristine sound full of regal pauses, he unleashes a continuous scrawl of murk. This is but one of the things you think about while listening to the same Basinski piano loop for a very long time.</p>
<p><i>Cascade</i> is very simple. A high minor arpeggio darts purposefully forward and then turns into a scatter of reflections as a midrange note tolls a few times in answer, followed by a distantly trumpeting howl. It lasts for a matter of seconds and then repeats—surge, collapse, glide—for 40 minutes, followed by a brief coda of Arvo Pärt-like sacred stillness. There is little sound in the low range, so the whole structure seems to hang over an abyss. With no variation at the macro level, the music shouldn’t describe much more than a figure skater tracing an infinity sign. But it has endless variation at the micro level, which creates the sense of a paradox—repetition that is impossible to grasp, slipping ceaselessly through your fingers.</p>
<p><i>Cascade</i> is released alongside <i>The Deluge</i>, where the same piano motif is process as to become more garbled, throwing longer and longer shadows over itself, and stormy frequencies overtake the placid weather of <i>Cascade</i>. By halfway through, a long serpent of digital tape echo has all but swallowed the motif, but it keeps glinting through. It’s the sound of  something being almost remembered, something that’s nagging at you but won’t quite slip into focus. <span>The comparatively brief ""The Deluge (The Denouement)"" splices a different fragment of piano with passages of maddened, Caretaker-like shortwave radio orchestration, with dark bass growing in under it like black mold.</span></p>
<p><i>Cascade</i> is a new work, though ""new"" is always a slippery term with Basinski, whose oeuvre is as nested as matryoshka dolls. Not only is the loop drawn from the archive of recordings he made in the '80s, but he also already used it, in an easily recognizable form, on <i>92982</i>, where it enters the piece shortly after the 40-minute mark. Is it a coincidence that you could replace the first 40 minutes of <i>92982</i> with <i>Cascade</i> and arrive at a new, continuous piece?</p>
<p>With Basinski, it’s hard to tell. He certainly doesn’t like endings—his pieces make you keenly aware that they’re just audible portions of infinite lines—and he treats little bits of captured time like bottomless wells. <i>Disintegration Loops</i> is his standout work because it dropped the illusion of eternity, letting us hear the tape decaying on the reels. Basinski admitted, with crushing poignancy, that things end. But on <i>Cascade</i>, he’s back to forestalling that knowledge through repetition, which is what gives his abstract pieces their surprising sentience and unaccountable melancholy. The machine is doing the work, but the composer has done the thinking and feeling, and that makes all the difference.</p></div>"|20900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20900-cascade-the-deluge/|7.4|Brian Howe

The Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist posts on the <a href=""https://www.muffwiggler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">message boards</a>, appears in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNNFLHV6j1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documentaries</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOoyLSrFJMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turns up at conventions</a> repping for popular modular designers like Make Noise and Verbos. A member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a> since the late 2000s, he’s earned a certain amount of mainstream alt-rock visibility, but there’s a substantial portion of his audience that likely found out about him by watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mpaiiHPJaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube videos</a> in which he monkeys around electronic unobtanium like the Buchla 700. He’s a gearhead’s musician.</p>
<p>His solo synthesizer records only reinforce that role. Cortini has a knack for making esoteric instruments like modular synthesizers seem cool and approachable. If you’re coming to electronic music via post-rock or even from film soundtracks, Cortini's music is easy to connect with. His compositions are spare and repetitive, but also melodic—employing warbly cyclical melodies that sometimes recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>’s early '80s film scores or the work of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>. Though he's often in proximity to instruments that epitomize electronic music's squealing id, Cortini's solo music is pretty dialed in.</p>
<p><i>Risveglio</i> is Cortini’s second full-length for <a href=""http://hospitalproductions.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hospital Productions</a>, the label run by <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>’s Dominick Fernow. Like its predecessor, <i>Sonno</i>, the album was composed while on tour using a portable studio setup. On that album Cortini used only one instrument, the Roland MC-202—a monophonic synthesizer/sequencer. Here, he expands the palate, adding a second element, the Roland TB-303. Both of these synths were heavily used in dance music during the '80s and '90s, particularly the TB-303, which provided the unmistakable squelchy bass sound that defined acid house. However, you will hardly recognize either of them on <i>Risveglio</i>.</p>
<p>In these songs, Cortini sets up static patterns that are gradually tweaked and mutated, using effect pedals (delay, reverb) to create a sense of development. The constant motion and shifting textures of sequenced synthesizer music (think Manuel Gottsching's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=e2+e4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""E2-E4""</a>) often make it feel fluid and watery. This is not exactly the case with <i>Risveglio</i>. It’s organic and propulsive, but the sound is eerie and claustrophobic rather than shimmery and ebullient. Cortini may have recorded it in a hotel room, but ""Lotta"" sounds like it was put to tape in an underground bunker.</p>
<p>In a genre where compositions are frequently driven by density and accumulation (both in terms of sound and of hardware), Cortini’s music is notable for its economy. Because of the instruments involved, no song can involve more than two active melodies at one time. Complex chords and harmony are not possible. These limitations make the music easily identifiable and distinctive. And despite the noise and murk, it's easy to listen to—once you're a minute into one of <i>Risveglio</i>'s songs, you pretty much know what it is and where it's going. It's music that is alien and strange, but also familiar.</p></div>"|20802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20802-risveglio/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

In 2013, Lee brought us the first professional recording of Dennis Johnson's long-lost, 1959 work <i>November</i>—a five-hour-plus minimalist breakthrough that inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"">La Monte Young</a> (and by extension, composers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>). Lee has also recorded post-minimalist touchstones by the likes of composer and early Village Voice critic Tom Johnson, and Wandelweiser-collective member Eva-Maria Houben.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Long-duration pieces that employ repetition (and sometimes outright silence) have given a sense of unity to Lee</span><span>'</span><span>s discography, thus far. And while his latest release, a 25-minute recording of Jay Batzner</span><span>'</span><span>s composition </span><span>""</span><span>as if to each other</span><span>…""</span><span>, doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t exactly shatter that brand, it does show off Lee</span><span>'</span><span>s skill at playing electro-acoustic works. After progressing through five gorgeous minutes of attractive (and contemplative-feeling) arpeggiated chords</span><span>—</span><span>in which top notes are constantly changing, and roving around the piano</span><span>'</span><span>s upper reaches</span><span>—</span><span>Batzner</span><span>'</span><span>s composition introduces a wisp of prepared electronics.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here</span><span>'</span><span>s where plenty of well-meaning contemporary classical pieces torpedo themselves (often by sounding cheap or hidebound enough to be confused with rejected haunted-house soundtracks). Batzner</span><span>'</span><span>s tones clear the initial sniff-test, simply by being well-judged. But his compositional instincts are also strong: up until the entrance of the electronics, slower-moving notes in the piano</span><span>'</span><span>s lower registers have been alternating with more active, higher-pitched chords. The</span><span> electronic field enters the picture right after Lee simultaneously strikes both extremes of the keyboard for the first time. Along with the resonant echo of the collision, the electronics create an icy, austere beauty.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The piece's middle section luxuriates in the immersive blurring of acoustics and electronics. By the sixteenth minute, we hear ov</span><span>erlapping, tinny samples of Lee</span><span>'</span><span>s playing, which </span><span>creates a feedback loop, as everything builds into a peak and slowly dies away. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It can be difficult for a musician not to become subservient to the media requirements of a piece like this one, but Lee</span><span>'</span><span>s playing is never just a helpmate; his interpretive choices sound explicably human throughout. Likewise, this release</span><span>—</span><span>the first professional, solo-composer recording of Batzner</span><span>'</span><span>s work</span><span>—</span><span>reflects Lee</span><span>'</span><span>s ongoing, admirable desire to champion works that haven</span><span>'</span><span>t yet had the chance to reach icon status.</span></p></div>"|20814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20814-as-if-to-each-other/|7.4|Seth Colter Walls

Steeped in Illinois' mid-'90s alternative rock boom—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5781-local-h/"">Local H</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a>, et al.—the trio gave off a grungy first impression, only to dash it by incorporating out-of-town touches: a hint of New York hardcore, a tinge of post-hardcore á la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"">Unwound</a>, and on their most recent outing (2010’s <i>Mercy</i>), some splashes of Savannah sludge.<span style=""line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">On their fourth LP <i>Earth</i>, the Chicago crew push their sound even futher, aided by Hum’s Matt Talbot and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> guitarist Kurt Ballou on co-production duties. Cuts like ""Old Haunts"" and ""Complaints"" pack enough firepower to compete with peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"">Torche</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22515-doomriders/"">Doomriders</a>; but where the aforementioned bands would rather barrel down the cliffside first and ask questions later, Sweet Cobra regard the speedometer with a careful, cumulative eye, with occasionally poppy results: ""Repo"" sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"">Snow Patrol</a> song on steroids.</p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the most underrated tools in Sweet Cobra’s arsenal is their sharpened sense of restraint: a necessary, and yet frequently overlooked, step in building a proper sludge assault. ""Future Ghosts"" guides a soft-spoken melody down a gurgling, muddied undertow of a bassline. The anxious post-punk of ""Sunburned Sons"" provides a master class in momentum, and the album’s warm, six-minute closer ""Walls"" feels concise and organic. <span style=""line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Earth </i>isn’t perfect, and Sweet Cobra’s charisma and compositional prowess don’t except them from the occasional flat note. Without a clear dynamic arc, ""He Tall He"", the album’s puffed-up ode to self-loathing and being ""[sent] down the river with... shit ideas,"" stumbles and buckles under its exaggerated weight. Meanwhile, lead vocalist Botchy Vasquez’s supple tenor lacks the substance to make glammier, radio-ready cuts like ""Flight Risk"" and ""Stiff Fits"" really shine. Despite his bad habit of tacking on unnecessary sharp notes to the end of his phrases, the guy's one of the most underrated vocalists in his niche, eschewing the throaty styles of Torche’s Steve Brooks or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"">Baroness</a>’ John Dyer Baizley for a headier approach that, in turn, makes the music feel less stifling. A little breathing room goes a long way, and in an atypical move for swampy albums of its ilk, <i>Earth </i>succeeds because it doesn’t attempt to downright bury the listener—it’s a slow, sweet smothering.</p></div>"|20836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20836-earth/|6.7|Zoe Camp

During that time, everything seemed to go their way: they had a bottomless well of songs built on the blues, early rock, British and American folk, psychedelia, and R&amp;B; they had the greatest riff machine the world had ever known in Jimmy Page, and they had hard rock's quintessential drummer in John Bonham. But given their penchant for excess and the hyper-intense life they lived as the world's biggest rock band in the '70s, there was no way it could last. They were getting older and growing tired; they did too many drugs; they were too isolated. In the five-and-a-half years between the February 1975 release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19834-led-zeppelin-ivhouses-of-the-holyphysical-graffiti/""><i>Physical Graffiti</i></a> and the death of drummer John Bonham that ended the band in September 1980, they released just two albums—<i>Presence</i> in March '76 and <i>In Through the Out Door</i> in August '79. The two LPs, newly reissued (along with 1982's posthumous odds-and-ends comp <i>Coda</i>) to round out what will almost certainly be the last large-scale catalog effort in the lifetime of the band members, were easily their weakest. But both are redeemed by the fact that they are also easily their two strangest.</p>
<p><i>Presence</i> and <i>In Through the Out Door</i> are opposites. The former was very much driven by Jimmy Page, who wanted badly to keep the band busy during a time of retrenchment following the serious car accident that injured Robert Plant in August 1975. The recording is ultra dry and the simple guitar/amp interface is front-and-center; just one song features an acoustic instrument, and the album has barely any keyboards. Page's strong hand led to an album that puts the focus on the playing and makes the fewest concessions to pop music. It has also developed a cult following in a way that no other single Zeppelin album has. (""<i>Presence</i> is just perfection,"" <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O'Rourke</a> told <a href=""http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/7344/Jim-ORourke-interview-transcript"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Time Out Tokyo</a>, and given his preference for clean and crisp engineering and arrangements, his admiration makes perfect sense.) It's the Zeppelin album that was least embraced by the radio, with its lengthy songs and general aversion to hooks. But the hard and brittle sound of <i>Presence</i> (at points, it sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"">Shellac</a> album) has much to admire, not least because you can hear the contributions of each band member so clearly. There are moments of space and silence and very little standing in between the instrument and the listener.</p>
<p>Throughout the album, bassist John Paul Jones and John Bonham are so perfectly in tune they seem like a single organism. Listen to how Jones' bass syncs with Bonham's kick drum on the tumbling stop/start masterpiece ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"", which certainly ranks with either's greatest moments, or the loping ""Hots on for Nowhere"", where the pauses serve as a third rhythm instrument. Page keeps his parts unusually lean, emphasizing percussive force over atmosphere. Distortion is used sparingly, as is reverb; though the songs contain many layers of guitars, the focus is on overlapping lines and counterpoint, even at the expense of riffs. </p>
<p>One thing <i>Presence</i> most certainly is <i>not</i> is Plant's album; he sang these songs from a wheelchair, still recovering from a car wreck, and his voice sounds pinched and thin on the group's least inspired tunes. Indeed, the overall lack of melody on <i>Presence</i> shows you just how underrated Zeppelin were in that department (as does the previously unreleased bonus track ""10 Ribs &amp; All/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod)"", a blandly pretty piano-led instrumental with a chiming acoustic guitar that's the closest Zep ever got to yacht rock). It might be their weakest album, but <i>Presence</i> is among the most special; none of these songs sound like they could have come from another record.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that <i>In Through the Out Door</i> was the work of the same band. By this point, Page, deep in the throes of heroin addiction, had mostly checked out, and Bonham's chronic alcoholism was reaching a terrifying end stage. Robert Plant's five-year-old son died unexpectedly in 1977 and his grief almost caused his exit from the band. Out of this turmoil came Zeppelin's most singular record, if far from their best.</p>
<p>With Page out of commission, Plant teamed with Jones, always the group's steadying force, and they wrote colorful songs that heavily featured synthesizers. Most of the '60s and '70s veterans who made a synth-heavy album in the '80s were responding to broader trends in pop, but <i>In Through the Out Door</i> doesn't sound like a reaction to anything, least of all new wave. The general mood is dark and inward; Plant's words are often hard to make out, and when you do catch lyrics they are especially cryptic. But there's something restless and experimental about it too, a feeling of open-ended structures being explored.</p>
<p><i>Out Door</i> is defined by its production sheen; even the most famous guitar part on the album, Page's beautifully broken solo on ""In the Evening"", sounds like it's been run through a dozen pedals and filters. The dirge ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" is utterly shapeless, not a ballad so much as a drawn-out moan; ""South Bound Suarez"" comes at country-tonk from bizarre angles. Where Zep once had direct homages to the music of their youth, now they were creating weirdly synthetic mutant versions of them. Sometimes, as with the Sun-era Elvis trifle, ""Hot Dog"", they didn't quite work, but the Latin-inspired ""Fool in the Rain"" is a unique creation that still sounds fresh. The piano is used as a looping rhythmic instrument in the Cuban tradition—there aren't chord changes, exactly—and the feel of the whole is circular and strange. John Bonham, whose nervous system was ravaged by a daily vodka intake that would stop most people's hearts, somehow managed one last burst of genius and created his most memorable and lasting drum line (hear it in isolation and marvel at just how deeply in the pocket he could still play, the utter mastery of his feel). ""Carouselambra"", a bizarre proggy rave-up that stretches for more than 10 minutes, is impossible to compare to another song.</p>
<p><i>Coda</i>, collecting outtakes (of which Led Zeppelin did not have many), followed in 1982. The big story on this reissue is the release of tracks recorded by Page and Plant in what in the early '70s was still called Bombay. The tabla and strings certainly bring to mind the flavor of some of their experiments in global music around the time, but truthfully there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ""Bombay Orchestra"" tracks. Beyond the new curiosities, <i>Coda</i>'s offerings range from one of the band's best single songs (""Hey Hey, What Can I Do""), which was originally relegated to a B-side, to a fantastic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/""><i>III</i></a> outtake (""Poor Tom""), to a couple of essential live cuts, to a skippable drum solo (""Bonzo's Montreaux"") and an exhausted rocker that truly feels like the end (""Darlene""). ""Ozone Baby"", recorded during the <i>In Through the Out Door</i> sessions, would have easily been that record's catchiest and most accessible song. <i>Coda</i> is a great listen with a skip button close at hand.</p>
<p>Revisiting their final records, it's clear that Zeppelin didn't exactly go out on a high note. But they didn't exactly fade away, either. True to their model, they did something no other rock band of their stature has before: They took a couple of wrong turns and changed into something else rapidly before vanishing. These sets will always leave a peculiar taste in the mouth of Zeppelin fans, but they affirm they were <i>the</i> rock band of the '70s, the decade when rock music ruled the world. Even in their exit, they carried themselves with a majesty and strangeness that simply couldn't be replicated.</p></div>"|20668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20668-presence-in-through-the-out-door-coda/|7.6|Mark Richardson

<p>With Page out of commission, Plant teamed with Jones, always the group's steadying force, and they wrote colorful songs that heavily featured synthesizers. Most of the '60s and '70s veterans who made a synth-heavy album in the '80s were responding to broader trends in pop, but <i>In Through the Out Door</i> doesn't sound like a reaction to anything, least of all new wave. The general mood is dark and inward; Plant's words are often hard to make out, and when you do catch lyrics they are especially cryptic. But there's something restless and experimental about it too, a feeling of open-ended structures being explored.</p>
<p><i>Out Door</i> is defined by its production sheen; even the most famous guitar part on the album, Page's beautifully broken solo on ""In the Evening"", sounds like it's been run through a dozen pedals and filters. The dirge ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" is utterly shapeless, not a ballad so much as a drawn-out moan; ""South Bound Suarez"" comes at country-tonk from bizarre angles. Where Zep once had direct homages to the music of their youth, now they were creating weirdly synthetic mutant versions of them. Sometimes, as with the Sun-era Elvis trifle, ""Hot Dog"", they didn't quite work, but the Latin-inspired ""Fool in the Rain"" is a unique creation that still sounds fresh. The piano is used as a looping rhythmic instrument in the Cuban tradition—there aren't chord changes, exactly—and the feel of the whole is circular and strange. John Bonham, whose nervous system was ravaged by a daily vodka intake that would stop most people's hearts, somehow managed one last burst of genius and created his most memorable and lasting drum line (hear it in isolation and marvel at just how deeply in the pocket he could still play, the utter mastery of his feel). ""Carouselambra"", a bizarre proggy rave-up that stretches for more than 10 minutes, is impossible to compare to another song.</p>
<p><i>Coda</i>, collecting outtakes (of which Led Zeppelin did not have many), followed in 1982. The big story on this reissue is the release of tracks recorded by Page and Plant in what in the early '70s was still called Bombay. The tabla and strings certainly bring to mind the flavor of some of their experiments in global music around the time, but truthfully there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the ""Bombay Orchestra"" tracks. Beyond the new curiosities, <i>Coda</i>'s offerings range from one of the band's best single songs (""Hey Hey, What Can I Do""), which was originally relegated to a B-side, to a fantastic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/""><i>III</i></a> outtake (""Poor Tom""), to a couple of essential live cuts, to a skippable drum solo (""Bonzo's Montreaux"") and an exhausted rocker that truly feels like the end (""Darlene""). ""Ozone Baby"", recorded during the <i>In Through the Out Door</i> sessions, would have easily been that record's catchiest and most accessible song. <i>Coda</i> is a great listen with a skip button close at hand.</p>
<p>Revisiting their final records, it's clear that Zeppelin didn't exactly go out on a high note. But they didn't exactly fade away, either. True to their model, they did something no other rock band of their stature has before: They took a couple of wrong turns and changed into something else rapidly before vanishing. These sets will always leave a peculiar taste in the mouth of Zeppelin fans, but they affirm they were <i>the</i> rock band of the '70s, the decade when rock music ruled the world. Even in their exit, they carried themselves with a majesty and strangeness that simply couldn't be replicated.</p></div>"|20668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20668-presence-in-through-the-out-door-coda/|7.3|Mark Richardson

While this wave of revivalists has been good about citing their sources and highlighting the original artists in their DJ sets, their actual music occasionally suffers from an overabundance of respect. House music was born out of a hacker mindset, and treating it with kid gloves, instead of finding a way to innovate on the old sounds, robs the music of one of its most vital elements.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Producer Matt Walker (aka Julio Bashmore) got his start in Bristol's dubstep scene, but he <a href=""http://crackmagazine.net/article/music/julio-bashmore/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claims</a> that his first exposure to dance music came through his older brother's vintage house records, and house seems to be his true calling. His breakout 2011 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLqWjUWGYFA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Battle for Middle You""</a> combined classic house revivalism with a quintessentially Bristolian combination of sub bass frequencies and icy synths. The resulting track had all the feel of a long-lost Chicago treasure being rediscovered. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since then, Walker's lost some of the Bristol chill, but kept his focus on house, to impressive results. His debut album, <i>Knockin' Boots</i>, could actually be the best LP-length statement to come out of house's reawakening. Walker's a nonspecific revivalist who draws inspiration from every point on the genre's timeline—""Rhythm of Auld"" emulates the kind of hard-edged disco funk that house was built on (including a spookily dead-on vocal part by J'Danna, who sings on three of the album's tracks), while ""She Ain't"" sounds like the funkily robotic stuff Cajmere was doing 20 years later with a dash of ghetto house raunch sprinkled on top.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He's not bound to any sort of outsized sense of responsibility to authenticity, though, and he freely adds his own personalized flourishes to the recipes he's working from. ""She Ain't"" ends in a glitchy breakdown that would've been very out of place in the mid-'90s. On some tracks he goes even further—a gently percolating bump combined with BIXBY's aching vocals peg ""Let Me Be Your Weakness"" as a stab at circa-1988 soulful house, but the rest of the arrangement is a fascinating mutant mashup of '80s freestyle and turn-of-the-millennium UK garage.</p>
<p>After ""Battle for Middle You"", Walker started collaborating with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>, and some of her pop ambition seems to have rubbed off. It doesn't have anything as world-crushingly catchy as Disclosure's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14188-latch-ft-sam-smith/"">""Latch""</a>, but <i>Knockin' Boots</i> has enough pop hooks to interest people who don't normally listen to dance music outside the club. Much of the credit should go to the cast of vocal talent, which includes J'Danna, BIXBY, space-funk auteur <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32135-seven-davis-jr/"">Seven Davis Jr.</a>, star songwriter Sam Dew, and South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat (who helps to pull hip-house into pop's globally connected present on ""Umuntu""), but Walker also has a talent for making tracks that can jack your body but also get stuck in your head.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Walker's already carved out a spot for himself on the worldwide pop scene with the Dew-fronted ""Holding On"", which has been on heavy rotation on Apple Music's Beats 1 Radio. House's danceability and deep utopian streak have helped it take root around the globe, spinning off more variations than even the most ambitiously imaginative house music fan could have pictured back in the days when Ron Hardy was spinning the smooth soul chopped up over thumping beats that ""Holding On"" tries—very successfully—to emulate. Now that house has conquered the world, it's feels right that a younger generation is bringing back the sounds of its earliest days for a victory lap, but it feels even better to know that there are artists like Walker involved who can keep pushing them into the future.</span></p></div>"|20797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20797-knockin-boots/|8.0|Miles Raymer

Whereas <i>Is Your Love Big Enough?</i> looks outward for validation, <i>Blood</i> is dynamic and poignantly self-assured in its introspection.</p>
<p><i>Blood</i><span>'s first single, ""Unstoppable"" is a breezy summer jam that pairs lighthearted bass and groove with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFic-xaLsPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">whimsical video</a> to match. In it, La Havas twirls through an empty house singing of the unique invincibility that comes post-healing: ""Our polarity shifted around/ There was nothing else left holding us down/ But it's just gravitational/ We are unstoppable!"" Warm and affirming, the track eases listeners into a complex, layered album with La Havas' earthy notes complementing meditations on love.</span></p>
<p>La Havas, whose soulful tunes place her most often in conversation with artists like Alice Smith, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30879-laura-mvula/""><span>Laura Mvula</span></a>, and Corinne Bailey Rae, handles her six-string acoustic with elegance and precision. Where she is less graceful, and at times even awkward, is the integration of more electric sounds. ""Never Get Enough"" alternates between her trademark lullaby and brash chords to almost jarring effect. The tonal shift matches the urgency of the cat-and-mouse lyrical arc, but the abrupt jumps add discordant conflict to an otherwise harmonious track sequencing. The song feels erratic, ill-suited to the pleasant lilt of La Havas' smooth voice. ""Grow"" alternates between acoustics and strong percussion, but its melodic shifts build gradually, matched by La Havas' rising vocals.</p>
<p>Though La Havas is best known for her dreamy love songs, she shines naturally when exploring her own internal world. ""Green &amp; Gold"" traces her coming of age through motifs from both her Jamaican and Greek backgrounds: ""I'm looking at life unfold, dreaming of the green and gold/ Just like the ancient stone, every sunrise I know/ Those eyes you gave to me, they let me see where I come from."" The nods to her mixed race heritage are childlike in their innocent inquiry, but the track still retains its maturity; its strong percussive notes deviate from her tendency toward ballads, evoking the same island influence depicted in the track's lyrics.</p>
<p>The album's strongest ballad, the stunningly simple ""Wonderful"" showcases her at her finest: sultry, nostalgic, and sweet. The track is a gorgeous ode to love lost, its chorus enchanting: ""But wasn't it kinda wonderful?/ Wasn't it kinda wonderful, baby?"" With slow snaps punctuating La Havas' voice, ""Wonderful"" seduces as it soothes. It is the soundtrack to slow motion surprise encounters with an ex. La Havas weaves contentment with a charged reflection on past romance to tantalizing effect: ""You can trip, flick a switch negative/ Break the circuit between us/ But electricity lingers/ In our fingers.""</p>
<p>Melodic interruption of ""Never Get Enough"" notwithstanding, <i>Blood</i> is an almost seamless album. Tracks flow into one another with the fluidity and serenity of rain into a freshwater pond—light, refreshing, natural. But there is substance moving here, weight in the currents. La Havas' even, powerful vocals ride syrupy strings with grace and latch onto sharper rhythms with authority. She is deft and adaptive, at once inspiring dancing and melancholy reflection: La Havas is always in motion.</p></div>"|20855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20855-lianne-la-havas-blood/|7.7|Hannah Giorgis

On that track, Caralee McElroy made a rare vocal appearance to sing, ""I can weep through my own midnights"" and ""I know it’s stupid to dream/ That you might think of me as a man."" Like Xiu Xiu in their softer, more reflective moments, Adult Mom, the Purchase, N.Y. guitar rock project helmed by songwriter Steph Knipe, scrawls gentle notes to self all over their music. <i>Momentary Lapse of Happily</i> externalizes many of the same queer anxieties that manifest in Xiu Xiu’s work, but in a lighter, warmer cadence more reminiscent of Knipe’s contemporaries in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32848-eskimeaux/"">Eskimeaux</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32493-girlpool/"">Girlpool</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32876-elvis-depressedly/"">Elvis Depressedly</a>.</p>
<p>Knipe writes and sings with a dose of humor that balances lyrics like ""one day I’ll set fire to your car"" (from ""2012""). The violence in their words isn’t a joke, but humor helps temper the incendiary impulse behind it. Sometimes you have to choose whether to laugh or scream, and only one kind of outburst is considered socially acceptable. But with Adult Mom’s anger comes a fierce yearning for growth. On ""Survival"", Knipe sings, ""I survive because I have died,"" as if shedding identities like old snakeskins were the only way to keep moving forward unhunted. Often there’s a bitterness ringing the words, but also an ember of hope for the future at their core.</p>
<p>Though much of <i>Momentary Lapse</i> plays like the residue of deeply private self-soothing (""I hold my own hands in crowds,"" Knipe sings on ""Be Your Own 3am""), Adult Mom nods to friendship and communal healing throughout. Band banter breaks up some tracks, while Knipe references their friends by name in certain lyrics. Adult Mom teeters on the line of needing companionship and also fearing it, of needing to externalize feelings while remaining unsure of whether those feelings can be understood or even heard. <i>Momentary Lapse</i> is an anxious record, and at times a tentative one, as though Knipe felt stifled in the process of articulating just how stifled they feel. ""It is okay to feel doubt/ But just know you’re gonna find a way out,"" they sing on ""Told Ya So"" between cheery strikes of keyboard. It’s one of many songs on the album that feels like a love letter to a younger self, something that can never actually be sent to its intended recipient, but can be reframed for a stranger out there who needs to hear it.</p></div>"|20850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20850-momentary-lapse-of-happily/|6.8|Sasha Geffen

Ricked Wicky, if you'll recall, is the so-called ""sophisticated arena rock band"" featuring Pollard, constant companion Todd Tobias, former GBV drummer Kevin March, and Dayton lifer (and relative newbie to the Pollard universe) Nick Mitchell; their latest, <i>King Heavy Metal</i>, follows their debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20208-i-sell-the-circus/""><i>I Sell the Circus</i></a> by a scant five months. The second LP from any post-GBV Pollard enterprise always feels a little like a dare: as the project starts to define its own borders, there's always the sense that the famously restless Pollard could abandon this one just as blithely as he has so many others. Still, Ricked Wicky feels different. Mitchell, for one, has clearly ingratiated himself to his new boss; after a few scene-stealing cameos on <i>I Sell the Circus</i>, he gets a strong supporting role throughout <i>King Heavy Metal</i>. And Pollard—content, presumably, with the way this latest venture is shaping up—turns in a weird, wide-ranging set.</p>
<p>Chiming opener ""Jargon of Clones"" could just be the out-and-out loveliest Pollard track of the decade, a swaying self-examination that finds our Uncle Bob deep in dialogue with himself. ""This Has Been My Picture"" is similarly lovely; after a lengthy buildup, its triumphal, harpsichord-ticked chorus makes for a well-earned payoff. And the svelte, surefooted ""I'll Let You In"" is a top-flight Pollardian rocker, a hard-charging, brain-sticking wonder in the grand tradition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J-V6AGuA2k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Motor Away""</a>.</p>
<p>Of late, the best Pollard records split the difference between spontaneity and craftsmanship; too much (or little) of either, and the whole thing starts to feel overworked, undercooked, or some combination thereof. The songs Pollard brings to <i>Heavy Metal</i> are smart—and occasionally downright elegant—without resorting to all the look-at-me bells and whistles that bogged down 2013's scatterbrained <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18802-robert-pollard-blazing-gentlemen/""><i>Blazing Gentlemen</i></a>. Not that they're all winners; the dirgey ""Walk Through Glass"" takes a beat too long to get where it's going, and ""Earth Among Men"" lays a thick layer of <i>Psychocandy</i> fuzz atop one of the set's more threadbare melodies, in the hopes that no one notices.<br/><br/>And then there's ""Come Into My Wig Shop"", a surefire top-five contender for weirdest Pollard song. Slinky spy-movie keyboards? Check. A bizarro-world version of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Thunderstruck""</a> intro? Sure, why not. ""Wig Shop"" is more science project than song, its goofball verses grafted awkwardly into a sundazed chorus. It shouldn't work, and it doesn't; still, after so many years of Pollard padding out albums with gormless ballads, blandiose rockers, and barely-there sketches, the sheer chutzpah of ""Wig Shop"" is almost enough to redeem it. ""Wig Shop"" is a lot of—probably too many—things, but boring isn't one of them.<br/><br/>""Wig Shop"" is a Pollard-Mitchell co-write, one of Mitchell's three writing credits on <i>King Heavy Metal</i>. His ""Weekend Warriors"" is either the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">Who</a> song they never got around to writing or the shameless pint-hoister the art-damaged Pollard won't quite allow himself to pen. Either way, it's a hoot, a would-be anthem for every heavy-lidded 9-to-5er staring down another early Monday alarm call. To its credit, ""Warriors"" cuts to the quick and guzzles straight from the bottle; to its detriment, Mitchell's other contribution, ""Imminent Fall From Grace"", does much the same. The metaphor-eschewing ""Grace"" finds Mitchell doling out a stern warning to a high-flying character who's due for a fall. If Mitchell's ""Warriors"" is a better-than-average Roger Daltrey bite, ""Grace"" is sub-Eddie Money bar-rock. Ill-fitting and uninspired, it's the record's sore thumb, an unusually earnest, uncomfortably literal song floating in a sea of Pollardian abstractions.</p>
<p>Just two records in, it's only natural that Mitchell and Pollard are still feeling each other out; given how capably Mitchell's slotted himself in with Pollard—whose many idiosyncrasies long ago calcified into his distinctive style—elsewhere, this misfire seems easy to chalk up to growing pains. While <i>King Heavy Metal</i> isn't quite as front-to-back consistent as <i>I Sell the Circus</i>, its aims are higher: a surefire sign of a band getting comfortable with themselves.</p></div>"|20820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20820-king-heavy-metal/|6.5|Paul Thompson

Such remember-your-roots DIY ethos has always been central to the band’s existence, because at a time when bands are more flexible than ever about taking money to survive, Titus Andronicus are specifically beloved for their refusal to compromise. They start charity funds so their music can be kept out of advertisements; they snidely refer to <a href=""https://twitter.com/TitusAndronicus/status/616574316830945280"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar as a shoe spokesperson</a>, an attitude both rigidly simplistic and <i>technically</i> true.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">The Clash</a> were hyped as the ""only band that matters,"" a dubious claim because it was invented by their record label. But for their fans, Titus Andronicus is this type of group. They turn a great, burning eye upon the world and spare no one from their observations, not even themselves. For listeners attracted to rock'n'roll as both flagellating whip and eternal flame, this is powerfully enticing—especially if you also believe the world is on the perennial edge of collapse. (Ironically, they take a similarly analytical approach to the ugliness in themselves and in the world as Kendrick Lamar—only, of course, they'd never sell any shoes.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Their status was cemented by 2010 breakthrough </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/""><i>The Monitor</i></a><span>, a wildly ambitious album that used the Civil War as a metaphor for Stickles' life. It was desperate music made for desperate people, filled with howled lamentations about the sorry state of society wrapped around riffs that forced your shoulders out of their sockets. But the follow-up, 2012's </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17258-local-business/""><i>Local Business</i></a><span>, was unexpectedly dour. Hesitant to accept his band's new position in the music industry, Stickles pulled back. The first line asserted that everything in the world was ""inherently worthless,"" and only grew more precisely negative as it went onward, critiquing the middle-class bubble that allowed a band like them to exist. Music fans will accept a certain amount of doom-and-gloom—many times they actively court it—but there are limits. Few people want to listen to a rock song about why listening to a rock song is bad. That Stickles spent the next few years telling his Twitter followers that </span><i>Local Business </i><span>was better than </span><i>The Monitor</i><span> (in a run of tweets now gone after he deleted his timeline earlier this year) seemed to cement its status as metaphorical garlic, meant to ward off the punks-in-name-only who today might discover the band through listening to Beats 1.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So when reports first emerged that the band was</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52135-titus-andronicus-patrick-stickles-says-next-lp-will-be-a-30-song-rock-opera/""><span> writing a 30-track rock opera</span></a><span>, it sounded outrageous—a pointed gag from Stickles that would probably culminate in, like, an album full of Crass covers. How do you go bigger than an album that uses the Civil War as a metaphor for one's life? But it wasn't a joke: Almost two years later, they announced </span><i>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</i>, a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera that immediately restored their claims to outsized ambition, as only a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera might.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Most Lamentable Tragedy </i><span>is a story told in five acts that follows the Hero, an unnamed man (who's someone like Stickles) in an unnamed city (which is somewhere like New York) grappling with his neuroses. He's confronted by his doppelgänger—an alternate self that seems to have everything figured out, and pushes him to find solace outside of sin. It’s a protracted allegory for manic depression, which Stickles has publicly struggled with since the band first came to attention. Here, he’s reversed course from the literal transcription of his life’s struggles on </span><i>Local Business</i><span> (no ""My Eating Disorder""), instead interpreting them to fit his larger vision. </span><span><i>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</i> </span><span>is their least specific album—no granular references to obscure Jersey baseball teams—but their most universal, less dependent on empathizing with the suburban sad sack.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music encompasses everything they’ve ever sounded like: There are knotty guitar anthems filled with chords like power lines thrumming with electricity (""No Future Part IV"", ""Stranded""), hot-breathed hardcore exhortations (""Look Alive"", ""Lookalike""), vamps on musical theater where Stickles sounds somewhere between Billy Joel and Meat Loaf (""I Lost My Mind"", ""No Future Part V""). They filter the visceral riffage of Thin Lizzy (""Lonely Boy""), the all-hands-on revelry of the E. Street Band (""Fatal Flaw""), and the whiskey-soaked romanticism of the Pogues (""Come On, Siobhán"") through a fiery, punk-indebted perspective. True, those are reference points on previous albums, but here the elements blend together like a hearty soup. Fifteen musicians are credited on the record (such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a>, who handled the strings) and there's a feeling of camaraderie in the production; at times, it feels like the album was recorded in one, rambling live take over a long night.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album’s ambitions aren’t only limited to the story, which Stickles has <a href=""http://genius.com/TitusAndronicus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eagerly detailed</a> at the former Rap Genius. Instead, it considers their discography as one giant super-structure. It's packed with callbacks to previous work, which any modest Titus head should be able to pick out. The references range from obvious (""More Perfect Union"" follows <i>The Monitor</i>'s ""A More Perfect Union""; ""I'm Going Insane"" is a reprise of <i>Local Business</i>' ""Titus Andronicus vs. the Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)"") to esoteric (lyrical homages to ""No Future"" and ""A More Perfect Union"", amongst others) to potentially meaningful: The titular character in ""Mr. E. Mann"" is the ""Electric Man"" from <i>Local Business</i>, which was written about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44524-titus-andronicus-patrick-stickles-gets-electrocuted-disses-kurt-vile/""><span>a real-life incident </span></a>in which Stickles was hospitalized after gripping a live microphone during rehearsal for a show.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The idea that electricity and electroshock therapy can cure depression is an old one, hence the smudging of fiction and reality to suggest that the shocks Stickles inadvertently received may have created this fictive doppelganger, who appears to the hero (""I met a mystery man/ On a magic morning"") and offers a hopeful path toward clean living. Of course, these layers of potential interpretation are secondary to the fact that ""Mr. E. Mann"" is simply an enjoyable song, guided by Stickles' sensitive vocal performance and the convergence of harmonica, piano, and strings into what sounds like glistening dew on that magic morning. You don’t need to know that Stickles was shocked by a microphone to enjoy ""Mr. E Mann"", just as you don’t need to know that he’s from New Jersey to understand the hero's sense of psychic isolation. But like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">the Hold Steady</a>, the mythology offers deeper enjoyment for anyone willing to burrow into it. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On their earlier albums, Titus Andronicus perfected the art of writing confrontationally self-effacing anthems. Their most potent and most recognized refrains—""You will always be a loser"" and ""Your life is over""—took on a therapeutic nature when being screamed by crowds of young men and women in the throes of rock-show-as-catharsis. By contrast, the mantras on </span><i>The Most Lamentable Tragedy </i><span>look inward. ""I hate to be awake""; ""I can control something inside of me""; ""It's alright""; ""I only like it when it's dimed out""; these are confessional observations that sound scribbled in the margins of some diary. Stickles has sounded more personal than this, but never less acidic. This is angst that’s approachable, rather than the starved nihilism that colored their previous records.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With that in mind, the one-two punch of ""Come On, Siobhán"" and ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"" is where the record unlocks. In their cover of the Pogues classic, they tweak a few lyrics to change the mood: ""One winter's evening/ Stoned as hell."" It's marijuana that the hero consumes in this version, not alcohol, because while booze dulls the senses, a real marijuana high makes one ultra-perceptive of all the conditions in one's life. Sifting those thoughts to find some clarity is like navigating a minefield... but here, the hero has a revelation that despite his baleful world view, despite the push and pull between his inner selves, despite the tide of disgust felt toward his surroundings, salvation is possible through someone else. The feeling might be as ephemeral as the high, but for a moment, life looks wide open. It's the first time the band has explicitly sung about love, the transmutation of brutal pessimism into beatific optimism.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This is not maudlin sentiment printed off a Hallmark card, but a hard-fought conclusion following a lifetime of despair. The feeling isn't eternal; a few songs later, the relationship has ended and the hero is plunged back into his depression. But the mood has shifted by ""Stable Boy"", the last proper song on the album. Over a weeping chord organ, Stickles gazes at the yawning void of ""forever"" and decides that for all life's dissatisfaction, 'tis better to have lived than not at all. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Stable Boy"" was recorded with the same cassette recorder used for ""Fear and Loathing in Mahwah, NJ"", the first song off their first record, which captured Stickles' need to do wrong to everyone who'd done wrong by him. T</span>he two tracks sound like bookends to the Titus Andronicus project, introducing and resolving Stickles' profound anxieties about life—the running theme through all of their four albums. It's not necessarily a happy ending, but it's one they fought for. And so: It's taken five years, but they've finally answered the grand expectations created by <i>The Monitor</i>. They could go anywhere from here—record that album of Crass covers, become a full-time bar cover band, or even happily break up. At the very least, they can stop writing songs titled ""No Future"".</p></div>"|20702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20702-the-most-lamentable-tragedy/|8.1|Jeremy Gordon

Public Enemy's message is more relevant now than ever.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Almost on cue, the group is back from a three-year hiatus with its 13th studio album, </span><i>Man Plans God Laughs</i><span><i>,</i> a timely release that repackages classic Public Enemy motifs for a renewed struggle. The group seems revitalized by the current movement and, as a longstanding, outspoken voice for civil rights, anxiously seeks to lend its support in the ongoing fight for black lives—there's even a passing mention of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign. Chuck D is refocused and often sharp, using his strained, but still booming chants to rally allies. When he shouts, ""So, it's cool to be black until it's time to be black,"" on ""Mine Again"", a song about African pride, it's as much a call-to-action for African-Americans as it is reprimand of cultural appropriators. The two major points of emphasis remain mobilizing the black base and challenging anti-black tyranny. The message is delivered heavy-handedly, but that's always been the group's method; the main difference between </span><i>Man Plans God Laughs</i><span> and Public Enemy at its critical best is that the former isn't bracing or forceful in any impactful way. It lacks bite. There's no punch.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Public Enemy's tone has always been angry, confrontational, and conspiratorial, and there's no group in history better equipped to weaponize black nationalism against white supremacy, but here the battle waged is at least partially against a spiritual adversary. The title originates from an old Yiddish proverb<span>—</span>a weird bit of irony for a group that has frequently been accused of anti-Semitism<span>—</span>and the record is lined with similarly out-of-place religious subtext (on ""Those Who Know Know Who"", Chuck fires subliminal barbs at the devil; there's no sympathy for the same foe in the intro). Scriptural buzzwords like ""evil"" and ""wicked"" pop up unexpectedly as descriptors. There's no piety, merely a fixation with ""the great Satan"", who plays a puppet master figure in the periphery, and this only splits focus and limits the commentary's potency.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Chuck <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-public-enemy-intense-man-plans-god-laughs-20150713"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>told Rolling Stone</span></a> that this would be ""the most intense Public Enemy record of the century,"" but 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10926-how-you-sell-soul-to-a-souless-people-who-sold-their-soul/""><i>How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul???</i></a> was much fiercer and more substantial. <i>Man Plans God Laughs</i> isn't intense; it's concise, and though it can't quite muster up the heavy strikes of other PE projects, it benefits from brevity. Many of the tracks barely clock-in at two minutes, which suits Chuck's fragmenting rap style, Flav's fading wail, and DJ Lord's compact scratching. Things click on all cylinders with the skipping ""Lost in Space Music"", where Chuck and Flav play up the emcee-hype man dynamic. When given space, like on ""Corplantationopoly"", the veteran can still be exhilaratingly bullish, rumbling through with weighty appraisals of race politics. But Chuck's voice isn't the same weapon it once was, Flav's ad-libs aren't as timely and his appearances are less waggish, and the shifting rap tide hasn't done the group's traditionalist sensibilities any favors. You can feel the difference.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Man Plans God Laughs</i><span> is entirely produced by longtime Bomb Squad member G-Wiz<span>—</span>who also produced the majority of </span><span><i>How You Sell Soul</i><span>—</span></span><span>and some of his beats slap, particularly ""Praise the Loud"", which is augmented by DJ Lord scratches. But many others blatantly pander to rap radio, and some are just busy for no reason (""Give Peace a Damn""). Where previous PE releases this century have often sounded dated, this one often sounds forcibly modern, the sonic equivalent of your tech-challenged granddad trying to use Spotify. At one point, Chuck utters the words 'Turnt up brand."" ""Earthizen"" attempts to reimagine the tired alphabet rap concept, but sputters, adding a cringeworthy hook: ""The earth without art is just, 'eh'."" Even for all its faults, though, this record doesn't lack the distinct, aggressively pro-Black energy that originally made Public Enemy a voice for the oppressed masses. That's what has always been the most important thing at the music's core. The message is still there, the delivery is just less effective now.</span></p></div>"|20846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20846-man-plans-god-laughs/|6.2|Sheldon Pearce

Gone are the days when many of the worldwide form’s biggest innovators earned large budgets from still-larger companies or bidding wars occurred for the most brutal new prospect. Though there are exceptions, most modern metal backed by largesse aims so squarely for genre rigidity and predictability that it’s hard to believe it requires humans to make. It’s as though the stuff comes from a factory in some anonymous and once-economically depressed flyover town, conveniently produced in five-band package tours that are almost impossible to distinguish but easy to absorb. Meanwhile, the new metal records that seem destined to matter as masterpieces, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31931-tribulation/"">Tribulation</a>’s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20329-the-children-of-the-night/""><i>Children of the Night</i></a>, arrive largely from the indie fringes. After three decades under Rick Rubin’s aegis, even the mighty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a> have decamped to an indie for the forthcoming <i>Repentless</i>.</p>
<p>During the past decade, Lamb of God have struggled with such a fate. Since signing to Epic Records for their third album, 2004’s <i>Ashes of the Wake</i>, they’ve often seemed a rather regimented metal band. Every two or three years, they would churn out another 10 or so songs, with big grooves and death metal outbursts decorated by lots and lots of guitars. Randy Blythe was a rampaging frontman, the kind who encouraged that you get loud with his tirades. But Lamb of God always teased the edges of their sound, trying to push beyond their meat-and-potatoes metal reputation with each release. It’s as if they felt guilty about their well-heeled position on Epic and tried to use it to gradually inch away from stylistic and financial safety, somehow back toward the fringes. By the time they issued 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16198-resolution/""><i>Resolution</i></a>, such distractions had wantonly diluted their strengths, resulting in an abysmal record of mediocre hooks and banal studio gimmicks.</p>
<p>Despite the highfaluting combination of Roman numerals and German words it takes as a title, Lamb of God’s very good seventh album, <i>VII: Sturm und Drang</i>, is a satisfactorily settled record, arguably their first such effort in a decade. <i>Sturm und Drang</i> takes decidedly few chances. Instead, it sticks mostly to up-tempo numbers, countered only by a clean-singing ballad that soon enough heads for the pit and a righteous stomper that eventually sublimates into something like shoegaze with the help of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones/"">Deftone</a> Chino Moreno. All of these songs are studded with enormous refrains and driven by a sense of urgency that Lamb of God have forsaken in recent years. When Blythe’s distended scream rips across howling amplifiers at the start of ""Still Echoes"", or when ""Delusion Pandemic"" snaps right into a belligerent stomp, it’s as if they’ve finally got too much to say to fuck around with being fancy. By not trying to be overly interesting or involved, Lamb of God have made one of their most alluring albums in years.</p>
<p>The newfound energy and efficiency seem to stem, in part, from between-album trauma: In 2012, months after the release of <i>Resolution</i>, Czech police arrested Blythe in a Prague airport. He spent five weeks awaiting trial for a manslaughter charge after he pushed a teenaged fan, who subsequently died, off the stage at a concert there two years earlier. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/05/showbiz/music/lamb-of-god-randy-blythe-acquitted-rstone/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blythe was acquitted</a>, but the process hung like a cloud around the band. They scrapped plans for shows and talked about taking a long break. Rather than languish, however, Lamb of God reassembled in the studio and got to work on several songs that examined the frontman’s time in prison and his rather hostile feelings at large.</p>
<p>The obvious approach worked: ""Still Echoes"" explores the Nazi history of Prague’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankr%C3%A1c_Prison"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pankrác Prison</a>, his anger for the subject animating the song with feeling. The guitars twist and scrape like the anxious hands of a very nervous person. It smartly points to Blythe’s prison time without exploiting it, powerfully suggesting that his stint inside allowed him to think about the rest of the world’s problems just as much as his own. And though the irrepressible ""512"" is named for the cell where Blythe spent some time, it’s penned from a much broader perspective. He serves not as the prisoner but as the spokesmen for them. ""My hands are painted red/ My future is painted black/ I’ve become someone else,"" he screams in one of the band’s best choruses ever, deflecting much of the blame at a society that creates its own criminals. He lodges similar criticisms during the bracing-and-racing ""Footprints"", a song about environmental degradation, and the wonderfully thrashing spree ""Delusion Pandemic"", a madman philippic on Internet culture. As laughable as Blythe’s hook about mockingbirds being fed to wolves may be, it’s an irresistible moment.</p>
<p>As with the other numbers <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lamb-of-god-break-down-new-album-vii-sturm-und-drang-track-by-track-20150630?page=4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about self-immolating heroes, Nazi assassins, or media distortion, </a>every song on <i>Sturm und Drang</i> feels like an outburst unmitigated by extraneous tinkering or trials. The production is dense, thin, and minimal, the guitars and drums pushed tight to give all these lyrics extra oomph. The fancy features are limited to a talkbox solo here and a Henry Rollins-like spoken-word bit there. Rather than distract from the hooks, they only reinforce them through contrast. No, <i>Sturm und Drang</i> isn’t a landmark of major-label heavy metal, but it is a reminder of just how very good one of its biggest bands can be when they have something to worry about other than trying so hard to be important.</p></div>"|20714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20714-vii-sturm-und-drang/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

Everything you need to know about them is in their name, right? All caps, no spaces. (As opposed to all caps <i>with</i> spaces.) The three members are named UGLYFRANK, Khris P, and EvergreenOne. Both of their releases, and all songs on each, are tagged in the same ALLCAPSNOSPACES fashion. A casual listen reveals a sound that's part-West Coast shit talk, part-<a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a> layered beats, and all brash. You can probably almost hear a song based on these ingredients in your head right now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> And maybe your estimation wouldn't be too far off, but what you would miss would be how charming and fun their music has consistently been, from even before their 2013 self-titled full-length when they were just frequently-hilarious dudes with a Tumblr. Like a glass of water after 10 shots of whiskey, ILLFIGHTYOU's <i>CASHINTHEBATHROOM</i> EP chases this year's glut of serious-minded spring and summer hip-hop albums. Two years after their debut, the appeal of ILLFIGHTYOU is even more apparent—they sound effortless, and they're clearly having a blast. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Khris P and UGLYFRANK trade verses with the temerity (if not complexity) that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"">Clipse</a> so much fun, or the 2014 model of Rich Gang so electrifying. And ILLFIGHTYOU's sound definitely owes a lot to not just Clipse, but a lot of mid-'00s Pharrell work: think of the line Fam-Lay toed between menacing and joyful. FRANK grounds the music with a delivery that's both deadpan and knives-out (the first verse on the album includes vivid images like ""sniffing coke up in the movie theater"" and ""I'm angry and hella faded, I'm flipping vehicles back"") but also works as Khris's logical foil: Khris has a naturally mercurial voice and he covers more territory, delivering the line ""stacking turkey burgers on my damn plate"" and bragging about having your girl in his mentions all in the same verse. His flow is so natural that ""Oracle"" fades with him still rapping: The sense you get is of having caught a tantalizing glimpse of a guy with better things to do than rap this effortlessly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""FLASH"" is the best song here, opening with Bill Paxton's famous line from <i>Aliens</i>, ""game over, man, game over!"" It contains my favorite line, Frank's ""Had a dream I got murked and bought a ticket to heaven/ Nah I woke up, popped a perc and I purchased another necklace,"" which somehow interpolates a dark, self-effacing <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> line from ""Can't Tell Me Nothin'"" into something even darker. The line is punctuated by Khris yelling ""hey!"" in the background, underlining how much fun these guys are having trading verses. And then the chorus riffs on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P800UWoE9xs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tribe's ""Award Tour""</a> just because it can. The recipe is simple, but potent: <span>casual irreverence with a pinch of nihilism.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-35197e10-bd8f-c2b2-3ff2-778415844f9d""><span>In 2015, with the Internet bubble of ""weird rappers"" giving way to either novelty hits like ""CoCo"", the pop appeal of ""Trap Queen"", or whatever the Awful Records guys feel like doing, ILLFIGHTYOU occupy an interesting middle space: their in-house produced beats knock and sound 0f-the-moment, but the in-jokes and hooks have an almost throwback appeal to them. It's helpful to have someone around to remind you that rap doesn't have to be so dark to make an impression or communicate something meaningful, and in this context ILLFIGHTYOU are surprisingly refreshing. When the last time you heard it like that?</span></span></p></div>"|20827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20827-cashinthebathroom-ep/|7.1|Matthew Ramirez

In a genre often pigeonholed as repetitive and raw, Roc's production style throughout his nearly 15 years in the game has maintained a fine balance between streamlined minimalism and organized chaos. He favors clarity over experimentation for its own sake, and often, his tracks are formatted in the style of a pop or rap song, with distinct bridges, choruses, pre-choruses. His 2010 <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a> debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14868-da-trak-genious-the-crack-capone/""><i>The Crack Capone</i></a>, was one of the first great footwork full-lengths, a subtle and often overlooked gem from the era in which footwork began to seep into the global dance underground.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His latest, <i>Practice What U Preach</i>, is a concise, eight-track mini-album on Swiss footwork label <a href=""http://www.duckncover.co/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duck 'N Cover Records</a>. More than any other footwork release this year, it's a study in control, all of its rough edges polished into sharp points. Roc's strong suit has always been deft, tricky sample manipulation. He has a keen eye for detail, and a knack for successfully juxtaposing clips that seemingly shouldn't work: on <i>Crack Capone</i>, he made Kid Cudi's hokey Lady Gaga-sampling ""Make Her Say"" barely recognizable, interspersed Evanescence with the ""Twilight Zone"" theme and crunk adlibs, and gave edge to Robin Thicke's pillow-soft ""Lost Without U"". The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3gge17rub0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>latter track</span></a> remains one of Roc's best, and its ethos—making easy listening just a touch harder—guides much of <i>Practice What U Preach</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The title track is built around an extended sample of Barry White's 1994 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br-Dy3puDoc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>song</span></a> of the same name, and serves as the ultimate example of Roc's eye for raw material. Halfway through the original, White's delivery edges just slightly out of time on the pre-chorus, chopping up his own rhythm in real time in a pattern that uncannily suggests footwork. It's a window into Roc's seemingly gut-driven sampling instincts; elsewhere, on ""The Worst"", he molds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a>'s mellow break-up song of the same title into something desperate and urgent. ""Lowend Unity"", a shout-out to the Low End neighborhood on Chicago's south side, gathers choppy snares and syrupy sax solos into neat, tight knots and then lets them unravel and ride out. It's the smoothest a footwork album's sounded in 2015, though it's not without its moments of catharsis: ""Destruction"" pounds organ loops into Lex Luger-style blasts, a battle track in the Spartan sense. Roc's style has often intersected with hip-hop, albeit never quite as overtly as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>'s (though he is perhaps the only footwork producer to have been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQxJok47RI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sampled</span></a> multiple times by <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>).</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-75bda405-c1ea-bfd5-ccd6-97d058deb97b"">But Roc's a juke producer as much as he is a footwork producer, and perhaps his closest parallel is to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32657-dj-slugo/"">DJ Slugo</a>, the juke pioneer with whom he's frequently collaborated. Both make finely crafted, approachable, and surprisingly subtle tracks that know when to build momentum and when to let things unfold organically. ""Ready or Not"", a sleek but dramatic orchestral juke track, is perhaps the album's best demonstration of how much Roc can do with so few components, its intricate structure a counter to anyone who still thinks footwork tracks are simple. </span></p></div>"|20832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20832-practice-what-u-preach/|7.5|Meaghan Garvey

Thanks to multi-disc box sets that have unearthed all the (thrilling) studio sessions that went into iconic fusion albums such as <i>In a Silent Way</i>, <i>Bitches Brew</i>, <i>Jack Johnson</i>, and <i>On the Corner</i>—as well as Columbia's more recent focus on unissued live performances in its Miles Davis <i>Bootleg Series</i>—the trumpeter-composer has remained an ever-renewable resource in the catalog. (If the branding reminds you of the label's back-pages approach to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, you're not wrong.)</p>
<p>On the whole, this feels appropriate, especially when the artist under consideration created and then ditched exciting new stylistic languages with Picasso-like abandon. But a nagging question also hovers around each new deluxe set to come off the 21st Century assembly line: How long can the party last, before we get into the realm of record-company rehash?</p>
<p>Unlike ""Bootleg Series"" sets that are more easily understood as essential, this four-disc volume strides through different decades of the Davis story. So at the outset, we get crisp, acoustic-instrument performances of tunes like ""'Round Midnight"", while at the far end of the box, we're delivered to the high-humidity atmospheres of the rock-tinged, experimental funk of Davis' 1970s lineups. The set's connecting thread is the Newport Jazz Festival—the legendary, still-running summer concert stage that Davis first stepped onto in 1955 (as a member of a brief ""All-Star Jam"" that included <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thelonious Monk</a>). Later in that decade, Davis took a hard-bop sextet (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Evans</a>) to Newport, not long before it went into the studio to cut <i>Kind of Blue</i>.</p>
<p>Are these early Davis appearances at Newport classic? Of course. But in the main, the music on the first disc of this box has been available for a while. As has a nearly half-hour portion of this volume's third disc (recently included on the album <i>Bitches Brew Live</i>). Moreover, while Davis certainly made a point of getting his various groups to the Newport festival—both its U.S. and foreign-touring iterations—there's little sense that the destination much influenced his fast-moving aesthetic development. (Unlike, say, the post-Summer of Love concerts at the Fillmore collected in the third Davis <i>Bootleg Series</i> release.)</p>
<p>So instead of being wall-to-wall necessary, this <i>Bootleg Series</i> edition is simply three-quarters-revelatory. But what is legitimately <i>new</i> here is as good as anything else in the Davis-rarity series. The second disc gives us multiple, intense sets by the trumpeter's ""second great quintet,"" which traveled to Newport in both 1966 and 1967. The back-to-back sequencing of these performances shows how fast Davis' music was developing, even from within a particular lineup. (Compare the thrashing, second version of ""Gingerbread Boy"", from the 1967 date, to the more restrained 1966 iteration.) And the final disc's rarely-heard 1971 band—including Keith Jarrett on electric piano—puts its own spin on some of Davis' most familiar fusion-era tunes (including a cool-strutting ""Bitches Brew"" that leads into a majestic, slow-burning ""Funky Tonk"").</p>
<p>The powerhouse performance in the box, however—a true drop-everything-and-call-your-friends-over-to-listen concert—is a 47-minute stretch on disc three, which puts the spotlight on a 1973 Davis band that would later go on to form the core of the ensemble on the live album <i>Dark Magus</i>. For some connoisseurs, <i>Dark Magus</i> represents Davis' point of peak-fusion—propulsive, densely textured, and grooving. But one thing that recording also has is <i>longueurs</i>. (It was a double-album, after all.) The 1973 gig included in this box isn't just more compact, it's nervier, too.</p>
<p>While Pete Cosey's wild electric guitar pyrotechnics sound great on <i>Dark Magus</i>, his playbook of liquid licks also feels fully figured out—it's a command performance by a Davis group member who has had years to drill this particular music. By contrast, his playing on ""Turnaroundphrase"", the opening tune from this newly issued 1973 set, is more darting in nature, and alive with the sound of the guitarist figuring out a way through Davis' ferocious composition. Likewise, soprano saxophonist Dave Liebman—the only acoustic axe in this lineup—sounds as though he's fighting his way toward a state of audibility. When his keening playing joins up with Davis's own wah-wah-enhanced trumpet moans, the sound reaches flourishes of intensity that rival (and perhaps eclipse) those on <i>Dark Magus</i>. (The 1973 set is such a different-sounding beast, it hardly matters that its setlist is largely similar to that of the latter album.)</p>
<p>The liner notes included with this <i>Bootleg Series</i> release refer to Davis' ""heath challenges"" during this period, and his reduced range on the trumpet. And yet the 1973 gig still shows Davis' bandleading and arranging skills to be working at a high level, hard living be damned. Despite the fact that those talents weren't intimately connected to the Newport Festival, particularly, they lend this box set a stable, running theme—whether Davis is leading his sextet with Coltrane, his second quintet, or else the various fusion lineups represented here. You can quibble with the inclusion of familiar material in a <i>Bootleg Series</i> package, but you can't argue—not yet, at least—with the unreleased depths of the Davis vault.</p></div>"|20816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20816-miles-davis-at-newport-1955-1975-the-bootleg-series-vol-4/|8.0|Seth Colter Walls

Lizzy Plapinger and Max Hershenow met as Vassar students, after Plapinger started the label <a href=""http://neongoldrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon Gold</a> as a thesis project. They rolled out the <i>Candy Bar </i><i>Creep Show</i> EP on Tumblr in 2012, and their followup debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17776-ms-mr-secondhand-rapture/""><i>Secondhand Rapture</i></a> came with ""visual treatments"" for all of its songs. Their song titles often feel like songwriting-workshop prompts (""Dark Doo Wop""). Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28730-marina-and-the-diamonds/"">Marina and the Diamonds</a>, MS MR offer pop that strives to hit its marks and offer something further: the viral hit and reactionary think piece about it, all in one.</p>
<p><i>How Does It Feel</i> is their second full-length album, and the larger sense that they’re a smartly conceived rollout plan in search of indelible songs has never really stopped dogging them. They <i>seemed</i> interesting in 2012, and they <i>seem</i> interesting in 2015. But the songs don’t speak the same subversive and interesting language of their publicity. Plapinger is a powerful singer, someone who very much sounds like she belongs perched on footlights. But the aesthetics of her songs with Hershenow remain timid and careful: There are no mind-warping sounds to match the visual boldness of their videos, and none of Plapinger’s lyrics have the crisp, memorable economy of her album and song titles. If pop art traffics first in unforgettable iconography, then MS MR fail the basic test: You could be listening to other people when you are listening to MS MR, and it’s often easy to imagine that you are.</p>
<p>If there are no calling-card songs here here, there are several solid ones: ""Painted"" turns Plapinger’s tense, brittle recitation of the words ""What did he <i>think</i> would happen"" into a rhythmic tattoo. The song seems to be accelerating slightly for its entire length, obsessive irritation gathering force. On ""No Guilt in Pleasure"" (another one of those mission-statement style song titles), tiny thumb pianos share space with tarmac-sized synths, while Plapinger dips into the throaty, throbbing lower end of her register. In general, MS MR have a much better feel for ""small, tense, and interesting"" than they do for ""big and soaring""—the verses crackle with friction and ideas, while the choruses taste generic. When ""No Guilt in Pleasure"" and ""Wrong Victory"" scale up into their Big Hooks, the flavor drains out of the music as the volume builds. </p>
<p>Plapinger’s lyrics also often clunk where they should soar. The synth-pop ""Tunnels"" builds a cool and autumnal atmosphere, but Plapinger trips through it with wordy lines like ""Silence and motion on this quiet tread/ Searching for lanes that don’t lead to the end."" They are conversational in a way that fights the basic impulse of pop lyrics, which is to distill emotions to a fine point. You can usually hear the semicolons in Plapinger’s lyrics, which struggle to wedge layered impressions and fleeting thoughts into the stark, four-color backdrops of the music. This is often a problem when you approach a genre—in MS MR’s case, pop music—with the stated intention of subverting or commenting on it. Genre writing is a complex enough game all by itself. Unless you are blessed with some illuminating thunderclap of genius, your efforts to ""subvert"" those tropes usually just renders them inert.</p></div>"|20824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20824-how-does-it-feel/|6.0|Jayson Greene

It's still the only one to ever dent the charts' upper reaches. There are almost a million Welsh speakers in the UK, but Welsh-language music struggles for recognition outside of Wales. At worst, it's treated as a novelty, a fate that you can only hope doesn't befall Cardiff-born Gwenno Saunders' debut solo album, reissued this week on <a href=""http://www.heavenlyrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavenly</a> after its initial appearance on local label <a href=""peski.co.uk"">Peski</a> last year.</p>
<p><i>Y Dydd Olaf</i> is named for Welsh author Owain Owain's 1976 sci-fi novel in which world-conquering robots turn humans into clones. Nine of its songs are in Welsh while the closing track is in Cornish, which is supposedly the primary language of around 600 people. Saunders used to front kitsch girl-group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4855-the-pipettes/"">the Pipettes</a>, which she recently dismissed as ""playing a role that had already been written."" <i>Y Dydd Olaf</i> also plays into an entrenched role—the gentle Welsh-language pop revolutionary set out by the likes of SFAs and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1768-gorkys-zygotic-mynci/"">Gorky's Zygotic Mynci</a>—but it's a natural fit for Saunders, who establishes herself as a visionary of synth-pop moods and textures.</p>
<p>Owain's original story is confined to the title track and ""Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki"", which isn't Welsh, but the nonsense words that his characters start spouting when cyborg forces corrupt their minds. Owain's protagonist, however, retains his individualism by writing diary entries in Welsh, which stops the robots from getting inside his head. Saunders uses that concept to underpin a record about the importance of preserving cultural identity in order to resist corporate death—which in turn, only a relatively tiny audience will actually be able to understand. English notes accompanying the album translate songs that explore the artist's role in a downtrodden society, and the way that technology gives misogyny yet another platform, which compounds the problem of sexism in minority cultures that still promote traditional gender roles. Saunders confronts Cardiff's unimaginative civic planning and highlights the dependable march of nature, weighing up the clash between old and new worlds.</p>
<p>For those without crib notes or a native ear, the idea of language-as-protector shines through in the intimate soundscape that Saunders creates along with her producer husband (and Peski boss) Rhys Edwards. Her palette is <i>kosmische</i>, recalling the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, but her soft-edged synths, intermingling with field recordings from Cardiff Bay, makes her evocation of space domestic and comforting, like a transmission from a house party on the moon. She has a tendency to stick to one song structure: her languid take on that gorgeously hushed language sits atop an insistent guitar or synth part that spirals somewhere heavenly in the chorus.</p>
<p>The magic, though, is in the spellbinding tones she weaves throughout. The piano on opener ""Chwyldro"" (revolution) sounds bent and worn, and guides out Cornish closer ""Amser"" (time). ""Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki"" sounds like a forlorn death disco for Owain's doomed population. ""Stwff"" starts with a bright piano recalling the swirl of a French carousel, or Nino Rota's sweeter film scores, though it comes to feel as disquieting as the drowned lounge band swing that underpins ""Calon Peiriant"" (the heart of the machine).</p>
<p>On ""Stwff"", a song about growing up and learning how to fit in, Saunders sings (in Welsh): ""I can only apologize for feeling the frustration/ Young and ambitious in a minority culture/ I joined the middle but it didn't really impress me."" Her treatise on the importance of staying true to your identity finds extra weight in the fact that she tried to live another way and came back, shaken up by the loss she felt during her pop outing. <i>Y Dydd Olaf</i> is a crucial minority language record, but Saunders' beguiling melodies and execution also make it one of the best British debuts of 2015.</p></div>"|20765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20765-y-dydd-olaf/|8.0|Laura Snapes

The suffix ""ly"" in the name ""Earthly"", for instance, nods subtly to how this pair of North Carolina noisemakers create music not necessarily <i>of</i> Earth but cobble together fragments from their terrestrial experience into a rough resemblance. The album title may account for the sheer amount of time ex-college roommates Edaan Brook and Brint Hansen have spent together, working through school, hanging out at home, writing songs, or just getting to know each other. You can hear that time in <i>Days</i>—the lifeblood of its tracks is an endless collection of samples that would've taken years to assemble, let alone arrange into music—and sense that close friendship, too. Look at the cover: two strange, colorful faces stare blankly, content to simply be in the same place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But maybe that's all a bit too serious for music like this, because if nothing else, </span><i>Days</i><span> wants to have fun. Earthly finger paints with found sound, plays tag with sequencers, jumps rope with drum machines, seesaws with FX pedals, and pigs out on bubblegum melody. You can imagine sing-songy opener ""RGB"" as the theme for a CGI </span>""Rugrats""<span> reboot, or ""Ice Cream""'s carnival bounce as a Cartoon Network interlude. One particularly exuberant track is straight-up called ""Games"", and though it wastes no time dropping PlayStation samples into its iridescent chords, the music plays like an anthem for indoor kids who discovered their kindred spirits at noise shows and dance parties. </span><i>Days</i><span> doesn't make you feel like a kid so much as it reminds you how great it can be to act like one.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Surrealist as they are, Brook and Hansen frequently dip into the uncanny valley, and it's where their best ideas are found. Not unlike <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"">Holly Herndon</a>, vocals are chopped and pitched into tuneful glossolalia, occasionally allowed to speak in daffy non sequiturs. And it's often impossible to discern exactly what other sounds Earthly recorded, dismantled, and pieced back together for any given track. Was that a pan flute fluttering in the background of ""Honison Climber""? Did they sample a soda commercial for ""RGB""? You may want to pick apart the layers, but it's better to soak in the frenzy; all those moving parts would be nonsense on their own, but together amount to a baffling electronic spectacle.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-11503e73-b983-5e09-2701-355894068bcb"">It's unlikely you'll hear another album like <i>Days</i> this year, but it's not without predecessors. The influence of early aughts psych noise courses through the music, as if it's a love child conceived during the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> tour. But the offspring has grown independently, learning to speak its own language with new slang and more deliberate syntax. The sound resembles fellow audio collagists in places—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28032-javelin/"">Javelin</a>'s playful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14115-no-mas/""><i>No Mas</i></a>, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"">Prefuse 73</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"">Matmos</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"">the Books</a> are all here. But throughout the record, Brook and Hansen discover new ways to surprise and thrill, making unexpected turns with each consecutive track. Even low-slung drifts and beatless shimmers aren't off limits in their topsy-turvy digital funhouse. Maybe ""balanced noise album"" is an oxymoron, but so is ""adult playground.""

But rarely do we think of records as <i>records</i>: documents of specific places, times, people, ideas. <i>Watkins Family Hour</i> accurately falls under both of those definitions. It’s an eponymous album born out of the monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean and Sara Watkins at Los Angeles’ Largo for more than a decade. Now, with this record, those of us outside L.A. can finally get a peek at what they’ve been up to each month.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Watkins were best known in the early 2000s for their band <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_Creek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nickel Creek</a>, a progressively minded roots trio that took tradition and imbued it with new energy that earned them a Grammy and a large international following. The band’s frontman and mandolin player Chris Thile has gone on to earn more acclaim than his bandmates in the decade since they called it quits (save for a record and reunion tour last year), but the Watkins are no slouches: guitarist Sean remains a tremendously skilled flatpicker, while Sara’s songwriting and fiddling has always been sharp. They’ve both put these chops front and center on the solo records they’ve released over the years.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Watkins Family Hour</i>, an 11-track LP comprised entirely of cover songs, feels like it could’ve been a live recording at any one of the group’s Largo conventions. They begin with Robert Earl Keen’s ""Feelin’ Good Again"", a mellow celebration of finding unexpected moments of joy. It’s an appropriate opening for a record that feels analogous to a live experience: it’s the obligatory ""Hey, welcome everyone, we’re so happy to be here."" From there, <i>Watkins Family Hour</i> arcs across toe-tapping numbers—some faster, some slower—before closing with the ""fare thee well"" reprises in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Grateful Dead</a>’s ""Brokedown Palace"". All that’s missing is stage banter and some between-song tuning.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While the Watkins siblings lend their name to the marquee, the Watkins Family Hour has always operated under an open-ended definition of ""family."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"">Fiona Apple</a> is perhaps the brightest star of the fold on the album, though she never eclipses her cohorts. It’s a pleasant surprise to hear Apple flex her vocal might in a genre outside her usual realm with ""Where I Ought to Be"", and her execution is immensely satisfying. Where Skeeter Davis leaned more toward self-pity on her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB2z3jYn5rY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original 1961 recording</a>, Apple’s vocals streak the song with anger and hurt, breaking the record’s overall complacent tone. ""Hop High"", with Sara Watkins taking the vocal lead, injects the back half of the album with more intrigue as a cautious introduction yields to fiery fiddle licks. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, <i>Watkins Family Hour</i> hits a number of country and Americana sweet spots: there’s the plaintive ballad ""She Thinks I Still Care"", the mournful drinking tune ""King of the Twelve Oz. Bottles"". And while they also include a Roger Miller song, they made an unexpected choice from his catalog: ""Not in Nottingham"" is from Disney’s 1973 movie <i>Robin Hood</i>. Greg Leisz’s pedal steel buoys the record throughout—that instrument can help songs soar with a twangy breeziness or damn them to goofy ""Hyuck, howdy-y’all!"" hell. Similarly, Benmont Tench’s honky-tonk organ and piano contributions are welcome additions to the arrangements.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When bands we like cover songs we love, our best hope to relive those special moments is usually through sideways videos recorded on cell phones and uploaded to YouTube. But with this crystalline collection, <i>Watkins Family Hour</i> offers a more compelling insight.</p></div>"|20821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20821-watkins-family-hour/|7.4|Allison Hussey

Their most recent restraint has proven trickier because it essentially translates to ""Wilco"". Between the self-conscious retromania of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13237-wilco-the-album/""><i>Wilco (The Album)</i></a> and the self-produced, self-released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15856-wilco/""><i>The Whole Love</i></a>, their last two LPs strove for comprehensiveness, containment, cohesion. They were rightly received as ""Wilco being Wilco"" and offered ""something for everyone"" except potential new listeners, drawing boundaries around their old ideas. In a concrete way, Wilco’s ninth studio LP <i>Star Wars</i> is their most accessible and least demanding, a free download equalizing the Wilco evangelist and those who swore they’d never pay one red cent for their music.  <i>Star Wars</i> is also Wilco’s shortest and least agenda-driven album since their debut, two things that actually lend it a novelty that endures beyond its instantaneous release.</p>
<p>For its first minute or so, <i>Star Wars</i> sounds like a record Wilco might have been <i>required</i> to give away for free. The skronking opener ""EKG"" has drawn valid comparisons to both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth"">Sonic Youth</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/260-aids-wolf/"">AIDS Wolf</a>, though it’s one of Wilco’s least jarring experiments in instrumental noise<span>—</span>compare it to the 15-minute migraine simulation of ""Less Than You Think"" or ""Poor Places"" submerging in a drowning pool of static and ""EKG"" is downright charming. It’s the first thing you might expect to hear from a band trying to familiarize themselves with each other after their longest break between records. It’s playful rather than confrontational, deflates any kind of self-importance projected on the band, and aligns with the $0 asking price, lawsuit-baiting title, and feline cover art<span>—</span>this record is loose, low-stakes, and fun, adjectives that no one has used to describe Wilco since <i>Being There</i>.</p>
<p>That’s something of a feint. <i>Star Wars</i> bears many signifiers of an off-the-cuff recording<span>—</span>the second-longest track is 3:50, and most are filled with all manner of ""what’s this pedal do?"" sound effects. The topsy-turvy glam-folk of ""More…"" becomes cemented in thick distortion, a theremin-like squeal seeps through the otherwise subdued ""Taste the Ceiling"", ""Where Do I Begin"" backflips into a coda of reversed drums. But think back on a decade of Wilco songs that regularly rode triple-guitar soloing past five minutes and ask if <i>Star Wars</i> is <i>really</i> the sound of them jamming. This is Wilco at their most concise and airtight; the frayed edges, loose wires, and sonic pockmarks are all considered decisions coming from a group of technical wizards with unconventional tastes that treat post-production like a tattoo artist, engaging in very detailed and skillful defacement.</p>
<p>Any discernible influence is unlikely, but<i> Star Wars</i> could be heard as a long-awaited convergence with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon"">Spoon</a>, the band who overtook Wilco as America’s most reliable and subtly inventive band in the studio. As with<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13839-transference/"">Transference</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10390-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga/"">Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</a>,</i> <i>Star Wars</i> scans as pop songwriting and rock music, though devoid of blunt force and obsessed with tactility, right down to the word choices. As with ""War on War"" and ""Impossible Germany"", ""Random Name Generator"" takes a phonetically catchy, abstruse phrase and repeats it until it becomes an unshakeable hook. It’s a veritable sonic topographic map, every single instrument close mic’d and enlarged to show texture: Tweedy’s comforting and disheveled vocals are audio two-day stubble, drums get dipped in bristling flange, you can pick out exactly which pedals on Nels Cline’s effects board are being used.</p>
<p><i>Star Wars</i> quickly develops its sonic character, and if it must have a label, ""mini-rock"" suffices. For one thing, these are the most compact and aerodynamic Wilco songs, aligning with a host of new-to-<i>them </i>glam precedents who punctured rock’s chest-puffing machismo. The pinched EQ’ing and stylishly sheared fuzz riffs of ""Random Name Generator"" tips a top hat to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"">T. Rex</a>; the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>-al ""Pickled Ginger"" removes the ""blues"" from 12-bar blues and replaces it with post-punk rigidity and blacked-out negative space; ""You Satellite"" continuously wraps itself in seemingly endless layers of high-thread count bedsheets, recalling the unsavory reveries of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a>.</p>
<p>And while nothing on <i>Star Wars</i> can cut you into ribbons the way ""Via Chicago"" or ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" or ""At Least That’s What You Said"", it's piercing and subtle enough to get under your skin. Compared to the sadsack reflections on domestication of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/""><i>Sky Blue Sky</i></a>, <i>Star Wars</i> strikes at a kind of empty nester fatalism signified by the ""separate, but together"" connection of ""Where Do I Begin"", or, more succinctly—""We’re so alone/ We’re never alone."" The narrative of <i>Star Wars</i> is driven by a fluid mix of devotion, commitment, and stubbornness, three qualities that are related but not synonymous. ""I could never leave behind the part of me that you refuse,"" is the sort of thing you might hear from a couple who are comfortable enough to snipe at one another, while, ""Why can’t we tell when we’re in hell?/ Why can’t I say something to make you well?"" speaks to the desperation underlying most prickly jokes. ""Taste the Ceiling"" hard-sells the LP’s most important lyric, the one that attests to unusual urgency of <i>Star Wars</i>: ""Why do our disasters always creep so slowly into view?"" Perhaps disasters are always in the frame, but judging from the communication failures and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPqQ2AWShqc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">speakers-speaking-in-code</a> that goes on here, it's more likely they don't get called for what they are until its too late.</p>
<p>While you never can really tell with a lyricist as cryptic and elliptical as Tweedy, <i>Star Wars</i> hints at a congruence between his own cautious confessions and Wilco’s sensible risks<span>—while this could just be a dry run for a conventionally released ""event"", the fact that they're challenging themselves is rewarding enough on its own.</span> Though <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> was met with the coolest reception of any Wilco album, it’s the one that remains the most interesting since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/""><i>A Ghost Is Born</i></a><span>—</span>like every record from Wilco’s elite run that spanned the kaleidoscopic roots-rock archive of <i>Being There</i> to <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>’s abstract Americana, it was fully committed to an idea Wilco hadn’t tried before. Because Wilco sounds about 85% committed to a truly new idea, <i>Star Wars</i> is their strongest record in a decade; and if Wilco have another truly great one in them, history strongly suggests it’ll be devoted to sounding nothing like <i>Star Wars.</i></p></div>"|20838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20838-star-wars/|7.7|Ian Cohen

You can trace a line between his MPC rips of vinyl back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>'s zonked-out tapestries on <i>Madvillainy</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/989-daedelus/"">Daedelus</a>' surrealist lounge music for <i>The Weather</i>. But over the past few years, and especially in 2015 through projects like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20456-jeremiah-jae-lorange-the-night-took-us-in-like-family/""><i>The Night Took Us In Like Family</i></a> (the latter made with L.A. rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30428-jeremiah-jae/"">Jeremiah Jae</a>), the man who bears the same name as Gilbert Bécaud's 1964 French chanson has cobbled something unique. On his best work, he stacks his snatches of vocals into something approaching a narrative, adding bebop and exotica tones and keeping rhythmic tension from slumping.</p>
<p>His second project this year finds him collaborating with Kool Keith on <i>Time? Astonishing!</i> Structurally, it's an adventure, heavy on vague metaphysics and B-movie ramblings about space travel. One of its charms is hearing L'Orange adapt his sound to fit the mercurial Kool Keith's style. He abandons the ornamental quirkiness of <i>The Night</i> in favor of yearning melodies, like the melancholy guitar loop of ""Twenty Fifty Three"", or the choral harmony and dusty jazz piano od ""Meanwhile Back Home"". The vocal samples are still there, though. On ""This New World"", he layers ""underwater"" effects onto a snippet of Flavor Flav asking, ""What goes on?"" and makes it resemble an outtake from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBVNOrV0Pr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Parliament's ""Aqua Boogie""</a>.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Keith, listeners will note parallels to his vaunted <i>Dr. Octagonecologyst</i>, especially when it comes to the bludgeoning, Automator-inspired bass thump of ""Dr. Bipolar"". However, <i>Time</i> might hew closer to Keith's criminally underrated 2006 collaboration with Tom C, <i>Project Polaroid</i>, which also found him speaking in a halting delivery, underlining the weight of his words. Here, it seems as if he's floating through the music, then going silent as it swirls around him. His restrained performance pays the most dividends on ""The Wanderer"", where he bends together incongruent images in his familiar Bronx drawl: ""The structure of combat is like Wrestlemania contracts/ Genetics make the eye contact/ Shaggy mister boom back denim/ I have nothing to prove in slacks."" Then there's his bizarre battle rap on ""I Need Out of This World"": ""Come again if you're a male with a fitted wearing a toupee/ I can get you an inside job wearing daishikis.""</p>
<p>Keith's deliberate opacity and ""upper-class penmanship"" is trailed by a panoply of guests. On ""The Traveler"", he drops a tantalizing verse—""See the cerebrum, how fast I'm passin'""—and then cedes the spotlight to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2154-j-live/"">J-Live</a>, who ""disappear like I never here."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2850-mr-lif/"">Mr. Lif</a> hijacks ""Twenty Fifty Three"" with Boston-accented super-scientifical madness. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"">Open Mike Eagle</a> tackles ""Meanwhile, Back Home"" alone, with Keith nowhere to be heard. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29674-blu/"">Blu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/296-mc-paul-barman/"">MC Paul Barman</a> (of all people), and <a href=""https://mindsone.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MindsOne</a><span>—</span>individually, they range from serviceable to splendid. But cumulatively, they distract from the chemistry between the album's two main performers. Then again, perhaps Kool Keith and L'Orange are satisfied with conjuring a mood of amusingly hallucinatory hip-hop that lasts just over 30 minutes, and then evaporates like a pleasurable high. Whether it will be remembered as <i>Time</i> passes remains to be seen.</p></div>"|20817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20817-time-astonishing/|6.8|Mosi Reeves

Along with glo-fi, seapunk, witch house, and a host of other disyllabic hashtags, ""night bus"" was derided during the great microgenre boom of the early 2010s—irrefutable evidence, it was thought, of the Internet's insistence upon inter-genre incest. But unlike a lot of its contemporaries, night bus was never as easy to define as influence + influence or adjective + genre. Named after a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a> track but as easily applied to the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"">50 Cent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23572-the-eurythmics/"">the Eurythmics</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a>, night bus was more a tone or a mood than a genre in and of itself. It was often categorized as midtempo, minimalist post-dubstep—trip-hop, sort of—but its proponents always stretched it to more disparate moods and eras. As someone drawn to those touchpoints, it was nice to finally have a name for it all, an easy-enough way to connect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>, ""Twin Peaks"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Canadian electronic producer CFCF, too, has always been attached to night bus—he was a frequent poster on the message boards that birthed the term, and his 2010 mix <i>Do U Like Night Bus</i> helped crystallize the breadth of music to which it might be applied. He has, in the intervening years, stretched that mixtape into a trilogy of nocturnal, reflective volumes, including last November's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/cfcf/night-bus-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Night Bus 3</i></a>, which was knowingly subtitled ""Death of Night Bus"", as if in acknowledgment that, yea, all microgenres must pass. This is probably just as well. A couple years after its invention, night bus is the last standing of its contemporaries—and yet CFCF will not let it go softly. Even his proper studio records can feel like academic experiments within the night bus aesthetic, further defying its easy categorization by leaning into its applications in quiet storm (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18663-cfcf-outside/""><i>Outside</i></a>) or minimalism (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18281-cfcf-music-for-objects-ep/""><i>Music for Objects</i></a>).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All of which is to say that, while the largely acoustic, ambient <i>Radiance and Submission</i> is the furthest afield CFCF's projects have ever gotten from his midtempo electronic roots, it still feels of a piece with his discography. The mood remains nocturnal, even if the bus has made its way out of the city and now rattles through a pitch-black desert. This is sparse, windswept music, full of warm, circling guitar plucks, gathering echoes, and long, slow fades. Like all of CFCF's music, it is exquisite in its details, as when the haze of cicadas buzzing throughout ""Tethered in Dark"" finds a rhythm in a palm-muted riff, all before receding back into the fog of circling insects. There are surprises, too, if subtle ones: ""La Soufrière"" begins with a similar naturalistic buzz, but halfway through blooms into something startlingly songlike. It's one of the shortest tracks on a short album, but, as with recent short-players by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>, <i>Radiance and Submission</i> holds together thanks to the clarity of its vision.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This patient, almost painterly approach to songcraft has always defined CFCF's work, which might on other records have faded in instead with soft synthesizers before five minutes of smart, pulsing boom-bap. Over 60 minutes, this meticulousness could all feel a bit too polished, but <i>Radiance and Submission</i> bucks that by forming itself entirely out of the interstitial moments. The establishing shots and denouements of his compositions are here turned into the raw material for something strange and fascinating and (for him, at least) new. He has mentioned Chris Marker's indescribable film travelogue <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans_Soleil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sans Soleil</i></a> as an influence in the past, and its compositional method—the reassemblage of the periphery into a focal point—could well be part of it. Night bus was always about intermediary spaces, anyway: a long trip home from a club, an overnight journey spent staring out the window. If there's a through line to the musical works we categorize with the term, it's their quiet ability to transform these lonely moments, to make a pair of headphones not a way of shutting out the world but of letting it in.</span></p></div>"|20757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20757-radiance-and-submission/|6.9|Clayton Purdom

But that's how things have been for decades now—going back to the early 1980s, when guitar-centric composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/454-glenn-branca/"">Glenn Branca</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"">Rhys Chatham</a> started fusing underground rock with post-minimalism. Today, it's common for young conservatory talents to name-check alt-derived noise artists alongside modernists like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>.</p>
<p>In that respect, Columbia University composition grad Mario Diaz de Leon is on-trend: the promotional material for his latest release of chamber pieces cites both Stockhausen as well the abrasion specialists in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes</a>. (Diaz de Leon comes by the latter reference point honestly, having collaborated with group member Nate Young in a duo that goes by the name Standard Deviance One.) When he's not working in chamber-music mode, Diaz de Leon also sometimes goes by the moniker Oneirogen—a guise which finds him splitting his attention between an electric guitar and a synth setup, ultimately creating a wash of doomy chords and spacey soundscapes. It's a sound that can make sense on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a> bill.</p>
<p>What makes Diaz de Leon stand out from his peers, though, is his ability to distill these influences into a balanced aesthetic. Plenty of people can write a one-off ""amplified"" piece for chamber musicians, but few artists have built a language as stable and rewarding as Diaz de Leon's. His first solo-composer album, <i>Enter Houses Of</i>, was released in 2009 on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a>'s <a href=""http://www.tzadik.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tzadik</a> label, and showed him to be adept at weaving opulently distorted electronics with virtuoso acoustic-instrumental parts, written for players drawn from the International Contemporary Ensemble. The noise throbbed with snarling exuberance; the woodwinds doled out haunting harmonies.</p>
<p><i>The Soul Is the Arena</i> is Diaz de Leon's latest chamber-music album since <i>Enter Houses Of, </i>and it's both shorter and more all-encompassing. In three different pieces that collectively stretch just over 40 minutes, he gives listeners two riff-rollercoaster duos and a 20-minute, chamber-band essay of grim, beguiling beauty. The opener, ""Luciform"", is a duo between Diaz de Leon's electronics and flutist Claire Chase (a recent MacArthur ""Genius Grant"" awardee). Over the course of its 13-and-a-half minutes, Chase's flute sometimes often carries the melodic line, while the electronics swoop in big, sine-wave-surfing curves behind her. At other points, Chase's breathy sound is just a complement to the rampaging crunch of the composer's programming. The fast switches are what keep the piece interesting.</p>
<p>The second duo piece is the album's title track, and it asks for Joshua Rubin's bass clarinet to go into reed-squawk mode. (Rubin manages this risky, awkward move with impressive grace.) Later on, the instrumentalist and the pre-engineered sounds partner up for a memorably precise and glitchy passage. The work packs a hell of a lot into nine-and-a-half minutes—so much so that you might need a little bit of a breather. Diaz de Leon has you covered on that count with the album-closing ""Portals Before Dawn"" (on which he plays synths alongside a sextet of instrumentalists from the International Contemporary Ensemble). The composer tried a similar strategy to close out <i>Enter Houses Of</i>, but this longer, more gradually surging and receding composition gets more out of the composer's ambient fascinations. Diaz de Leon hasn't put out an uninteresting release yet, but this compact and wide-ranging album is now the best introduction to his refined feel for instrumental extremity.</p></div>"|20811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20811-the-soul-is-the-arena/|8.0|Seth Colter Walls

Three years and about as many interviews later, the Chicago songwriter remains elusive on his debut album, and yet easier to pin musically: the songs on <i>Many Levels of Laughter</i> are intricate, introspective, and self-contained, while hinting at a world just beyond the scope of the music that’s too dauntingly ordinary to warrant investigating.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While Fernandez crafts a distinctive blend of dextrous, spidery guitars and quivering organ, he’s practically anonymous as a lyricist. The record opens insisting that ""Communication is a waste of time"" and follows the theme. ""Please don’t listen to me,"" he implores on ""Casual Encounter"", as if his presence center-stage were some kind of mistake. ""Read My Mind"" depicts a similar glossophobia within a muted relationship, its ambiguous opening line–""No conversation, and everything is fine""–poised between pre-breakup denial and passive-aggressive petulance. Fernandez is emotionally static, his problems less exclaimed than exhaled, so it’s no surprise when, for stretches of the record, his voice disappears entirely.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically <i>Many Levels <i>of Laughter</i> </i>has a neat breadth: His jauntier, jazzier passages explore the bits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4958-tim-buckley/"">Tim Buckley</a>’s <i>Starsailor</i> that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1126-doldrums/"">Doldrums</a> bypassed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/""><i>Lesser Evil</i></a>, while interlude ""Markers"" deploys curious, playful paddling sounds against an odd, melancholy jingle. His hooks have nuance and charm–you can hear the cognitive cogs whirring behind ""Apophis""’s squiggling organs, the shivery up-strokes in ""Between the Channels"". But even at the record’s most kaleidoscopic, Fernandez sings cautiously, as if each note were subject to stringent security checks before leaving his mouth.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""Break your habits, try a different route,"" he croaks on closer ""Melting Down"", a flash of wishful thinking as eerie, lunar synths orbit an ambling krautrock beat. As if to keep him company, a gently stirring bassline kicks in, heaving itself up the fretboard. The forward momentum is welcome, albeit akin to the </span>flicker of daylight in a dark room as an oscillator fan tickles the curtains. After 30 minutes of cosmic despondence, though, that reprieve almost feels misplaced. Rather than celebrating isolation, Fernandez' songs use the languid, daydreamy haze of bedroom pop to hint at the pathos of wasted life.</p></div>"|20822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20822-many-levels-of-laughter/|6.5|Jazz Monroe

Its <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/images/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">data</a> has been revealing the dwarf planet as an icy, complicated world, still in geological flux, marked by a bright, <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-spacecraft-displays-pluto-s-big-heart-0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heart-shaped feature</a> in the center of much darker terrain. It’s not just an apt parallel for the rapper, who named his expectation-defying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/"">debut</a> after the misunderstood planet: it’s the ultimate symbol for the latest and most relevant phase of Future’s career. The stars have never been more uncannily aligned for the man born Nayvadius Wilburn, the reigning king of Atlanta who’s deployed a trilogy of album-quality mixtapes since last October to recapture some of the goodwill lost as he’s figured out what kind of artist he wanted to be over the past three years.</p>
<p>There’s been a backlash against sophomore album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/""><i>Honest</i></a> in the past year—even Future has distanced himself from the project, which he released before the ugly demise of his relationship with ex-fiancée <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a>. But <i>Honest</i> wasn’t a bad album by any means; it was just confused. It was obvious Future was being tugged in too many directions at once: the sledgehammer street bangers, the poignant lone ranger ballads, the big-name collabs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>. The album’s emotional nucleus was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amcYOPt5v8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Be U""</a>, the ex-romantic’s most stunning love song to date. But it was no coincidence that it saw Future learning to empathize with his partner by literally becoming her, projecting himself onto her being (compare it to the similarly-titled but far less resonant bonus track ""I’ll Be Yours""). He was caught between dissonant identities: the wide-screen romantic who made songs with Miley Cyrus, and the hustler from Little Mexico, Zone 6, who flirted with death on record. ""I think I lost my heartbeat for a second and a half,"" he chanted dispassionately on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka9H41yNw5A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> of <i>Dirty Sprite</i>, the 2011 mixtape to which <i>DS2</i> nods with its title.</p>
<p>""Tried to make me a pop star, and they made a monster,"" Future snarls on ""I Serve the Base"", a skuzzy, fiendish track that busts down <i>DS2</i>’s doors early, its Metro Boomin beat built around what sounds like a sacrificial lamb’s last minutes of life. That pivot from hero to villain is the album’s central conceit, the culmination of the journey from <i>Monster</i>’s wounded hedonism to the numb howl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/""><i>56 Nights</i></a>. The cruel irony is that Future was great at being a pop star, at least in a mercenary sense; <i>Pluto</i>, with its glossy ballads about looking for love with a flashlight, remains one of the best major label rap debuts of the last five years. But he remained visibly uncomfortable in the spotlight, stepping out in matching designer with Ciara like Atlanta’s begrudging Montague.</p>
<p>There is no such self-consciousness on <i>DS2</i>. Its universe is bleak and unforgiving, a redemption story for a man who is certain it’s too late for his soul to be redeemed; instead of a triumphal arc, we burrow deeper and deeper into Future’s dystopia. Before we hear his voice at all, on intro track ""Thought It Was a Drought"", we hear the slosh of codeine stirred into soda, the dull snap of ice cubes crackling in styrofoam. The only songs that resemble anything like radio hits are mostly pre-released and relegated to the bonus tracks (""Fuck Up Some Commas"", ""Trap Niggas""), and the only feature is <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, who does a commendably bitter Future impression on ""Where Ya At"". There is no room for misinterpretation: Future does not want to be your role model. This is music for nihilists, for the reckless, for those who embrace darkness because they don’t see another option.</p>
<p>With his run of post-<i>Honest</i> releases, Future has made it clear who he would like to speak for, and who he is no longer interested in courting, and his recent work is an obvious gesture towards his day-one fanbase who supported him pre-<i>Pluto</i>. Most of the production is handled by Metro Boomin and 808 Mafia’s Southside, with a few appearances from Zaytoven and a small handful of Atlanta trap mainstays. All these guys have an obvious synergy with Future, with whom they’ve worked for years, and their chemistry provides a cohesiveness and clarity of vision missing from his previous two albums.</p>
<p>But as a stylist and a technical rapper, Future’s operating on a level unmatched in his five-year discography, early mixtapes and all. As a storyteller, he’s evolved considerably, his lyrics crystallizing into a specific poetry. ""A product of them roaches in them ashtrays/ I inhale the love on a bad day/ Baptized inside purple actavis,"" he raps on ""I Serve the Base"". Miniscule yet significant details come into crisp focus, like a series of tightly framed, disorienting closeups. On ""Kno the Meaning"", which doubles as an oral history of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20166-future-beast-mode/""><i>Beast Mode</i></a> and <i>56 Nights</i> tapes, we meet his Uncle Ronnie who washed cars and Uncle Don who robbed banks, snapshots of the men he once looked up to. Future was always straightforward, never ashamed to confess his depression or infatuation, but the narratives never felt so focused, nuanced, or vulnerable than here.</p>
<p>Lucidity is a poignant theme in his recent work, since he seems to be constantly seeking to escape it. For Future, razor-sharp memory is a curse, one that even month-long benders cannot break. (He spells this out on ""Hardly"", one of <i>Monster</i>’s more underrated tracks; ""Hardly, hardly, hardly forget anything,"" he croaks, obsessing over moments with a deceased friend.) Thus is the strange and singular beauty of <i>DS2</i>, as ugly as its themes may be: it is at once detail-oriented and hazy, painfully coherent while advocating against coherence, creating an atmosphere like club spotlights piercing through fog machine and blunt smoke, or the beam of a lighthouse searching in the dark for a shipwreck.</p>
<p>This dissonance creates the album’s essential tension between what Future literally describes and what he truly feels. ""I pour two zips/ I’m feeling way better,"" he crows on swirling, melodramatic ""Slave Master"". ""Way better,"" here, is fraught with subtext—the transcendent but fleeting relief of giving in to temptation. This isn’t an album that giddily champions substance abuse as a rock star trait, as his Future Hendrix persona once may have. Reckless drug talk and boilerplate trap themes are undercut by incessant bitterness, loathing, and nausea. ""God blessing all the trap niggas"" is more than just a shout-out to people who grew up like he did, it’s a sincere plea.

During these nine tracks, they buoy black metal with kaleidoscopic guitar solos and punctuate cinematic three-piece suites with transfixing synthesizer serenades. Screamed anthems find and then finesse an unexpected threshold between post-metal and post-punk, while some of the band’s most grim vocals ever provide the friction against their most gorgeous and warm musical setting to date. With <i>Infinite Dissolution</i>,<i> </i>Locrian continue a series of impressionistic explorations devoted to apocalyptic apprehension—or ""hymn[s] to the deluge,"" as they put it at one point here. Somehow, though, these soundtracks to oblivion come to feel redemptive and even empowering, like torches made only to work in the most extreme dark.</p>
<p>For half of their career, Locrian were a duo whose hard-shelled hybrids of harsh noise textures and heavy metal structures felt compelling but often stable. Terrence Hannum and André Foisy built bleak expanses of brutal sound, where considerations about technical and cultural obsolescence fought through sheets of dissonance and walls of distortion. Their recordings were aggressive and ruminative, less concerned with acute crescendos than cumulative atmosphere. But in 2010, for the album <i>Crystal World</i>, Locrian enlisted Steven Hess, a Chicago improviser with a long and impressive résumé of collaborative electronic abstraction. The moment was an oxbow: Locrian’s ideas crystallized around the skeleton of Hess’ drums, and their music began to take new shapes and gather sudden speed. Urgency and bravado entered their vocabulary. By the time Locrian issued their full-length <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse</a> debut, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18255-locrain-return-to-annihilation/""><i>Return to Annihilation</i></a>, the trio were able to <a href=""http://chicagoist.com/2013/02/28/locrian_gives_an_update_on_their_re.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talk about the influence of Genesis</a> <i>and</i> make music that offered up evidence.<i> </i> </p>
<p>Despite Locrian’s doomsday obsessions, <i>Infinite Dissolution—</i>much like the last five years of Locrian at large—depends upon a wide-eyed sense of musical wonder. Locrian’s evolution has hinged less on a refinement of their style and more on an expansion of it, so that new influences and impulses operate inside of their general roar.<i> </i>This spirit is obvious from the start of <i>Infinite Dissolution</i>, which exposes facets and folds of Locrian that never before seemed to exist. The brilliant opener ""Arc of Extinction"" begins like a Locrian creeper of not so long ago, with piercing noise and saturating tones shaping a broad drone. Powered by Hess, though, the song steadily escalates, moving from a slow-motion march into a sustained sprint of blast beats. Locrian have touched on black metal before, but here, they perfectly tuck it into their past. The speed animates the animosity. The tumult counters a guitar solo so bright it seems excised from a Rainbow record. The effect is both beautiful and frightening, much like the lyrics of death and rebirth that Hannum sends into the squall.</p>
<p>The brief poem at the center of ""Arc of Extinction"" highlights another crucial element of Locrian’s evolution, because you can <i>barely</i> hear Hannum. Instead, his words are massaged deep into the mix, so that they are part of a whole and not its obvious leading edge. Likewise, during the strangely triumphant ""The Great Dying"", the obvious vocal hook yields the foreground to the band, the chant becoming the de facto bass for a band without one. After a decade together, Hannum and Foisy have erased many of the boundaries between their electronics and electric guitars, their synthesizers and their manipulated shouts. During the dénouement of ""KXL I"", for instance, the strangled riff, static-caked vocals, and screeching circuits congeal into one righteous din, a single symphony of terror. Hess has not only learned their logic but also enhanced it. In the past, ""Heavy Water"" might have been a formless cloud of hazy effects and echoing glissandos, but he gives the record’s cold comedown a pulse and purpose. During <i>Infinite Dissolution</i>, Locrian make very involved music seem effortless, allowing the sound to support the emotion rather than overpower it. That’s what they’ve tried to do for a decade.</p>
<p>In their salad days, Locrian seemed to issue new music constantly. A stream of seven-inches, CD-Rs and cassettes arrived one after another, as though Hannum and Foisy had nowhere else to be for five years. But Hess joined the band, and <a href=""http://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-negative-theology-20140729-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hannum split Chicago for Baltimore</a>. The complicated schedule and the precipitously slower pace have been boons for Locrian. They have had time to incorporate new touchstones without letting them overrun the band, and they have had time to approach each additional layer with diligence. There is so much pressure to speed up as a band these days, to not give any bit of online notoriety an instant to disappear. But Locrian chose to slow down and create consecutive meticulous albums. They are isolated and involved worlds of sound—safe, as one song suggests, from our own ""wreckage of a mighty dream.""</p></div>"|20724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20724-infinite-dissolution/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Their new LP <i>Stay Wild </i>adheres to the latter's sonic specs, blurring all edges and smearing all lenses, </span></span><span>everything is fed through the same sun-dazed, saturated prism. But Tearjerker remains a </span><i>rock</i><span> band, just one that works up a slow, steady sweat. ""The Gardiner"" lets bass guitar and singer </span><span>Micah</span><span> Bonte's vocals compete as lead, like a woozier </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/952-you-forgot-it-in-people"" target=""_blank""><i>You Forgot It In People</i></a><span> cut, and the title track takes on the wooly kraut of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Shjips</a><span>. While the sentiments of ""Stay Wild"" (""When we have bills and little children/ We won't change/ We'll stay wild"") may invoke </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a><span>’ ""live fast, live </span><i>forever</i><span>"" M.O., Tearjerker never come close to embodying it.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you believe Bonte's assertion on ""Perfect"" that, ""Summer is the shortest season/ It's up to you and me to give it meaning,"" individual days tend to feel long and languid and listless.</span> This much comes across in the way <i>Stay Wild</i> fixates on a single, simple situation that can stretch out infinitely. ""Phone"" is exactly what it sets out to be, a jilted complaint about the obvious irony of an iPhone being used for everything except its primary purpose: ""Is it too much for you to pick it up/ When we both know you never put it down?"" Bonte allows himself the luxury of dejection worth wallowing in, but these down moments allow for a bounce-back.</p>
<p>On <i>Stay Wild</i>’s more spirited tracks, Bonte give voice to the emotions hinted at by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16891-tearjerker-you-can"">""You Can""</a>, a striking single from last year’s <i>Hiding</i> EP. ""You Can"" had almost nothing in the way of intelligible lyrics, though it certainly <i>sounded </i>like drunken memories of either a rave or a massive sporting event. Something major definitely <i>happened</i>. Little on <i>Stay Wild</i> brings to mind that song's blissful levitation—the album as a whole is more grounded. Still, it holds true to Bonte’s request on ""Perfect"": the record isn’t likely to inspire the action itself, but rather the subsequent reflection that gave it meaning.</p></div>"|20805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20805-stay-wild/|6.5|Ian Cohen

Still, you can move the furniture around a little, make some tweaks here and there. Spraynard's third album <i>Mable</i> does away with the sophomoric song titles (""Internet May Mays"", ""Are You Ladies Familiar with the Work of Zach and Cody""), paper-thin mixing, and pitchy vocals of past releases for a buttoned-up (but nonetheless boisterous) sound. With Mike Bardzik —a musician/producer known for his work with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Casualties"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Casualties</a> and <a href=""http://everyoneeverywheremusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Everyone Everywhere</a> —manning the boards, Spraynard’s punkish project has graduated from bedrooms and basements to a bigger stage. Lead singer Pat Graham is much more confident in his ability to hold a tune this time around: His nasally tenor is more grounded and melodically consistent, even on shoutier tracks like ""Bench"". As with peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball/"">Modern Baseball</a> and <a href=""https://algernoncadwallader.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Algernon Cadwallader</a>, Spraynard cater to the awkward ones, the losers; as the album’s opening line puts it, boldly and matter-of-factly: ""I am every person that you’ve ever ignored/ I am the flaming bag of dog shit on your porch.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Embedded as nostalgic groupthink and suburban malaise may be within the modern pop-punk blueprint, Spraynard's sonic and lyrical concerns are less successful when they toe the tropes. ""Lost Boys"" is the perfunctory nihilistic ditty about ""fuck[ing] up just for the hell of it,"" ""Pond"" the romanticized portrait of a hometown haunt. As with Modern Baseball’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18984-modern-baseball-youre-gonna-miss-it-all/""><i>You’re Gonna Miss It All </i></a>and Man Overboard's <i>Real Talk</i>, (ostensibly) female subjects are recurrently portrayed as thorny, shallow subjects oblivious to the pain they inflict. ""I asked you to hang/ You just looked away,"" Graham whines on ""Out of Body"", ""I’ve got nothing to say/ I think I want to die."" Heartbreak and social rejection are two of pop punk's lyrical cornerstones, sure, but lyrics like the aforementioned couplet—or ""Medicine""'s awkward likening of a lover to sleeping pills—tread dangerously close to self-pitying excess.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Graham ultimately spends more time looking inward than outward on <i>Mable</i><i>, </i>and it’s these reflections that constitute its crux, as well as its biggest source of interest. On cuts like ""Buried"", the warm guitars, ""woah oh"" choruses, and peppy rhythms obfuscate suffocating feelings of agoraphobia and anxiety. ""Pond"" takes a Sisyphean glance into the mirror—""I hate my own body, but I am fucking lazy/ I sit here wanting change but just keep doing the damn thing""—only to shrug it off with a silver-lined retort: ""What’s the use in trying to survive if we don’t do what makes us feel alive?""</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are a few melodramatic stumbling blocks, and some painfully awkward moments, but melodrama and awkwardness sort of come with the anthemic-pop-punk territory. Spraynard serve up endearing honesty within the crucible of FM-friendly pop punk, and their music is better suited for long summer drives than late-night mope sessions; it’s introspective, but also accessible. <i>Mable </i>might not be a knock out of the park—""Bench"" sounds like lukewarm <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>, and the five-minute ""Out of Body"" seems out of place—but it might be one the catchiest sets of pessimist punk songs since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32096-fireworks/"">Fireworks</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19196-fireworks-oh-common-life/"">Oh, Common Life</a>.</i></p></div>"|20801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20801-mable/|6.9|Zoe Camp

As a punk rock trio based out of Olympia, Wash. signed to <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop Records</a>, the band can hardly escape the comparison, but the tendency is all the more irresistible given how closely they mirror the sound and aesthetic of Nirvana's earliest work. All of the key elements are present within the first 30 seconds of the opening track ""Pronoia"". A spongy, clean guitar sound, punched up with overdrive, thickened with a chorus pedal and a burbling  up-tempo bass riff packaged in the standard loud/quiet/loud framework. We’ve all tasted meals made from this particular recipe before.</p>
<p class=""p3""><i>Subjective Concepts</i> isn’t a bad record. It's well-produced, and the band clearly has a vision for the sound they want: The hard <i>thwack</i> of the drums sounds great, the bass keeps things punchy and taut, and the alternating clean and massively fuzzed out guitar tones are varied enough to keep things interesting. The problem is, their vision feels a little <i>too</i> clear, and far too often, you can almost hear the names of the bands<span>—</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"">Mudhoney</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">the Melvins</a>, and of course Nirvana<span>—echoing </span>in the heads of the band members as each song plays through. </p>
<p class=""p3"">There are a few times when the overall dynamics of the song seems to get away from them. Singer Steve Serna has a tendency to slip into a speak/scream reminiscent of mid-'00s screamo bands like Asking Alexandria or Saosin. In those instances, like on ""Pareidolia"" and ""Egophilia"", the choruses become indecipherable battering rams that bludgeon the skull. Alternatively, ""Autothysis"" is perfectly understandable, but completely flat in the way it’s delivered; a monotone voice without any hint of insecurity, anger, or resentment drolly questioning an unnamed person ""do I look like him/ I bet I do, I do"" over and over again. </p>
<p class=""p3"">The moments where the band breaks away from the expected become the real highlights. ""Lost and Found"" is the mostly oddly paced song on the record, featuring a genuinely weird, plodding drum break accented by random guitar stabbings before kicking into a screeching bridge section and flowing back into the chorus. Ten songs into an album where every dynamic shift feels like a bus arriving on schedule, the wrench thrown into the machine is a welcome reprieve. ""Don’t Have To"" is another gratifying mix-up, where the band dives past their late '80s/early '90s Pacific Northwest fixation into the foreboding tones of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>.</p>
<p class=""p3"">In each case, the break from uniformity underscores how good Strange Wilds are at mimicking a specific sound, and how dutiful they are in doing it. They are a powerful outfit, and <i>Subjective Concepts</i> is cohesive and fierce. But there's a fine line between ""influenced by"" and ""outright derivative,"" and Strange Wilds chip away at it with each hit of their stomp pedal.</p></div>"|20806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20806-subjective-concepts/|6.4|Corbin Reiff

They'd had a Top 10 single in 1967 with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn2PNlhvy8E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dance to the Music""</a>, but their follow-up, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOB5vw7aNGc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Life""</a>, and the album of the same title, had both stiffed. The plan, apparently, was to release an album of the Fillmore gigs to show off what the Family Stone could do on stage<span>—</span>and, perhaps, get some traction with the free-form FM radio stations that were popping up all over.</p>
<p>A few months after the shows, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvkaUvB-ec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everyday People""</a> became the massive hit the band needed<span>—</span>a song that echoed their own racial and sexual integration<span>—</span>and the live album was set aside. (<i>Stand!</i>, released in May, 1969, didn't include any of the new songs played at the Fillmore East gigs.) Somehow, the Fillmore tapes were never edited down to an album until<i> this year</i>, when a vinyl-only double-LP, sequenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">the Roots</a>' ""Captain"" Kirk Douglas, appeared for Record Store Day.</p>
<p>This wider-scale release, though, isn't that selection: it's a four-disc set of all four Fillmore sets in their entirety. That means we get multiple renditions of the long, jammy pieces that would have been the spine of a late-'60s <i>Fillmore East</i> album: ""Are You Ready"" and ""Music Lover"" (both, in their way, prototypes of ""I Want to Take You Higher""), a cover of ""Won't Be Long"" (from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"">Aretha Franklin</a>'s second album) sung by keyboardist Rose Stone, an extended version of the <i>Dance to the Music</i> album's ""Color Me True"", and a frenetic medley of <i>A Whole New Thing</i>'s ""Turn Me Loose"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding/"">Otis Redding</a>'s ""I Can't Turn You Loose"".</p>
<p>A 35-minute, six-song <i>Live at the Fillmore East</i> would have been a drop-dead classic on the order of Sly and the Family Stone's next three actual albums, or nearly so: the missing link between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown"">James Brown</a>'s extended funk workouts, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Whitfield"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Norman Whitfield</a>'s psychedelic soul, and the progressive rock that was evolving among the Family Stone's Bay Area neighbors. The band's half-dozen-or-so vocalists sound great, especially Sly himself, and the stop-on-a-dime arrangements are thrilling. But if you care about Sly Stone in 2015, after decades of dashed expectations and bungled comebacks, you probably care enough to want to hear the outtakes and alternate versions from the album-that-might-have-been alongside the real thing.</p>
<p>True enough, the minor tracks and oddities on this set are illuminating: a relaxed rendition of (Louis Armstrong's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzcpUdBw7gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">version</a> of) ""St. James Infirmary"", a show-ending flourish called ""The Riffs"", a version of ""M'Lady"" that detours into a long, spectacular vocal breakdown. It's fun to hear how different the band's performances could be from show to show, too. Still, collecting the entire Fillmore East engagement also reveals the Family Stone's curious weaknesses, especially recycling riffs from song to song and relying on a handful of instrumental and vocal tricks.</p>
<p>Sly and the Family Stone were a groove band above all, and their classic lineup rarely got to stretch out on record before it fell apart in the early '70s. <i>Fillmore East</i> isn't the hit-making, up-with-people pop group commemorated on their <i>Greatest Hits</i>, or the embittered, shaken genius-plus-backup of <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i> and <i>Fresh</i>. (It's not the first live album by the original group, either: their complete set from 1969's Woodstock festival was released in 2009 as <i>The Woodstock Experience</i>.) But this set is the document we've been missing of the onstage Family Stone of legend: the tightly knit extended family that sang and played together, the group that magically united black and white audiences. If it doesn't quite live up to their radiant reputation, it comes pretty close.</p></div>"|20812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20812-live-at-the-fillmore-east-october-4th-5th-1968/|7.9|Douglas Wolk

He appeared to fit the new archetype for super-sincere singer-songwriters, hunched over synths rather than an acoustic guitar, forgoing stationary strumming for something as emotive physically as it is vocally. The elite in this small class all have a defining characteristic that comes close to being a superpower—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">Tom Krell</a>'s facility with R&amp;B, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>'s composure, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"">Autre Ne Veut</a>'s dramatic flair, and so forth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Arsenault's persona is still predicated on him <i>really</i> <i>meaning </i>every word he says. His dominant mode is aerobic '80s synth-pop reshot in HD, overlain by vocals that are confrontational in either a hypothermic quaver or a full-chested bellow. Arsenault shuttles between these two poles during his major-label debut <i>Seraph, </i>though it never seems as if he's trying to skew one way or the other. Therein lies its appeal, the way it feels both exhausting and unplanned, one guy speaking his truth directly and on impulse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Seraph</i> doesn't feel quite as singular as 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18936-mas-ysa-worth-ep/""><i>Worth</i></a> EP—the vocal volatility and disorienting dynamics that distinguished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16614-shame/"">""Shame""</a> are portioned out to individual tracks and there is no longer a clear distinction between ""proper songs"" and shorter ""interludes"". But what <i>Seraph</i> forfeits in immediate impact is compensated for with range. Arsenault proves adept in a number of styles—zero-gravity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a> balladry (""Sick""), a surprising turn towards mid-'00s drum-circle indie (""Running""), and a pounding EDM instrumental that actually provides relief at <i>Seraph</i>'s center. There are also a handful of coed duets that provide welcome contrast and perspective—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30274-hundred-waters"">Hundred Waters</a>' Nicole Miglis guests on the dramatic split-screen soliloquy of ""Gun"", whereas the back-and-forth of ""I Have Some"" is as close as <i>Seraph</i> gets to unabashed fun.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Seraph</i> might be shifty, but Arsenault still works with blunt force. The opening title track barely has a melody, both Arsenault's voice and a thick synth shuddering like they're initiates of the Polar Bear Club. The spellbinding intensity is maintained on ""Margarita"", a plainspoken, heavenward plea for his mother to not die on him. He is a maximalist singer and a minimal lyricist, his words so terse and direct that when they hit awkwardly, they also do so loudly. </span>This works against the lullabies which should provide the greatest impact—the grass is cut and so the gawky snake metaphors show on ""Garden"" and while the closing ""Don't Make"" is clearly heartfelt, it's too pushy to be touching.</p>
<p>""Suffer"" is the most aggressive and the most memorable track, and it's possible these two things are correlated. The song fuses the clenched-fist, down-strummed acoustic-electric guitars and leatherette drum pads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow"">Twin Shadow</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16805-confess/""><i>Confess</i></a> with lyrics that read like a shitfaced text message —""I don't want another one/ I don't wanna learn nobody's touch/ She won't want to drink this much/ <i>Fuck her</i>,"" Arsenault biting down hard enough on the last two syllables to draw blood from his tongue.</p>
<p>Arsenault has <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/cosign-mas-ysa/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that he's ""not proud of the person in that song"" and every time I hear it, I admire his audacity for even including it on <i>Seraph</i>. The mental state of ""Suffer"" is embarrassing and horrifying and Arsenault wisely forgoes any sort of apology or justification: Being in touch with your emotions doesn't mean you get to choose how you feel at all times, after all. Even if it's not a very healthy place to be for over four minutes, everyone has likely <i>been there</i>.

The song has been in her repertoire for nearly a decade, and has long been her signature tune. She first recorded it back in the late '00s, when she was an upstart from Knoxville and when Nashville had even less time for young female singer-songwriters than it does now. Monroe had signed to Sony, which in a no-faith vote had released her debut, 2009's <i>Satisfied</i>, digitally instead of physically. Soon, she would be on her own again. </p>
<p>Many artists might have simply disappeared, but Monroe simply switched her career GPS to take her down less-traveled industry routes: performing on the Ten Out of Tenn tour in 2009 (which featured ten emerging singer-songwriters from the Volunteer State), recording an EP with Trent Dabbs, working with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a> on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3674-the-raconteurs/"">Raconteurs</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34104-the-raconteurs-reveal-details-of-bluegrass-single/"">single</a> and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9495-wanda-jackson/"">Wanda Jackson</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15042-the-party-aint-over/"">album</a>, and forming a supergroup called the Pistol Annies with friends Angaleena Presley and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8649-miranda-lambert/"">Miranda Lambert</a>. So, by the time she re-signed with a major, Monroe had re-established herself as a cult commodity in Nashville, and her ascendency looked certain. In 2013, she released what amounts to a comeback, <i>Like a Rose</i>, one of the best country albums of this decade.</p>
<p>The history of ""Has Anybody Ever Told You?"" also shows how Monroe's conception of country music has remained constant throughout all the professional twists and turns. Her original was spare and direct, with as few instruments as possible to get the point across, but the version on her new album <i>The Blade</i> is fuller and denser. It sounds made by someone with many more resources at her disposal, yet it retains its stateliness, its essential intimacy. Even with more musicians involved, Monroe makes the song sound like a whispered exchange between the listener and herself—less a profession of desire than a reassuring embrace.</p>
<p>The old song fits perfectly on the new album, which is less about the vagaries of relationships than the trauma of their aftermath. As such, it may not have the immediacy of <i>Like a Rose</i>, which was all about finding and asserting your identity both professionally and personally. Yet <i>The Blade</i> has its own specific character, its own set of concerns, even if it does take Monroe a few songs to settle into the album. Opener ""On to Something Good"" is a statement of unflinching optimism by an artist who might have succumbed to bitterness ages ago. The title track hinges on a devastating break-up metaphor: ""You caught it by the handle, and I caught it by the blade."" Rather than belt that line, Monroe wisely dials it back, sounding like she is already getting on with living with the hurt.</p>
<p>The theme of <i>The Blade </i>isn't the wound, but the salve. As such, some listeners new to country music—enticed by the success of recent efforts by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32337-kacey-musgraves/"">Kacey Musgraves</a>, Brandy Clark, and Presley—might write off songs like ""Weight of the Load"" and ""From Time to Time"" as platitudes, the kind you might find on sympathy cards. Country, however, does these sentiments better than most genres, and the best country makes extroversion sound compassionate and humane. When Monroe is singing about her own travails, as she does on the upbeat ""Winning Streak"" (which is actually about losing) or the satisfyingly dark ""Dixie"", she manages to convey a very specific and detailed perspective, to suggest a very real human being within the song.</p>
<p>Like so many country albums, especially recent ones by Monroe's friend and bandmate Miranda Lambert, <i>The Blade</i> could be stronger if it was more streamlined and sequenced with some kind of overarching narrative in mind, but that's almost beside the point when the album sounds so damn good. Once again Monroe worked with Vince Gill and veteran engineer Justin Niebank, and together they hint at pop directions while never abandoning classic country traditions. This is country music for headphones, intricate and inventive and endlessly detailed. A looped beat opens ""From Time to Time"" with a rigid meter, but it loosens up gradually until it recalls something recorded decades ago at Muscle Shoals. On ""Winning Streak"" Monroe is joined by what sounds like the ghosts of the Ray Conniff Singers, egging her on toward disaster. And perhaps that's the secret to Monroe's longevity in a cutthroat business where radio rules and women are dismissed as <a href=""http://tasteofcountry.com/radio-consultant-take-females-out-of-rotation-at-country-radio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""tomatoes""</a>: Digging in its past, she still finds sneaky ways to point towards country's future.</p></div>"|20813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20813-the-blade/|7.5|Stephen M.

It's hard to imagine White Reaper not sharing this opinion. <i>White Reaper Does It Again</i>, the cheekily titled debut album by the young, Louisville-spawned foursome, traffics in much of the same elements that the Dickies pioneered in the late '70s: bouncy pop-punk underpinned with classic songcraft; hockey-rink-ready keyboards. In particular, White Reaper's singer/guitarist Tony Esposito sings almost exactly like the Dickies' Leonard Graves Phillips, all stuffy-nosed sneers and bubblegum-blowing vowels.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Dickies aren't the only influence on <i>Does It Again</i>—nor does the album's derivativeness in any way dampen its snotty, romantic charisma. On ""Friday the 13th""—the only song on the album in a minor key—an ominous opening by keyboardist Ryan Hater sets the tone for a campy horror-meets-new-wave mash-up. And on ""Candy"", Esposito and company splice in some Sweet-style glam-rock swagger. ""On Your Mind"" even goes so far as to directly lift the melody from the original power-pop wellspring: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">The Who</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afam2nIae4o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Kids Are Alright""</a>.</p>
<p>It's all pulled off credibly, though, with plenty of perspiration and wild-eyed reverence poured into the pastiche. Bassist Sam Wilkerson and drummer Nick Wilkerson are brothers, and rhythm is clearly in their DNA; ""Wolf Trap Hotel"" simply rages, shearing off all subtlety in a flurry of adenoids and adrenaline. But even when things get as breakneck as they do on ""B.T.K."", Esposito's hooks are piercing, precise, and endearing. And when, on the slower, more supple ""Sheila"", he lets himself cut loose, his vocals approach full-on croon.</p>
<p>Barring a couple of forgettable, filler-feeling tracks like ""Don't You Think I Know?"", the biggest drawback of <i>Does It Again</i> is the production. It doesn't sound bad, but the washed-out reverb and pushed-to-the-front keyboard creates a distance that the band sounds like they are constantly fighting to push through. Songs this punchy should land effortlessly. Still, Esposito's yearning and dissatisfaction come through clearly: ""I've got it bad, you know/ Give me a double dose,"" he sings on ""Pills"", and it doesn't matter what he's singing about. It's our job to fill in that blank. White Reaper knows how to work that ambiguity, just as its navigates its unabashed influences to locate that perfect midpoint between ""nerd"" and ""numbskull.""</p></div>"|20794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20794-white-reaper-does-it-again/|6.8|Jason Heller

They appeal to a slightly older garage sensibility, before the cherubic sweetness of <a href=""http://www.burgerrecords.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burger Records</a>, crystallized in early-2000s Detroit bands like the Piranhas and Clone Defects. The Texan trio's eponymous debut feels unwieldy and fetid, proudly brainless, and committed to the primacy of a punchy rhythm section and seething guitar riffs.</p>
<p><i>Snooty Garbagemen</i>'s<i> </i>opener is a statement of intent: a minute and a half of rollicking drums and a careening riff that renders the usual vocabulary of chords and strumming inadequate. Lots of rock records use fidelity and effects as an off-putting hide, but few make guitars sound so unnatural and ingratiating at once: they are warm and full, but in a <i>gross</i> way. The guitar tone feels less like something picked out on steel strings than some mutant extension of singer Tom Triplett's rancorous vocals.</p>
<p>The only way for <i>Snooty Garbagemen</i> to feel any woozier, you might think, is for it to go backwards, which happens on ""Cigarette Juice"", an album highlight. <i>The Sandlot's </i>classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC89cgK5Sp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tilt-a-whirl puke scene</a> is set to the Champs' sinister and weirdly vindictive instrumental ""Tequila""; ""Cigarette Juice"" could soundtrack the remake for regressing adults, which would inevitably star Johnny Knoxville.</p>
<p>That sort of lumpen idiocy is a good look for Snooty Garbagemen, a trio drunk on the gospel of <i>I ain't gonna wanna </i>whose lyrics reflect the hostility of a petulant brat. Triplett is hysterically incredulous on ""Superman"" and exhausted with everything ""lame"" and ""so fucking dumb"" on ""I Quit"". ""I Can't Find My Keys"" features choice lines like, ""This happens every morning/ This happens all too frequently,"" whinnied out with such feverish despair that they teeter into comedy. Triplett's Cro-Magnon missives attack relatable, quotidian annoyances with the outsized rage that we're all compelled to repress in polite society.</p>
<p>""Don't Know to Play Guitar"" is the big stroke of irony. Triplett hails from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32288-obn-iiis/"">OBN IIIs</a> and <a href=""https://theenergy.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Real Energy</a>, among many other bands, drummer Josh Wolf plays guitar in <a href=""https://secretprostitutes.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Secret Prostitutes</a> (and dons a massive ""Rock N Roll Nightmare"" <a href=""http://cdn.discogs.com/-tVeC7Re9iDPya2QD-zrIXNKhmQ=/398x386/smart/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(96)/discogs-images/A-647227-1367590614-4069.jpeg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chest tattoo</a>), and recently-departed bassist Manie Chen is likewise steeped in Texan punk circles. Snooty Garbagemen is a venerable power-trio, attuned to one another's rhythmic lurches and assaultive physicality with a nuance that's unique to journeyman players. It's what makes this fairly straight-ahead rock'n'roll full-length engaging from start-to-finish. That ensemble feel, rather than its air of ferocity, is also what distinguishes Snooty Garbagemen from its peers, past and present. And nowhere is plain proficiency more evident than in Triplett's guitar solos, which stand out as rather beautiful and inspired against their ugly backdrop, like some sort of uncannily resilient butterfly flitting up from a trash heap.</p></div>"|20792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20792-snooty-garbagemen/|7.5|Sam Lefebvre

Yet, Wavves X Cloud Nothings represents a sudden intersection after the two artists have spent the past five years aiming in opposite directions. Dylan Baldi wants esteemed producers to act like P90x coaches, helping him shed the flabby baggage of his earliest recording for something meaner, leaner, and shredded, whereas Nathan Williams employs them like high-end makeup artists. You'd have to go back to 2009 for the last time Wavves and Cloud Nothings were functionally similar, or <i>No Life For Me</i> can save you the trouble.</p>
<p>Before the turn of the decade, both bands were solo projects manufacturing confectionary nuggets about being young, bitter and bored, wrapped in metallic hiss<span>—</span>the equivalent of eating chocolates without removing the foil. <span>There's no obvious reason for either Baldi or Williams to be nostalgic for this period, as their careers have continued to evolve and prosper along with their music</span><span>.</span> Maybe they're eager to revisit a time when their every move wasn't subject to scrutiny, though slapping both of their highly recognizable brands on the cover doesn't exactly<i> lower</i> expectations, despite the modest rollout.</p>
<p>Still, this album is the most effortless music either has produced in years, which ultimately serves as proof of how easy it is for both Baldi and Williams to write good songs and also the care it takes to make them <i>great</i>. There are solid hooks scattered all over<i> No Life For Me,</i> and they sound like they could've been knocked out in five minutes<span>—</span>each melodic note notches in the expected place over thrumming power chords and steady drums. The seven proper tracks are all opportunities to parse the fine difference between urgency and immediacy: much of<i> No Life For Me</i> happened without much noticeable struggle, but did it<i> need</i> to happen?</p>
<p>In the end, ""Wavves X Cloud Nothings"" manages to be misleading on numerous levels. It implies a full partnership or at least participation from both bands<span>—</span>this is essentially ""Wavves feat. Dylan Baldi"", as it calls on Nathan's brother Joel as a producer and his drummer Brian Hill, who is not Jayson Gerycz. Hill is a fine drummer but he's not one of the few plus-value drummers in rock music, a guy who can singlehandedly change a band's trajectory and take a song from an 8 to a 10. This might've reflected more on Baldi than Hill had the dreamy, drumless closer ""Nothing Hurts"" not been the LP's highlight. However, ""Come Down"" and the title track are essentially Cloud Nothings deep cuts with a solid rhythm section that never pushes against Baldi's vocals, never threatens any kind of chaos. It's possible Hill could've provided these things had <i>No Life For Me</i> been the result of more protracted sessions, but you might come out of this record thinking Gerycz is somehow still underrated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the nominal ""X"" implies a factorial relationship between the two acts<span>—</span>maybe this could've been a muscling up of Wavves' wiry surf-and-skate physique or the achromatic bleakness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/""><i>Attack on Memory</i></a> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19075-cloud-nothings-here-and-nowhere-else/"">Here and Nowhere Else</a></i> given a suntan. Tilt that ""X"" 45 degrees and you've got a more accurate formula: This is more an example of addition, two artists with very similar writing styles piling on top of each other.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In fact, Williams and Baldi are virtually indistinguishable emotionally or sonically here. The same themes of intransigence, ennui, and self-pity that serve as the basis for nearly every one of their previous songs is shuffled and endlessly reworded, Wavves and Cloud Nothings lyrics turned into magnetic poetry tiles grabbed out of a bag. Their blunt admissions never sound insincere despite being shared and workshopped, just pro forma<span>—</span>""I'm such a fucking mess/ Don't know at all how it's gonna go,"" ""I feel it open up around me."" ""Sometimes, you'll find nothing ever comes down.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Looking at the most recent, productive relationships between established songwriting entities—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels"">Run the Jewels</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20665-ffs"">FFS</a>, for example—there's a provision of contrast, a clear quid pro quo where each party has something the other wants or needs. Whether or not there's chemistry between Baldi and Williams, there's no volatility. They don't even sound like they're having fun: the bummer attitude was a given, but neither is inspired to go beyond their own sonic boundaries, nor is there any sign of friendly one-upmanship, no indication that a truly great idea from these sessions wouldn't be tucked away for private usage. That wouldn't be much of an issue had this partnership reflected its low-key creative process by having Wavves X Cloud Nothings go by a different name or having the results given away as a freebie or just a lark. But <i>No Life For Me</i> is a 21-minute record with two instrumentals <a href=""https://wavvesxcloudnothings.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that costs $10</a>—the same price you could pay for <i>Attack on Memory</i> or <i>King of the Beach</i>. Which is to say that Wavves X Cloud Nothings didn't need to result in a good album to justify its existence, but <i>No Life For Me</i> did.</p></div>"|20799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20799-no-life-for-me/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Mondanile has been upholding this truism for the better part of the past decade with both of his bands, nurturing a wistful, contemplative sound that, while far from the heartland rock New Jersey holds dear, will still strike a chord with anyone who has ever gone down the shore. </p>
<p>Having shaken the once-fashionable lo-fi aesthetic that marked the project's early work, Ducktails found its surest footing with 2013’s more varied<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17538-the-flower-lane/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""> <i>The Flower Lane</i></a>. But if that album found him expanding the Ducktails sound, fifth album <i>St. Catherine</i> finds Mondanile cautiously shuffling his way back into his comfort zone, churning out the kind of pretty, melancholic daydreamers he cut his teeth on. It’s hard to fault Mondanile for going back to basics, especially considering that he’s still one of the most unassuming but instantly recognizable guitar players in his respective orbit, and both his knack for cozy melodies and skills as an arranger are intact. But there’s a feeling of trepidation that hangs over the record as it favors familiarity over all else.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rob Schnapf, who co-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Elliot Smith</a>’s <i>Either/Or</i> and <i>XO</i>, helped Mondanile get <i>St. Catherine</i> across the finish line. It’s an appealingly clean sounding piece of work with serious attention to detail, from the simple but perfectly EQ’d drums to brightly-lit acoustic guitars to those swooning string arrangements. The sound is there, but the songs on <i>St. Catherine</i> don't have the substance to match.

This is Ducktails’ most discriminating and tasteful album, but the project is at its best when there's a certain amount of exploration even within its narrow parameters. </p></div>"|20818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20818-st-catherine/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Millions and Fox are the two busiest drummers in experimental music, bounding between projects with the zeal and energy of potent valence electrons. Both have bands that pushed them into prominence. For Millions, it’s the pantheistic weirdo crew <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a>, known for extended adventures into rock’s most distant corners, both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdtkCFoD_Pc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">onstage</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13215-rated-o/"" target=""_blank"">off</a>. For Fox, it’s the flinty black metal band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a>, known for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9608-the-liturgy-manifesto/"" target=""_blank"">testing the boundaries</a> of that genre and irking its old guard in the process.</p>
<p>But Millions and Fox treat those acts as launch pads, not landing pads. Fox, for instance, leads his own freak-out act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"">Guardian Alien</a>, is the newest member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5596-zs/"">Zs</a>, and collaborates with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"">Ben Frost</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32419-pc-worship/"">PC Worship</a>. Millions, meanwhile, drums with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>, helms the drum ensemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28966-man-forever/"">Man Forever</a>, and released duo records with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6427-j-spaceman/"">J. Spaceman</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23791-borbetomagus/"">Borbetomagus</a>’ Jim Sauter just last year. Their collision seems, then, inevitable if not overdue, an obviously great idea that each musician had to squeeze into packed dockets.</p>
<p><i>Lost Time</i>, however, does not sound like an obligation, a date on a calendar meant to be fulfilled. At its best, it feels like an opportunity for two daring drummers to explore with and without their kits. Recorded during two workaday sessions in 2014, these dual tracks find the pair testing diametric impulses with equal zeal—building and filling a sidelong groove for the meditative ""Post Encounter Effect"" and treating grooves as anathema for the explosive ""Telegy/Time Lapse"". For both pieces, Fox and Millions step behind and then away from their sets, accessorizing the ""drum duo"" concept with guitars and electronics, samples and screams. The choice affords <i>Lost Time</i> unexpected approachability. The first side speaks as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"">Lightning Bolt</a> as it does to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"">Albert Ayler</a>, the second as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Neuhaus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Neuhaus</a>.</p>
<p>You can practically hear each drummer’s enthusiasm for simply playing (but not playing <i>simply</i>) on ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", a 20-minute opening marvel of momentum and cooperation. A murmur of looped electronics yields to an outburst of drums, with Millions and Fox interlocking their very heavy, very fast, very long rolls and fills. They continually escalate and de-escalate, creating a seesaw that emphasizes just how meticulous and powerful they can get. Sometimes, they stop altogether; other times, they play so hard you wonder how they know where each limb will land. Instead of two titans squaring off, the sound suggests a spirited conversation between equals, each offering distinct but complementary voices and thoughts on a shared interest.</p>
<p>Fox has studied with Milford Graves, a pioneering jazz drummer who has, in recent decades, <a href=""http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/trends/columns/cityside/5380/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">used heart monitors to help build musical frameworks. </a>Midway through ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", the drums disappear, replaced temporarily by the amplified heartbeats of Fox and Millions and, soon, solid sheets of industrial noise. When the drums return, they slyly mirror those biomechanical rhythms, suggesting that both of these musicians were born to do exactly this. When the track hits its ecstatic peak, Fox howls and hums maniacally behind the beats. The élan is visceral, contagious.</p>
<p>But where that first piece is immediate and demanding, ""Post Encounter Effect"" attempts to be immersive and hypnotic to the point that it borders on soporific. Fox and Millions begin with a wide, swinging beat, syncopated cymbals splashing over a regimen of tom-toms. For 20 minutes, this rhythm sits mostly still. Meanwhile, they saturate the space between their kits with a panoply of drones—loose-stringed acoustics and phosphorescent electrics, muzzled trumpet and squelching synthesizers. The hope, it seems, is to commingle the ideas of opposing minimalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"">La Monte Young</a> by balancing the eternal tones of the latter with the rhythmic latticework of the former. But the idea is more interesting than the execution, itself a listless piece whose subtlety morphs into tedium long before the track expires.</p>
<p>In recent years, two other drummers, Jon Mueller and Jonathan Kane, have applied similar principles to much more dynamic work in their respective bands Death Blues and February. Perhaps because it seems so redundant, ""Post Encounter Effect"" feels like a cerebral exercise for Millions and Fox. They are much better when the exchange is physical, as on ""Telegy/Time Lapse"", a piece so urgent and expressive it’s a shame the side ever ends.</p></div>"|20800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20800-lost-time/|7.0|Grayson Haver Currin

Along with kazoo solos and rewritten Shania Twain verses came effervescent indie-pop track <a href=""https://badbadhats.bandcamp.com/track/super-america"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Super America""</a>. In it, lead vocalist/guitarist Kerry Alexander strolls gas station aisles gazing longingly at its sugary treats, and in the same breath reveals similarly hedonistic desires for her love life: ""I want a sweet tea and a heart that won't break.... I want an Icee and a nice boy to date."" On the surface , the song seems a bit wide-eyed. But it ends up reflecting how self-serving cravings address our basic human needs—physical and emotional—without satisfying them, and the end result in both cases is empty, whether caloric or romantic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Psychic Reader</i><span> builds upon the unconventional structure and sticky melody behind ""Super America"", but now Alexander's self-aware concerns are less one-dimensional. Her vocals will undoubtedly earn her cursory descriptors like ""sweet"" or ""childlike,"" but her seeming innocence is belied by her apt songwriting. She's an expert at translating her own experiences into poignant, universal stories. On the bouncy, immediately accessible opener ""Midway"", Alexander confesses, ""I knew that I'd leave you by the middle of June/ You touched me on my shoulder blade, soft like a tomb/ I wanna hear you tell me you don't know what you'll do/ The words you were not saying nearly filled up the room."" She speaks with astute cognizance—she's the first to admit her contradictions because she's already come to terms with them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are quirky electronic noises sprinkled all over the LP, a sign that Bad Bad Hats are a new band trying things out. The blaring, robotic effects on the caffeinated ""Shame"" come close to distracting,  although they're matched by some appropriately noisy guitar freakouts. On the album's pillowy title track, cooing waves of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" blend in seamlessly with atmospheric, ping-pong-ing synths, a slithering chord progression, and offbeat percussion patterns.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Hats leap into yet another direction with their least-produced track, ""Things We Never Say"". If you were to close your eyes, you might think Alexander was singing into your ear, and really, that's the only way to record an acoustic song that's this unnerving. Alexander takes age-old subject matter—unrequited love—and manages to articulate the accompanying swirl of messy emotions without sounding cliché: ""You never say you love me, but you never let me fight you/ Can't get you off my mind babe, so I bought this dress to spite you/ I wear it 'cause I hate you, 'cause you don't know what you got/ Then I'll wear it to your house and I'll let you take it off."" When she concludes, ""I wanna be the one who holds you/ I wanna be the one who says goodnight,"" it feels less like a plea and more like a liberating declaration.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-2b9fef32-982f-cf81-985a-d6c25f7d45f8""> There's a distinct purity to the cadence of Alexander's voice, one that works to maintain its grip on the record's more experimental tinkerings. The final track, ""Spin"", sounds like Bad Bad Hats time-traveled from a 1998 alt-rock radio station, pumped full of glossy, uptempo guitars reminiscent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_6"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eve 6</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Blossoms"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gin Blossoms</a>. It's a strange choice, but a catchy chorus and fatalistic lyrics give the song a sweet-and-sour appeal and charming enthusiasm. The band's fluctuations from track to track aren't entirely unexpected—this is their debut full-length after all—nor are they unwelcome. However, their capricious inclinations wouldn't be able to hold their own without Alexander's visceral songwriting. This is where <i>Psychic Reader</i>'s nuances are buried, within her complex perspective that's at once clever, fresh, and earnest.</span></p></div>"|20798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20798-psychic-reader/|6.9|Tess Duncan

Their strain of rap&amp;B is tinged with cosmic insight but always tugging earthward, mingling calls for acknowledgement, autonomy, and freedom with utopian visions and sinuous grooves. In the event that liberation actually comes, their music suggests, people will still need to dance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As the singing half of THEESatisfaction, Catherine ""Cat"" Harris-White's sideline recording DIY EPs as SassyBlack has given her additional room to express her insights for a couple years now. Categorizing her music in part as ""hologram funk,"" Harris-White's vocals sink into the similar hypnotic chants and plainspoken wisdom that she brings to her main gig. It's in a simpler form, sure; <i>Personal Sunlight</i>, her latest Bandcamp release, harmonizes with itself in a way that seems more intent on delivery than message.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's the timbre of her voice, spread out along hooks-turned-mantras, that resonates the most. She runs it through fields of beats that are simple, minimalist, sometimes even forgettable in isolation; the fluttering, pendulous synth-guitar riffs in opening cut ""(Dance in My) Personal Sunlight"" is the closest this six-track EP comes to a memorable melodic element that arises from Harris-White's production rather than her voice. But the drums are catchy in their slipperiness, and keep a sense of focus in the track when Harris-White reels off into subtly melismatic runs. Her voice carries all the style and vibrance the music needs: Her repeated hooks locate an exact and satisfying balance between nonchalance and urgency (she nails it best in ""Thriller (Game Healer)"").</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Her messages are simpler, more general, and more abstract than the Afrocentric core of </span><a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20227-earthee/""><i>EarthEE</i></a><span>, but if the personal is political, </span><i>Personal Sunlight </i><span>isn't a departure at all, really. Harris-White credits this album as the product of a certain epiphany: ""I woke up one day and realized my life's full potential. With this new found (previously understood, yet never truly fully actualized) reality, I created"". What exactly it was that removed this last remaining block for her isn't specified, even on a pretty matter-of-fact record that rides on simple messages of radiant inspiration (""(Dance in My) Personal Sunlight""), the self-absorption behind environmental neglect (""What's the Sun WithOut the Rain""), and the unrestrained thrill of pure love (""Splish Splash (My Lovin on FLEEK)""). But even when the ratio of what she says to how she says it tilts this far toward the latter, it's not hard to feel the weight she brings to her voice.</span></p></div>"|20809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20809-personal-sunlight/|6.8|Nate Patrin

And then, sometimes, you're just repeating yourself, like Ratatat. There’s nothing regressive or cynical in Ratatat’s consistency, because I do believe these two guys are making the music they want to make (see their game Genius annotations <a href=""http://genius.com/Ratatat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), but I also think that on <i>Magnifique</i>, their fifth record, the well has dried up. There’s something about not being able to tell five years has passed between records that makes you wonder about an artist's evolution.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When Ratatat were at their peak (for my money, 2006’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9326-classics/""><i>Classics</i></a><span>), the duo crystallized an aesthetic that was similar to chillwave before chillwave existed: a rudimentary, simplistic dissection, then careful re-assembly of, modern music’s most elemental pieces (keyboards, guitars, beats) that amplified the simple beauty of the bare necessities and evoked layered feelings of nostalgia. But, more often than not, Ratatat’s music has felt like a tasteful accessory, something that reminds you of other, more progressive electronic music, but mostly sounds great while trying on sweaters. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are little gestures at switching things up, like the steel guitar on ""Supreme"". But it disappears as unceremoniously as it came, leaving no real impression other than, ""oh that’s the song with the steel guitar."" This is <i>Magnifique's</i> real issue: It’s not that </span><span>the album </span><span>is bland, it’s that it doesn’t really </span><span>do</span><span> anything or go anywhere. No matter how skillfully they may blend sounds, like on the dense ""Abrasive"", or the playful if thin ""Cream on Chrome"", or the lite-funk of ""Countach"", nothing leaves an impression. There’s no emotional core or tension. An uncharitable soul will say that’s always been the knock on Ratatat, but, especially after a half-decade absence, it seems awfully relevant now.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Nightclub Amnesia"" works itself into a nice groove, complete with one of the album’s most memorable riffs, but it’s also hard to imagine the song working on any dancefloor or anywhere else than the tamest apartment get-together. Even when Ratatat spent earlier releases like they were specifically working this angle—the barest, most minimal take on party music suitable for coffee-shops—they backed it up with memorable hooks or tones. </span><i>Magnifique</i><span> fades from memory as soon as it ends.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fitting, then, that the most memorable song is a cover, the penultimate ""I Will Return"", offered as an emotional climax to the record. A quick listen to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01zHBnSTrh8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Springwater original</a> reveals something about the song’s stakes—and how it should affect the listener. It feels cosmic, triumphant. Ratatat cleans it up and rehashes it, like the sleek reboots of last decade’s blockbuster hits.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d768d9e2-8d68-1ede-959a-571e6bcc0c10"">It seems confining to suggest that Ratatat's best music is often collaborative. But that’s also their most memorable and essential work, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36y6uzwKpt0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kid Cudi</a> to their unofficial but rewarding remixes to the great <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/despotroast/house-of-bricks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Despot single</a> produced by <span>E*Vax. </span>It's never seemed like their tone and vibe was substantial enough to last an entire album.

But pop music stands alone in its obsession with their convergence point, where they become interchangeable or indistinguishable or simply confused with one another. ""Is it desire, or is it love that I’m feeling for you?"" Years &amp; Years singer Olly Alexander asks, in characteristically dramatic fashion on ""Desire"", and the law of pop melodrama demands that the question go unanswered. So it goes with the music: is it the easy populism of Years &amp; Years’ honed, slick dance-pop that intoxicates, or a transmission of deeper truths? But why separate the two?</span></p>
<p><span>The majority of the songs on the British trio’s debut album <i>Communion </i>marry thematic precision with the broad kinetics of great pop songwriting, mingling self-loathing and doubt with a redemptive, near-bloody-minded push to prettiness and uplift. Only the excellent single ""Shine"" is as upbeat as it is up-tempo, and even then the happiness feels so hard-won it can’t help but imply its opposite. The songs </span>carefully map the contours of gay sensuality, filtering lust through a variety of counterparts: not just shame, but vulnerability, self-awareness and annihilating self-abandon. Where <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronski_Beat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bronski Beat</a> once crafted colossal club-pop out of tales of marginalization and abuse, Years &amp; Years occupy a more subtle, liminal contemporary world, one of feeling isolated amidst a crowd of bodies. ""I’ll do what you like if you stay the night,"" Olly bargains on ""Real"", and then later offers on the seductive slow-grind of ""Take Shelter"", ""do what you want tonight/ It’s alright."" On ""Worship"", he promises ""I’m not gonna tell nobody ‘bout you,"" and finally, on the wracked, gorgeous closer ""Memo"", he begs, ""Let me take your heart/ Love you in the dark/ No one has to see."" In each case the character of the song is made small and powerless by the asymmetry of desire, which renders the stadium-chant backing vocals and sun-from-behind-clouds synth bursts more perverse and exhilarating than they have any right to be on their own. </p>
<p>Remove or ignore that contradiction, and Years &amp; Years’ musical familiarity might breed contempt. You could dismiss their overblown choruses and sculpted electro-house arrangements as just the most commercial manifestation yet of a decade’s worth of also-ran bands reimagining '80s and '90s club-pop; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZexg8sxyk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Electric Feel""</a> strained through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>’s snappy post-garage percussion and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a>’s middlebrow wallowing. But Years &amp; Years don't dilute this formula, they distill it: <i>Communion</i>’s biggest hit thus far, the high-gloss anthem ""King"", attains a kind of formal loveliness not witnessed in this genre since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceS4553f-0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Madonna’s ""Get Together""</a> almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>Here, and on the album’s other highlights, the air of mercantile anonymity feels generous rather than cynical, the music as anxious to accommodate its imagined audience as Olly is his lovers, to be the song that made you dance all night even though you can’t remember a word of it now (i.e. to be the best song ever, as One Direction <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_v9MY_FMcw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rightly observed</a>). How else could you end up with a song like ""Worship"": a bright xylophone bounce for the verses, and a chorus that references gospel via diva-house via the Wanted’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r8G3SEGIV0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Found You""</a>? Appropriately, the band sounds too delirious to feel any shame.</p>
<p><span>Years &amp; Years are weakest when seeking to project dignity, a noble bearing up in the face of life’s torments and disappointments (""Eyes Shut"", ""Gold"", ""Without""). Then, the arrangements veer towards placating grand gestures, and Olly’s ""soaring"" vocals threaten to become cloying. <span>Conversely</span>, the ballad ""Memo"" is perhaps the album’s pinnacle, at least in part because of its defiant specificity. Over slow piano chords and halting percussion, Olly describes in fragile falsetto his infatuation for a straight male friend (""You see yourself in another way/ I try my best but I don’t ever change""), doomed to be unrequited although perhaps not unconsummated (the repeated refrain, ""I want more"", works either way). Although its lip trembles with the tremulousness of its longing, at another level ""Memo"" is ice cold: what kind of love, it asks, would place lovers in such an impossible bind? Again, there's no answer on <i>Communion</i>, but you can always return to the dancefloor and try to find it again.</span></p></div>"|20831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20831-communion/|7.4|Tim Finney

Credited to Suzanne Kraft, an alias of dublab DJ Diego Herrera, <i>Green Flash</i> did nu-disco infused with a low-slung pacing and a warmth not unlike a cassette tape left on the dashboard at midday. It was soon followed by the <i>Horoscope</i> EP and a handful of more Balearic cuts from Herrera's other band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31122-pharaohs/"">Pharaohs</a>, suggesting that more floor-filling tracks lay ahead.</p>
<p>But when <i>Missum</i>, Kraft's next release for Running Back, came out last year, it showed Herrera not leaning in but rather taking a step back. The record was actually a reissue, but it showed a different side of him: The drums turned down to register as gentle pulses, samples of old boogie records gave way to chord organs and saxophone lines that mimicked deep breathing exercises, unfurling slowly and deeply across each track. <i>Missum</i> revealed the mellow, contemplative side of Suzanne Kraft, which in comparison to the DJ tracks, might have sounded anomalous. With <i>Talk From Home</i>, it instead illuminates that the unhurried pacing of those first dance singles might be the outliers.</p>
<p>Released on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Melody-As-Truth/877261968966177"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melody As Truth</a> imprint out of the UK, <i>Talk From Home</i> isn't an homage to new age music per se, but it does take cues from the more chilled-out end of the ECM and EG catalogs. ""Two Chord Wake"", with its brushed hi-hat programming and measured snares, might have the most pronounced beat of the album, yet even with flares of guitar spiking above the rhythms, it pads about gently like music for children’s television.</p>
<p>""Never Heated"" might be carved out of Julee Cruise’s exhales, a wordless vocal paired with a simple figure on bass guitar and a tube amp buzzing like cicadas. Throughout, Kraft gets the most out of the simplest of ingredients, ""Male Intuition"" imparting its contemplative vibe with little more than a guitar line couched in reverb and echo that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">Durutti Column</a>.</p>
<p>Other moments of the album sound like something Mark Isham might have cut around the time of <i>Vapor Drawings</i>, just at the border between breezy and cheesy. The pads of the title track at first bring to mind a Muzak version of ""King of Pain"" but as the track evolves, a bath-warm depth is revealed. The beatific slow swells of closer ""The Result"" brings this all too-brief outing to a close, but <i>Talk From Home</i> is the ideal soundtrack for taking a leisurely stroll rather than frantically Ubering to reach a destination.</p></div>"|20776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20776-talk-from-home/|7.3|Andy Beta

It marks the culmination of a two-year period in which we've had only teasing glimpses—an EP here, a <a href=""https://izwid.bandcamp.com/track/controversy-prince-cover"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prince cover</a> there—at his unorthodox take on house and funk. But for the Houston-born, Los Angeles-based musician, <i>Universes</i> marks the completion of a much longer process and a vindication of his methods, as well as a rebuke against those who doubted him along the way.</p>
<p>Davis' moment has been a long time coming. He grew up in a gospel family and got his first look inside the music industry early on. He discovered house and techno while living, and dancing, in San Francisco; for a while, he ghost-produced for rappers, but his own productions, he has said, were deemed too strange. ""I made a lot of this music many years ago and other labels and artists hated on me for it,"" he recalled around the release of <i><a href=""https://izwid.bandcamp.com/album/the-lost-tapes-vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lost Tapes Vol. 1</a></i>, a compendium of his early work. ""They said it was too weird, too different, sounded like drug music.""</p>
<p>In fact, it <i>was</i> drug music, but at some point, he kicked his habits, and in that sense, it's possible to read <i>Universes </i>as a testament to the soul-cleansing power of funk. Once upon a time, negativity established the limits of his vision: ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", the opening song on <i>The Lost Tapes Vol. 1</i>, complained, ""You need to go find a hobby"" and ""Stop being a hater""—understandable sentiments, perhaps, but the prosaic lyrics didn't measure up to his production talents or his powerful voice. But the far more assured <i>Universes </i>is swept up in the power of positive thinking, both lyrically and musically. The gorgeous, introductory ""Imagination"", a dreamy nod to the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><i>Voodoo</i></a>, gives way to ""Freedom"", an uptempo riot of stuttering drums and disco vamps that can barely contain its giddy cheer. In ""Sunday Morning"", he pares down the production and puts his voice center stage: ""Bet you never had a love like this before,"" he sings in a loop, and it's not just the lyrics that do the talking; it's his playful voice, swooping and diving, the very embodiment of joy at its most seductive.</p>
<p>""Everybody Too Cool"", a sly romp splashed with organ and falsetto, is even more joyful, as Davis taunts, ""Mr. DJ/ Don't play this in the club/ 'Cause people don't dance no more/ Everybody too cool for school""—a clever bit of reverse psychology, because good luck standing still in the face of his loping, rolling groove. Davis' own history as a house dancer is evident in his music's wild gyrations; even when he's laying down four-to-the-floor rhythms, he imbues them with more bump and flex than most contemporary dancefloors will be used to. Case in point: ""Good Vibes"", a co-production with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"">Julio Bashmore</a> that loops its squelchy chords and rickety drum machine, as though 1993's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a> were trying to worm their way back to Minneapolis, 1985.</p>
<p>But there's a somber side to the album, too. In ""Fighters"", the album's emotional centerpiece, he layers his voice into a mournful, wordless mass, over which he offers a lament for America's racist violence. He keeps the details vague, but that winds up contributing to the song's depiction of fruitless violence and misspent energies, all of it summed up in the line, ""Everybody's hoping for peace but they're doing it all wrong."" It's the album's most musically adventurous song, too, skulking along in a strange, 5/4 time signature, the murk mirroring the exhaustion of the lyrics.</p>
<p>The album perks up after that; ""Afterlife"", a wheezy keyboard sketch, finds Davis brushing the dirt off his shoulder: ""I will love, I will love, I will love/ Let 'em hate, let 'em hate, let 'em hate."" And ""No Worries"", one of the album's sprightliest jams, is a kiss-off of the most carefree kind. Throughout it all, his arrangements burst with a vitality that belies their modest construction. The sounds may be humble, not that much more hi-fi than his early demos, but their vision of funk as lifeblood is never anything less than radiant.</p></div>"|20756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20756-universes/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Ty Money is a young street rapper from the gritty suburb to Chicago's south, and his talents transcend his city's bleak profile. Although Harvey is virtually unknown nationally, in Chicagoland, it's known for rappers like the east coast-inspired duo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBPgmSlxgM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Naughty and Kane</a>—with whom Ty recorded <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju56Kbms6eA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sibley Boyz""</a> in 2011. That song showcased Ty's slick, lyrically dense rap style, one reminiscent of the narrative-oriented tradition that propelled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> in Atlanta back in the early 2000s. (It may explain why the Grand Hustle CEO was reportedly courting Ty for a deal in 2014.) Ty's latest tape, the gripping<i> Cinco De Money</i>, is his third, and the first to realize a coherent vision, updating his style without sacrificing his strength as one of hip-hop's most talented new writers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Cinco De Money</i> is a dark and depressing record to be sure, the rapper's brutal assuredness set in stark relief against a canvas of hopelessness. But it is engaging in a way that belies its somber subject matter. The album is an immersive visit to Harvey's Sibley Boulevard, a main strip that takes on mythic connotations in Ty's lyrics, his own <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensbridge_Houses"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queensbridge projects</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolished_public_housing_projects_in_Atlanta#Bowen_Homes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bowen Homes</a>. The music moves in continuous descending circles, a musical Escher drawing, giving a downward pull to everything. Some productions, like the grim vocal sample on ""Just Bars"", are skittishly somber, while others creak back and forth with the inevitability of a porch swing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ty is a lyrical rapper, but his dense thickets of wordplay are more concerned with depicting scenes and telling stories than drawing attention to their own cleverness. In the last few years, there's been a tendency among popular rap artists, particularly in the South and Midwest, to take a hypnotically repetitive rhythmic approach—think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>, or, more locally, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a>. On <i>Cinco De Money</i>, Ty meshes his older lyrical style with this punchier delivery. The effect works, somehow—his intricate rapping, dense with euphonic syllables and clever wordplay, is stickier, more urgent than ever before. Unlike the Migos, whose lyrics are often appreciated moment-to-moment, his words tend toward narrative cohesion, a thread of ideas best understood <i>in toto</i>. The effect is like a jagged EKG, in which each pulse is horizontally compressed.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-588ee7d8-9348-8633-f1fe-342f4588c5da"">Ty defies easy categorization, which is part of why his new work feels so vital, but also might be part of why he's still mostly undiscovered. He's a rapper's rapper, but not a traditionalist. At a time when so many artists aim for the pure, simple gestures, Ty Money aims for an amalgamation: the confluence of rewind-worthy wordplay (""Couple old shooters, call 'em Robert Horry""), evocative imagery that focuses on the details (""Wipin' down the shotty with a napkin""), and a compelling personal narrative. This is street rap that is as much about the blues as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJK0OGlhKF4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future's ""Trap Niggas""</a>, which captures a similar tire-spinning-in-mud futility with very different tools. The album's spark, its magnetism, lies in the balance between the crisp precision and forceful confidence of Ty's rapping and the taut  unease of his bars, which suggest a lifetime of existential anxiety.</span></p></div>"|20745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20745-cinco-de-money/|7.8|David Drake

It could be a sly nod to their influence on this decade’s global electronic boom. Back in the mid-1990s, acts like the Chems, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"">Fatboy Slim</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"">the Prodigy</a> were primed to vanquish guitar rock once and for all while ushering in a squelching age of rave. It didn’t work out that way and, soon enough, Limp Bizkit were dragging their knuckles all the way to the top of the charts. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ radical mix of acid house, hip-hop, and shaggy psych was deemed just another pop fad. But now, with EDM festivals drawing millions of fans around the world and spiritual big beat descendants like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a> helping to shape the Hot 100, it’s clear that the Chemical Brothers were both ambassadors and soothsayers. And they’re still around. They deserve to gloat.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Then again, the line could also suggest something more sinister. It’s taken from a spoken-word performance by iconoclastic 76-year-old Canadian poet <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_bissett"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bill bissett</a>, whose idea of ""the future"" involves scentless flowers, two-headed babies, and other marks of a hellish apocalypse; for every hit of ecstatic futurism, they seem to be saying, there is an equal and opposite dose of reality. Meanwhile, the music of ""I’ll See You There"" finds Rowlands and Simons once again tripping out on the <i>past</i>, as howled backmasking and frenzied drums criss-cross in an effort to once again capture the headiness of their own psychedelic pop ur-text, the Beatles’ ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". All of which leads us to the eternal present—the <i>now</i>—which happens to be a place that suits the Chemical Brothers quite well.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Born in the Echoes </i>is the pair’s eighth album and it continues the creative resurgence ignited by their brilliant last full-length, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14359-further/""><i>Further</i></a>, which served as something of a career reset following a decade of flagging potency. But whereas that album was marked by extended dancefloor workouts, seamless DJ-style transitions, and an overall feeling of loved-up euphoria, <i>Echoes</i> is more of a grab bag: Enormous festival fillers and hard-nosed club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like fellow '90s innovators <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>, the Chems have managed to last more than 20 years in part because they are smart enough to prioritize mindless immediacy. The two upper middle class boys bonded while studying history at Manchester University at the height of the city’s ecstasy heyday; they would read Chaucer’s bawdy <i>Canterbury Tales </i>and then head over to The Haçienda and flail about with 1,000 of their new best friends. They quoted British novelist Evelyn Waugh on an early EP title and then sampled roughneck New York rapper Keith Murray on their ageless classic <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>. Simons recently returned to the world of academia (and will miss this year’s Chemical Brothers tour dates because of it), while Rowlands recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9680-running-on-instinct-how-the-chemical-brothers-stay-vital/"">summed up</a> the duo’s objectives thusly: ""We're just really into making funny sounds and putting them into some kind of order that makes sense … Not every song has to be the meaning of life.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">So on <i>Echoes</i> we get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a> spouting motivational <a href=""http://j-walkblog.com/images/pixzb324.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pizza box rhymes</a> over rubberband basslines on future sports montage soundtrack ""Go"" followed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a> staring into the suicidal void of a performer’s high on ""Under Neon Lights"", which peaks with a guitar (or is it a synth?) solo that searingly recalls ""Bulls on Parade"". We get the viscous funk of ""Taste of Honey""—replete with buzzing bee cameo—next to the taut title track, which features a coolly distant vocal from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9328-cate-le-bon/"">Cate Le Bon</a> and sounds like a worthy tribute to the late, great psych auteurs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>. Then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a> shows up at the end to help Rowlands and Simons create the finest New Order song in ages. ""Wide Open"" makes the inevitability of losing it—life, love, inspiration—sound terribly triumphant, and just as the track hits its climax, Beck wisely gets out of the way, making room for undulating waveforms that bristle and burst with all-too-human imperfections.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Talking to <i>Spin</i> about his Big Beat contemporaries in 1999, Ed Simons suggested, ""There’s surely going to come a time when those kind of tricks—all the drops and builds and rhythm changes—aren’t going to trigger the same responses in people."" Of course, the same could be said of today’s insta-nuke dance tracks, the ones that try to cheat death by just running away from it really fast and really hard. And, to be fair, the Chemical Brothers have deployed plenty of drops and builds and rhythm changes across the last two decades. But Rowlands and Simons’ version of the future isn’t one of narrow-minded annihilation; there are levels to it, along with paths that connect everything from the Fab Four to ""Funky Drummer"" to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCUPc9zVfyo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phuture</a>. Part of a fast-moving culture always looking for the next high, the Chemical Brothers remain steadfast—eyeing the past and future while living in the here and now.</p></div>"|20721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20721-born-in-the-echoes/|7.8|Ryan Dombal

At that time, the mostly forgotten Flying Saucer Attack were important to a lot of people invested in underground psychedelia and noise. The Bristol duo of David Pearce and Rachel Brook, who were dating for a time, often slapped a somber landscape on the front of their albums—sunsets, dark trees, scattered cloud formations, blue moons—and the music matched the pastoral mood these pictures evoked.</p>
<p>On any given FSA album, lo-fi folk feedback and whispered vocals collided with delicate and spaced-out strums and just enough tape hiss. There was tripped-out forest-jazz stuff with bongos and horns. (Matt Elliott of the affiliated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4212-third-eye-foundation/"">Third Eye Foundation</a> contributed percussion, drums, clarinet.) They covered bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/"">Suede</a> and did a seminal take on the old folk song ""Sally Free and Easy"", and later covered Skip Spence. The first record, a self-titled collection released in 1993, bore the phrase ""Rural Psychedelia,"" and that stuck.</p>
<p>Flying Saucer Attack recorded most of their output at home, not in a proper studio, and you could tell, though you'd more likely think they're recorded it in their backyard at night. In any case, they'd remind you, with little messages on their albums like ""compact discs are a major cause of the breakdown of society"" and ""home taping is reinventing music."" Most of their early material was vinyl only.</p>
<p>Brook left the band in the 1996 to concentrate on her other project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2847-movietone/"">Movietone</a>, and the liner notes for the <i>Chorus</i> compilation from that same year featured the sentence: ""This album marks the end of FSA phase one."" In retrospect, the best material emerged from that first phase, when FSA was two people in a room. In fact, if you want a place to start with FSA, your best bet would be the 1993 self-titled debut and 1995's <i>Further</i> along with the two early compilations, 1994's <i>Distance</i> and the aforementioned <i>Chorus</i>. There was plenty of material after that, often in 7"" and single form, but none had quite the same magic.</p>
<p>And, now, after a 15-year hiatus that finds FSA deep into ""phase two"" (or maybe ""phase three""), Pearce is back with a FSA album recorded solo at home and entirely on guitar. It's his first proper release since 2000's <i>The Mirror</i>, which was a collection in the spirit of the earlier work. The 57-minute <i>Instrumentals 2015</i>, on the other hand, is stripped back and spare, a series of 15 untitled instrumentals that often feel like interstitials—bridges or ladders to something else. (The lack of titles is interesting for someone who always had so much to say, even if you couldn't really understand what he was singing half the time.)</p>
<p>The music is often reminiscent of the silvan Bay Area psych of the Jewelled Antler Collective, and the elegant, air-born recordings of New Zealand experimental guitarist Roy Montgomery (Dadamah, Dissolve), with whom Pearce collaborated in 1997 on a noisy three-song EP. The second song on that EP, the melancholy, meditative ""And Goodbye"", is echoed a bit here, though that older track featured buried drum rumbles and crashes and bigger explosions. <i>Instrumentals 2015</i> is not necessarily about dynamics: it's pretty and sprawling, even when certain songs only last for a few seconds.</p>
<p>As far as the FSA canon, it bares some similarities to 1996's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"">Hawkwind</a>-echoing <i>In Search of Spaces</i>, which was pieced together by another underground New Zealand legend, Bruce Russell (of Dead C, A Handful of Dust) with tapes from live performances. Like the collaboration with Montgomery, though, it was weirder and noisier than this new set.</p>
<p>Some of these <i>2015</i> songs flit by without much of an impression, but then you'll get the sturdier drift of a piece like ""Instrumental 4"", which has the holy, ritualistic ambiance of FSA's best work or the clanging ""Instrumental 6"", a short, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/"" target=""_blank"">Harry Pussy</a>-esque bit that adds imploded grit before the melancholic, majestic folk-drone of ""Instrumental 7"". But as the album goes on, the mood flatlines into a gentle, somber, not very compelling middle zone. The collection closes with its two longest pieces, the almost eight-minute ""Instrumental 14"" and the almost 10-minute ""Instrumental 15"" (which could almost be a new-school <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a> track). Both are fine, but could've been shorter, which is something you could also say about the album as a whole.</p>
<p>The D-side of the 2xLP version of <i>Instrumentals 2015</i> was etched by Rachel Brook, now Rachel Coe, a sweet touch, and maybe one justification for the record being so long. Otherwise, after a 15-year pause, it would've been nice to have a little less music that offered more to latch onto. The strangeness and slightness of <i>Instrumentals 2015</i> is admittedly refreshing in our age of overdoing it, and it does fit with the whisper that is Pearce's overall career arc, but when placed next to Flying Saucer Attack's best music, it still comes off like a faint echo.</p></div>"|20667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20667-instrumentals-2015/|6.8|Brandon Stosuy

Even as he describes the customs, he lacks an understanding of the emotions that motivate them, so what should be mundane imagery comes across as foreign and strange: ""You got a face with a view,"" he offers as a compliment, then adds, ""I’m just an animal looking for a home."" Yet, the song is so well-observed, so wide-eyed and naïve that it never comes across like a parody of marriage and commitment. Instead, that alien sounds like he might envy us humans and our needs. This must be the place, indeed.</p>
<p>On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7207-sam-beam/"">Sam Beam</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell/"">Ben Bridwell</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60068-iron-wine-band-of-horses-ben-bridwell-cover-talking-heads-this-must-be-the-place-naive-melody/"">rendition of the song</a>, which opens their new joint covers album, they remove all ambiguity and alienness from the original. The setting is folksy, with an acoustic guitar, a gentle percussive thrum, and Beam’s yearning vocals replacing the original’s burbles of Afropop percussion. The main character is no longer an outsider looking in on humanity, but an insider looking outward. It’s as straightforward a cover as you could imagine, removing a layer of meaning from the original, and you know what? It actually works. Maybe it’s the upbeat tempo and the jumpy guitar licks, which evoke a certain kind of domestic contentment. Or maybe it’s the way Beam sounds like a dude trying to say something just beyond his range of expression, without resorting to pop-song clichés: kiss, desire, love, marriage, life. In their reading, the song becomes a testament to the impossibility of saying anything new, even if the vividness of emotion is endlessly renewable. And here’s the catch: Beam and Bridwell aren’t bemoaning those creative limitations, but celebrating the overwhelming complexities of simple human connection.</p>
<p>Presumably, the album sprung from this particular cover, which also serves as the source of its title: <i>Sing Into My Mouth</i>. But none of the 11 songs that follow sounds quite so well conceived or executed; nothing is nearly as daring in its interpretation. There are moments when the project brings out the best in both Beam and Bridwell, whose day-job acts have been on a run of ho-hum albums for several years now. Without the reverb of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"">Band of Horses</a>, Bridwell sounds particularly animated on Ronnie Lane’s ""Done This One Before"" and especially on Cale’s ""You Know Me More Than I Know"", which features some of his most robust vocals—to the point where he’s unrecognizable. Likewise, Beam has a set of strictly structured songs to rein in some of the more elaborate arrangements that have dogged recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26448-iron-wine/"">Iron &amp; Wine</a> albums. It suits him well on Sade’s ""Bulletproof Soul"", with its barroom noir ambience and side-scrolling pace. It’s not hard to imagine <i>Sing Into My Mouth </i>pointing the way forward for both artists.</p>
<p>And yet, <i>Sing Into My Mouth</i> is never quite the sum of its most interesting moments, mostly because there seem to be just as many clumsy or complacent moments. Beam’s take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4788-el-perro-del-mar/"">El Perro del Mar</a>’s signature ""God Knows (You Gotta Give to Get)"" sacrifices the rhythmic thrust of the original as well as its essential melancholy, which leaves him with nothing beyond an awkward, even ugly vocal melody. And somehow Bridwell manages to make ""There's No Way Out of Here"", penned by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12366-david-gilmour/"">David Gilmour</a> but originally recorded by Unicorn, sound as pallid and dippy as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5079-america/"">America</a>. As ungainly as these covers are, at least they stand out. Too many of these songs strike the same tone of beery introversion and chummy camaraderie—both of which could be defining aspects of the pejorative genre known as bro rock. It’s an odd flaw considering the diversity of the source material. It’s not surprising to hear them tackle Bonnie Raitt, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/648-jj-cale/"">JJ Cale</a>, or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25235-the-marshall-tucker-band/"">Marshall Tucker Band</a>, but it’s a bit more of a stretch to hear them apply their voices and laidback sports-bar folk-rock to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5861-numero-group/"">Numero Group</a>’s Eccentric Soul series.</p>
<p>What works so well for ""This Must Be the Place"" has a flattening effect on these other selections. Instead of opening up new possibilities in the originals, Beam and Bridwell unwittingly demonstrate how limited certain songs can be and therefore how unsatisfying certain covers can sound. Essentially they have taken tunes from a wide variety of genres and rendered them all as blah folk rock. Or, to take a page from the bottles on the album cover: They’ve taken a flight of regional microbrews and made them all taste like PBR.</p></div>"|20697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20697-sing-into-my-mouth/|5.2|Stephen M.

""I like things raw and kind of sloppy,"" he told <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1507"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Resident Advisor</a> in 2012. ""I like things when they're not perfect."" That sensibility is what makes Container’s records so compelling and unique. His songs live on the verge of chaos, and though they never actually fall apart, the threat remains. At the same time, his adherence to regular rhythms and logical changes makes each track focused and orderly, at least compared to abstract noise. So you can dance to Container’s music without falling over, but you can also chill to it without falling asleep.</p>
<p>The mix that Schofield has hit on is so potent that he hasn’t needed to change it up much so far. There’s not much difference between this new album and his previous two full-length efforts, which perhaps explains why he gave them all the same generic title of <i>LP</i> (all the songs on each have one-word titles, too). Still, dig in closely and subtle modifications and peripheral developments emerge. He’s made some movement toward a denser, busier mix. That trend began on last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19024-container-adhesive/""><i>Adhesive</i></a> EP—perhaps the best distillation so far of his vision—and it continues during this album’s quick, 27-minute sprint.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The moments where things sound like they’re spilling over, bleeding outside of the track's imaginary lines, are when <i>LP</i> is most thrilling. The overlapping drum-machines in opener ""Eject"" give the sense that Schofield is discovering the beats as he makes them, a tone matched by the found-footage <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UM-3E0zz8Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video </a>constructed by Valerie Martino (aka noise-beat-maker <a href=""http://puffmutt.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Unicorn Hard-on</span></a>). ""Cushion"" starts like a straight dance track, but eventually metallic whirrs and siren calls pile on like rugby players in a scrum. The peak is closer ""Calibrate"", a hypnotic mess of stark hip-hop rhythm and hyperactive static.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of the above tracks drive firmly in Container’s established lane. It will be interesting to see if Schofield ever feels compelled to steer his rumbling vehicle into some unexpected left turns. His omnivorous creativity—a clear openness to all types of sounds—suggests he could carve a new path without losing sight of the one he’s already crafted. But whether or not that ever happens, what he’s done with Container so far is enough to ride out for a long time.</span></p></div>"|20826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20826-lp/|7.5|Marc Masters

The guitars bend with the willingness of steel girders and with every line, Kindlon strains like he’s waiting for a spotter to assist him. By the time it collapses in an exhausted heap, Kindlon’s point has been made by omission: Self Defense Family is his sole concern, the means and the end—the song itself is titled ""In My Defens Self Me Defend"". It speaks to the curious nature of the band—they’re a shape-shifting, inclusive and absorbing entity that somehow still feels closed off from society.</p>
<p><i>Heaven is Earth</i> is Self Defense Family’s second LP in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18873-self-defense-family-try-me/"">two years</a><span>—</span>they’re an extraordinarily prolific and collaborative band that’s more willing to play the traditional album cycle game while defying the idea that it needs to consist of four guys going into a studio to knock out a 45-minute record and tour through the writing of the next one. Despite having over a dozen releases under the name End of a Year, they had no issue changing it once Kindlon decided it made them sound like a <a href=""http://www.altpress.com/contributors/entry/the_name_game_why_choosing_a_band_name_is_important"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""local metalcore""</a> band. You’ll have to read the credits to keep up with their constantly rotating personnel; it’s currently six deep, though that’s always subject to change. <i>Heaven Is Earth</i> was also recorded in four different studios with four different, esteemed engineers, including Kurt Ballou (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>) and Jonathan Low (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">the National</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile"">Kurt Vile</a>)<span>—</span>more a tribute to their reputation than any kind of budget. And the video for lead single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Imn81ZysOk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Talia""</a> is filled with stock wildlife footage, meant to be ""directly ripped off from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ixRWvrkUHo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">‘It’s My Life’</a> video"" and the opposite of the typical ""band playing in a warehouse"" clip.</p>
<p>Their contrarian thinking and freewheeling structure belies the circumscription and cohesion of <i>Heaven Is Earth</i>. In the lineage of Steve Albini, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2720-mclusky"">Andy Falkous</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans"">Pissed Jeans</a>’ Matt Korvette, Kindlon sings with constant aggravation, a smart-ass frustrated by the dimwitted and probably even more so by the intellectuals. They’re not as ascetic nor abrasive musically, however<span>—</span><i>Heaven Is Earth</i> is a warm and often rich recording. But it’s one that doesn’t trust conventional displays of beauty, especially <a href=""http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/your_inferiority_complex_is_showing"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shoegaze</a>. There’s all the whammy bar abuse and tonal clusters of the genre, but it’s gone straight-edge, with none of the disorientation and gushing ambience. ""In My Defens"" segues into ""Talia"" and is distinguished entirely on its inclusion of harmonica and piano, which are employed for groaning ambience<span>—</span>a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans"">Swans</a> song in miniature.</p>
<p>Self Defense Family make good on their name throughout <i>Heaven Is Earth<span>—</span></i>there are no hooks, the songs are mostly stationary and stonefaced, waiting for you to fuck up so they can pounce. This is music that doesn’t play offense, it just takes offense. Traditional, confessional songwriting seems to be a particular pet peeve, which he addresses on ""Basic Skills"" (""peer review, I handled that poorly"") and ""Everybody Wants a Prize For Feeling"". However, it’s unclear whether the surprisingly clean jangle of both these songs contradicts Kindlon’s mocking of basic indie rock or serves as a deeper means of parody.</p>
<p>Kindlon isn't the type to have trouble getting his point across, but sometimes he appears to resist making direct points. ""Ditko"" pits simple acts of kindness against overt acts of social antagonism to ruminate on ideas of possession: one man watches your laptop while you take a piss, another pees on your lawn. Kindlon asks, ""But that’s not ownership, is it?"" and reveals his ultimate point: ""the hardest part of partnership...to possess and appreciate."" The title track juxtaposes man and animal, heaven and hell, the cerebral and physical, and the mention of an unnamed risible, self-pitying Boston artist is somehow capable of tying it together. But regardless of its intent, the arid, mirthless nature of <i>Heaven Is Earth</i> becomes wearying even after a half hour. Self Defense Family are interesting, Kindlon has interesting things to say. But <i>Heaven Is Earth</i> finds few ways to enhance what you could gain from Kindlon’s interviews or the lyrics sheet<span>—</span>an album that’s literally more interesting on paper.</p></div>"|20775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20775-heaven-is-earth/|6.3|Ian Cohen

The narrator of the cheery ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" is a man settling down after years on the road, adjusting to an empty house and a dead-end job while acclimating to the lowered expectations of a lonely life. The song's chief conflict is summed up by the line, ""I keep my spirits high, find happiness by and by."" There's more than a little bit of Isbell the touring musician and recovering alcoholic in that narrator, not only in the lines about the road (""I thought the highway loved me but she beat me like a drum"") but also in the references to not drinking (""I don't keep liquor here, never cared for wine or beer""). ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" sounds like Isbell playing a game of What If: What if his solo career hadn't taken off after he departed the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"">Drive-By Truckers</a> eight years ago? What if he hadn't emerged as one of the most popular voices in the thriving Americana movement? What if he had just settled down in one of the small towns he depicts so vividly in his lyrics?</p>
<p>It's a fine song, sporting a spare, defiantly upbeat arrangement and a melody that celebrates rather than laments the narrator's situation. With an eye for telling details that accrue into specific settings and characters, Isbell is one of few songwriters today who can turn a line like, ""Working for the county keeps me pissin' clear"" into a solid earworm. And yet, I can't quite shake the feeling that I've heard ""If It Takes a Lifetime"" before, in some iteration or another, at some point in Isbell's catalog. Five albums plus two live releases into a solo career, any songwriter will find his themes solidifying, his sound coalescing into something recognizable and, if he's lucky, something completely distinctive.</p>
<p>""If It Takes a Lifetime"", however, introduces an album that contains too few surprises. These are, as usual, not story-songs so much as they are character sketches: Very little happens beyond a character reflecting on past mistakes and present circumstances, which means the narrative arc—the big decisions, the major conflicts; in short, the action—has been consigned to the distant past. As a result, Isbell's narrators tend to be surprisingly passive, observing the world without doing very much. ""I don't think on why I'm here or where it hurts,"" notes the main character on the title track, who lives in his own memory more than in the present world.</p>
<p>""Children of Children"", which serves as the album's centerpiece, wrestles with some tangled issues in a family with ""five full generations living,"" but Isbell seems more interested in the romance of sepia-tone photographs than in the reality of a great-great-grandparent. It's an odd hull of a song, whose weirdest element is the way it borrows the female hardship of childbirth only to bolster male drama: ""All the years I took from her just by being born,"" the narrator says of his teenage mother, even though he's really talking about the burden of his own guilt. The arrangement is spare and languorous, with Derry DeBorja's Mellotron adding a windswept quality to the music. Isbell and producer Dave Cobb put that instrument to fine use on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18283-jason-isbell-southeastern/"">Southeastern</a></i>, where it played like a jerry-rigged orchestra and conveyed an immense sense of isolation. On ""Children"", however, the ersatz strings generate only ersatz drama. </p>
<p>In general, the music does little to distinguish these characters or enliven the lyrics. Cobb is one of the most adventurous producers in Nashville, and together they have made Isbell's sparest record yet, with an austere palette dominated by acoustic guitar. The results are noncommittal: not quite folk, not quite country, definitely not rock. Even Amanda Shires' fiddle sounds stripped of the eccentricities she typically brings. It's a shame, as Isbell's home state boasts a lively and surprisingly diverse music scene, with bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30335-alabama-shakes/"">Alabama Shakes</a>, <a href=""http://stpaulandthebrokenbones.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. Paul &amp; the Broken Bones</a>, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wraymusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wray</a> slyly subverting and therefore rejuvenating Southern conventions. Isbell is obviously familiar with the music of the region, yet <i>Something More Than Free</i> sounds nondescript and—worse—placeless.</p>
<p>In 2015, Southern identity occupies the center of a number of heated debates, and few artists are better poised to comment on its complexities than Isbell. But race has never been a compelling issue for him, and while class underlies every one of his songs, he long ago stopped writing about it with much acuity. His approach has become internalized, rooted in a self-consciously literary first-person perspective. And while he's created strong work within these parameters, I still lament the lack of urgency to engage with anything too far beyond the reach of his customary stand-ins. Isbell once again shows the world through familiar eyes, but here it just feels like we've seen it all before.</p></div>"|20648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20648-something-more-than-free/|5.8|Stephen M.

It's an understated portfolio, but an amazing one, and it should elevate him out of the ""recommended if you like Madlib"" pantheon onto anyone's short list of greats. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Retarded Alligator Beats </i>(eesh, that title) is another notch in the belt, even if it's kind of a shallow one<span>—</span>after all, it's only 20 minutes long. But since Alc's spent so much of his free (and paid) time plunging into the weirdo-sample abyss, even his less-substantial stuff finds a way to cohere. This time, it's through a dense patchwork of clipped soundbites, which offer alerts about train-derailing kids (""Retarded Alligator""), acid trip narratives (""A Million Cigarettes""), missives taken from '70s flicks like <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sJIQUpNo3s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Caesar</a></i> (""Muscular Infant"") and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp-sBvq9Mic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Gravy Train</i></a> (""Kirk Fuckin Douglas""). These loosely connected pop-cultural riffs on power, money, drugs, violence, and corruption echo in some of Alc's jittery beats, like the four-note suspense-sting keyboards on ""Muscular Infant"" and a thousand-yard-stare of an acid-blues guitar lick on ""Seven Minutes"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Retarded Alligator Beats </i>is over in a flash, a bunch of ephemeral tracks that hint at the wider, weirder stuff Alchemist's been doing this decade. But even on a snapshot of an album like this, he can't keep from letting his love of headknock beats shine through. The 8-millimeter piano chords on ""Jane Meets Chrissy"", choppy loops of ""Holy Tabernacle"", and sizzling '70s synthesizer noodling of ""Drug Break"" all have some authoritative drum breaks underneath. That goes double for ""Voodoo"", the only rap track and one of numerous opportunities Alchemist has given <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a> to be unpredictably outlandish (""I'm not fat, I'm only robust/ Crash the Jeep into your crib until it blows up"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So with all that recent and omnipresent work going for him, how badly would you really need an EP-length mostly-instrumental mix of his, especially so soon after last month's fantastic <i>Israeli Salad</i>? I mean, yeah, it's got a coloring-book cover if you're into that kind of novelty (drawn by Nick Gazin, the guy behind the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"">Run the Jewels</a> artwork), but otherwise we're not hurting for Alchemist releases. Still, getting a little slice more is fine, really. What with being put out on his own odds-and-ends-heavy label and having a pretty low-stakes whateverish feel to it, <i>Retarded Alligator Beats</i> is a fun diversion that feels like it was made in an afternoon, not out of some kind of first-draft laziness, but because Alchemist's gotten to the point where the trip from inspiration to production feels more-or-less instantaneous.</p></div>"|20774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20774-retarded-alligator-beats/|6.7|Nate Patrin

In all likelihood, Chapman <i>is</i> the first guy to use it in the context of an <a href=""http://www.yogananda-srf.org/Hidden_Truths/The_Hidden_Truths_in_Omar_Khayyam%E2%80%99s_Rubaiyat.aspx#.VaJ9NZNViko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Omar Khayyam text</a>. <i>Whine of the Mystic</i> is a necessarily dense title for a band like Nap Eyes, its multitudes containing additional multitudes. This is a drinker’s album, for the kind of drinker who does so alone, publicly, poring over popular 11th-century tomes. And like most other musicians you’d associate with this pastime, Chapman speak-sings dense lyrics in a nasal, weary bray tinted with sarcasm—the content portrays him as a wise man, the delivery as one someone who isn't 100% trustworthy.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that Chapman, ruminative dude he is, has thought through this image of himself and what it says about him and what he wants it to say about him. While Nap Eyes works up a Kiwi-rock rollick on ""No Man Needs to Care"", Chapman struggles to get to the revelation contained in the title<span>—</span>""Well, I was reading in my book/ Just so that everyone would come take a look/ Nobody even dares."" Chapman doesn’t seek companionship at the moment, it’s the <i>noticing</i> that gives him pleasure. Meanwhile, on ""Delirium and Persecution Paranoia"" he analyzes the meaning behind every gesture<span>—</span>""What am I trying to say by way of/ Eat with my door in a closed position?/ What am I trying to say to you/ When I sleep with my door in ajar position?""</p>
<p>Still, <i>Whine of the Mystic</i> is musically plainspoken and direct. There’s enough rhythmic jangle and lead twang to have it scan as ""rootsy"" or ""folksy"" even though Nap Eyes don’t actually appear to be a folk or roots band. Perhaps they are if you consider <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens"">the G0-Betweens</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground"">the Velvet Underground</a> as their respective nation’s folk music. <i>Whine of the Mystic</i> was recorded live with no overdubs, and they sound limber enough to let loose, but capable of keeping it together. As untraceable feedback leeches through the mix, Seamus Dalton’s constant kick drum stays <i>just enough</i> within the grid during ""Dark Creedence"", while ""Delirium and Persecution Paranoia"" and ""No Fear of Hellfire"" emulate Chapman’s mental cycling by vamping out for over seven minutes; they're all highlights and all come off like impromptu, extended live versions of songs originally planned to clock in at half their length.</p>
<p>Chapman’s a biochemical researcher by trade, a career that presumably requires so much focus and passion that there’s no off-switch. The same could be said for being a musician, so naturally songs about Nap Eyes (""Night of the First Show"") mingle with ones that incorporate Chapman’s day job. ""Make Something"" could certainly be about the drudgery that accompanies both<span>—</span>""By and large, my only success comes from the things I do begrudgingly."" It also has him complaining of, ""One sickness of brain protein aggregation/ One of upregulated oncogene""—rifle through your old biochem notes and Chapman’s referencing the growth of cancer cells to explain a hangover or heartbreak. Granted, the vocabulary interrupts the flow of the music like tiny cork pieces in your wine glass, but they’re necessary for Chapman to establish his personal P.O.V. within music that deals in very familiar tones and ideas<span>—</span>at any given point, he could be mistaken for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer"">Dan Bejar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs"">Adam Granduciel</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2714-cass-mccombs"">Cass McCombs</a>, and of course, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison"">Van Morrison</a>.<br/><br/>It won’t be long before we find out the degree to which Nap Eyes developed their own voice—<i>Whine of the Mystic</i> was a short-run 2014 release in their native Halifax, reissued by <a href=""http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise of Bachelors</a> in anticipation of an LP due next year. For the time being, Chapman is more inclined to question his own inner monlogue. On ""Dark Creedence"", he finds himself at mass on Christmas Eve, drinking sacramental wine even though he can’t understand the reasoning behind it. At least until he recognizes how the ritual parallels with his voluntary usage of wine as a spiritual guide and mental lubricant rather than a blotter. He sighs, ""Just get my drinking under control/ And I will live again,"" but note he doesn’t plan on quitting, just finding the right balance.</p></div>"|20718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20718-whine-of-the-mystic/|7.0|Ian Cohen

He's always clever, and his nasal pitch goes well with the hazy funk beats he creates. Yet his new album, <i>Innocent Country</i>, is ruminative in a way we've never heard before. Quelle's 2013 full-length, the breakout <a href=""https://quellechris360.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-at-the-finish-line"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost at the Finish Line</i></a>, found the MC/producer assessing the indie grind; <i>Innocent Country</i> is the inner dialogue of a man trying to understand his logic, no matter how random it is.</p>
<p>Yet Quelle doesn't fully articulate his views here; instead he just muddles through them. In a good way, <i>Innocent Country</i> resembles early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3834-slum-village/"">Slum Village</a>: The music has a cassette-worthy hiss that solidifies the album's nostalgia, and Quelle—whose Bandcamp is<a href=""https://quellechris.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> full</a> of low-key gems—doesn't speak directly to his listeners. He flubs lines and trails off in other places. It's shoegazing in a pure form; he's just talking it out, hoping you catch a line or two.</p>
<p>That's most prevalent on ""Well Running Deep"". It feels like Quelle is rapping alone to a mirror, reciting the words from his rhyme book and locking them into memory. ""I barely eat, and barely sleep,"" he raps, ""'cause when I sleep, I'm just reacquainted with mistakes and paths that are way gone."" Beneath the humor are the regrets he first examined on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mellomusicgroup/quelle-chris-loop-dreams-prod"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loop Dreams""</a>, a <i>Ghost</i> standout produced by Chris Keys, who handles all the beats on <i>Country</i>. The sound is loosely built around dusty drum breaks, and sonically, Keys seems influenced by early '90s West Coast rap—Cypress Hill or the Alkaholiks.</p>
<p>The soundtrack moves between wistful and nonsensical moments, which leads to a strong alliance with Quelle who, across several projects, uses conversational flows of disconnected thoughts. He strings those meditations into effective one-liners that somehow stick, even if they don't make sense. Quelle's impact isn't so much in what he says, but how he says it—with a blunted, nonchalant tone that draws comparisons to Redman. There's no shortage of randomness on <i>Country</i>: ""Murphy's Law"", featuring <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/tag/crown-nation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crown Nation</a> collaborator <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dirty-science/sets/denmark-vessey-scud-one-cult"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Denmark Vessey</a>, is carried by a lo-fi Dilla-inspired beat (think Slum Village's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g_n-a5Yma0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fantastic""</a>) where the two riff on whatever comes to mind: houses getting robbed, pork belly, stock trading, and hedge funds. The next song, ""Drugfest TooThousandToo"", is a show-of-hands survey for your favorite narcotics (""Y'all fuckin' with them shrooms?!... How 'bout the meth"").</p>
<p>Druggy satire is Quelle's thing, but <i>Innocent Country</i> is equally refreshing when the rapper reflects. On ""I Asked God"", Quelle revisits some old demons while the music conveys sullen remoteness. Yesterday, he says, ""everything was where it belonged, but something went wrong."" Quelle wakes up, dusts himself off, and tries to move forward. Yet, for reasons he can't fathom, he simply cannot. ""Maybe it's the drink, maybe need to put down the bottle, or maybe I'm drunk/ Maybe it's the weed, maybe stop hittin' them high notes, or maybe I'm skunked right now."" On <i>Innocent Country</i>, Quelle asks these kinds of questions without getting clear answers. Certain revelations take time to appear.</p></div>"|20795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20795-innocent-country/|6.9|Marcus J. Moore

In its first several years, the imprint became a bastion of the West Coast beat scene, releasing singles by veterans like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/989-daedelus/"">Daedelus</a> while nurturing the careers of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"">Shlohmo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29376-salva/"">Salva</a>, and others who mined the shared turf of instrumental hip-hop and dance music. But as Friends of Friends added even more friends to its roster, its still-nascent identity became harder to parse. Artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31733-perera-elsewhere/"">Perera Elsewhere</a> strayed from the label’s established template and significant time and energy was spent promoting lofty projects like <a href=""http://www.1979.la/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deru’s <i>1979 </i>multimedia website</a>. Even Shlohmo, once the label’s flagship artist, released his latest LP on True Panther, swapping in his hip-hop bona fides for prog and angst.  </p>
<p>So it’s nice to see that, with several of its projects in 2015, Friends of Friends appears to have adopted a back-to-basics approach. DJ duo Nadastrom contributed to the trend early this year with their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20128-nadastrom/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">self-titled full-length debut</a>. Now they’re back with a new mixtape, <i>The Life and Times of Raphael De La Ghettó</i>, which, with its gutbucket funk breaks, instrumental hip-hop, and subtly ambitious conceptual peg, represents FOF at its loosest and most free-thinking.</p>
<p>The tape is built around samples from an early episode of <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>. In the episode, Will joins a poetry club and in order to impress the women in the club, invents the ""street poet"" named Raphael De La Ghettó, improvising basic poems on the spot and attributing them to his creation.</p>
<p>Though the show is sly about what it’s doing, this is, of course, a creative reinterpretation of hip-hop’s origin story. It follows that Dave Nada and Matt Nordstrom use the character as inspiration for the kind of breakbeats and samples that would have inspired block partiers to start throwing rhymes together on the spot. In a recent <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/06/nadastrom-new-mixtape-premiere-the-life-and-times-of-raphael-de-la-ghetto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, they clarified that they used digital tools to try to replicate a loose, analogue sound and you can hear that in the summertime rumble of ""Raphael’s Theme"" and the percussive funk shuffle of ""Extra Curricular"", one of many tracks named for a memorable line from the show.</p>
<p>The breezy nostalgia of the early tracks here would be worth visiting for its own sake, but the producers also channel the sneaky-deep ethos of <i>Fresh Prince. </i>As lighthearted and clunkily formulaic as the poetry episode is at times, it still manages to insert allusions to vogueing, the black power movement, and a respectful reading of an Amiri Baraka poem. The Nadastrom mixtape follows suit, revealing its depth on the later tracks ""Raphael’s Word"" and the flute-looping ""Gettin’ Thanked"". The first of these, one of the strongest tracks here, conjures up a jittery California soul underpinned by a religious plea that adds notes of paranoia and melancholy to the tape’s largely carefree tone.</p>
<p>These more thoughtful bits slow things down, but they’re not long enough to allow the tape to stiffen into self-seriousness. The last track breaks back into raw, fun, backyard house that recalls the vogueing in the initial minutes of the episode, before winding down with a lovely sample of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5LXTNvJ38w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tyrone Davis’s ""Turning Point""</a>. It’s the exclamation mark on a sure-handed soundtrack for pool parties, barbeques, and other summer evening pursuits, on which low stakes are countered by the calm expertise of two producers helping to stoke new excitement for their still-young label.</p></div>"|20808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20808-the-life-and-times-of-raphael-de-la-ghetto/|6.8|Jonah Bromwich

And he's lonelier than ever. The bemused, occasionally melancholy isolation that defined <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/"">Innerspeaker</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/"">Lonerism</a></i> has metastasized into heartbreak, bitterness, regret—feelings <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20034635"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that can actually kill you</a> if left untended. This is a breakup record on a number of levels—the most obvious one being the dissolution of a romantic relationship, but also a split with the guitar as a primary instrument of expression and even the end of the notion that Tame Impala is anything besides Kevin Parker and a touring band of hired guns. Because of these shifts, the question of whether <i>Currents</i> is <i>better</i> than his first two albums is beside the point: it stands completely apart.
<p>Parker has never minced words about his intentions, and there's a song here called ""Yes I'm Changing"". The music communicates even more clearly:<i> Currents</i>' opening salvo ""Let It Happen"" has barely any audible guitars and makes ingenious use of a passage where it sounds like a half-second loop is accidentally stuck on repeat. It's a despairing, open-ended psych-disco hybrid whose closest modern analog is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories"">Random Access Memories</a>—</i>a record that cast disco, yacht rock, and dance pop as shared founts of old-school, hands-on music-making. In this sense, the album reimagines and expands Tame Impala's relationship to album rock<i>—</i>like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"" target=""_blank""><i>Loveless</i></a> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13385-kid-a-special-collectors-edition"" target=""_blank"">Kid A</a> </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i></a>, it's the result of a supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music while redefining their relationship to album-oriented rock. There's more care and nuance put into the drum filtering on ""Let It Happen"" than most bands manage in an entire career of recording.</p>
<p><i>Currents</i> is the result of many structural changes, most of which exchange maximalist, hallucinatory swirl for intricacy, clean lines. As we knew from ""Elephant"", the song that Parker sheepishly admitted <a href=""http://grantland.com/features/tame-impala-currents/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""[paid] for half my house,""</a> Parker is good at writing catchy, simple guitar riffs. But he’s also somehow the best and most underrated rock bassist of the 21st century, and it’s not even close on either front. The near total absence of guitars means there is nothing remotely like ""Elephant"" here. But this allows the bass to serve as every song’s melodic chassis as well as the engine and the wheels: ""The Moment"" actually shuffles along to the same beat as ""Elephant"", though it's a <i>schaffel</i> rather than a trunk-swinging plod, its effervescent lope and pearly synths instantly recalling ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" or even Gwen Stefani and Akon's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0lf_fE3HwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Sweet Escape""</a>. ""The Less I Know the Better"" merges <i>Thriller</i>'s nocturnal, hard funk with the toxic paranoia of <i>Bad. </i></p>
<p><i></i>And make no mistake, Parker is writing <i>pop</i> songs here, and doing them justice. During the lead-up to <i>Lonerism</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8888-tame-impala/"" target=""_blank"">he claimed he wrote an entire album of songs</a> for Kylie Minogue and had to stress he wasn't joking. Perhaps appearing on one of 2015's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20121-uptown-special/"" target=""_blank"">biggest pop records</a> inspired him. Either way, the external or internal pressure to keep his pop impulses at bay are gone.</p>
<p>Nearly every proper song on <i>Currents</i> is a revelatory statement of Parker’s range and increasing expertise as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and vocalist while maintaining the essence of Tame Impala: Parker is just as irreverent working in soul and R&amp;B as he is with psych-rock. ""Nangs"" and ""Gossip"" function as production segues, pure displays of ""How'd he do that?"" synth modulation that prove Parker sees himself as a friendly rival of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a> rather than someone who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/752-when-jamie-xx-dropped-tame-impala-at-coachella-why-are-we-still-worried-about-djs-playing-other-peoples-music/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">sees a strict DJ/""musician"" binary</a>. While the sitar-like frill on ""New Person, Same Old Mistakes"" has hints of shimmering Philly soul, there's also engagement with the dubby textures and repetitive melodies of purple R&amp;B. And for good measure, there's a bridge where Parker makes a modern studio take sound like a forgotten, vinyl breakbeat and drops it mid-track like a jarring DJ transition—a trick most effectively used on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>' ""On Sight"" and ""I Am a God"".</p>
<p>While Parker will never <i>not</i> sound like John Lennon, this time, he imagines a fascinating alternate history where the most famous Beatle forsakes marriage and the avant-garde for ""Soul Train"" and Studio 54. On <i>Innerspeaker</i>, Parker's melodies were effectively smudged with reverb and layering—once drawn with charcoal, now they're etched with exacto knives. As a result, the singles on <i>Currents</i> could be covered by anyone, and Parker has advanced to the point where he can write and sing an immaculate choral melody on ""'Cause I'm a Man"" and have it sound like a soul<i> </i>standard.</p>
<p>""'Cause I'm a Man"" also puts Parker's personal life front and center in a new way. The chorus (""I'm a man, woman/ Don't always think before I do"") finds him in league with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/"">Father John Misty</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20131-i-love-you-honeybear""><i>I Love You, Honeybear</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"">My Morning Jacket</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20396-the-waterfall/""><i>The Waterfall</i></a>, taking an unsparing and often unflattering look at masculinity and romance, examining what qualifies as biological instinct and what qualifies as mere rationalization for wanting to fuck around and/or be left alone.</p>
<p>The emotional power of <i>Currents</i> comes from its willingness to accept that relationships will expose an introvert's every character defect. Parker's lopsided inventory is revealed on ""Eventually"", which exposes the false altruism often used to justify ""it's not you, it's me."" The structure of the chorus (""But I know that I'll be happier/ And I know you will, too/ Eventually"") makes it plain that it's always about <i>me</i> first. And even if Parker honestly wishes eventual happiness for ""you,"" he wants it to arrive on his schedule. On ""The Less I Know the Better"", he calls out an ex's new lover by name and plots his empty revenge (his ""Heather"" to her ""Trevor""). By the next song (""Past Life""), Parker passes her on the street and considers giving her a call not because he cares or wants to get back together, just because he <i>can</i>. He fools himself into thinking a new routine of picking up dry cleaning and walking around the block, which he enumerates in a mumbled, pitched-down monologue, constitutes a new existence, but it's all part of the same continuum.</p>
<p><i>Currents</i> could be called a ""transitional album,"" but what Parker seems to realize is that all albums should be so named, because <i>life</i> is transitional. This is why ""Let It Happen"" leads off <i>Currents</i> rather than serving as its climactic laser-light show. It's a dazzling, impossibly intricate song about resisting the temptation to micromanage your life. And it may be a companion piece to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14404-feels-like-we-only-go-backwards/"">""Feels Like We Only Go Backwards""</a>. Notice that Parker presciently phrased the lyric with <i>we—</i>whether it's about a partner, a fanbase, or just the construct of one's self, there's always the tendency to seek comfort and stability rather than dealing with the dissonance between two entities that are inevitably subject to changing at different frequencies. The kicker was even more prescient—""Every part of <i>me</i> says, 'go ahead'."" And so <i>Currents </i>ends up being Parker's most convincing case for solitude yet—he knows that perfection can only be achieved inside the studio and progress is the ultimate goal outside of it.</p>

Will reconciliation be an excuse for nostalgia? Will the group be content to fall into old habits? This is the Chicago band’s first album with founding member Nina Gordon since 1997, and its opening sounds play like a knowing joke. On ""The Gospel According to Saint Me”, a fuzzy and sinuous bassline that could have come from 1994’s <i>American Thighs</i> burbles quietly before being cut off by sharp chords, giving way to Gordon’s bell-clear vocals: “I wanted to live/ So I pretended to die.” The sound is familiar and so is the sense of mischief, and if there’s a phantom around, it wants to party.</p>
<p>If <i>Ghost Notes</i> doesn’t do much we didn’t already know Veruca Salt could do, that’s not such a bad thing in light of the group’s checkered history. From their earliest success with 1994’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC9AUR-iTo0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seether</a>”, their music was straightforward: infectiously poppy with a grungy rock underpinning, delivered by two frontwomen (Gordon and Louise Post) who were feminist but not overtly so—more the Breeders than Bikini Kill. Their music became glossier and sharper with their second album, <i>Eight Arms to Hold You</i>, which deployed single “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyVSKydUxKk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Volcano Girls</a>” like a grenade filled with superglue and silly string, and then, mysteriously and abruptly, Gordon departed in 1998. With Shapiro already having left after recording <i>Eight Arms to Hold You</i>, Lack also exited, and Post oversaw a few newly constituted versions of Veruca Salt with dwindling success while Gordon struggled as a solo artist.</p>
<p>Gordon and Post are complements, tempering each other’s extremes while mutually enhancing strengths, and they’ve always been preternaturally skilled at transforming rotten experiences into triumphant anthems. <i>Ghost Notes</i> acknowledges this on “Black and Blonde”, the title a kind of sobriquet for the singer-guitarists and their contrasting aesthetics. Here, buzzing guitar and heavy drums underline Gordon’s angelic vocals except during the bridge, where their harmonies trill like a regretful music box. The juxtaposition makes their respective hard and sweet approaches sing, as on “Come Clean, Dark Thing”, where plain country-inflected verses alternate with a chorus backed by wailing guitar bends and Post’s scraping screams. The song’s lyrics prod and encourage, a “Hold On” for the 2010s: “Come clean dark thing/ You can breathe the air again.” It’s a sterling example of Gordon and Post’s assistive interplay and lucid sensitivity, and it’s an album highlight.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Post and Gordon are exhilarated about reuniting, and that joy is <i>Ghost Notes</i>’ main theme. “She’s the flame and I’m the glow,” declares Post, and if their glee wasn’t obvious enough, the “Laughing in the Sugar Bowl” <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMeYDS9kZcE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> shows an old photograph of the two burning in reverse—a reference to their 1998 split—then a shot of the older but wiser band members jamming, and the girls whispering to each other like besties, twin Gibson SG Standards at the ready. It’s an infectious friendship romp, marking a new chapter in the band’s Nina-and-Louise mythology.</p>
<p>The most common sin here is that the music can veer toward generic, forgettable rock. Sometimes the songwriting relies too heavily on swelling harmonies and crescendos, and occasional lyrical clichés grate. “Bang bang my head against a wall of sound,” shrieks Post on “Empty Bottle”, a song otherwise quietly prepossessing and handled expertly by producer Brad Wood. “The Sound of Leaving” showcases the versatility of Post’s voice, which can be one moment delicate, a petal on water, and a bewildered howl the next. But the track is complacently constructed, incorporating a basic guitar solo and a repetitive outro that feels more like a shrug than catharsis.</p>
<p>Apart from not futzing with the formula, the most compelling evidence of <i>Ghost Notes</i>’ looking back rather than forward is that some of its songs actually were rescued from the ‘90s ashes of the band. Album closer “Alternica”, a sprawling, slow-paced epic about alienation, loss, and hope that draws on dreamy imagery, is a spiritual sister to “Earthcrosser”, the final track on <i>Eight Arms to Hold You</i>. Not only does it hark back to the sonics of a previous era, but its evocation of a music-related space with a sci-fi name—“All hail Alternica”—is almost adorably old-fashioned. But so what if Veruca Salt’s return isn’t about doing something new? At its core, <i>Ghost Notes</i>, and the band who made it, wouldn’t be what they are if they didn’t celebrate their own homecoming. As they sing at album’s end, “In the end it comes around/ Comes around again.”</p></div>"|20786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20786-ghost-notes/|7.0|Estelle Tang

Yet, just a few years after it became a hit stateside, the Norwegian jazz singer Karin Krog recorded a version with a Scandinavian rhythm section and American tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon. Gone are the familiar acoustic guitar theme and the cinematic strings. In their place is a constantly dissembling jazz-funk groove: bass, drums, and piano playing against each other, Gordon riffing like he’s in an entirely different song. But the musicians themselves are only playing in service to Krog, whose voice leaps and flutters and twirls around the consonants. She effectively transplants the song from the Deep South to some other, slightly fantastical terrain, lending it a fragmented funk momentum that transforms it completely. It’s an amazing feat of vocal interpretation, presenting the human voice as a tool for musical and narrative abstraction and Krog as a formidable artist.</p>
<p>Recorded in 1970, ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was shelved for 30 years, first appearing in 2000 as a bonus track on a CD reissue—available only in Europe or as a pricy import elsewhere. Krog has been a prolific performer and recorder, yet few of her albums—either solo or collaborations with Gordon, Archie Shepp, Steve Kuhn, and John Surman—ever made their way beyond the continent and certainly not to America. Highly respected by jazz musicians and jazz fans, she somehow managed to glance off the U.S. market, despite—as ""Ode to Billie Joe"" makes clear—the fact that she has a lot to say about this American art form. So <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=light+in+the+attic"">Light in the Attic</a>’s new career retrospective is not only the first official Krog release on this side of the Atlantic; more promisingly, it implies an ongoing reissue series that will introduce the singer to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>To call Krog a ""singer"" does seem limiting, as the album title makes clear. She doesn’t just sing on these 16 tracks; she practices something akin to vocal sculpture, reshaping even familiar words into new sounds and lending them a vivid physicality. As she draws out her vowels and carves against her consonants, she makes the syllables sound like physical objects: keys on a xylophone, strings on a piano. As a result, even standards become de-standardized. Her finest moment may be a seven-minute cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">Coltrane</a>’s ""A Love Supreme"", on which voice replaces sax as the lead instrument. It’s a form of scat singing, although Krog seems to be mimicking the texture and tone of a synthesizer rather than a soloing horn or reed instrument.</p>
<p>Ignoring chronology altogether, <i>Don’t Just Sing</i> presents a well-rounded and adventurous artist. The comp is less concerned with the shape of her career and more interested in the breadth of her abilities. The well-selected covers (Gentry, Coltrane, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>) reveal a musician finding inspiration beyond the confines of jazz, while the collaborations suggest a vocalist who engaged closely with other musicians and played off of them intuitively. In this regard, of course, Krog is not necessarily unique: Betty Carter and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"">Nina Simone</a> and Sheila Jordan were doing similar things nearly contemporaneously. What truly distinguishes the Scandinavian from her American peers is her easy means of abstraction: the way she turns each words into a new piece of onomatopoeia. ""As a Wife Has a Cow"", which she adapted from <a href=""http://myweb.dal.ca/dhevans/2034/Readings/As%20A%20Wife.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Gertrude Stein poem</a>, overlays her vocals until the words shed their meaning and become pure sound. Similarly, she fills ""Images in Glass"" with shards of syllables, which sound sharper than the actual samples of shattering panes. It’s less a song than a multimedia installation.</p>
<p>That recording in particular demonstrates the degree to which Krog used technology to manipulate her voice, not just looping and layering but distorting it to find ever newer shapes. It’s no coincidence that nearly every photograph in the liner notes for <i>Don’t Just Sing</i> shows her with a microphone in her hand: Such equipment was a crucial aspect of her performance, a useful means of not just singing. As her career progressed—and, crucially, as technology caught up with her imagination—Krog’s music grew more unearthly, less and less anchored to traditional song structures. On ""Tystnaden"" she oohs and ahhs, mews and sshhhes, as though testing out the range of her own instrument; that flight of fancy morphs so fluidly into her cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/"">Herbie Hancock</a>’s ""Maiden Voyage"" that you’d swear she dreamed them up as complements to each other. In fact, they were recorded five years apart. <i>Don’t Just Sing</i> sketches out an exciting career, and hopefully additional reissues will fill in the details.</p></div>"|20787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20787-dont-just-sing-an-anthology-1963-1999/|8.0|Stephen M.

The 28-track, 70-minute album is a sprawling work that allowed the laconic young rapper to explore the depths of his mind and ability. He had a hand in producing 15 tracks from <i>Tin Wooki</i>, many of which are left as instrumentals. The album is an introduction to the jazzy, downtempo mood of Watson's music, as well as his heady, alliterative rhymes. <i><a href=""https://chesterwatson.bandcamp.com/album/summer-mirage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Summer Mirage</a></i> is Watson's first rap release since <i>Tin Wooki (</i>he's released three beat tapes in the interim). A 19-minute EP with just six songs, <i>Summer Mirage</i> is more easily consumed than its predecessor, and also finds Watson better in command of his free associative, internal rhyme-heavy style.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Watson operates in the darkness on <i>Summer Mirage, </i>surrounded by sparse, bass-driven beats. Most songs begin with a loud noise as an introduction: a heavy xylophone on ""Chosen"", a thump and a door creak on ""Deep Sea Tundras"", a flat, UFO-like synth on ""Wrath of the Guided"". From there, Watson unleashes his unassumingly brilliant lyrics. Like his obvious influence <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, Watson rarely strays from his natural monotone, and his delivery is never strained. In that way, Watson's voice is as much a platform as it is a tool for his wordy bars.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The EP consists mostly of the 18-year-old's musings, both abstract and mundane. His near-stream-of-consciousness lyrics connect the lines with tangential thoughts and homophonous words. On ""Islands"", for example, he works his way from a maze to Greek mythology to teenage nerves: ""I think I'm done/ Lost inside this maze, I think it's won/ Now I'm gazing at the sun/ Son of Hades, wish Poseidon would have claimed me/ I'm at one, with the spaces and the waves, and yet I quaver breaking blunts."" Through sound alone, he maintains a logic to the mental leaps within the bars.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Watson succeeds most when rhyming for the sake of rhyming. On ""Chosen"", he demonstrates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF DOOM</a>'s uncanny ability to articulate every little syllable of every word with precise rhythmic cadence: ""See, my kindness is diminishing/ Five bitches and middlemen/ Process to belittle them time-ticking."" (Watson underlines the influence with a reference to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"">Madvillainy</a></i>'s ""Curls"" later in the song.) The words don't have a natural internal rhyme, but Watson enunciates each syllable so particularly that he creates his own rhyme-like scheme.</p>
<p>Watson does his fair deal of self-mythologizing on <i>Summer Mirage</i>. He is, once again, very aware of the ridiculousness of some of his own claims: He calls himself a ""self-proclaimed pharaoh of the future"" on ""Deep Sea Tundras"", a tacit acknowledgement of that boast's inherent flimsiness. Like a young DOOM, Watson masks himself behind a persona of grandeur (though not literally). We learn little about Watson, but he'd like to keep it that way. We, instead, get a mix of his presumed daily activities and some pseudo-philosophical contemplations (""The moon is my conscience/ In tune with the waves and the loom on the starship""). But, again, Watson's rapping is so strong that it covers any flaws or lack of revelations in his songwriting.

But the shared imperative is tension, which is exactly where Negative Scanner excels on its eponymous debut. For the Chicago foursome, it's at once a conscious goal and the consequence of a band threatening to fly off the rails. Suffused with desperation and determination, the songs on <i>Negative Scanner</i> trudge from forbidding valleys to staggering peaks.   </p>
<p>The players' physical exertion is palpable:drummer Tom Casling punctuates white-knuckled eighth-notes with frantic cymbal strikes, bassist Nick Beaudoin opts for down-strokes, and dual guitarists Matt Revers and Rebecca Valeriano-Flores hold back, chiseling riffs down to just a few needling notes. For a fast and barbed record, it might seem counterintuitive to cite the players' restraint, but they frequently shove out or delay anticipated climaxes and chord changes. Those moments are especially charged and frenzied – much more invigorating than if the group just cut loose when expected. Coupled with trebly, sinuous production, it lends <i>Negative Scanner</i> the feel of skittering on a knife-edge.</p>
<p>Valeriano-Flores' pressurized bellow also distinguishes Negative Scanner from similarly zipped-up post-punk acts. Syllables arrive in fits and spasms, like clusters of jabs, making her titular refrain in a song like ""C.P.D."" exceptionally stirring, especially given its ghastly lyrical impressions of assault. ""Tireless violence / It decides if you submit to it,"" she projects above the arresting chill of two alternating guitar chords. ""Don't set me free, C.P.D. / Get off easy, C.P.D.,"" she sputters at the end, each letter landing like an indictment. On ""Saturday Night &amp; Sunday Morning,"" Valeriano-Flores audibly resists the urge to yell, which hard-boils her enunciation into the fraught, warbling shout of a fighter on the other side of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Negative Scanner's earlier catalog, which consists of two EPs released in 2014, featured a couple glimpses of pop in the midst of chaos, particularly on ""Ambitious People."" <i>Negative Scanner</i> makes good on this impulse with the platinum projectile ""Would You Rather"", but otherwise seems unconcerned with bright melodic flourishes. The band's accomplishments here are harder earned. ""Planet of Slums"" vamps on static notes with increasing vigor until feedback envelops and turns it to scree. The same thing happens with Valeriano-Flores' vocals,  which ascend with  perceptible effort.</p>
<p>But ""Pity"", the closer, is <i>Negative Scanner</i>'s loftiest statement. For an album that's so concerned with how to configure a crescendo, ""Pity"" is a fitting endnote. At its apex, Valeriano-Flores trumps all of her earlier performances with an exultantly delivered line that yearns for even more: ""Do you want to get higher? / Do you want it, do you will it?"" Forget punk and post-punk, ""Pity"" is a blasted ballad – and a potent demonstration of how tension is most rewarding when it snaps.</p></div>"|20736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20736-negative-scanner/|7.1|Sam Lefebvre

Rashad Harden, along with lifelong friend and collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32321-dj-spinn/"">DJ Spinn</a>, was at the forefront of footwork's manifest destiny until his tragic death last year; his last full-length release, 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/""><i>Double Cup</i></a>, is often considered the genre's high watermark. Posthumous four-track EP <i>6613</i> is the icon's first solo <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub</a> release since that album, and it arrives in a year overflowing with stellar footwork releases, as though some higher power attuned to avant garde dance music felt sorry for the world's loss. There's been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20450-dark-energy/""><i>Dark Energy</i></a>, a vision from Gary producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32851-jlin/"">Jlin</a>'s apocalyptic Afrofuture, and most recently, scene godfather <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33038-rp-boo/"">RP Boo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20782-rp-boo-fingers-bank-pads-shoe-prints/""><i>Fingers, Bank Pads &amp; Shoe Prints</i></a>, its abstracted, essentialized structures evoking De Stijl compositions. In comparison, <i>6613</i> feels like comfort food—a return to Rashad's soulful side, though not without its own dark corners.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The EP's four tracks form a gradient of intensity, shifting gradually from cheery and familiar to aggressive and disorienting. ""CCP2"", in collaboration with Spinn, eases us in with juked-out block party fare. Given warmth by Rashad's signature Rhodes melodies and punctuated by giddy whoops, it's the kind of track that can serve as a gateway drug to those used to four-on-the-floor patterns. (</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9642-from-teklife-to-the-next-life/""><span>According to Spinn</span></a><span>, he and Rashad used to call these ""grease tracks,"" stuff to lubricate the rawer, more rhythmically complicated tracks for unfamiliar club-goers.) Standout track ""Cause I Know U Feel,"" featuring DJ Gant-Man, is built around an jacked-up sample of Alicia Myers' 1984 disco jam </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j2irKho384"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""You Got the Best of Me (Say, Say, Say)""</span></a><span> that dissolves into heavily-filtered, arpeggiated synth wails. The sweet, coy original becomes belligerent and overpowering, an innocent crush snowballing into obsession.</span></p>
<p><i>6613</i>'s second half breaks from the soulfulness, channeling a mood closer to the twitchy menace of 2013 cut ""I Don't Give a Fuck"". ""Ya Hot"", featuring Spinn and Teklife's Bay Area ambassador Taso, explodes with trap-style 808 patterns gone rogue; just as things start to get claustrophobic, a clearing opens, and whirring <span>drum'n'bass</span> rhythms creep into the open space. On ""Do Not Fuck""—a family affair that includes Taso, Spinn, and DJ Manny—Rashad somehow anticipated the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKl6umkwKfU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current ubiquity</a> of the <i>Kill Bill</i> siren in Atlanta rap, which spin and stutter over what sounds like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZV0jZne1-I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Valley level</a> in ""Super Mario Kart"". It feels like an encroaching panic attack—although if some intrepid DJ doesn't blend it out of a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/"">56 Nights</a></i> cut in some after-hours warehouse in the coming months, this summer will have been for naught.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ff86af06-6fe5-29d7-e366-0e25742e4a12""><span>If anything, this collection feels more of a piece with Rashad's </span><i><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/1lEHis0Fl2vPVtTfOCVdpe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teklife Vol. 1: Welcome To The Chi</a></i><span> from 2012 than the smoothed-out, syrupy vibes of </span><i>Double Cup</i><span>.

It's the cornerstone of Sleaford Mods' sound, underscored by double-tracking on crucial phrases; the music behind it is loops made by Andrew Fearn, the other half of the band, mostly from blunt basement-rock bass and drums. (On stage, the two of them are a delightful contrast: Williamson burning-eyed and venting, Fearn hanging back with a beer in his hand, bobbing his head and not even pretending to do more than press the start button at the beginning of each song.)</p>
<p>Williamson and Fearn are both weary-looking white guys in their mid-forties, and they've been kicking around the music world long enough to not have an iota of idealism about it. The title of <i>Key Markets—</i>something between Sleaford Mods' third album and their ninth, depending on how you count—refers to a '70s-era supermarket, but it's also a canny reference to the way the band has been clawing its way up in the British music scene. It's been less than a year since Williamson was able to quit his day job as a ""benefits adviser,"" which provided the raw material for both their best-known older song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udp6fZ9vWCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jobseeker""</a>, and the new album's ""Face to Faces"": ""Free money, mate, just fill in the form and if you can't then I can 'elp ya.""</p>
<p>The state of a working class that politics have kicked in the face over and over is the central subject of Williamson's topical, allusive, syllable-drunk lyrics. His mocking rants spool out like bog roll yanked by a cat, occasionally rhyming, miraculously snapping into sync with Fearn's beats. ""Miliband got hit with the ugly stick, not that it matters/ The chirping cunt obviously wants the country in tatters,"" Williamson spits on ""In Quiet Streets""; it's not quite <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>-caliber for either invective or internal rhyme, and it arrives two months after Ed Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, but it'll do. (Likewise, you need to have a fairly deep knowledge of both British politics and Britpop to parse a couplet from ""Rupert Trousers"": ""Idiots <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-26254624"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visit submerged villages</a> in 200-pound wellies, spitting out <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2271277/Alex-James-haven-Blur-bassist-turned-cheesemaker-music-room-Oxfordshire-farm.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fine cheese</a> made by that tool from Blur/ Even the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/28/blur.drummer.byelection.defeat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drummer’s</a> a fuckin' MP: fuck off, you cunt, <i>sir</i>."")</p>
<p>Sometimes Williamson sings, after a fashion, which is where <i>Key Markets</i> gets weird, in much the same way that early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Fall</a> records got weird when Mark E. Smith tried to carry a tune. (The creepily catchy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-gvxxhcS8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tarantula Deadly Cargo""</a>, which may or may not be a scatological joke, would fit right in on the Fall's <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MkAZb6ebSc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dragnet</a></i>, especially Fearn's asthmatic guitar plinks.) ""No One's Bothered"" is another sung one, the closest thing here to the form of the '70s punk that's deeply embedded in Sleaford Mods' art, and it's built on a smart trick from Fearn. His rhythm track is a three-minute extension of a punk song's bolting bass-and-drums intro, a loop of the few seconds before the guitar inevitably dives in—which it never does here. ""You're trapped? Me too,"" Williamson snaps. ""Alienation? No one's bothered."" The punk rock on which Williamson and Fearn grew up promised a lot of catharses that weren't actually forthcoming, so they don't even hint at those. But they've adopted its raw elements—crudity, spittle, black humor and unpretty voices—as durable tools to express discontent.</p></div>"|20770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20770-key-markets/|7.5|Douglas Wolk

But by the time the singer dissolved the group in 2013—following four full-lengths and a number of singles—it seemed like he, too, needed a breather. Not long after Sic Alps called it quits, he released a solo record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18659-mike-donovan-wot/""><i>Wot</i></a>, under his own name. On <i>Wot</i>, Donovan took a break from skronk and hiss, focusing instead on acoustic guitar-driven sounds inspired by '60s folk and country music. The production values were more traditional and the subject matter slightly more earthly and universal. It was a relaxed and pretty set of songs, which may have been to its disadvantage. If you were drawn to Alps' for the topsy-turvy sounds, <i>Wot </i>might have come off a bit staid.</p>
<p>In this sense, Peacers' self-titled LP is a course correction. Ostensibly a band, <i>Peacers </i>was recorded by Donovan and long-time collaborator and former San Francisco cohort, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>, who produced the album and performed on a number of the songs. It's not exactly Sic Alps Mk. II, but there are some clear similarities. The record's eerie psychedelic pop strikes a similar balance of order and chaos, with songs that rev up only to be subverted by detours into dissonance and static. The music is often wobbly and disjointed, with tracks like ""Mary Jane/Glorious Sunrise"" and ""Drama Ensues"" congealing into a groove only to vaporize with little resolution. The musical reference points have shifted away from Bob Dylan and back toward Syd Barrett and Tronics. As a singer, Donovan has exited his folkie phase and returned to his old self—tuneful, but disturbed, like a zombie Marc Bolan. And the bad vibes abound. </p>
<p>Bitterness was a key component of Sic Alps. Living in a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco, Donovan and his bandmates sounded like defiant weirdo survivors, fending off a rising tide of dotcom normies. As their hometown buffed up, they staked a claim in the psychedelic fringe, willful outsiders keeping the candle lit for the city's storied '60s subculture. The band's final EP came with the epigraph, ""Digger gold vs. Google dorm. Real SF will rise again.""</p>
<p><i>Peacers</i> feels like a continuation of that attitude, though apart from one or two moments—closing cut ""Super Francisco""—it's rare that the message is clearly stated. Rather, it's implied in the disquieting and rubbery nature of the music. Donovan's songs plot out a course toward a grimmer, grimier, and freakier world. And depending on your perspective, that may be an attractive destination.</p></div>"|20653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20653-peacers/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

Their splits with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4234-thursday/"">Thursday</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"" target=""_blank"">Jesu</a> are crucial documents of post-hardcore diplomacy as is their working relationship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>, reaching out towards post-rock, metal, and emo. Bands that incorporate some combination of those elements—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore"">Touché Amoré</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4953-envy/"">Mono</a>, to name a few—sing their praises. They may have singlehandedly legitimized screamo. All of which sets up quite nicely for <i>Atheist’s Cornea</i>: it can be framed as a ""triumphant return"" and also an opportunity to reappraise their overlooked past work without having to go through the trouble of reissuing it. But after five years that reiterated how much Envy has influenced other bands, for 40 minutes, <i>Atheist’s Cornea</i> plays out a complete role reversal.</p>
<p>""Blue Moonlight"" starts with a 20-second salutation of wayward, delayed notes that gets decimated when the band enters with a typical, consumptive roar. This move doesn’t get repeated all that much throughout <i>Atheist’s Cornea</i>, though it’s a proper introduction in promising, ""this is a post-hardcore record that will have pretty moments."" Its means of making good on that promise go as expected. ""Blue Moonlight"" bursts apart in opposite directions much like Deafheaven’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15379-deafheaven-dreamhouse/"">“Dream House""</a>, heat-seeking guitars skyrocketing towards the sun and drums keeping the rhythm of falling down a jagged mountainside. Meanwhile, the twin guitars of ""Ignorant Rain at the End of the World"" swordfight like early Thursday, swift clashes of sharp, clanging metal. Closer ""Your Heart and My Hand"" damn near namechecks an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky"">Explosions in the Sky </a>song with its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzIK5FaC38w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title alone</a>, to say nothing of the tremolo-picked clean leads and drum crescendos and everything else that causes ""cinematic!"" and ""epic!"" to be dug out of critical wordbanks like a reflexive, glassy-eyed dig into a bag of popcorn.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the specific textures of Tetsuya Fukagawa’s vocals aren’t as easy to imitate as Envy’s pedalboard setup. Compared to most of his peers, Fukagawa has a squat, muscular, and ugly tone rather than something shrieking or abrasive. Especially as the band becomes more slickly produced, Envy songs are immiscible mixtures where the vocals always rise to the top. It can be difficult for non-aficionados to distinguish what makes for a <i>good</i> vocalist in this realm, but Fukagawa clearly has range. Not in the multi-octave operatic sense—rather, he has a number of distinct modes of expression. Whether he’s dramatically muttering spoken word, letting out a blowtorch-intense, burnt-black scream, or a surprising sing-song cadence in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17506-envy-footsteps-in-the-distance/"">""Footsteps in the Distance""</a>, <i>Atheist's Cornea</i> maintains an urgency that’s palpable even for those who don’t speak Fukagawa’s native language.</p>
<p>Still, this is a tenuous foothold as the instrumentals of <i>Atheist’s Cornea</i> go through every ""emotional"" post-hardcore motion. They may boast more technical precision and higher production values than most—the gleaming open chord strums on ""Footsteps in the Distance"" sound like straight-up alt-rock triumph rather than some distorted approximation of it. Likewise, the tinkling Rhodes solo in the middle of ""Shining Finger"" is a legitimately new touch and there’s unassailable beauty in the sighing string arrangements of ""Ticking Time and String"" (naturally) and the cymbal washes of ""An Insignificant Poem"". It’s not Envy’s fault these effective means of establishing contrast are basically public domain tropes in post-hardcore. But Envy established their reputation of being one step ahead rather than in lockstep with their peers...it <i>is</i> their fault for assuming the risk of doing these things in 2015. There’s almost no way Envy intended to namecheck their progeny in such an orderly manner. But it does get to the troubling contextual effect of hearing them in 2015 rather than echoed in other’s work: Envy just sound like an Envy-influenced band now.</p></div>"|20712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20712-atheists-cornea/|6.0|Ian Cohen

But given the Duke's decades-long track record of taking creative risks, the two disparate minds coming together made a certain kind of sense.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Plank, who got his start as the soundman for famed German actress/singer Marlene Dietrich, was a maestro at multi-tracking, creating alien atmospheres for pioneering experimental rock acts such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Guru"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guru Guru</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-58875162-758a-002d-e32d-e0627e749b64""><span> Plank wasn't entirely foreign to jazz, having done sound the year before for fellow countrymen Alexander von Schlippenbach on the piano great's seminal album </span><span>T<i>he Living Music </i></span><span>and </span><i>Nipples</i><span>, the free-jazz classic by saxophone colossus Peter Brötzmann.</span></span> Ellington, meanwhile, usually worked with a large ensemble and an even larger imagination for where to take it, a combination that seemed custom-made for multi-track recording. As with the rest of Ellington's rich and storied career, a combination of fate, savvy, and mutual connections brought the aging bandleader and the vanguard engineer together for a brief time at Rhenus Studio in Germany's Harlem of kosmische muzik, Cologne.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this session, which contains three takes apiece of two different songs, is how Ellington's Orchestra comes across when filtered through Plank's audio setup. For a producer whose work is so affiliated with heavy doses of pitch bending, echo, controlled reverb, and other forms of early electronic sound manipulations in his work, it's wild to hear how <i>natural</i> this recording is, as though Plank—himself a great admirer of the Duke—knew not to trifle with music that writer Henrik von Holtum compares to Johann Sebastian Bach in the liner notes to this release. </span>""With both Bach and Ellington, you can sit down at a piano simply to go through it building chords and something great always happens,"" he explains. ""This music is so rich, and it is virtually indestructible.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the three versions of ""Alerado"", it is the combo organ work of Wild Bill Davis that takes center stage. Here, Davis picks up where he left off upon joining Ellington in 1970 for a leading man role on ""Blues for New Orleans"", the opening track off that year's </span><i>New Orleans Suite</i><span>. By the time they get to the third take, Davis seems to have discovered his inner Billy Preston, taking the brass section to a church somewhere between a cathedral and a ballpark, running full stride in a way that wastes no second of the opportunity provided to him by Duke, who seems happy to let Davis take the wheel.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But if there is any evidence from this session of a direct creative connection between Duke and Plank it is on the set's second track, ""Afrique"". Duke is front and center, and there's a discordance in his playing that suggests an admiration for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"">Cecil Taylor</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hill"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Hill</a>. This song would wind up, in its more percussion-driven form, on <i>Afro-Eurasian Eclipse</i>, a record revered for its excursions into African folk music, Southern R&amp;B, and even rock'n'roll. But on the three versions of ""Afrique"" recorded with Plank, Ellington can be heard exploring minimalism as expertly as his most vibrant, Technicolor playing from the heyday of swing.</p>

That's partially due to an inability to come to terms with Simone, whose penetrating breadth and pointed sagacity, to this day, remains a source of both comfort and discomfort to listeners. It's also because the project—co-executive produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"">Ms. Lauryn Hill</a>, largely produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/"">Robert Glasper</a>, and featuring almost a dozen key artists—doesn't seem to ever come to terms with itself. It's a tribute to Simone's legacy, but in many ways, it's not.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Revisited</i> arrives at a time of renewed interested in the pianist and singer's life and art, and as a companion piece to the must-see documentary <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/title/70308063"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>W</i><i>hat Happened, Miss Simone? </i></a>(Seriously, stop binging on whatever you're binging on via Netflix and push play.) In the past decade, the flame of Simone's heritage has been kept burning by Verve Records' <i>Verve Remixed</i> series, most notably on 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9749-remixed-and-reimagined/""><i>Remixed and Reimagined</i></a>, which put the vocal stems of her RCA recordings through the mixers and production tools of a variety of DJs. The project featured renditions that not only updated a timeless artist, but also fostered inquiry about the voice, the phrasing, the poise that stood undaunted by all of the technology-assisted musical changes. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">By contrast, <i>Revisited</i> relies on contemporary singers updating Simone, and sometimes not doing the High Priestess much proper worship.   There's issue to be taken with the choice of songs here. Numbers like ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"", ""Sinnerman"", ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", and others, while being staples of Simone's live sets, are not her original numbers, reducing much of the album to covers of covers. Sometimes these work. Gregory Porter's rendition of ""Sinnerman"" translates well, but that's because Porter's voice—plaintive but confident—is suited to this kind of material, as he showed on the stirring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmDcWr1yqCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""1960 What?""</a> from his 2010 debut, <i>Water</i>. And the severely under-appreciated Alice Smith provides that album's best number with ""I Put a Spell on You"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Haunting and pleading, ""Spell"" is not just a song, it's a moment of abject desperation—picture <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> on his second night in an in-patient rehab facility, curled up in a corner with debilitating withdrawal symptoms, and you’re close. If it doesn't make sense to describe this song by using another singer as metaphor, that may be because it makes no sense to pay tribute to Nina Simone with a Screamin' Jay Hawkins song. Regardless, Smith owns the fuck out of ""Spell"", much the same way Jimi owned Dylan for ""All Along the Watchtower"" and Bobby Shmurda took ""Jackpot"" from Lloyd Banks to make ""Hot Nigga"". If there's any justice in this world, no one will ever cover ""I Put a Spell on You"" again, whereas <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>'s Salaam Remi-produced take on ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"", might as well be a Sinatra tribute.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">  For her part, Ms. Lauryn Hill—who perhaps introduced an entire generation to Simone with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIXyKmElvv8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Fugees' ""Ready or Not""</a> when she rhymed that ""while you imitatin' Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone/ And defecating on your microphone""—provides five songs here (six, if you count that she's credited with producing the remake of Simone's ""African Mailman"" instrumental). These are a mixed bunch. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" feels like a self-indulgent exercise to prove that she can sing in French; her remix of ""I've Got Life"" finds her not singing, but rapping—and pretty unconvincingly at that. In the same way that this project is sure to leave listeners wondering why Simone was important as a singer, ""I've Got Life"" leaves one wondering why Ms. Hill, full of empty narcissism and wordy pedantry, was very important as a rapper. Yet, when she's not sounding like a newcomer doing a poor L-Boogie impersonation, she comes through with a pitch perfect cover of ""Feeling Good"", and by the time she's running through riffs near the end of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", all is forgiven and we're reminded that Ms. Hill—a Black woman with classical aspirations, a dark-skinned Black girl posed as object of beauty, a pop culture fetish figure striving to be a social agent—has always been a generation's Nina Simone.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, what's missing here is Simone's voice. Even though it appears on the album's final number—full and deep and wide and light on ""I Wish I Knew How It Felt to Be Free""—her metaphoric voice has been muted, akin to the way Kanye West covered her up with AutoTune on <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/""><i>Watch the Throne</i></a>'s ""New Day"" and sped it up for ""Blood on the Leaves"", which turned <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcCm_ySBslk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strange Fruit""</a>, one of the most piercing songs in American history, into a mishmash about sidepieces and drugs and being down for your n-words. Simone's true endowment to culture is the steadfast way she engaged social issues and activated protest and love in her music. There's little of the fire and compassion that Nina Simone embodied on <i>Revisited</i>. (For that, it's urged that you check out 2008's excellent <i>Protest Anthology</i>, which mixed her more political numbers with contextual interview snippets.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What is here is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32712-jazmine-sullivan/"">Jazmine Sullivan</a>'s ""Baltimore"", which while not a Simone original, should have, for obvious reasons, been put to much greater effect. ""I'm never gonna come back here/ 'Til the day I die/ Oh, Baltimore/ Ain't it hard just to live,"" Sullivan sings strongly, but safely. It's personal, not political and it's disheartening. The album's most poignant political moment comes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>, who breaks out of his placating Black coffee shop rap on ""We Are Young Gifted &amp; Black"" to spit, ""Mississippi, goddamned/ Ferguson, goddamned/ Staten Island, goddamned/ Baltimore, goddamned,"" but without the inclusion of Simone's signature ""Mississippi Goddam"", the line is sure to go over the heads of many.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9ad3dd9d-6e37-a832-4ce5-eb0633b5bbb2""><span>  With this shaping up to be the year that Nina Simone truly gets revisited—in addition to this album and the aforementioned documentary, there's a controversial biopic coming later this year—it's less important that this album do the job by itself of capturing Simone. (To be fair, not even </span><i>What Happened, Miss Simone?</i><span> does that.) </span><i>Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone</i><span> seems geared towards introducing a contemporary to the High Priestess of Soul, and how well it does that remains to be seen. The album's inability to get it right is a testament to America's inability to come to terms with Blackness and Black genius, which was always at the core of Simone's struggle. In that sense, it's the perfect tribute album—just not in the way it intended to be.</span></span></p></div>"|20753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20753-nina-revisited-a-tribute-to-nina-simone/|7.0|kris ex

He was coming off almost a year in prison, and the last album he'd offered fans before beginning his sentence was early 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/""><i>Rebirth</i></a>, a misguided-if-actually-kind-of-endearing rock album. By the time he was free and the summer of 2011 swung around, the thought of new Weezy filled fans with feelings they would never have again: anticipation and excitement. We got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/""><i>Carter IV</i></a>. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2015 and, after four years of hit-or-miss releases, <i>The Free Weezy Album</i>. A set billed as a ""Tidal exclusive"" doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Tidal is already looking like the MiniDisc of streaming services and it’s only been around for a few months. The existence of <i>FWA</i> starts to make sense when you realize that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a> (and by extension Cash Money) has essentially taken what would be <i>Carter V</i> hostage, and Wayne is currently prohibited from profiting from new music. But, as an ""artist owner"" of Tidal, no one is telling him he can’t release things for free. <i>The Free Weezy Album,</i> then, has a double meaning.</p>
<p>For every memorable line or couplet (on ""He’s Dead"", he flatly admits ""rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten,"" and on ""Pull Up"", a clear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> diss song, he pulls some vocal acrobatics, mimicking Thug's percussive, ratatat delivery) there are many clunkers (""she get hard dick and McDonald’s 'cause she so tired of them whoppers,"" from ""I Feel Good""). Closer ""Pick Up Your Heart"", a tedious attempt at channeling protégé <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, features Wayne pleading ""I don't wanna do it no more"" but any kind of emotional resonance is nullified by a goofy spoken-word outro. His last words on this record are ""She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners.""</p>
<p>Listening to <i>FWA</i>—which is slight by design and not any kind of statement release—I kept thinking, ""This is what listening to a new Dylan LP in the '80s must have felt like."" You knew you were in the hands of a living great, and you could convince yourself a few songs every few years were worth saving. Across <i>FWA</i>'s 15 tracks and laborious 65 minute runtime, I can salvage ""Glory"" and <i>maybe</i> ""Without You"", but I can’t help but feel like the guy cherry-picking songs from <i>Knocked Out Loaded</i>. The effort and energy are there but the soul is missing, even when Wayne calls back to New Orleans bounce staple sample ""Trigga Man"", references TRU, or in the album’s funniest and oddly sweet moment, says ""it’s Lil Wayne, I been this shit since Lil Zane,"" which only reminds you of when he was young, hungry, and full of potential.</p>
<p>It all raises the question: What do you want from Lil Wayne in 2015? Because let’s face it: 2007 Wayne ain’t walking through that door. Since 2011 and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7bmJBhduvc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Grove St. Party"" with Lil B</a>, how much Wayne music could be deemed essential? Has he crossed a ""Simpsons"" line where he’s been ""okay"" longer than he was great? Wayne will always wring a few memorable lines from any song, but how many of his mixtapes or singles or features have had staying power since then? Is this what we want from 2005’s best rapper alive? Are you the same person you were a decade ago?</p></div>"|20796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20796-fwa/|5.5|Matthew Ramirez

The music commands more respect now, but the accolades are disproportionately showered on a boy’s club of talented, offbeat songwriters circuitously linked together under the banner of ""alternative R&amp;B"" by little else than the fact they all had very good albums out the same year. ""Alt-R&amp;B"" isn’t just circuitous, though; it’s not real. Cordoning off and lionizing an alternative quadrant of R&amp;B dismisses gifted but traditional singers like K. Michelle as plebeian, and worse, it carries the subtle insinuation that this music can’t be—and hasn’t always been—delightfully weird.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>California soul collective the Internet frequently weather the alternative R&amp;B tag, but hopefully their new album </span><i>Ego Death </i><span>will help shake the descriptor. It made sense around the group’s 2011 debut </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16145-purple-naked-ladies/""><i>Purple Naked Ladies</i></a><span>, a quiet collaboration between Odd Future affiliates Syd tha Kyd and Jet Age of Tomorrow architect Matt Martians. On </span><i>Purple,</i><span> Syd stepped out of her role as Odd Future’s house engineer into that of singer-songwriter for a batch of quirky, sometimes-crass tunes about the peaks and pitfalls of love and sex. Since then, Syd and Matt have expanded the project into a fully functional band. While the arrangements grew more accomplished between </span><i>Purple </i><span>and 2013’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18567-the-internet-feel-good/""><i>Feel Good</i></a><span>, the songwriting lagged, sultry and intimate, if, at times, not much else. Syd comes into her own as a writer on </span><i>Ego Death</i><span>, and the band steps up and reins </span><i>Feel Good</i><span>’s </span><span>jazz-chords-for-jazz-chords’-sake extravagance into tight, hooky hip-hop soul.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Ego Death</i> is both spare and quietly musical, its crisp low end anchored in hip-hop as the rest of the band coolly branches out into jazz, funk, and rock. Think of it as an offspring of early neo-soul pillars like Groove Theory and Maxwell’s <i>Urban Hang Suite</i>, bedroomy but also lush and progressive. <i>Ego Death</i> is leagues too studiously retro to fit anyone’s idea of ""alternative,"" but it’s still plenty odd. These songs frequently take hard, unexpected turns: Opener ""Get Away"" is a tribal bass and percussion stomp in the verses (twice as sinister live) but gossamer and pretty around the choruses. ""Gabby""’s hip-hop strut melts into a psychedelic waltz-timed coda adorned with pretty, wordless melodies from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"">Janelle Monáe</a>. ""Girl"", the album’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a>-assisted centerpiece, hangs spectral keys over thick, heavy bass until the groove trails off into a spacey interlude. <i>Ego Death</i>’s short cuts get straight to the point, while the longer ones tease out instrumental sections without coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5444bdbe-6ab4-c613-6f92-0bef129964f1""><span>The economic, purposeful instrumentation clears ample room to showcase Syd’s writing, and she’s got a war story here for every stage of love and loss: ""Special Affair"" and ""Go With It"" are horned-up player’s anthems (""Fuck what’s in your phone, I wanna take you home.""), while ""Get Away"" and ""Under Control"" beg a suspicious lover to stop nagging about girls she’s not cheating with. ""Girl"" is the big syrupy cohabitation ballad, the song couples will hug and sway through at the live show, but ""Partners in Crime Part Three"" raises the stakes, testing our duo’s mettle with a </span><i>Thelma &amp; Louise </i><span>police chase. Syd taunts an old flame on ""Just Sayin/I Tried"", chanting ""You fucked up,"" but ultimately coming to peace with the break because she did everything in her power to stop it. Parsing Syd’s lyrics can feel like eavesdropping on a lover’s quarrel in a restaurant; she’s adept at tackling complex matters of the heart in a voice that’s both relatable and conversational. The Internet’s songs have always felt like scenes of salaciousness happening just out of earshot. </span><i>Ego Death </i><span>finally pulls us into the maelstrom.</span></span></p></div>"|20783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20783-ego-death/|7.4|Craig Jenkins

The California quartet released a few solid records of experimental, mid-aughts indie pop that were easy to overlook because they never quite fit into any sort of trend or local scene. In fact, their biggest moment since 2006 was probably accidental: they may have been momentarily confused with the German band Velveteen, who generated a brief period of notoriety in 2008 by <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1584748/death-cab-for-cuties-narrow-stairs-has-leaked-april-fools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disguising their own album</a> as a ""leaked"" advance copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab For Cutie</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11501-narrow-stairs/""><i>Narrow Stairs</i></a> (the Velvet Teen’s debut <i>Out of the Fierce Parade </i>was produced by former Death Cab guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5613-chris-walla/"">Chris Walla</a>). But the lack of expectations actually can benefit <i>All Is Illusory</i> by allowing Velvet Teen to establish a new identity. <a href=""http://www.topshelfrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Topshelf</a> has relaunched the careers of certified emo O.G.s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid/"">Braid</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/387-braid-and-the-jazz-june"">the Jazz June</a> and introduced them to younger fans drawn in by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31608-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra"">leaders</a> of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31918-you-blew-it/"">new</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33001-sorority-noise/"">school</a>. Does this mean the Velvet Teen have been grandfathered into the genre?</p>
<p><i>All Is Illusory</i> suggests they have, but in an unexpected way<span>—</span>it might be the only record to ever fit into emo based solely on its drums. The Velvet Teen became a much more interesting band with the addition of Casey Deitz in 2006 and he’s been allowed the opportunity to serve as a de facto voice in addition to Judah Nagler. Deitz applies the spectacular technique of speed metal to everything you could learn from listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox"">Jawbox</a>, Braid, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring/"">the Promise Ring</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football/"">American Football</a> records just for the rhythm sections<span>—</span>channeling the urgent, kinetic and unpredictable physicality that distinguished these bands from the more staid and slack ""college rock"" of the mid-to-late '90s.</p>
<p>To clarify, Nagler has proven quite adept at the spirited, unhinged singing of this style, though it appears he may have taking a few vocal lessons since the Velvet Teen's quietly released 2010 EP <i><a href=""https://thevelvetteen.bandcamp.com/album/no-star"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Star</a></i>. He’s still as much of a belter as he was on <i>Cum Laude!</i>, only now he removes the distorted mic filters and projects into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley"">Buckley</a>-esque ululations, dusky mutters and, on ""The Manifest"", a vocoder. Taken out of context, Nagler now sounds like he could’ve fronted one of those ""next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/252-nu-radiohead"">Brit-rock bands</a> that cropped up at the turn of the century. As it turns out, his unorthodox, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke"">Yorke</a>-ish means of enunciation and pronunciation also tends to wad up lyrics which might actually be better off being misunderstood. Lean into what Nagler’s actually saying and finicky, self-impressed bon mots cut against the plaintive narrator: ""Oh, finally a taste/ Words fall from my ellipses,"" ""If you can take my chaos, baby/  I’ll map your terrain."" That said, ""I was made from dust/ Call me Macgyver,"" makes me think he appreciates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1260-dipset/"">Dipset</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciD2b_DtyaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deep cuts</a>.</p>
<p>But this is Dietz’s album, and the emotional status of <i>All Is Illusory</i> is best demonstrated by actions rather than words. Deitz underlines the instability and wanderlust evoked by ""Sonreo"", as tricky fills and pivots allow him to keep pace with a player piano having a nervous breakdown. Erratic bursts of double time and pounded open hi-hats express the romantic hopelessness on ""Eclipses"", while the impulsive ""You Were the First"" is power pop played like a noise duo<span>—</span>it could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend"">Vampire Weekend</a> being covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"">Lightning Bolt</a> or vice versa. Either way, I'm not sure I've heard anything quite like it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I can say I <i>have </i>heard <i>All Is Illusory</i> before and you likely have as well if you lived through the mid-2000s and owned a record or two released on Barsuk. ""Pecos"" and ""Sonreo"" take after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2892-menomena/"">Menomena</a>’s idea of pop collage, big, whirling synth loops, cut-and-paste production, and chunky percussion that focus on the band’s process rather than persona. But <i>All Is Illusory</i> is too reliant on Deitz’s involvement, and it slumps whenever he has to play a supporting role rather than the lead. Oddly enough, this doesn’t occur during the nearly 11 minutes taken up by ""Taken Over"", where the insistent, patience-testing repetition of its doleful melody is the entire point. Instead, ""The Giving In"" and ""Church or State"" are typical ""atmospheric"" mid-album padding, Deitz assigned to swaying waltz time and staid rattle and hum while backing pealing, gleaming Edge guitars. For all of their upgraded production, instrumental technique, and influences, <i>All Is Illusory</i> sounds like a record that primes the Velvet Teen to succeed around the time <i>Cum Laude!</i> was released<span>—</span>but making the best ""2006 indie rock"" record of 2015 makes them stand out in a way that they hadn’t managed yet.</p></div>"|20761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20761-all-is-illusory/|6.9|Ian Cohen

The former's scratchy coo provides counterpart to the latter's airy moans, and by matching those subtle harmonies to seething, grungy backgrounds (as well as employing sonic quirks, like using a reel-to-reel tape machine from the '50s to record their debut EP), Creepoid have heretofore been able to avoid the paint-by-numbers redundancy suffered by similarly nostalgic peers such as Superheaven. It's a shame, then, to see them regress on their newest record, <i>Cemetery Highrise Slum</i>: a set of depressive shoegaze tunes that captures the sound without catching the spirit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Creepoid's exodus from Philly's DIY punk scene to one of the nation's most infamous sludge-metal strongholds bears the expected sonic hallmarks: swampy, heavy bass, percolating guitars, slower tempos. On tracks like ""Here"" and ""Calamine"", the foursome surrender to their own plodding grooves, coasting along on waves of reverb and letting the notes fall as they may. They're not averse to earworms: With its mournful guitars and Pumpkins-reminiscent churn, opener ""American Smile"" sounds tailor-made for coasting down roads on a summer's night; its chorus' directive to ""cough at the moon"" provides a welcome touch of morbid humor. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Miller's drowsy tenor suits itself well to the band's lazy-river tempos, but the frequency and insistence with which he slides around the melody grows wearisome by the third track, and downright annoying by the end. Coupled with the meandering nü-gaze of ""Tell the Man"" and ""Eating Dirt"" (the latter of which swipes from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91yrS5PUJBY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana's ""Very Ape""</a>), Miller's disdain for a solid, sustained lead vocal translates into a vague, often directionless listening experience, as well as an act of overcompensation for an unremarkable voice (though it bears mentioning Troxell's high, clean soprano provides welcome, but infrequent relief). And then there are the lyrics—for every ""cough at the moon,"" there's a muttered clunker like ""you shake my heart"" right behind it, indifferently delivered, an aural  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's something to be said for the band's devotion to disorientation: it's a fucked-up record for fucked-up people, and its inherent queasiness is a part of its charm, not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/"">Title Fight</a>'s similarly-woozy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20173-hyperview/""><i>Hyperview</i></a>. But whereas that band used shoegaze and sludge as references and jumping-off points, Creepoid treat it like the whole point, and the album grows wearying long before it's over.</p></div>"|20735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20735-cemetery-highrise-slum/|5.0|Zoe Camp

After putting out a few singles, he released his one and only solo album, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/""><i>Space Is Only Noise</i></a>, when he was 21 and still a student at Brown University. That record introduced a unique sensibility that centered on Jaar's expertly constructed slow-burn rhythms and his unusual voice, which looms between speaking, singing, and chanting in an almost comically low register. He had an aesthetic connection to minimal techno and its attendant fascination with dub, but his voice lent his music a pop sensibility that drew fans from outside electronic music circles. In the four years since, Jaar has done everything <i>but</i> follow up <i>Space</i>'s success with another solo full-length. He steered the <a href=""https://other-people.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Other People</a> label, which has a busy release schedule (including Jaar's own EPs) and has experimented with a subscription service. For a while he focused on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/"">Darkside</a>, his psych-jam project with guitarist Dave Harrington, which got relatively huge until Jaar left it behind. He created <a href=""http://crackmagazine.net/2013/10/audiovisual-artist-tarik-barri-schedules-shows-with-nicolas-jaar/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">installations</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59562-nicolas-jaar-scores-jacques-audiards-dheepan/"">film soundtracks</a>, started yet another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54466-listen-to-nicolas-jaar-and-sasha-spielbergs-just-friends-track-dont-tell-me/"">duo</a>, pulled off a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18243-daftside-random-access-memories-memories/"">full-album remix</a>—Jaar's a multimedia artist, and the traditional album cycle doesn't fit his m.o.</p>
<p><i>Pomegranates</i>, an alternate soundtrack to Sergei Parajanov's 1969 avant-garde film<i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_of_Pomegranates"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> The Colour of Pomegranates</a></i>, is the producer's latest excursion, and it's one of his most unusual projects to date. The film, a non-linear depiction of the life of Armenian poet Sayat-Nova, has an ornate surrealism that for me brings to mind Matthew Barney, and the soundtrack often serves as a minimal contrast to the onscreen grandeur. Heard just as an album, <i>Pomegranates</i> often sounds like Jaar's version of <i>musique concrète</i>, with buzzing electronics, warped orchestral samples, and jittery recordings of scrapes and rustles coursing through the mix. Jaar's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60107-nicolas-jaar-releases-free-album-pomegranates/"">description</a> of it as ""a weird collage of the ambient music I had made over the last 2 years"" is apt; it's an album of fragments, ranging from abstract sound design to pretty piano solos. There are long stretches, particularly in the early going, where it's more of a sound piece than what is usually described as ""music"", but the album's second half contains some of Jaar's loveliest tunes.</p>
<p>While Jaar has always had a great ear for texture, his music has been defined by its rhythmic sense, a loping swing that has become his signature. Beats only crop up in a few places, and when they do, they snap you back to the producer's organizing aesthetic. ""Shame"", for example, with its processed vocal and slow groove, could easily be an interlude on a Darkside release. But the bulk of the record is filled with drifting tracks that defy classification. ""Pass the Time"" mixes room tone with a pinched vocal sample that sounds like it's been crumpled up and is being dragged around on a string. ""The Fool and His Harem"" sounds like broken Middle Eastern instruments half-playing a modal melody amid bursts of hiss. ""Beasts of This Earth"" brings to mind the near-music of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Nuno-Canavarro-Plux-Quba/release/171531"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nuno Canavarro's <i>Plux Quba</i></a>, where tracks half feel like something that was found on the ground. If it's not always easy to locate Jaar in these soundscapes, there is always a lot to explore within them.</p>
<p><i>Pomegranates'</i> other notable element is something we've heard from Jaar since the beginning—piano, sometimes heard in isolation and sometimes mixed in with the electronics. ""Nothingness"" is almost unbearably delicate, as single notes are played and then electronically stretched into long and thin tendrils of sound. And the record's back half features the piano more prominently, most notably on the solo ""Muse"", which comes over like a nocturne mixed with a jazz ballad. The piano tracks serves as a kind of tentpole on the record, pulling it back whenever it threatens to seem too much like a collection of sound design without any particular shape. After the textures and the flow lure you in, the melodies rise to the surface, slowly, giving <i>Pomegranates</i> a quiet lingering power.</p></div>"|20791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20791-pomegranates/|7.6|Mark Richardson

It may not always feel like it, but it was. Think about it—we didn't even have iPhones! Or streaming Netflix! Point being, we live in a different world than we did 11 years ago, and so does the Tough Alliance. While the Swedish synthpop duo's first set of EPs, </span><i>Make It Happen</i><span> and </span><i>Holiday</i><span>, were imbued with a sense of urgency and wacky newness upon their release, in the cold, harsh, retrospective light of a new decade, that sheen has sadly dulled a bit. The burgeoning tongue-in-cheek chemistry between childhood friends Henning Fürst and Eric Berglund is still present, but the edginess that set them apart is mostly gone. The ideas are there, though, and it makes for an interesting, if a bit frustrating, jaunt down memory lane.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Not that it takes away any of TTA's many accomplishments since then—quite the contrary, revisiting these first forays into irreverent lo-fi pop territory make their subsequent releases shine all the brighter. Having not only founded cult record label <a href=""http://www.sincerelyyours.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sincerely Yours</a> in 2005 (and signed compatriots <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27763-jj/"">jj</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"">Air France</a>), and reached what may be their creative apex with 2007's stellar full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10668-a-new-chance/""><i>A New Chance</i></a>, Berglund has found ways to push his style of hyper-happy electropop even further with his acclaimed ceo side project. And granted, a lot of TTA's appeal resided not in their musicianship—although it can safely be said that that aspect was mastered over time—but their concept as a mock-dangerous party band rife with a sense of irony and humor. After all, this is a band comprised of two skinny white dudes who have been thrown offstage for swinging baseball bats at each other and sell Sincerely Yours-approved bulletproof vests on their website (<a href=""http://www.sincerelyyours.se/yours0034.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sold out</a>, we checked).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Case in point: <i>Make It Happen</i>'s closing track is a two-minute cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D3crqpClPY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">50 Cent's ""Many Men""</a>, with Berglund nasally posturing: ""Many men wish death on me […] and niggas trying to take my life away,"" amidst samples of gunshots and Fürst's spiraling, droning synth line. The track is a testament to the time-capsule feel of listening to these early tracks in 2015: N-bomb deployment notwithstanding, it's incredibly ballsy for two Scandinavian guys to deconstruct and almost outright <i>parody</i> a song that's literally about being shot in the back nine times. Imagine the social media crucifixion that would occur if such a cover were to happen today, and while a lot can be said about the moral juxtaposition of gangsta rap and lo-fi pop, ""Many Men"" is also a testament to how far TTA were willing to push boundaries to stay true to their manifesto (even if, as Swedes, they may not appreciate the nuance of an American white person covering that song verbatim). It feels like it's in the last few minutes of <i>Make It Happen</i> that TTA chance upon their winning formula: dark, funny, cocky.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That formula begins to be honed on <i>Holiday</i> and its eponymous opening track, which sees TTA embrace the light-hearted tropicalia sound that threads throughout the rest of their discography while holding onto that aforementioned dark streak. It's a bouncy, straightforward uptempo dance track, with Berglund's punk-tinged sneer lending it just the punch it needs not to fall into monotony. It's by far the highlight of the two EPs, its superficially bright demeanor hinting at the aesthetic peaks that the band were to reach by the end of the '00s. ""Velocity Boy"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a> cover, veers back into highly entertaining faux tough-guy peacocking, with Berglund whining: ""Here I come again/ With vodka in my veins"" before hitting a chorus of ""I don't care at all/ Leave me alone.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5a2041c5-691b-8df9-20ba-25f9f86fff7a"">TTA have been ludicrously accused of promoting hooliganism by authorities in their native Sweden, but their take on music and violence comes from such a studied place, one would have to be truly obtuse to take their bat-swinging postures seriously, which is what makes their band as a whole so fun. Having never officially broken up, and Berglund releasing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28811-ceo/"">ceo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18915-ceo-wonderland/"">second album</a> last year, it would seem like perhaps new material from TTA wouldn't be completely out of the question sometime in the murky future. If that ever does happen, though, their early work may continue to pale, ever so softly, against the bright lights of their astounding highs.</span></p></div>"|20779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20779-make-it-happen-holiday/|6.9|Cameron Cook

The title might be a joke, but it also signals an uncomfortable familiarity. Statik, whose real name is Patrick Baril, has unceremoniously pumped out hour-long projects like this for the last eight years, and just about all of them feature some three dozen rappers. Earlier this year Baril was asked about what motivates him as a producer and <a href=""http://www.beatmakingvideos.com/Video/statik-selektah-x-istandard-interview-sxsw-2015-statik-selektah-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he responded</a>, ""It's a really simple formula: fuck with artists that don't suck at rapping."" It's a pretty flat, dispassionate motto, but practically speaking, he's built the philosophy into an alignment with a batch of East Coast semi-underground rappers for the better part of a decade. On albums like <i>Lucky 7</i> Statik corrals them into an assembly line and feeds them beats.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a producer, Statik isn't the type to push boundaries. His baseline sound is manufacturable with skill: a few similar drum patterns snap into place on almost all of his songs, a loose sample—guitar, horn, or twinkling keys usually—clicks on top, and a chorus is often, but less frequently recently, scratched out of a famous '90s vocal sample. It's a recipe for an unambitious palatability, but Statik has also definitely gotten better over the last decade, and at his best (which includes about a quarter of this album) he can coax out smoother, more alive grooves than this latter-day boom-bap formula usually allows. The worst thing here is the format—21 tracks and no continuity—not the music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Statik has loosened his tendency toward a three-rapper quota per song—though there are still far too many of them here—and it's easier to down the first few tracks in sequence because of the effect. On ""Another Level"", Rapsody delivers with less flash than the rest of the bunch but is nonetheless one of the most interesting. Her oddly placed inflections and abrupt rhyme schemes have become a hallmark, but it's still fun to soak up and parse. On ""Beautiful Life"", a best-foot-forward lead single, Statik musters up an '80s pop-inflected feeling for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>, the New York rappers with whom he's most closely aligned.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bronson can make himself at home anywhere, but at worst the collaborations can run cold, a hazard of the format and Statik's production as much as anything else. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28303-royce-da-59/"">Royce da 5'9''</a> sounds tired of his dexterity when he often revels in it elsewhere, but there's nothing in the choppy beat of ""Crystal Clear"" to charge him up. It's easy to mistake Illa Ghee for Sean Price on ""Gentlemen"", but at least the off-kilter loop Statik builds up from a prog sample suits them well enough to share the same space. Later, ""Top Tier"" gathers obligatory and disposable verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"">Bun B</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5555-styles-p/"">Styles P</a> over the most middling production of the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a whole<i> Lucky 7</i> sounds a lot like everything else Statik Selektah has done up to this point; the album is neither offputting nor particularly exciting, and it's hard to feel strongly about at all. A couple of the songs sound good enough to have just gotten cut from better solo albums, but that's not a strong selling point. To his credit, the guy churned a formal mixtape series into a bona fide discography. It's not surprising he's leaving the format behind, and he's certainly milked it for all it's worth.</p></div>"|20762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20762-lucky-7/|5.0|Jay Balfour

Sure, there's Chedda da Connect's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D3js33Nk3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Flicka Da Wrist""</a> and T-Wayne's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGKK8eGQQEk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nasty Freestyle""</a>, two unlikely hits that quickly charted on the Hot 100, bolstered significantly by Vine popularity. Those songs are catchy, if unremarkable; the real gems come from the perennially underwritten city's new guard, including BeatKing, the Sauce Twinz, Sosamann, 5th Ward JP, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32815-maxo-kream/"">Maxo Kream</a>. These guys revere their city's traditions but understand rap stardom in the post-major label era; they worship at the altars of Fat Pat, Lil Keke, and Pimp C but also brand themselves with signature emojis (the triple water droplet, in the case of the Sauce Twinz) or take lyrical cues from whatever is trending on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjXUdlLkCLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WorldStar.</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"">RiFF RAFF</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travi$ Scott</a> are the only major rap stars to break out of the city in practically a decade, and even <i>they</i> aren't what most would consider household names. Instead you've got guys like Drake and A$AP Rocky siphoning its swag and displacing Houston rap culture while its own icons, past and present, live within their own relatively self-contained universe. The ultimate manifestation of this skewed dynamic came earlier this year, when known <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABJK1qOO9XY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Houston fetishist</span></a> Drake hosted his second annual <a href=""http://www.rap-up.com/2015/05/19/drake-announces-houston-appreciation-weekend-2015-lineup/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Houston Appreciation Weekend</a>. None of its headliners hailed from Texas at all, save Bun B, who's technically from Port Arthur. Sauce Walka (half of the Sauce Twinz) called out the discrepancy in an <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/3C8db3vOTf/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Instagram video</span></a> that weekend.</p>

It's the latest in his unstoppable stream of highly entertaining free projects over the past couple years, including last year's breakout tape </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19623-beatking-gangsta-stripper-music-2/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Gangsta Stripper Music 2</i></a><span>, his four-volumes-deep </span><i><a href=""http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/beatking-club-god-4-new-mixtape.115692.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Club God</a></i><span> series, and his </span><a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/29769/gangsta-boo-beatking-underground-cassette-tape-music.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>joint release</span></a><span> with Memphis legend Gangsta Boo. And while it's not quite as consistent as </span><i>GSM2</i><span>, it shows BeatKing expanding beyond the meme rap that built his buzz.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>BeatKing's a comedian at his core, and his raunchy, button-pushing humor is as sharp as ever here. The best showcase is ""That Ain't My Thot"", a riff on the </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-uj8wTCyj8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Silkk the Shocker/Mystikal classic</span></a><span>. </span><span>The guy oozes charisma; it's hard not to be charmed when he calls himself a ""sexy fat boy"" with a caricatured lisp. To be sure, he's got his share of ""problematic"" themes. He treats sex and women (and especially sex workers) like he treats the rest of his subject matter: crudely and graphically. Taken at face value, there's a lot here that could potentially alienate female listeners, or anyone not into sophomoric humor. But I take comfort in the sense that he's the type who roasts everything and everyone around him, including himself: ""If I said I'm throwing money in a song, then I'm lying,"" he admits on the same track.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As always, these are not songs made for quiet introspection—they require a club or a car for full activation. Some draw from current rap trends, mostly outsourced from Atlanta: self-produced ""Holup, Holup"" borrows the <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/06/10/beat-construction-tm88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kill Bill </i><span>siren</span></a> that 808 Mafia have all but trademarked this year. Even then, they are transformed by mere proximity to BeatKing, whose world reflects reality like a fun-house mirror. ""Chasing Dat Check"", featuring hometown hero <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4128-slim-thug/"">Slim Thug</a>, could've been a fairly standard-issue Migos impression, but BeatKing adds a layer of playful snark to its hustlers themes: ""Niggas wanna hate, they don't make sense/ Stevie Wonder at a skating rink,"" he deadpans.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And perhaps more than any other members of Houston's new guard, BeatKing reps his hometown's musical legacy—nowhere better than on the title track, the tape's easy standout. Voice screwed to a guttural drag, he maneuvers seamlessly through multiple beat changes, including a water-logged <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTBsN-KeNE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Still Tippin'""</a> flip. It's some of his deftest rapping yet, and while ""freestyle"" rarely does what it says on the tin these days, there's a gut-driven ease here that suggests extemporaneity. It's a worthy tribute to Swishahouse freestylers of the late '90s and early '00s (and should prove eye-opening to anyone who still thinks RiFF RAFF's ""I done shook dice with Larry Bird in Barcelona"" style is an original). ""H"" slows a new jack swing sample to a syrupy crawl for a love song to his city, on which he nostalgically recalls the first time he saw the ""Still Tippin'"" video on BET in '05, in that singular stretch when Houston rappers ran the airwaves. ""'I'm still in love with the H, that'll never change,"" Chalie Boy sings on the hook. It's a poignant moment, whether or not the outside world hears it.</p></div>"|20751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20751-houston-3-am/|7.0|Meaghan Garvey

But it is reality, and despite recent strides at dismantling how bodies direct society, it remains worth contesting. <i>The Wild Animals in My Life</i> does this subtly, with poise. There is nothing didactic about this heavy dream pop record, but it doesn't take long to decipher Flesh World's outsider perspective. The band is lead by vocalist/guitarist Jess Scott, formerly of C86-indebted pop-noiseniks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28324-brilliant-colors/"" target=""_blank"">Brilliant Colors</a>—who, alongside Veronica Falls and Allo Darlin', released some of the more memorable records of the contemporary Slumberland era. It was at the San Francisco HQ of long-running punk bible <i>Maximum Rocknroll</i> that Scott met guitarist-synthesist Scott Moore, of the essential queercore band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Limp-Wrist/53115536388"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Limp Wrist</a>, known for pissed, purposeful outcast spirituals like ""Punk Ass Queers"" and ""I Love Hardcore Boys/I Love Boys Hardcore"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite these seemingly disparate stylistic backgrounds, it's not surprising that Scott and Moore would come together. It seems rather inevitable that folks working in genres like hardcore and indie pop—where there are typically more sonic parameters, where things are tight, sped-up, compacted—would eventually want to free themselves and make impressionistic music like this. (As with <a href=""https://lavidaesunmus.bandcamp.com/album/flesh-world-mlp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013's self-titled EP</a>, <i>The Wild Animals in My Life</i> is out on <a href=""http://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a small hardcore label</a>, affirming their ties to that community.) Flesh World, now a punk-not-punk quartet, audibly revel in the newfound breathing space, tugging at the nuances of candied noise, brash '70s punk, and the gauze of shoegaze, fleshing out their emotional possibilities with disarming melodies. Scott's voice is patently, unconventionally gorgeous, more grave and poetic and goth than her sweet-pitched approach in Brilliant Colors, as if Nico joined a shoegaze band. In her old group, Scott once wrote a song about seeing Patti Smith (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5gT5MuK2HE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cult Face""</a>), and here she joins the ranks of punk singers channeling the cool androgyny of Smith's expressive inflection into a DIY aesthetic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the tender, harsh, and searingly honest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17401-flesh-world-just-to-tear-me-down/"">""Just to Tear Me Down""</a>, Scott sings, ""I could hang myself out to dry/ From the storm of this fantasy/ Either way, you cut my faith,"" her syllables bleeding like watercolors, their tones ambiguous and beguiling. This vulnerability and strength plays out across <i>Wild Animals in My Life</i>, which hones on themes of alienation, blurred self-perception, and love that can swallow you whole, all with an uncanny calm. The sing-song title track almost starts with a lightness, before growing increasingly gloomy with each verse. Scott says the title was a <i>National Geographic</i> headline about a zookeeper, repurposed for the careless people around her: ""I know they're ruthless and uncaged/ I know they're thrashing and untamed."" You can hear them wear on her.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Wild Animals' </i>music sometimes sounds likes it's moving in opposing directions all at once, like tectonic plates diverging. Former Brilliant Colors drummer Diane Anastasio brings a barebones rhythm section, recalling the minimalism of Moe Tucker or Bobby Gillespie on <i>Psychocandy</i>, underpinning the whole record with a hypnotic tension. The band only occasionally races off on an ethereal 1-2 punk blast,<span> as on the penultimate ""Your Love Is Like a House""</span>; ""Shaved Head"", meanwhile, is a screeching tale of restless youth with a Sonic Youth sprawl. It all lends their music an alluringly monochrome, filmic quality. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Flesh World have indeed been more likely to name-check underground queer filmmakers like Kenneth Anger and Bruce LaBruce as influences than other bands. They have been vocal about their interests in the queer histories of art and literature, in paying homage and following the thread. <i>The Wild Animals in My Life</i> was recorded with Canadian punk pioneer Don Pyle (of Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, authors of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebHfMRw--sE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ""Kids in the Hall"" theme song</a>) who is from Toronto, which seems fitting—it's the city where queercore launched with the publication of the legendary '80s zine <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/650-queering-the-pitch-on-jds-and-the-roots-of-queercore/"">J.D.s</a> </i>(co-founded by LaBruce). Were Flesh World born a few decades earlier, <i>Wild Animals</i> tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17475-flesh-world-poolside-boys/"">""Poolside Boys""</a> or the dire, rocketfire ""Strawberry Bomber"" could have adorned one of <i>J.D.</i><i>s</i>' <a href=""http://40.media.tumblr.com/1c61027ea979ce451a9f84b016b3ddf8/tumblr_nozpze13z41qawqoao3_540.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Homocore Hit Parade""</a> pages.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Accordingly, Scott says she wrote ""Poolside Boys"", the record's most stunning track, after visiting an exhibit by 1960s pop artist David Hockney. She must have been staring down the vibrant, cerulean blues of his classic swimming pool paintings, the ones with nude men against modernist Southern California architecture, with so many implications of queer desire, like vintage visual love poems. Even without this context, ""Poolside Boys"" bursts wide open, washes of reverb, color, and light that glow more with the foil of their surrounding greys, and its sublime tones feel optimistic. Scott's words are simple—""I painted/ Something for David... Something beyond the brush/ Something I liked very much""—which makes it prettier, more mystical. Limp Wrist once said they put the ""core"" back in ""queercore,"" and here, Flesh World puts the ""dream"" back in ""dream pop,"" envisioning familiar sounds in a crucially different way. Square in the middle of a record that can be excessive, albeit endearing, in its dour veil is a moment of unrepentant brightness, beauty and hope.</p></div>"|20707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20707-the-wild-animals-in-my-life/|7.7|Jenn Pelly

It's Wu-Tang revisionist mob history, the rap equivalent of retroactively inserting Captain America into the World War II timeline. Longtime Ghostface Killah alter ego Tony Starks<span>—</span>Marvel's Iron Man, repurposed<span>—</span>acts as the enforcer for the DeLucas, a Cosa Nostra-esque crime family terrorizing 1960s Italy. He decides to set off on his own, falling in love with the boss's daughter in the process, and he is subsequently murdered by his former employer for his perceived treachery. Starks' ashes are then pressed into a dozen records, and when they are played he is resurrected as Ghostface, an embodiment of the departed's thirst for vengeance.</span></p>
<p>It sounds like something out of a comic <a href=""http://www.okayplayer.com/news/ghostface-killah-and-adrian-younge-12-reasons-to-die-comic-book-album-trailer-video.html#slide5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">because it is</a>—this is the same rapper who named his debut after an Avenger and commissioned a Marvel artist to ink the artwork for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14112-wu-massacre/""><i>Wu-Massacre</i></a>. Ghostface has always been enamored with the medium, and his colorful storytelling lends itself well to sequential framing. But<i> Twelve Reasons to Die</i> was rough around the edges, trying to fit too many moving parts into its ambitious conceptual framework. It was limited by obtuse exposition and lazy transitions as transparent as a strip's ""meanwhile…"" panel. The second installment in the saga, <i>Twelve Reasons to Die II</i>, hits the reset button, hopping decades and time zones, recycling the original blueprint but recasting Ghostface as an anti-hero.</p>
<p>If <i>Twelve Reasons to Die</i> is a comic, then its sequel is the cinematic adaptation or a reboot of the franchise; the source material is the same, but the execution is tightened in places. It has a bigger-budget feel—stronger guests, better pacing, and a more careful consideration for its audience. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a> narrates the passages too tricky to rap. Adrian Younge warps thick '70s soul sounds into a concrete jungle. But mostly, <i>T</i><i>RTD II</i> is simply able to succeed where its predecessor failed with the benefit of hindsight. With a proper framing device, more capable bit players (Scarub and Chino XL), and closer attention to detail, Ghostface and Younge do a better job sketching out an alternate universe.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The key to <i>TRTD II</i> is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"">Raekwon</a>, who stars as Lester Kane, an upstart New York City kingpin at war with the DeLucas in the mid-'70s and a foil for Ghostface's Starks. Here, unlike on his recently released gaudy solo album, <i>Fly International Luxurious Art</i><i>,</i> he is noticeably comfortable, penning engaging underworld scenes. He remains an asset to modern Ghostface, whose yarns don't string quite as far these days.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Peak Ghostface could tell an entire story in footnotes; this Ghostface is less subtle. But something happens to him rapping next to Raekwon: On ""King of New York"" he is as graphic as ever describing Kane (""the New York mob scene is just scared of his suits""). Seconds later, Rae chimes in as Kane, and the exchange breathes real life into the character, who plays a pivotal role in the plot. Raekwon's dense, barreling lyricism is perfect for the action sequences of ""Return of the Savage"" and ""Blackout,"" where gunfire is exchanged in flurries. Ghostface is still sometimes hilariously literal on <i>TRTD II</i> (""Bash him with a disco ball/ It's the '70s!""), but when challenged, like on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"">Vince Staples</a>-assisted ""Get the Money"", he still comes up with great writing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ghostface is the visible star at the center of the production, but he is backed by Adrian Younge, the silent star who stitches </span><span><i>TRTD II</i> </span><span>together at the seams with his evocative soul instrumentation. His murky production does a lot of the heavy lifting dramatically: He creates the worlds in which these characters interact, and his work gives everything that happens texture. He chops sequence amplifiers all the way through the finale.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-c3625b68-4f40-86df-cdef-90903fb6870a""><span>At the end of </span><i>TRTD II </i><span>(spoiler!), Ghostface Killah is reborn as a mortal man in the body of Lester Kane, opening the door for a potential third and closing act to this trilogy (RZA: ""This is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks/ In actuality, this is just the beginning""). If there is to be a </span><span><i>TRTD III</i></span><span>, hopefully it embraces the format and flow of this record.</span></span></p></div>"|20722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20722-twelve-reasons-to-die-ii/|7.2|Sheldon Pearce

Others might have traveled further, but he was, arguably, the first. The son of a former <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> bassist, Space's work has a deferential sense of groove; while his peers Rashad, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32851-jlin/"">Jlin</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32321-dj-spinn/"">DJ Spinn</a> take footwork outside of itself and draw in outside inspirations, Space seems largely driven by the desire to inspire footwork dancers. His productions lack the polish and lushness of Rashad's later work, which flourished and matured as influences like J Dilla were subsumed—it's no surprise that Rashad's work found a wider audience. But RP Boo's provincialism and focus have resulted in the kind of cleverness needed to continually impress dancers that, at this point, probably think they've heard it all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fingers, Bank Pads &amp; Shoe Prints</i>, like 2013's incredible <i>Legacy</i>, comprises a mix of new productions and selections from his 15-year-plus production history. Space relies heavily on interwoven vocal samples and, relative to his peers, less on rattling percussion. This gives his tracks a weightless, labyrinthine feel, as exultations for the dancers hold conversations with wailing soul samples and various grunts and shouts. On the manic opener ""1-2D-20'2"" all of this happens over a tangled electro sequence as an unnamed barker shouts out names of locals and...venues? Moves? Crews? You could probably unwind some of the references with Internet searches and a helpful Chicagoan, but I find it equally exciting to just let the syllables pile up into little structures, and revel in how strange and consonant the phrase ""Crackaplaya Boo"" sounds amidst the bustle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Freezaburn"" is similarly satisfying, as samples unspool over snares that arrive at odd intervals; I wouldn't recommend trying to nod along, but the sense that Space remains in control of all this provides comfort. Regardless of the lip service paid to making this music strictly for the dancers, there are moments of strangeness and oddity strewn throughout <i>Fingers, Bank Pads &amp; Shoe Prints</i>, and they serve to remind how an artist like Space can end up on a label, <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a>, still largely associated with IDM and outre electronics. I would like to hear Space explain what utility the chirping, alien voices that underpin the entirety of ""Heat From Us"" provide a battling footworker.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's easier to follow the contortions of ""Finish Line D'jayz"", whose refrain—""Mothafuck your favorite DJ""—hands the battle DJs a weapon to toss back at the dancers, or to trace the street names called out during ""Bang'n On King Dr."", easily the most conventional rhythm on the album. The horrorshow samples that drive ""I'm Laughing""—a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaOzdr7CP6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">detuned Tony Sunshine</a> repeating ""I'm laughing at you now,"" a villainous cackle, and a lot of whistles—are easy to understand in the context of competition, but it's still strange, uncomfortable music seemingly incongruous with a bunch of people partying.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Footwork's sound has expanded, from the fevered soul of Rashad and Spinn to Jlin's noisy, coal-black intensity. Space's work is fairly traditional in comparison—its stitches-showing madness feels, at this point, somewhat familiar—so <i>Fingers, Bank Pads &amp; Shoe Prints</i> is a nice reminder that footwork's version of classic rock still overflows with bizarre juxtapositions and high-wire pileups. That anyone wants to dance to this music provides an architecture for all this peculiarity, and Space is no less adventurous or inventive for clinging to it.</p></div>"|20782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20782-rp-boo-fingers-bank-pads-shoe-prints/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

On the band’s five-song and very fun debut LP, <i>Sonic Praise</i>,<i> </i>the three Philadelphia bros holler about an ""astral plane where our herb will suffice,"" urge their audience to forego homes and bosses for a trip ""through the astral sea,"" and demand that you ""take the time"" to ""have a good time."" They ply this blatant, positive peer pressure through spiraling psychedelic rock. Roaring organs, screaming guitars, and the occasional squawking saxophone seem always to be preparing for another narcotic liftoff. The rhythm section is brawny enough to be the dope pusher. By the time Ecstatic Vision peak during ""Astral Plane"", a 12-minute triumph where cosmic chants arrive over bulbous bass and hand drums and spirited solos spill from most every break, Ecstatic Vision’s preferred platform sounds like a thrilling escape hatch, even if you don’t want to get stoned with these or any other dudes.</p>
<p>During the next decade, many of Ecstatic Vision’s chief touchstones—Hawkwind’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_on_the_Edge_of_Time"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Warrior on the Edge of Time</i></a>, Leaf Hound’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growers_of_Mushroom"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Growers of Mushroom</i></a>, Black Sabbath’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vol._4_(Black_Sabbath_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Vol. 4</i></a>,<i> </i>Amon Düül II’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeti</i></a>—will reach the half-century mark. Meanwhile, Led Zeppelin’s catalog, which Ecstatic Vision reference liberally during mid-song breakdowns and through general riff-led ascendance, has survived <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/led-zeppelin-announce-final-three-deluxe-reissues-20150603"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yet another round of extensive reissues.</a> Those records have helped build legions of stylistic descendants, from outbound psychedelic rock acts and burly stoner metal crews to bleary-eyed synth trippers and meditative new age gurus. It’s tempting, then, to dismiss an act so indebted to an obvious lineage (and so enchanted with a drug that’s <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">increasingly less taboo</a> and <a href=""https://weedmaps.com/washington/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">criminalized</a>) out of hand. In 2015, who cares if you like to get high and jam all the livelong day with your pals?</p>
<p>Ecstatic Vision, though, doesn’t get lost amid the seeds, stems, and stars. For all the band’s talk of escapism and their musical animations of such, they don’t write, play, or record with stoned indolence or mindless indulgence. Rather, like Virginia’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27743-pontiak/"">Pontiak</a> or New York’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5242-white-hills/"">White Hills</a>, they funnel that enthusiasm into compelling songs. Each of these five tracks breaks the five-minute mark, but three of them barely get there. Collectively, they betray senses of economy and premeditation rare to this field. A study in efficiency and impact, opener ""Journey"" shifts quickly from an introduction of pretty, back-masked vocals to a burly power-trio throb, from a cowbell-driven bridge to an electrifying instrumental break. They never surrender to their self-induced haze, so the song remains magnetic even as bandleader Douglas Sabolick steps out for multiple solos.</p>
<p>The similarly terse ""Don’t Kill the Vibe"" feels like waiting bait for the sort of rock radio DJ who still references roach clips on air. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> on uppers, Ecstatic Vision power ahead at length with one riff and one vocal melody. The dual parts fit like puzzle pieces, with layers of guitars and noise tucked inside and around the motion. ""Take what you want/ Take what you want now, baby,"" Sabolick shouts on repeat at the end. It’s the kind of simple refrain that could last forever, soundtracking some long, windows-down drive into the sun of a summer road trip. But it ends soon enough to make you crave more, an essential tenet of <i>Sonic Praise</i>’s success.<i></i></p>
<p>To the same end, the new band’s prospects seem most exciting when they fold unexpected influences into <i>Sonic Praise</i>, especially during its two longest tracks. While ""Astral Plane"" ultimately charges through amplified bedlam and ricochets around a sharp riff, it works the patter of hand drums into the start. Somewhere near the middle, Ecstatic Vision accent a big bass-and-drum groove with stabs of dissonance and washes of chromatic textures. It sounds, briefly, like an early version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>, loosening up and zoning out. Almost as an afterthought, closer ""Cross the Divide"" suggests that Ecstatic Vision haven’t looked for ecstasy only in American and European rock trances. During one of the record’s most evocative moments, Sabolick nods to West African guitar styles while the band around him conjures the modal Middle Eastern electronics familiar from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27844-omar-souleyman/"">Omar Souleyman</a>’s Western rise. The international jolt is a sudden reminder that, 40-plus years after many of its masterpieces were made, drug-induced rock needn’t be stale, stupid, listless, or long. Instead, the surprisingly incisive <i>Sonic Praise</i> is a celebration of higher aims in high times, for now free of many of the worst side effects.</p></div>"|20731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20731-sonic-praise/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

He loads his albums with frantic energy and watches them burn down to embers. Unlike the wiry, anxious music his brother Jonah writes with the Massachusetts band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31405-krill/"">Krill</a>, Furman's music hides little behind metaphor or enigma. He'd rather spit out all his problems than wrap them up into something oblique. He's kind of a projectile singer, firing off barb after barb as soon as they come to him.</p>
<p>A playful, hefty romp through folk, blues, and plain old rock'n'roll, <i>Perpetual Motion People</i> marks Furman's first release with London imprint <a href=""http://bellaunion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bella Union</a>. It's his third solo LP, but it matches tempos more closely with <i>Mysterious Power</i>, his 2011 release with his old band the Harpoons. Throughout his catalog, Furman has penned plenty of songs about his struggles with mental illness and self-destruction, and <i>Perpetual Motion People</i> continues that theme with tracks like ""Haunted Head"" and ""Can I Sleep in Your Brain?"". It also breaches identity and politics and love and loneliness, and the inherent instability of each.</p>
<p>Furman indulges a couple saloon-ready crooners, like the loose piano jam ""Hour of Deepest Need"", but <i>Perpetual Motion People</i> shines when it's at its most kinetic. On ""Lousy Connection"", Furman bemoans the emotional vacancy of a life that moves at lightspeed over doo-wop backing vocals and swinging saxophones; he promises his ""undying affection"" to whoever will listen, though he's worried that the whole world is caught up in ""a game of worldwide karaoke"". But Furman is a clever enough lyricist to hit home that paradoxical feeling of manic isolation in just a few words: ""There's nothing happening, it's happening too fast.""</p>
<p>More than anything else, <i>Perpetual Motion People</i> feels like a rallying cry against boredom. ""I'm sick of this record already,"" he sings on ""Ordinary Life"". ""Let's wreck all the preconceived notions we bring to it."" Furman, who <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/03/ezra-furman-gender-fluidity"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">publicly identifies</a> as queer and genderfluid, sets ablaze traditional Americana frameworks with a yearning to be seen and heard the same way he feels. The friction between his sources and the direction in which he points them sets sparks flying throughout the album. He calls out for bodily autonomy and self-love on ""Body Was Made"", while on ""Tip of a Match"" he barks about never admitting defeat, even in the face of a long overdue apocalypse.</p>
<p><i>Perpetual Motion People</i> can never sit right in its own skin, and that's largely where its charm comes from. Furman is the kind of singer who seems to have crammed so many ideas into his head he can hardly decide which ones should fly out of his mouth first. While he's deeply indebted to traditional sounds and familiar structures, he comes alive most when he's sewing fissures into the forms he knows so well. <i>Perpetual Motion People</i> comes with its share of misbehavior, but there's still more room left for Furman to thrash.</p></div>"|20773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20773-perpetual-motion-people/|6.9|Sasha Geffen

Aside from a few incidental scraps, there are no voices here, and there are hardly any beats, either—just rumbling synths, quivering effects, placid electric guitar, and oodles of atmosphere. It's not inconceivable that you might mistake it for some forgotten post-rock obscurity from the mid-'90s.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be the first time that Warmsley has looked to the past for inspiration. He got his start, as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>'s Pro Era crew, making colorful boom-bap beats indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a>, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongues"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Native Tongues</a> era. Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18894-lee-bannon-alternate-endings/""><i>Alternate/Endings</i></a>, his first big step away from hip-hop, nodded to canonical jungle producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1752-goldie/"">Goldie</a>, as well as breakbeat mavericks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"">Squarepusher</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4479-luke-vibert/"">Luke Vibert</a>. To dig back through his catalog—from the whimsical sample flips of <i>The Big Toy Box</i> to the transient random noise bursts of 2012's <i>Fantastic Planet</i> to the mutant jungle experiments of <i>Alternate/Endings</i> and its companion EP, <i>Main/Flex</i>—is to track the development of a restless musical sensibility.</p>
<p>Ironically, then, one thing that distinguishes <i>Pattern of Excel </i>is its abiding sense of calm. The most turbulent sound on the album is the splash of water at the beginning of ""Good / Swimmer"", which opens the record. From there on in (save for one song, ""Inflatable"", that sounds like a shuddering drum'n'bass remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>), it's all smooth sailing—or smooth drifting, anyway. He's fond of resonant synths and grainy field recordings and silvery electric guitar run clean, offering a marked contrast to the tape hiss and distorted undercurrents that lie just below the surface. In ""Suffer Gene"", monosyllabic vocal samples spin slowly in midair like the pieces of a mobile. ""Shallowness Is the Root of All Evil"" ruminates on a guitar tone inspired by Ennio Morricone and Angelo Badalmenti, post-rock's patron saints of twang, and the pedal-steel returns in ""Disneµ Girls"", a lilting, romantic miniature in waltz time.</p>
<p>It's not all so beatific; a few tracks hint at his industrial leanings. (Speaking to <i><a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/lee-bannon-15-faces-2015/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Interview</a> </i>last year, he mentioned Goldie and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a> as twin poles of his habitual listening.) The minute-long ""Dx2"" is a steel spring swathed in reverb, waiting to snap; ""Aga"" is the ghost of a boom-bap rhythm shrouded in gothic synths, part DJ Shadow and part Siouxsie. ""Artificial Stasis"" plays his dark side against his more dulcet tendencies to spine-tingling effect. As slow-moving guitar notes hover before a looming void, it brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"">Ben Frost</a> remixing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>.</p>
<p>One wonders if the album's title is supposed to be ironic: while contemporary production software like Ableton often resembles a game of Tetris played on spreadsheets, Bannon's music refuses to be contained by the grid. In that sense, despite the differences in mood and tone, <i>Pattern of Excel</i> is a logical extension of <i>Alternate/Endings</i>. Even making drum'n'bass, his tracks didn't unfold in the usual ways; they were slippery and unpredictable, and while their sound wasn't lo-fi, exactly, it was hardly the hyper-engineered, studio-perfect sound of contemporary club-ready jungle. It was fallible and fucked up and proudly uninterested in functionalism. <i>Pattern of Excel</i> is similarly idiosyncratic—it feels, in many ways, like a fistful of sketches torn from the notebook and tossed to the wind. Making sense of the ways they fall is part of the pleasure of this quiet, cryptic record.</p></div>"|20755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20755-pattern-of-excel/|6.6|Philip Sherburne

Named for his recently departed maternal grandmother, the burbling track began to dilate beyond its original three-minute length as he kept performing it, eventually nearing the twenty-minute mark by the end of the tour. There might not be a direct sonic correlation between that track and the two twenty-minute tracks that comprise the entirety of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>'s eighth album, <i>Morning/ Evening</i>, but they seem thematically of a piece. The former pays tribute to his Indian heritage, the latter displays a structure that brings to mind Indian classical music.</p>
<p> In the same manner that <a href=""http://www.itcsra.org/sra_others_samay_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ragas pertain to certain parts of the day,</a> <i>Morning/ Evening</i> has a biorhythmic specificity in mind.  Both tracks move between diffuse drifts of electronic tones and skittering drum programming. The ""Morning"" side begins with a straightforward tap of closed hi-hats and a deep thump that sounds flat at first, before a trickier pattern of programmed drums are overlaid. A melodic swell of bass then appears, as graceful, slow-moving and almost imperceptibly evolving as what you might find in early New Age music or the works of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjHQQxAJlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Behrman</a>.</p>
<p>And then, just over a minute in, a bright, quivering Indian voice manifests, saccharine strings at play around her. Voices often factor powerfully into Four Tet's productions: think of the honeyed utterances of ""Love Cry"", the chopped pirate radio barks that underpin <i>Beautiful Rewind</i>, or the startling reconfiguration of J. Lo's ""Ain't It Funny"" on ""Pyramids"". But the loop of famous Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar, whose voice has adorned thousands of Hindi films over a seven-decade career, startles upon its appearance. It remains foregrounded for much of the duration of ""Morning"", receding around the eight-minute mark for some of Hebden's most complex drum programming, then reappears halfway through. In using a famous Indian playback singer, which he no doubt grew up hearing in his household, Hebden gives the track an opulent yet pensive feel, which in turn gives ""Morning"" emotional depth.</p>
<p>""Evening"" picks up where ""Morning"" left off, with a coffee percolator of a beat that never quite solidifies, instead leading into the kind of tones that recall early electronic music pieces like Morton Subotnick's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EelvKqhu1M4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Silver Apples of the Moon</i></a>. Hebden allows each element plenty of space to breathe, striking a balance between the abstract and the accessible. Another wordless voice comes into focus about five minutes in, though my ears can't tell if it's Mangeshkar or another Hindu devotional chant.</p>
<p>At around the twelve-minute mark, amid chimes and gentle digital processing, ""Evening"" drifts into near-silence, but just as you rise to play something else, it returns: a hi-hat figure arises, amid shimmering electronics and a kick. The inverse of ""Morning,"" the last five minutes of ""Evening"" gather velocity and strength, to where it seems everything is converging on a climax and payoff for this slow twenty-minute build. But right where a release might be expected, everything fades back out instead: You sense a desire to make a grand statement, but the dramatic dissolve doesn't quite stick the landing. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Four Tet's position in the electronic landscape is solidified: He's able to work on the experimental fringe when he wishes, or collaborate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a>. Even news of a possible Diplo team-up doesn't cost him credibility. The scope and ambition of <i>Morning/ Evening</i> is profound, and will hopefully inspire producers to take bigger chances and not be satisfied with pop- or club-friendly lengths. Even where <i>Morning/Evening</i> doesn't quite work, it's daring and expansive.</p></div>"|20729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20729-morningevening/|7.7|Andy Beta

The rest of the album has more or less dropped from public consciousness, but the intro remains a resonant classic: When the song suddenly shifts tempo and mood, and Meek jumps into an urgent, bleating rap cadence (complete with lines like ""all I know is murder"" shouted with guttural intensity), he's introducing himself as the only rapper that matters for five minutes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The ""for five minutes"" qualifier is an important distinction: Meek's intensity is both the key to his appeal and his Achilles Heel. His mixtapes are often long and scattershot, while still containing at least a half dozen keepers, and his first album, and now the second, suffer a similar fate. Every few months, Meek drops an incredible single, or an eyebrow-raising feature, reinforcing the idea that his music works best in short blasts, harnessing his energy and expending it all at will. Recent non-album single ""Monster"" is an incredible song, but I can't imagine it being on this album; it's too concentrated. And I'm not even sure if 14 ""Monster""s is sustainable or desirable. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>However, <i>Dreams Worth Than More Money</i> is still a few clicks better than his debut, because it feels like Meek Mill is taking risks. Opener ""Lord Knows"" lays a Tory Lanez hook and a typically fraught Meek vocal performance atop sample from Mozart's Lacrimosa movement from his Requiem in D, a tip of the hat to how epic ""Dreams and Nightmares"" remains but also as a hedging of bets: Nothing could realistically top his first intro, so they reached all the way back to <i>Mozart</i> for a fitting backdrop. He's still rapping hard-hitting lines like ""Shout-out the judge that denied me my bail/it made me smarter and it made me go harder."" It's a great song, even if it can't match the bar set by ""Dreams and Nightmares.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Classic,"" a typically nimble, bouncy, Bangladesh track, is an atypical Meek move: he's rarely if ever sounded so airy, clean, fun, </span><span>bright</span><span>, and it's a good look. In fact, the album's biggest highlights are its biggest departures, from the druggy ""Jump Out the Face"" with Future (which would fit nicely onto </span><i>56 Nights</i><span>), to ""R.I.C.O."" featuring Drake, and even ""Bad For You"" with Nicki Minaj. Meek has allowed these artists to ""take the lead"" on these tracks, and the album is better for it, because it opens the record up and gives Meek breathing room. It also keeps in line with the idea that a brief blast of Meek is the best way to experience Meek.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The  '70s exploitation flick vibe of ""Stand Up,"" featuring an indelible two-line cameo from DJ Khaled, is another stylistic switch-up on the album's back end. And ""Cold Hearted"" is a surprisingly touching closer. Ostensibly riffing on a familiar rap trope—rebuking family and friends who turn on you once you taste success—it gains depth through little details, and ends up feelin more like an introspective testament to youth. Diddy, his voice sounding destroyed, offers a weirdly unguarded monologue, and Meek sneaks gut-check details like ""we started off as kids, stomach touching our ribs"" in a sing-song patter. It reminds you why you loved the guy in the first place: He accomplishes more with the sound of his rapping than other rappers do with entire albums. His understanding of rap as a vocal performance; his ability to summon powerful emotions; his combination of vulnerability, bravado, and a storyteller's sense of character and time—well, shit, those are all the hallmarks of a great rapper. </span></span>Maybe it only all coheres in flashes, but if Meek Mill works best in bursts, then so be it.</p>

But versatility can also be a side effect, an accidental byproduct of the process of honing in on your own sound.</p>
<p>In his short but prolific career so far, Charles McCloud Duff has tried his hand at many sounds. As part of the club duo 5kinAndBone5, he produced the rapper Le1f's saucy, sax-driven ""Wut"". In the duo Amen Brother, with his frequent recording partner Vin Sol, he flirted briefly with B-more breaks and ghetto-house. An early track under his Matrixxman alias, ""Wicked"", laced dreamy synths with snapping percussion; not long thereafter, Matrixxman's ""God Created the Beat"", featuring Mykki Blanco, took a stab at ballroom house. As he's experimented with different variations on the deeper strains of house and techno, his own signature has begun to emerge. Matrixxman's productions are typically marked by their restraint (even when they bang); their pristine sound design (except when they're murky); their balance (except when they go off the deep end).</p>
<p>His debut album, <i>Homesick</i>, displays a newfound and dogged single-mindedness. It is so intently focused upon its aesthetic—dark, ominous, sensually mechanical, all hot breath and brushed stainless steel—that it feels, in retrospect, like everything until now has been leading up to this. He has arrived at an effortlessly efficient vision of techno, chilly and not a little forbidding: no bullshit, no wasted movements. Duff told <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2471"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Resident Advisor</a> that he was attracted to drum 'n' bass, his first electronic love, because ""there was this alienating feeling I was really drawn to. It was post-apocalyptic."" You can hear that fascination for the inhuman, or the post-human, all over <i>Homesick</i>. There are no voices, no acoustic instruments, no obvious samples, just analog pulses and electric currents.</p>
<p>The bulk of the album tackles classic techno styles and tropes: The plucky arpeggios of ""Network Failure"" and ""False Pattern Recognition"" recall Robert Hood's nail-bitten minimalism; ""Red Light District"" is squelchy acid; ""Augmented"" is EBM tinted with tropical watercolors. Some of the most invigorating cuts are essentially just drum tracks fleshed out with a modicum of silvery tone, but half of <i>Homesick</i> takes place away from the dancefloor. ""Annika's Theme"" evokes <i>Blade Runner</i> with new age choral pads and a wistful melody; ""Packard Plant"", titled in homage to a Detroit landmark, cobbles Motor City tropes together into a kind of deconstructed techno. It's all smartly sequenced, right down to ""Dejected"", a minute-and-a-half-long metal drone that serves as a kind of dystopian palate-cleanser, and even the club-oriented tracks have the home listener in mind. For the most part, they're short, intense mood pieces, and they inform one another in the same way that paintings in a gallery seem to communicate with each other, sparking new meanings as the viewer's gaze crisscrosses the white cube.</p>
<p><i>Homesick</i> is not quite a concept album, but there's a ghost of a narrative visible in the record's bookending tracks. First, there's ""Necronomicon"", which opens the LP with nine-and-a-half minutes of greyscale throb, like Basic Channel rendered ultra-minimal and unusually menacing. (That's the record's longest track, by a considerable margin, which is kind of impressive; it takes some chutzpah to open an album with something this forbidding.) The closing ""Earth Like Conditions"", sounds almost optimistic, with its kosmische echoes and its green shoots of melody. If the bulk of the album tends to evoke a metal object hurtling through empty space, ""Earth Like Conditions"" feels like an escape pod to another world—or, at least, to Matrixxman's next record, where, one suspects, he'll have distilled his sound into an even more potent, concentrated form.</p></div>"|20752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20752-homesick/|7.2|Philip Sherburne

It’s for those who speculate where the time has gone, who hope someday to put their feet on the floor and feel something real, who feel kept in the dark by the ones they love. The record plays like the musical equivalent of an Andrew Wyeth painting: cold and dreary, rooted in an Americana sensibility that’s completely vague in its specific hardships but crystal clear in conveying the sheer lack of company, light, and happiness.</p>
<p>Broderick is an accomplished musician and singer in Portland’s folk-music scene, having been a member of groups like Horse Feathers (along with her brother, Peter Broderick), Loch Lomond, and backing bands for artists like Alela Diane and Sharon Van Etten. And it’s been nearly seven years since her debut record <i>From The Ground</i>, which played like a more 2000s indie effort from the likes of Mirah, with sparser compositions and tone that made use of Broderick’s piano, guitar, and cello playing skills. But <i>Glider</i> is darker, less precious, and a record that feels as if it's been bound to a front porch rocking chair for decades now.</p>
<p>In this sense, <i>Glider</i> is really about aura. Broderick’s voice is a loud whisper; you’ll find her, depending on the song, somewhere between Hope Sandoval and Elizabeth Fraser. And with her voice distant and fogged, she builds a skeleton of meaning through earthy and familiar (and therefore perhaps universally devastating in a Rorschach-test sort of way) images and feelings. She’s walked in the shadows, she’s hidden a bad lover’s letters away in drawers, she’s taking what she’s earned because she’s “had enough, enough, enough,” she echoes on the title track. “Never been one to shake my head,” Broderick sings in “Fall Hard”. “I can’t say it feels good.” </p>
<p>It’s from these lyrical glimmers of feeling lost and tired in love and life that Broderick constructs bigger affection through instrumentals. From reverb-heavy piano ballads to grand orchestral compositions that weave in and out of audibility, she does a good job of building walls of sound that still maintain an intimate, bedroom-folk feel. It’s hard to know where Broderick lands as a musician and singer. Although a veteran of a close-knit folk-leaning scene her music isn’t particularly folksy even in an age of throwback singers like Jessica Pratt and Angel Olsen and re-inventors of the genre like Sylvan Esso or Hundred Waters. Her music could easily be of the blanket-label “singer-songwriter” variety but song writing doesn’t seem of great importance to her, at least in the final results of her shrouded vocals. She might be onto a strain of dream-pop, at least one that ditches the synths for strings.</p>
<p>Regardless, her music is deeply familiar, even if it can’t be neatly boxed. On one of the <i>Glider</i>’s strongest tracks, “Wyoming”, Broderick does her best Cocteau Twins impression, with the track ending in an uncharacteristically loud and intense eruption of singing and guitar. Songs like “A Call for Distance” and “Mama Shelter” elevate Broderick’s music to a more soulful plane in their quick, jazz percussion and bass-lines, the latter with just the slightest echo of dancehall flair. The album’s closing sound, “All for a Love”, is an unmistakable, slowed-down sister to touring mate Sharon Van Etten’s “Tarifa”, even in its saxophone.</p>
<p>And maybe it’s this familiarity that keeps <i>Glider</i> feeling stilted. The record walks well-treaded territory lyrically and musically. It almost feels like Broderick is imitating a <i>Walden</i>-esque romance of loneliness in the desert or the pines rather than crafting her own, or at least effectively and personally staking her place in it. Because while Broderick has the tool-kit to make a very pretty and sad sounding-record, nothing she builds here seems to really pierce anywhere where it actually hurts. </p></div>"|20742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20742-glider/|6.6|Hazel Cills

<p dir=""ltr""><span> ""Yacht rock"" probably isn't a tag any musician seeks out, since it carries more weight as parody or flat-out insult than genre descriptor. But there's something loose and happy to the energy, particularly on the album's first half: </span>""1999"" is built around mid-temp pianos and the soft clicking of unobtrusive percussion.  ""These Arms"" boasts a slinking, slow-dancing drum line, as does ""Never Far Away"", where it pulses behind rounded, coke-straw guitars. The fried electronics of ""Mercy"" add a jolt to the slightly sleepy, all-around lushness.  All of these sounds are secondary to Grossi's voice, which does not sacrifice body for altitude; operating in and around the falsetto, Grossi less resembles the fragility of How To Dress Well than the aforementioned McDonald. He has a strange way of condensing out of his chest voice into his head voice, like a rising updraft, and the split between the two is astonishing. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Midnight Swim"" marks the beginning of </span><i>Mercy</i><span><i>'</i>s more active second suite; weird and crystalline, the song conjures an alien beauty—like jellyfish in underwater caverns—and rides a thin line of eeriness and pulchritude. From here </span><i>Mercy</i><span> takes a decidedly more dance-y turn, maintaining the relaxed vibe while amping up the tempo. ""Temptation"" is sexy, carried on the strains of organs in lieu of harps, one hagiographic instrument swapped for another. It's a stronger sound, yet still casual; like the album itself, it seems just shallow enough to wade into and just deep enough to linger awhile.  <i>Mercy</i> is studiously lovely, like a brochure for paradise, and over its course it begins to feels like a sunset in <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>: beautiful, but a replica.</span></p></div>"|20710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20710-mercy/|6.4|B.

Some might say the tension of conforming to one-dimensional manhood contributed to D'Angelo's post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><i>Voodoo</i></a> unspooling.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The current R&amp;B landscape is painstakingly virile: From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"">Trey Songz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a>, men are singing about sex and love. But all of these supposed libertines are focused on the primacy of male pleasure, treating their sexual experiences with all the reverence of a bunch of wadded-up tissues. On <i>Wildheart</i>, his third full-length album, Miguel, the writhing, pompadoured soul singer, has a similar focus, but it's sex-positive instead of sex-obsessed, a crucial difference. Languorous and detailed, it transcends the genre's established narratives with a focus on pleasure and partnership instead of one-sided pursuit. If <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> is young soul's prismatic, consciousness-expanding Marvin Gaye, Miguel's the reliable Al Green. The first words on this album—""Don't ever sell yourself short... Trust your intuition... You know the plan, conjectures of society,"" from the reverb-y opener ""A Beautiful Exit""—are a testament to how Miguel's grown from radio-baiting R&amp;B archetype to a maker of high-concept, genre-splicing pop music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Miguel has occupied a unique space in the awkward ""alt-R&amp;B"" narrative of the last few years. Amidst the washed out presets and drum machines and drugged-out boasting of his peers, he was a guitar-toting outlier, more of a throwback to a sensual showboat like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"">Ginuwine</a> instead of a self-loathing narcissist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>. The nag champa-tinged smokiness of earlier songs like ""All I Want Is You"", or the glowing synth arpeggios on ""Adorn"" and fuzzed out scales on ""Gravity"" expressed something more wholesome, hopeful, and musically psychedelic. (Even when he sang about drugs on ""Do You…"" it was all just a metaphor for love). On <i>Wildheart</i>, Miguel makes good on all of his cross-genre dabbling of the past five years, but unlike the track-based experiments that dotted his two prior LPs and five mixtapes, he extrapolates the heavy funk across an entire album. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Miguel has long cited Prince, Freddie Mercury, and James Brown as inspirations, and on <i>Wildheart</i> he works through these icons. The album soars with s<span id=""docs-internal-guid-ad56a019-4582-0d60-4b4d-ac40e09837fc""><span>hiny guitar lines and sky-high vocals, which reflect the mythic possibilities of California and his hometown of L.A. </span></span>Unlike <i>All I Want Is You</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17125-kaleidoscope-dream/""><i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i></a>, <i>W</i><i>ildheart</i> is almost entirely self-produced save for a couple of assists, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30860-cashmere-cat/"">Cashmere Cat</a> and Benny Blanco on the Cali soul-riffing ""…Goingtohell"". So Miguel is writing for Miguel, and he knows that his voice, heady like good coffee, will soar over the crunchy bass guitar lines of ""A Beautiful Exit"" and the sultry, obsessive ""FLESH"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When he wants to go digital, on ""The Valley"" and ""Destinado a Morir (Enter.Lewd)"", dilated, ragged synths and stretched-out strumming serve as a glowing bedrock over which he exhales explicit lyrics. The titular valley in the former refers to California's porn industry and he sets the scene like an R-rated kid's playground song: ""lips, tits, clit, sit."" It's the blood-red prelude to <i>Wildhear</i>t's tender morning-after first single, ""Coffee"", and his writing is even raunchier than <i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i>'s ""Pussy Is Mine"". The sequencing belies the real turn-on: Miguel knows where to find those hard-to-reach spots, and will bring you coffee in the morning, too.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Focusing on <i>Wildheart</i>'s overt eroticism is one way of listening, but it's impossible to overlook just how seriously he's taking craft. Like, sure, Miguel's take on #<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/surfbort"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">surfbort</a>, ""Waves"", might be a vivid metaphorical construct, but the silky stack of harmonies on the bridge is absolutely stunning—maybe the album's most dazzling moment. Lenny Kravitz, another soul-subverting California dreamer, creates an airless cocoon of lust and lush guitars on ""Face the Sun"". ""What's Normal Anyway"" has careful guitar ripples and a steady beat, sturdy footing for Miguel's backstory to all of the skirt-chasing: ""Too proper for the black kids, too black for the Mexicans, what's normal anyway."" And the quiet moments explode without veering into bombast; think about the simple chord changes and placid drum loop of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Smashing Pumpkins' ""1979""</a> with a wistful story about a California stricken of sunlight—and that's ""Leaves"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Wildheart,</i> Miguel complicates his lothario backstory in a way that few of his peers have managed. A song like ""What's Normal Anyway"" speaks to multiple experiences of alienation, in both life and love. For Miguel, humanity is found between partners and between the sheets. And <i>Wildheart</i>'s success might signal a shift in modern R&amp;B, which is to say that perhaps we will finally move on from minimalism and petulant misogyny and sluggish synths to follow Miguel, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33008-leon-bridges/"">Leon Bridges</a> and Frank Ocean—the latter slated to return this summer—toward the next era of soul, one where sex is not an arbiter of masculinity but something that's simpatico with fun <i>and</i> feelings.</p></div>"|20728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20728-wildheart/|8.9|Anupa Mistry

Dealmaker, the UK hip-hop label behind the original release, went dark after 2010. Cutler has since become known for his singular fusion of lysergic downbeat and serotonin-flushed rave throwbacks; it makes sense that fans would want to hear what came before his subsequent albums—<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Lone-Ecstasy-Friends/release/2033256"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ecstasy &amp; Friends</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14998-emerald-fantasy-tracks/""><i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16578-galaxy-garden/""><i>Galaxy Garden</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19458-lone-reality-testing/""><i>Reality Testing</i></a>—established him a kind of King Midas in Mickey Mouse gloves. To sweeten the deal, <i>Lemurian</i> has been remastered, given striking new cover art (a big improvement on the <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/Lemurian.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original</a>, which evoked Britpop cutout-bin CDs from the '90s), and, crucially, released on vinyl for the first time.</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine that <i>Lemurian </i>was always destined for reissue treatment, if only because it was such a nostalgic undertaking from the get-go. The longing for a lost musical utopia is woven into its very fibers. Lone's debut outing, 2007's <i>Everything Is Changing Colour</i> CDR, was already an attempt to recreate the sound and style that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> pioneered a decade prior, from the blurry family photo on the cover to track titles that hinted at synaesthesia, numerology, and other cornerstones of the Scottish duo's aesthetic. The music, meanwhile, brimmed with pitch-bent synths, woozy easy-listening samples, and shuffling hip-hop beats. But it was with <i>Lemurian </i>that Lone really immersed himself in his idols' tape-warping acid bath.</p>
<p>The titles might have come straight from a Boards of Canada name generator—""Phthalo Blue"", ""Green Sea Pageant"", ""Maya Codex"", ""Lens Flare Lagoon""—and the music follows suit. If <i>Everything Is Changing Colour</i> represented Cutler's desire to sound like his heroes (""I heard Boards of Canada on John Peel when I was 12, and that was it,"" he told the <i><a href=""http://www.nottinghampost.com/Interview-Lone/story-12224828-detail/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nottingham Post</a></i> in 2008), then <i>Lemurian</i> found him mustering the chops to do so convincingly—and compellingly. Their hallmarks become his hallmarks: his synths are fat and rich and full, brilliant as a kaleidoscope full of diamonds. His chord changes evoke a wistful, nonspecific yearning, and the omnipresent wow and flutter lends an extra layer of temporal dislocation. Matching the distressed VHS-tape timbres, there are scraps of found footage running through ""Interview at Honolulu""; the soft-focus ""Girl"" samples the trailer from a racy European flick from the '70s. And he's no stranger to a beautiful place out in the country: waves lap in ""Under Two Palms"", a river runs through ""Orange Tree"", and birds chirp in ""Lens Flare Lagoon"". Beyond those literal references to nature, the whole thing feels sun-drenched and wind-kissed. He's fond of chords that rise up and away, forever drawing your attention above the shining horizon; his Doppler-effected de-tunings feel like sound that's been carried on the breeze from three counties over.</p>
<p>Even the album's sequencing takes after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/""><i>Music Has the Right to Children</i></a> and <i>Geogaddi</i>: in between the more fully fleshed-out songs, brief sketches suggest wide vistas before dissolving into thin air. ""Buried Coral Banks"" is as watery and mysterious as its title; ""Green Sea Pageant"", just a loop of too-bright keyboards and a scrap of voice, feels like a late-night public-access transmission spun into a locked groove. Like his heroes, Cutler has a thing for low-budget cable-TV aesthetics, and his digging game is strong: ""Phthalo Blue"" loops an easy-listening interlude from Bob Ross' <i>The Joy of Painting</i> and turns it into a woozy folktronic miniature that sounds almost like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"">Bibio</a> tune.</p>
<p>But <i>Lemurian</i>, to its credit, is more than just the sum of its inspirations. His approach to rhythm is looser than Boards of Canada's, for one thing. Cutler has cited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> as his other key influence, and it's easy to hear how Madlib and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>'s slack, elegantly ramshackle timekeeping animate Cutler's own rumpled sense of swing. Where Boards of Canada's beats are often crisply mechanical, his slow-burning grooves crackle like the cherry at the end of a cone-shaped spliff; they shuffle along, shoulders hunched, hands stuffed in pockets, as though they were trying to go unnoticed. Sometimes lumpy, sometimes fluid, his beats feel unusually organic, as misused as that term can be—almost as though they grew themselves, like a burl, or a fungus. Lone's later albums would incorporate the cadences of Detroit techno and breakbeat rave, but <i>Lemurian</i>'s intense focus on the expressive possibilities of hip-hop rhythms and looped chords lends to its success as a sustained mood piece, front-to-back. It's as though he heard a kernel of something in his favorite records and, not hearing enough of it there, figured out a way to extend it to fill an entire album. That we're still going back to it seven years later, after he moved on to four albums that are far more diverse, and maybe even more ambitious, is a testament to its success. If you're interested in immersing yourself in a phthalo-blue haze, there's no better place than this.</p></div>"|20769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20769-lemurian/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

Elizabeth Harper’s synth-pop project, dormant since 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15941-rapprocher/"">Rapprocher</a></i>, has not only found a home with legendary disco label Casablanca Records but has gotten as a collaborator its key hitmaker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a>, himself in the midst of a career revival. And Moroder’s signature sound of implacable synthesizers and L.A. night music has found its way over the past few years to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0mxXrHowHQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">critical darlings</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qU7p7yOY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">megastars</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5_3Oxd_Hc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">newcomers</a> alike. On the other hand, Casablanca has chugged along in various degrees of half-existence over the past decade, home to <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67367/lohan-signs-with-casablanca-records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two Lindsay Lohan records</a> and, until recently, little else; the omnipresence of neo-disco means the genre has been killed, revived, then Family Fun Night-ified out of any of its former transgression; its key session players are well into another golden age of guesting on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsU189WyU68"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mediocrities</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuFGbxpLg94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crap</a>; and the man himself is working with flyweights like Mikky Ekko and Matthew Koma, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20703-deja-vu/"">gruesome returns</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hardly Harper’s fault that her EP came out almost immediately after Moroder recorded a terrible album; and though she’s given <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/class-actress-movies-ep-giorgio-moroder/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">varying</a> <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6583217/class-actress-movies-ep-giorgio-moroder-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stories</a> to the press about when and how she became infatuated with Moroder, enough of the producer's sound throbbed through <i>Rapprocher </i>that her ambition seems sincere. And of ambition, there is no shortage—""I kinda wanted to be the next Donna Summer,"" she told <i>Billboard</i>, but their voices do share some similarities: suggestive, negligee-light, pairing well with synth strobes. Moroder, perhaps emboldened by working with a single muse again, turns in a more coherent production than <i>Déjà Vu</i>, more <i>Midnight Express </i>than EDM compilation. <i>Movies</i> is a rough concept album: the familiar cautionary tale, older than celluloid, of a woman chasing the lights of Hollywood, the movie version in which all love is unrequited, ""girlfriend"" is a term that belongs more to escorts than lovers, and everyone is constantly high on something (see: the album cover, an anonymous woman snorting lines off the skyline.) The test is whether it’s easy to fall for.</p>
<p>The first half of the record is the closest to Class Actress’ previous sound, a triptych of songs on obsessive crushes. Returns vary. Languid lead single ""More Than You"" is competent, and whether it’s a limp <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XdTr23ABQk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Weekend""</a> reprise or a longingly indulgent sigh depends mostly on the hour of the night, the person on the mind, and the contents of the bloodstream. ""The Limit"" zips through a wind tunnel of an '80s production, and Harper flits between confidence and vulnerability at ease;  but it’s followed by ""High on Love"", which has a peppy production but a metaphor that was smoked dead before Moroder was born, never mind Harper; her <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1807364/class-actress-high-on-love/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uninspiring elaboration</a> (""They keep you hooked like a drug. The best drug is another person. But when a person becomes a drug it’s dangerous…"") does not suggest much further depth.</p>
<p>Originality aside, the main problem with <i>Movies </i>is that it can’t decide how much sleaze and drama it’s willing to commit to. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"">Neon Indian</a>-produced ""GFE"", fitting its title, leans well toward the former, asking little of Harper but strutting, cooing, and sighing her way down double entendres, Studio 54 glitz, and vocoder scales, at which she is adept, but offers no glimpse behind the emotional curtain, which is either the problem or the point. ""Love My Darkness"" wants to evoke the self-consciously moody R&amp;B of 2013 but actually evokes the self-consciously moody trip-hop of 1998; the production is thankfully more dynamic than either, but Harper relies so much on masochistic clichés that it hardly matters.</p>
<p>The title track is the sole outlier: a strings-and-music-box ballad and the narrative’s cruel awakening: ""everything I do, I learned in the movies."" It’s cinematic, in that it requires the suspense of disbelief, namely the disbelief that what you are hearing isn’t actually ""Glory Box"" covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>—the elephant in the room, for any artist attempting this sort of self-destructive L.A. fantasy. As a Lana Del Rey song, it’s probably better than anything she’d have sung herself; as a piece of sequencing, it’s jarring, like a film skipping directly to its denouement, and might have been better served as a full album closer. And as a self-aware lament, it’s intermittently poignant but, like the album in full, hews a little too close to its conceit: entrancing if you let it be, in love with its star-size emotions, but hollow when the lights come up.</p></div>"|20734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20734-movies-ep/|6.0|Katherine St. Asaph

He spent the past year burning what few bridges he had left—most memorably, in a depressing <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/11/drake-tyga-instagram-beef-continues"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">triangle</a> between himself, ex-girlfriend Blac Chyna, and labelmate <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>—and decorating his Egypt-themed <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/tygas-design-store-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clothing store</a> like an Illuminati VFW hall. His pet Siberian tiger was <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/25/tyga-tiger-wildlife-animal-shelter-criminal-charge/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">confiscated</a> by California wildlife authorities. He's currently dating 17-year old Kylie Jenner; it's a creepy and presumably illegal mess that doesn't seem to bother her bro-in-law <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, the executive producer of Tyga's fourth album. <i>The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty</i> should've been the biggest look of T-Raww's career; instead, it's the casualty of YMCMB's implosion that no one was especially concerned about. He <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/10/tyga-threatens-to-leak-his-album-and-says-he-wont-be-on-young-money-for-long"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">threatened</a> to leak it last fall, claiming his best work was being held hostage: crickets. You can just imagine him texting Kylie when <i>The Gold Album</i> debuted, at long last, on Spotify last week: ""Can you remind your sisters to tweet the link to my album? ;)""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To be fair, the guy's had his share of moments. ""Rack City"" was the spark that ignited DJ Mustard's career; last summer's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>-featuring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-J95fYuVz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Hookah""</span></a> was even better. He had semi-meaningful contributions to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha80ZaecGkQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bedrock""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXRN_LkCa_o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loyal""</a>, two very good, very dumb songs. And if you succumb to the darkness early on—letting it wash over you, baptizing you in its filth—his recent joint album with Chris Brown (<i>Fan of a Fan</i>) is actually pretty solid. It's exactly what you expect: a totally pleasant collection of Nic Nac beats, soaring hooks, and salty, chauvinist lyrics about how they're going to steal your girl and not even enjoy it, just to spite you. These songs succeed for reasons that have almost nothing to do with Tyga, but knowing when to show up is a talent in itself, and if there's one thing Tyga is great at, it's showing up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As Tyga would tell it, <i>The Gold Album</i> is his ""serious"" album, the one where he stops being polite and starts getting real. If you preordered the album back in January, you got an early download of the two lead singles: passable Drake impression <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtK2RZq6urw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Make It Work""</a>, and the Kanye and Mike Dean-produced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQhbeJfzzw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""40 Mill""</a>. The latter came with a self-directed video, in which T-Raww goes straight M. Night Strugglerap, becomes infected by church-dwelling demons, and ultimately tosses a single rose into his own open casket. (There's also an inexplicable subplot about fitness.) Both of these songs are decent enough; neither of these songs appear on <i>The Gold Album</i>. Nor does ""Hookah"", or the enjoyable single with Justin Bieber, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkL1PCBI9sQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wait for a Minute""</a>, that's now almost two years old.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Instead, we have 12 microwave-nuked approximations of Drake songs circa 2013 and Kanye songs spanning from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/""><i>The College Dropout</i></a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, with none of the wit, soul, or edge. At best, you can slip into a meditative zone wherein Tyga's tissue-thin voice fades into its surroundings, as on ""Wham"". But then you hear Tyga deliver a line like ""Hole in her neck from the fangs/ Pressure and pain"" with all the force of a clammy, limp handshake, and reality sets in. Tyga couldn't string two coherent lines together to save his life: each bar is a dead end, completely unrelated to the one that came before it. He is the converse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>—another guy who knows how to milk a Kanye co-sign for all it's worth—who raps like he is scrolling down an especially long iPhone note. Tyga raps like his bars are transcribed on the insides of fortune cookies that he must break open individually.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tyga doesn't even sound like he's having fun here; the prevailing mood is one of vague bitterness, directed at everyone, but particularly women. ""Poppa ran a hedge fund/ All his daughter do is give head,"" he raps on ""Shaka Zulu"", a blatant ""Started from the Bottom"" rip-off. On ""Muh Fucka"", T-Raww threatens to fuck your mom moments after he muses about how no woman will ever match his mother's love—one of the album's several instances of, shall we say, complicated family sexual dynamics. ""Pleazer"", the desperate, last-ditch single, sucks all the fun from its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYy8FOAVMsU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Freaky Tales""</span></a> sample so Tyga can detail how he's ""bout to catch a felony"" for a young woman whose interests include dick and, uh, dick. It seems possible featured guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32643-boosie-badazz/"">Boosie</a> might save the proceedings until he references ""Kardashian pussy"" and sends the whole thing spiraling down in flames. ""Hard for You"" is the token ballad; it's about exactly what you think it's about, and just to make things extra uncomfortable, Kylie has <a href=""https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/614556618336776192"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>reported</span></a> it's her fave. Yay!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I wish there was anything on </span><i>The Gold Album</i><span> that matched the batshit, DGAF audacity of Tyga's creepy storefront or zoologically unreasonable videos: All-seeing eyes of Horus, pussies in sarcophagi, blood orgies in the Agape Lodge with L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons. The closest we've got to any of that is a deeply unsettling moment near the end of cheap </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a><span> simulacrum ""Down for a Min"", where Tyga's kitten-like mewls are interrupted by what seems to be Siri's dark, DMT-smoking twin. ""Listen to the sound of my voice,"" she commands. ""Darkness will always follow the brightest star."" I'm not sure if it's intended to be motivational, or an attempt at subliminal Illuminati mind control—I'm too preoccupied by how similar the stilted, awkward patterns of her robotic delivery are to Tyga's own voice.</span></p></div>"|20780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20780-the-gold-album-18th-dynasty/|3.9|Meaghan Garvey

Albini, Edwards adds, ""wasn't totally wrong."" Maybe so, but Edwards was lucky in the sense that Failure never actually sold enough units to get swindled out of much. Moreover, Slash (then a Warner subsidiary that had retained some of its indie spirit) gave the L.A. space-rock/alt-metal trio an unusually wide berth when it came to creative control. The label even allowed Edwards and co-bandleader Ken Andrews to self-produce their 1996 opus </span><i>Fantastic Planet</i><span><i>,</i> a sleeper classic that attracted a cult following </span><span>after</span><span> the band broke up in '97.</span></p>
<p>With its dense layers of guitar distortion, gusts of compressed cymbal wash, and near-70 minute runtime, <i>Fantastic Planet</i><span> bears the familiar hallmarks of the CD era it was conceived in. But other than a longstanding affiliation with </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><span>Tool</span></a><span>, Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards didn't relate to the grunge-alternative paradigm at all. With </span><i>The Heart Is a Monster</i><span>, their first new LP in 19 years, they—along with returning drummer Kellii Scott—make a self-conscious attempt to revisit the scale and feel of </span><i>Fantastic Planet</i><span>. On the surface, that seems like a capitulation, but they manage to pull off the near-impossible feat of establishing continuity with their back catalog while also giving listeners a glimpse of what the band might have sounded like had it stayed together, and evolved organically up to this point. </span></p>
<p>Edwards and Andrews went on to make more elastic music in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/226-autolux/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><span>Autolux</span></a><span> and ON, respectively, but </span><i>The Heart Is a Monster</i><span> reminds us of how synergistic their creative bond was—and still is. Once again, Andrews brings most of the riff-oriented guitar and bass parts, vocal melodies, and engineering to the table, while Edwards contributes the more impressionistic bass and guitar ideas, as well as lyrics and a classic producer's sense of oversight. It doesn't take long for the magic spark between them to make itself apparent. On ""Hot Traveler"", for example, a plodding, metallic march dissolves into a dreamlike, suspended-gravity passage, as graceful as a field of fireflies on a summer night. </span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the bridge of ""A.M. Amnesia"" benefits from what Edwards and Andrews have obviously learned during their time apart—i.e: art-damaged atmospheres à la Autolux and quasi-soulful bedside falsetto cooing reminiscent of Andrews' solo work. (""Soulful"" was the <span>last</span><span> thing you'd have called Andrews in '94, when he was belting out acid-fried lines about enlarged cockroaches and dead boys in dumpsters on Failure's sophomore effort </span><i>Magnified</i><span>.) Of course, these new sonic touches resonate more deeply thanks to the album's overarching lyrical themes. Just like in 1996, Edwards and Andrews anchor the music in a rich subtext that threads the songs together into a Pink Floyd-ian, almost topographical journey fit for headphones and extended bouts of sitting in your room with the lights off. </span></p>
<p>In short, where <i>Fantastic Planet</i> (partially inspired by the 1973 René Laloux <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Planet"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film of the same name</a>) used outer space imagery as a vehicle to express Edwards' heroin-addled feelings of spiritual dislocation, <i>The Heart Is a Monster</i> shifts focus from outer to inner space and probes the deeper mysteries of sleep. The band spends the bulk of the album's 18 tracks exploring dreams, consciousness, memory, and the dissolution of self. Song after song after song, it's clear that Edwards and Andrews haven't lost their gift for walking the line between cerebral and dark. And it's precisely that charge of intellectual stimulation—spiked with an ever-so-subtle creep factor—that makes <i>The Heart Is a Monster</i> such a thrilling ride.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, though, Failure circa 2015 engages most when it departs from the driving riff-rock that landed it on the map in the first place. ""Counterfeit Sky"", for example, rubberizes the band's penchant for dissonance and stretches it into a slinkier, sexier sound. And then, in the most striking<i> wtf?… wait, this could actually be working!</i> moment, the piano-driven ""Mulholland Dr."" literally sounds as if it could've walked off of <i>From the Inside</i>, Alice Cooper's 1978 album with three of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Elton John</a>'s bandmates and John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. Meanwhile, <i>The Heart Is a Monster</i> contains no less than six ambient interludes. A whole separate album in that style would've been nice, but even in truncated form the interludes cast <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Philip Glass</a>-ian shades onto the other songs and suggest that Failure's creativity is far from exhausted.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7cdd7d3b-4554-dee1-c5f4-bd652735db8c""><span>Finally, there's ""I Can See Houses"", a song that pre-dates the band's 1992 debut </span><i>Comfort</i><span>. Prior to this version, only one, chatting-marred </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/FG9EfNW5ztA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>recording</span></a><span> existed. But even without Edwards' fretless-bass flourishes that define the character of the original, the new ""Houses"" swells into a more sublime, highly finessed vision—the perfect mirror, in fact, for how Failure's sound has blossomed across the board. By reviving its the past, Failure has taken a most decisive step into the present. </span></span></p></div>"|20692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20692-the-heart-is-a-monster/|7.8|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Mere days after the May 1970 massacre at Kent State, he had <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8JPPpFmeYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">branded Richard Nixon a mass murderer</a>; nearly 20 years later, he was redrafting George Bush Sr.'s inaugural address into a state-of-the-union screed dripping with so much bitter sarcasm, some conservatives <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/17/neil-young-donald-trump-keep-on-rockin-in-the-free-world"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still mistake it for an ad hoc national anthem</a>. Those songs remain FM-radio staples to this day because their raging invectives still sting like a ripped-off bandage, decades removed from the moments that incited them. But the topical material that Neil has rush-released in recent years has turned both more lyrically obvious and musically frivolous; whether <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklm3sSds00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dramatizing 9/11 valor in a goofy bar-band grind</a> or calling for Dubya's head with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4kTnP5VJ1k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a cheery choral sing-along and chirpy cavalry-charge trumpets</a>, these songs' shelf lives can be measured in weeks rather than years. As much as his legacy is tied to the politically charged tumult of the late '60s and early '70s, Neil has always been more compelling when playing the rugged, inscrutable individualist rather than the man-of-the-people populist—the urgency to get his message out tends to override the sublime lyricism and unnerving ambiguities that have yielded his most resonant, timeless work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On his new album, Neil revisits an old pet cause: the plight of the American farmer. But 30 years after he co-founded Farm Aid to save cash-strapped field workers from foreclosure, the terms of war have changed. <i>The Monsanto Years </i>fixes its crosshairs on the GMO-pimping agribusiness behemoth that has a stranglehold on the world's seed (and, by extension, food) supply, forcing farmers to comply their strict terms or be litigated into destitution. And, here, the buckshot splatter extends to other entities contributing to the suppression of the average American: Wal-Mart, Chevron, Citizens United, and even Starbucks (though in the latter case, the company insists it's just <a href=""https://news.starbucks.com/views/starbucks-response-to-questions-and-litigation-regarding-gmo-labeling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an innocent bystander</a>). But despite the dawn-summoning optimism of the opening eco anthem ""A New Day for Love"", <i>The Monsanto Years</i> is ultimately less a call to topple an evil empire than an expression of helplessness in trying to fight it. As the album trudges through its treatises on corporate bullying, compromised democracy, and environmental degradation, Neil's not so much standing up for the embattled farmer as embodying the withered voice of one.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perhaps not coincidentally, the sound of the album hearkens back to Neil's immediate post-</span><i>Harvest</i><span> period, a time when the narrative concision and electric-guitar savagery of his early work was giving way to a certain fuck-it-all sloppiness and sundazed cynicism. His amped-up backing band for this set, the Promise of the Real (fronted by Willie Nelson's sons Lukas and, when performing live, Micah), never approaches the trance-inducing psychedelia of Crazy Horse, but they make for a solid Stray Gators substitute, encouraging the sort of rough'n'tumble rave-ups and slack-rock jams that defined early '70s detours like </span><i>Time Fades Away</i><span>. The appealing looseness of their performances proves to be the saving grace of an album too often hamstrung by heartfelt but hackneyed messaging.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While the loping, whistle-hooked ""A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop"" and cowpunk stomp ""Workin' Man"" playfully highlight the absurdity of Monsanto's strong-arm tactics,  extendo-rants like ""Big Box"" forsake the rich characterization of Neil's </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZilu4ApCI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most</a> </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ6hmupAtIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">incisive</a> </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVRxdPWV3RM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>social</span></a><span> commentaries for worn-out catchphrases (""too big to fail""), broadstroked scenery (""Main Street's boarded up"") and the blunt simplicity of a Change.org pitch (""people working part-time at Wal-Mart/ never get the benefits""). The album's preference for critique over craft is epitomized by the awkward ubiquity of the very word ""Monsanto,"" which is wedged into several songs even when Neil can't be bothered to find anything to rhyme with it. (On the otherwise poignant seven-minute title track, a breezy </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koFM5paYEmM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Mambo Sun""</span></a><span> groove is tripped up by each utterance of the company name, delivered with all the grave weightiness of a movie villain appearing to the sound of </span><i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61L6hB7c1bg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dun-dun-dun</a></i><span>.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With much of the songwriting on </span><i>The Monsanto Years</i><span> taking the form of hastily scribbled screeds, the most revelatory moments come when Neil grapples with the paradox of making complex politics more pop-song palatable. The album's most immediately engaging track—the raggedly glorious ""People Want to Hear About Love""— isn't a protest song but a song about protest songs. Sure, its call-and-response structure provides Neil with another opportunity to check off all of his key talking points: the fragility of the environment, political corruption, the link between pesticides and autism, and so on. At the same time, it shrewdly addresses those concerns within the context of a more existential dilemma: that is, in a cultural landscape craving feel-good entertainment, </span><i>The Monsanto Years</i><span>' brand of straight-shootin' rock'n'roll activism is going to be a tougher sell than a Pono.</span></p></div>"|20643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20643-the-monsanto-years/|5.2|Stuart Berman

Patterson and a rotating cast of cohorts—including members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"">the KLF</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"">Public Image Ltd.</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29263-killing-joke/"">Killing Joke</a>—made their name and reputation on diaphanous ambient house tracks that stretched on for up to 40 minutes. The project brought to mind weed smoke and chewed mushrooms, but the Orb also cranked out a ton of music. Even as a head for most of their '90s output, I was oblivious to their post-<i>Orblivion</i> output.</p>
<p>Rather than drift off into irrelevance in the 21st century, the Orb have become sturdy and workmanlike. And no small credit is due to Paterson's longtime collaborator, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>, whose solo discography spans three decades. It's almost startling to write that <i>Moonbuilding</i> is the Orb's 10th album in the new century (not including entries in Kompakt's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=pop+ambient"">Pop Ambient series</a> and a slew of rarities comps). The records they've released in that span may not be particularly memorable, but they have realized collaborations with their most obvious sonic forbearers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>'s David Gilmour and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a>. <i>Moonbuilding 2703 AD</i> scans as a concept album, and each of the album's four tracks is more than 10 minutes long. For those that came of age to the likes of ""Blue Room"" and <i>Orb Live 93</i>, it's the kind of length and depth worth getting lost in.</p>
<p><span>The 15-minute ""God's Mirrorball"" adheres to the classic structure of the project. ""First, God does not exist,"" goes the opening sample. ""But don't worry, what does exist is good."" It's a standard Orb trope, a sample that first scans as philosophical query, this one on the nature of good and evil. But then comes the punchline: ""If you believe in evil, then you probably need a whack on the back of the neck with a big fucking stick."" Subliminal rhythmic patterns rise and fall, with the track's true beat only dropping almost five minutes in. It's ambient house perfection as only the Orb can do it.</span></p>
<p><span>The highest highs come on ""Moon Scapes 2703 BC"", moving from satellite beeps to a tough shuffling thump, softened ever so slightly by Patterson's echo and delay. By turns spongy and pounding, head-spreading and heart-quickening, the track moves effortlessly between peaks and chilled-out valleys. When <i>Moonbuilding</i> sounds best is when it strikes a balance between the spaciness of Dr. LX's golden years and the type of craftsmanship and restraint that typifies Fehlmann's 21st century solo output, such as <i>Visions of Blah</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10338-honigpumpe/""><i>Honigpumpe</i></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>But as is their wont, the Orb lose steam and focus on the record's second half. ""Lunar Caves"" is middling and indistinct, its ambient washes leading into a number of beats that are soon sloughed off. The 13-minute title track boasts the crispest beat on the album, but it's one ill-suited for the group, situated midway between jazzy nu-soul and boutique hotel downtempo. While both subgenres arose during the Orb's heyday, they sound wholly out of date here. Some moments on <i>Moonbuilding</i> show the Orb, if not regaining their form, then offering up decent ambient music. But elsewhere they revert back to a formlessness that's devoid of their quirky stoner persona.</span></p></div>"|20709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20709-moonbuilding-2703-ad/|6.7|Andy Beta

Wolf Alice's debut album is one of 2015's most anticipated homegrown debuts, thanks not to them running their mouths or having <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28776636"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the right management</a>, but three years of hard touring punctuated by just four EPs. In the UK, <i>My Love is Cool</i> is being touted as grunge’s second (or, ninth) coming, when really it affirms the tentative coming-of-age story in guitarist/singer Ellie Rowsell’s lyrics by refusing to settle for a single identity at this early stage.</p>
<p>Wolf Alice are best at capturing sensations. The chiming rush of ""Bros"" freeze-frames the heady teenage abandon of the lyrics—bad haircuts and hopping buses with a best friend you'd die for—as Rowsell's wistful vocal turn establishes her increasing distance from that time. Meanwhile ""Freazy"" is Wolf Alice's us-against-the-world mission statement: ""You can hate us all you want but it don't mean nothing at all."" There's a neat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"">Haim</a>-like snap to the choruses, but the dreamy verses clash with Mike Crossey's intense production sheen, evoking a time when Tin Tin Out were pop's go-to remixers.</p>
<p>When Wolf Alice rage, they usually do it with stealth. It takes 90 seconds for ""You're a Germ"" to turn from grave whispers about a bad boy in cheap leather to an indictment of the ""dodgy fucker."" Rowsell's a limber vocalist: ""Lisbon"" starts with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/186-azure-ray/"">Azure Ray</a> sweetness as she clings to an ex's stolen cigarettes and threadbare t-shirt, but by the end it sounds as if she's rounded up the rest of the band to smash in every window of his house. Forgoing restraint in favor of hard-edged, exhilarating swagger, ""Giant Peach"" and ""Fluffy"" confront the suffocating element of remaining in the place where you grew up. ""What the hell keeps me here/ In a dark old town that I've adored?"" Rowsell snarls on ""Giant Peach"". ""The rules don't seem so clear/ And change, it feels like fear/ It's all you know.""</p>
<p>That sense of vulnerability also informs some of Rowsell's bleaker lyrics, which unpick the social implications of mental health issues while conveying their claustrophobia. ""Silk"" mutates from spare coldwave to a dark nursery rhyme that rejects the idea of depression as an interesting character trait. On ""Soapy Water"", a distant-sounding Rowsell hides inside a mesmerizing disco swirl to conceal the effects of anxiety from her parents. It's crushing but strangely comforting, like repeated viewings of <a href=""https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/1079-in-sofia-coppolas-films-music-says-what-characters/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Virgin Suicides</i></a>.</p>
<p>Concealed at the end of <i>My Love Is Cool</i> is the secret title track, a bedroom demo of Rowsell and her electric guitar. ""Teach me, teach me/ Teach me rock and roll,"" she sings softly. But the confident diversity of <i>My Love Is Cool</i> indicates a band who have their own thing all figured out, who shouldn't veer from their own strange path to live up to outdated narratives that dictate what a young British band should be.</p></div>"|20680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20680-my-love-is-cool/|7.4|Laura Snapes

He has Devin’s gift for observational humor, for singing his own choruses, and for making songs that seem light but can cut deeper than you expect. His voice is light and unassuming and his flow gathers in clumps around the beat, like he is punching it affectionately in the arm rather than riding it. He has a lisp he does nothing to disguise on record, which adds up to a certain image: This is a guy who doesn’t really care about how he appears, someone comfortable with his own thoughts, with being himself. On last year's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/boogieofficial/sets/boogie-thirst-48-final"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Thirst 48</i></a>, that guy—shrugging, diffident, wry, full of little jokey insults like ""Man I swear Twitter turned lying to a talent”—seemed like someone to watch.</p>
<p>His follow-up, <i>The Reach</i>, is a little darker, and a little more outwardly emotional, than<i> Thirst 48</i>, which kept the energy casual. The beats were quiet, tinged with some subdued horns and a general vibe of electric relaxation. <i>The Reach</i> opens with an expansive and melodramatic sample from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS46C2z5lVE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Route 94’s ""My Love""</a>, with Jess Glynne’s already-deep voice pitched down. It’s a wider-reaching sound than anything on<i> Thirst 48,</i> and Boogie sounds like he’s amping himself up a bit, trying to raise the stakes on his music. His lyrics are uniquely clear and instantly legible—on your first listen through one of his mixtapes, you generally come away having absorbed every word he’s said.</p>
<p>This might seem like a strange or minor point to focus on, but it feels like part of Boogie’s appeal: His lyrics are plainspoken, funny, and sometimes poignant, and listening to him expound on his life is why you tune in. ""Further"" is a meditation on the effects of cyclical violence, and he sounds musing, hurt, and confused in turns. On the interlude ""God’s Work"", he remembers his mother’s eviction, sneaking back in to sleep in the apartment, eating dry cereal. ""Even when I’m quiet I be turnt/ And I ain’t trying to cause no riot with my verse,"" he raps, in what feels like a Boogie Manifesto.</p>
<p>The production gleams with lots of warm horns, drums that sound like dripping faucets, and ribbons of vocal samples. It’s rap that sounds like it’s peeking out the window at the world, which is a feeling Boogie reinforces sometimes in his lyrics, which bristle with protective fear for his six-year-old son. On ""Make Me Over"", he is an aggrieved single dad, fretting about an environment that feels studded with threats large and small.</p>
<p>There are moments where Boogie sounds silly, getting excited about girls on Instagram, annoying retweets, and people who buy followers on Twitter. If his ear for rapped hooks sharpened, he might land something like a calling-card song: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmUgmo7x_sA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bitter Raps""</a>, a  loose stream of insults and half-hearted gripes from<i> Thirst 48</i>, is the closest he has. Like his first tape, <i>The Reach</i> feels like a lovingly small-scale project, something to keep you good company in the privacy of your earbuds rather than at a party or in open spaces.</p></div>"|20768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20768-the-reach/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Earlier this month, the Chicago rapper, then just 19, released his third mixtape, <i>X</i>, which scans like a pretty unsurprising extension of the aesthetic of his previous two mixtapes. Eck$' is murky, tonally somber music: the kind that is borderline overwrought, sometimes irksome in its refusal to get up from under its own weight, even for a minute. Affect-wise, there are resonances with the recent work of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> (Eck$ acknowledges the debt, being ""high as fuck off of that Earl Sweatshirt and Max B"" on ""Mac N Cheese""). The Odd Future alumnus' April album has been widely acclaimed, but has also spawned its share of categorical dismissals: usually, by listeners with limited patience for self-serious grand tours of the dark recesses of the post-adolescent mind (""I do like shit, and I do go outside,"" essentially). Eck$' tape is even more unrepentantly bleak, and stylistically provocative, combining Earl's insistent misanthropy with a kind of rap game senioritis; greasy, caution-to-the-wind flows and half-baked reflections are the order of the day.</p>
<p>Appreciating Eck$' songwriting prowess and overall discipline—and crediting that he is something other than a one-trick pony, wielding tape-echo-heavy ambience as his primary weapon—requires closer listening. The rapper has altered his sound and focal points significantly over the course of his three releases; just compare the croaked axioms and eerie washes of <i>X</i> to his comparatively chipper 2013 debut, <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/lucki-eck/alternative-trap"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Alternative Trap</i></a>. Though that tape sags under an excess of small-time pusherman shop talk and viscous reverb clouds, Eck$' delivery is usually liltingly melodic; in hindsight, the influence of the then-rising <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> is unmistakable (the title is a play on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/""><i>Acid Rap</i></a>: statement-of-purpose as mixtape title and invented Soundcloud genre tag). Eck$' breakthrough track from the project, ""Count on Me"", is driven by quaint pizzicato strings straight off of an Andrew Bird record. 2014's <a href=""http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lucki-ecks-body-high-new-mixtape.115278.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Body High</i></a>, in turn, found Lucki smearing the colors on his sonic palette, shunting the lithe, nursery-rhyme hooks off to the side to accommodate more longform lyrical throughlines and rap over <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>—it's a drastically more difficult record.</p>
<p>But somehow, it feels easier to lock in with the spare, dead-eyed <i>X</i> than either of these other two tapes; certainly, it's Eck$' most lovingly crafted release to date. The production operates in the same general realm as the previous material. The key chordal material is manifested in waves of impressionistic, mostly unidentifiable sound. Samples, when they crop up, are treated heavily, mimicking the crackly sound of aged 78s; otherwise, they are slowed down and phased in the mode of a vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/hall-of-game/9069-dj-screw/"">DJ Screw mix</a>. But generally, on <i>X</i><span>, the drum sounds and patterns are crisp, moving closer than Eck$ has yet come to trap that is not ""alternative"" at all. They swing rather than plod, topped by careening cymbal purrs (the beat for the Chance-featuring ""Stevie Wonder"" is partially the work of Young Chop, the veritable Charlie Parker of Chicago drill production).</span></p>
<p>Eck$' rapping bends to this newfound clarity. He's clearly storyboarding his ideas, or at least considering his next step more carefully on the spot. Song structures shift smoothly with new gestures in the production, or don't, when there's still life in just one sticky idea to squeeze out: Highlights ""Lowlife"" and the ""Still Tippin'"" sampling ""Still Steal"" build up momentum around deadly simple, plaintive refrains and narrow locked grooves. Elsewhere, Eck$ builds toward denser, more symphonic moments—see the sinister synth bass that builds under the tabla-driven ""Mac N Cheese"" (toward the line ""Got nightmares starring you"") or the lush ""None Other"", with its thinly sliced soul sample and tap dancing 808s.</p>
<p>His verses, narratively, also seem to unfold with the expressive contours in the music. Tales of wasted hours, bad relationships, and ill-advised benders build toward unexpected admissions: ""I contradict often, I get it from my family/ So you can't blame me, baby, it's in my blood/ So if I'm disrespectful, just know that it's all love,"" he half-snickers on ""Still Steal"". Self-doubt and, at worst, self-loathing is the constant subtext, lurking behind every self-mythologizing moment, allowing Eck$ to push beyond the <a href=""https://youtu.be/yNncDVmU5jc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""posted up on that corner like I been waiting on a ride or something""</a> braggadocio and caricaturish anti-heroism of his preceding tapes.</p>
<p>If nothing else—right down to Eck$ assuming some of the production duties—the key to <i>X</i>'s success is its palpable, overarching poise and control. Hearing attitude-for-its-own-sake and sloppiness as the locus means buying into the central illusion, confusing content for form. Sure, this is, for all intents and purposes, bleary Tumblr-ripe rap which coalesces loosely, begging for the use of ""drug-addled"" as both a general descriptor and an excuse for its surface eccentricities.

The heavy-lidded, preternaturally calm Long Beach rapper has always seemed to have a remarkable amount on his mind, with more to say than he has room for: The last line on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apf8vp85a8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Taxi""</a>, the final track of his first full mixtape, 2011’s <i>Shyne Coldchain Vol. 1,</i> ended in a similar fashion, with a freezing bucket of water—""Tried praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up""—before the music simply stopped.</p>
<p>In those days, Staples seemed studiously laconic, like his friend <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, whom he is still often mentioned alongside. What’s been remarkable to watch is the way Staples has leaned forward—bigger songs, bigger statements, greater urgency–as Earl bled into the cracks in the walls of his mind. Earl doesn’t know or care if you are in the room, which is part of his appeal; Vince Staples’ eyes are boring right into you.</p>
<p>Staples has become an increasingly powerful communicator, and on <i>Summertime '06</i>, his lines are sharp enough that every word digs into meat: ""I hate when you lie; I hate the truth, too."" (""Jump Off the Roof""), ""In the Planned Parenthood playing God with your mom's check/ You ain’t even been to prom yet"" (""Surf""). Like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> drained of hope, Staples expresses complex ideas in plain, hard sentences, ones that can be handed to you like a pamphlet:<span> ""No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past,"" he states simply on ""Like It Is"".</span> His rapping is conversational, but these are the conversations you have when all optimism has been burned away.</p>
<p>The album is split into two sides, making it technically a double album. But double albums are usually unwieldy, and <i>Summertime '06</i> is breathtakingly focused, a marathon that feels like a sprint. The production bangs and clanks throughout with a septic, rusted, retooled-buggy persistence, which Staples matches. On ""Lift Me Up"", he chants the song’s title over and over again, but his voice is thin and tired, and the music heavy and slow. It’s the sound of someone working for uplift who knows in their bones just how much misery lays along the road.</p>
<p><i>Summertime '06</i> was overseen by Dion ""No I.D."" Wilson, one-time mentor to Kanye and the force behind all of Def Jam’s best projects for years now. No I.D. seems to grasp the essence of every track he works on; music that has borne his attention almost always emerges with its worldview clarified. On <i>Summertime '06</i>, he turns an album produced largely by himself, DJ Dahi, and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a> into one tense, seething organism, making it difficult to isolate which songs these wildly different musicians worked on. The sound is cold and brittle, full of little blurts of percussion that resemble nervous fidgets. The basslines are often played by a groaning distorted electric guitar, and songs like ""Dopeman"" have the crackling alkaline energy of a Neptunes production. There are forlorn melodies, played on keys, that sometimes sneak in behind songs like ""3230"" or ""Might Be Wrong"", and they provide the undercurrent of what all this hard-nosed realism might cost you.</p>
<p>By now, it’s clear that <i>Summertime</i> is not ""fun,"" and at no point do you suspect you’ve been invited to a party. But the sound submerges you in the itch of Staples' mind. He is a devotee of realism, in its simplest definition. Keeping it real, for him, means clearly documenting everything he sees, removed from the clouds of hope or pain or pity. He marvels at the loneliness of his job as a rapper, translating his life to those who don’t live it: ""All these white folks chanting when I ask them ‘Where my niggas at?’/ Going crazy, got me going crazy, I can’t get with that/ Wonder if they know I know they won’t go where we kick it at?"" he raps on ""Lift Me Up"".</p>
<p>The voices you hear on the album that don’t belong to Staples—the voicemail on ""Might Be Wrong"", hooks whispered by art-rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30612-kilo-kish/"">Kilo Kish</a>—feel like echoes or ghosts. He raps often about crimes he’s committed, but the songs don't have the cinema of street rap. His attention to detail purposefully drains the adrenaline out of the scenario and leaves a quotidian focus on the smallest facts of the situation—""Four deep, five seats, three guns,"" he observes on ""Get Paid"", and this is almost all you get. ""The sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties/ In Black America, can you survive?… No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leaning on the Bible,"" he laments on ""C.N.B."", an expression not so much of defiance as a simple plea for peace. Sometimes, nothing feels as real as simple weariness, or wariness.</p>
<p>There is one true moment of tenderness on the album. ""Summertime"" has some oddly voiced guitar chords, which Clams Casino surrounds with his trademark soothing hum of synths, like a buzzing air conditioner behind yellowed drapes. Staples half-sings in an exhausted monotone. ""Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom,"" he offers. ""My teachers told us we were slaves/ My momma told me we was kings/ I don’t know who to listen to/ I guess we somewhere in between/ My feelings told me love is real/ But feelings here can get you killed."" It’s a love song, or the closest thing to that Vince Staples allows himself to make—an allowance that love might exist. There’s nothing in the song’s deadpan knock, its arrangement, or in Staples' voice, that gives away the warmth. It is just there, like the sun the song’s characters stare at to know their freedom.</p></div>"|20719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20719-summertime-06/|8.8|Jayson Greene

In the years following his debut, 2001’s <i>1st Born Second</i>, Bilal has done everything to shed the neo-soul label with which he’s been associated. ""I’m a jazz musician. That’s what I went to school for,"" he recently <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/03/interview-bilal-talks-kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Complex. ""I want to make music that is going to confuse the computer."" In hindsight, that explains the iconoclastic nature of 2010’s <i>Airtight’s Revenge</i> and 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17816-bilal-a-love-surreal/""><i>A Love Surreal</i></a>, two albums that largely eschewed Bilal’s earlier throwback aesthetic for a denser electronic sound. Through it all, Bilal is at his best when he's disciplined: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-FvlxE3uI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his version</a> of ""Can’t Hide Love"" rivals the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire original, and his feature work on Kendrick Lamar’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a><i> </i>bolstered the rapper’s coming-of-age narrative. Too often, though, Bilal’s solo music has been scattered and unfocused, making it tough to fully embrace.</p>
<p><i>In Another Life </i>is produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Adrian+Younge"">Adrian Younge</a>, whose live instrumentation matches the singer’s raw energy. Younge has composed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17872-ghostface-killah-adrian-younge-twelve-reasons-to-die/"">for rapper Ghostface Killah</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17811-the-delfonics-adrian-younge-presents-the-delfonics/"">Delfonics’ vocalist William Hart</a> and is known for his modern interpretations of <i>Shaft</i>-era R&amp;B. Where <i>A Love Surreal</i> dabbled in electronic soul, <i>Life</i> feels like a one-take jam session: Younge’s soundtrack evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly Stone</a>’s improvised funk and buffers Bilal’s ruminating ballads, and the LP falters when it strays from that sound: The bouncy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"">Big K.R.I.T</a>.-assisted ""Pleasure Toy"" is out of step with <i>Life</i>’s organic vibe, and ""Lunatic"" is a shrill alt-rock number that Bilal screeches his way through. Elsewhere, the backing music acts as scenery for the singer’s best feature—the timbre of his voice. If <i>Surreal</i> was the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> album Bilal always wanted to make, <i>In Another Life </i>seems influenced by <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> (Kendrick spits rapid-fire verses here on ""Money Over Love"") and D’Angelo’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20078-black-messiah/""><i>Black Messiah</i></a>, multifaceted works that celebrate blackness without conforming to what black art is perceived to be.</p>
<p><i>Life</i> has an inquisitive spirit; as it plays, Bilal sounds like the ardent storyteller trying to figure things out along the way. He withdraws from Earth on ""Satellites"", assessing civic decay from an aerial perch: ""Watching the world watch people as they do what they do to people/ So what did we do? And what can we do? And how did this happen?"" On ""Open Up the Door"", Younge wields a '70s Stevie-like groove, and Bilal, like the Motown icon, uses seasonal imagery to convey human perseverance. ""It’s a long, cold winter,"" he sings, ""but when it rains, we grow."" Younge and Bilal’s synergy takes shape toward the album’s back end, on ""Holding It Back"", ""Spiraling"", and ""Bury Me Next to You"", all three using similar rhythms to form a seamless suite. <i>In Another Life</i> is one of Bilal's better records; after many years and five albums (including the impressive and unreleased <i>Love for Sale</i>), perhaps he has finally found his niche. Who knows how long he’ll stay there.</p></div>"|20647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20647-in-another-life/|7.2|Marcus J. Moore

He’s successfully avoided accumulating even the basic trappings of adulthood—the only things he seems to own are a skateboard, a backpack full of clothes, and some portable gear, and he exists in sort of a perpetual cruise around New York City, crashing on the couches of friends in between peregrinations. His <a href=""http://londonoconnor.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr posts</a> and interviews so far have had a slumber-partyish confessional quality, and he’s quick to bring up the fact that he didn’t lose his virginity until just before his 21st birthday. He’s got a babyface, an unguarded smile, and the struggle dirt stache of someone who hopes the guy at the door thinks his fake I.D.’s legit.</p>
<p>Despite spending the past six years carving out an enviable home for himself on the fashionable end of the New York creative scene (including a stint in photographer Ryan McGinley’s crew of ethereally young and beautiful models), on his debut album <i>O∆</i>, O’Connor returns to his frustratingly hemmed-in experience growing up in the sedate San Diego suburb of San Marcos, California. The lyrics follow him through an archetypal day as he wanders around feeling alienated, ponders the effect of the Internet on his IRL friendships, records voice memo ""Captain’s logs,"" feels weird about a girl, and steals a garden gnome off someone’s lawn. The subject matter’s typical high school shit that should be achingly familiar to anyone who’s ever been on the scary, confusing brink of adulthood and trapped in a nowhere town, but he imbues them with the immediacy and world-encompassing gravity of someone living through it for the first time. It’s easy to feel like you’re right there with him.</p>
<p>On top of his strings-free living situation and fixation on his high school days, O’Connor’s got a teenager’s complicated mix of childlike and adult natures, and the interplay between innocence and sophistication is the axis that <i>O∆</i> revolves around, and the friction that generates its boundless energy. At first glance it might seem like an almost amateurishly simple album, with chintzy synth sounds, drum beats straight off an old Casio, and major-key melodies that project an aura of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a>-like naivete.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s no outsider musician, though—he originally moved to New York to attend NYU’s heavily industry-connected Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, and one of the couches he crashes on belongs to Nick Sansano, who produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10326-daydream-nation-deluxe-edition/""><i>Daydream Nation</i></a> and engineered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19997-public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-backfear-of-a-black-planet/""><i>Fear of a Black Planet</i></a>—and behind the candy-like facade, <i>O∆</i> is a technically masterful record. O’Connor packs his songs with melodies and countermelodies that whirl past each other in neatly choreographed movements spiked with acrobatic leaps and twists. The production might suggest thrift store keyboards, but the tones are actually clean and rich, and deftly arranged to fill in a comfortable amount of audio spectrum without any extra clutter. It’s as expertly constructed a pop album as anything that will be released this year, and the most impressive thing about it is that O’Connor makes it all look so effortless that you can actually believe he just stumbled into making it by accident.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s a true eccentric, but <i>O∆</i> has a universal appeal. The hooks are so intensely hooky that you can find yourself singing along to them without even knowing it. It’s infectiously joyous, and even when the songs turn sentimental and sweetly sad there’s still the uplifting energetic charge of witnessing an artist figuring out the extent of their powers. The infinitely catchy refrain on his single ""GUTS""—""I hate your gu-uuu-uuu-uuu-uuuts""—makes it a cathartic sing-along jam on par with Beck’s ""Loser"" and Cee-Lo’s ""Fuck You"". As odd as the album is, it could very conceivably turn him into a pop star. I’ve been daydreaming about what that would look and sound like, which might be unfair to an artist who’s just getting started, and if <i>O∆</i> weren't so good at dominating my attention the idea might be a distraction. But just think about it—if he made something this good out of the most boring parts of his past, what’s going to happen when he sets his sights on the future?</p></div>"|20733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20733-london-oconnor-o/|7.8|Miles Raymer

The 53 melodic phrases in that one-page piece—available to be played as many times as members of an ensemble cared to repeat them—still inspire a range of artists today. (Composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a> was among those contributing to <i>In C Remixed</i>, in 2009, while the musicians of Africa Express gave us their spin with this year’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FXQ68ZkWVw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>In C Mali</i></a>). Even if Riley had never fixed another note to paper, the Who would have name-checked him in the title of ""Baba O’Riley"" on the strength of his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKg_R1W94G0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">keyboard improvisations</a>. Similarly, you can imagine contemporary connoisseurs like Big Boi taking time to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2011/05/16/136369324/terry-riley-and-big-boi-hanging-out-like-its-not-a-thang"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pose for a picture</a> with the composer on godfather status alone.</p>
<p>It almost happened just like that anyway. In the 1970s, as Riley was diving ever deeper into his study of North Indian classical music with the singer Pandit Pran Nath, a legacy based on ""In C"" and hypnotic live performances seemed probable. But then, in 1979, violinist and Kronos Quartet founder David Harrington intervened. After a year of persuasion, Riley was prevailed upon to write music on paper again. And the lobbying went both ways. Riley changed the way Harrington’s group worked: encouraging the members to improvise and to ditch the romantic vibrato common to mainstream string-quartet sonics. The result was a working relationship that has now lasted for 36 years, resulting in dozens of commissions and four full-length studio albums.</p>
<p>With Riley turning 80 this year, it’s an obvious move for <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonesuch</a> to bring out all of their Kronos-Riley recordings in a box set, along with a half-hour of previously unheard music. The core of the set is a straight-up porting over of Riley-composed Kronos releases that haven’t ever been hard to find: the 1989 tour de force double-album <i>Salome Dances for Peace</i>, 2001’s<i> Requiem for Adam</i>, and 2008’s <i>The Cusp of Magic</i> (which guest-stars Chinese pipa player Wu Man). But taken cumulatively, the result feels less like an anniversary cash-grab than an attempt to help us see a major aspect of Riley’s art on its own terms.</p>
<p>Riley’s string quartet music reveals the interpretive limitation of the ""minimalist"" tag—the two-hour <i>Salome Dances for Peace</i> is nothing if not maximal music. In his writing for Kronos, Riley variously employs raga patterns, jazz harmonies, and chromatic dissonance. You may need the liner notes to help understand Riley’s mashup of Native American spirituality and New Testament narrative—it involves King Herod’s daughter being brought back to life, in order to inspire compassion instead of violence—but the diversity of the music and its emotional range are anything but compact in scale. Likewise, the surprising synthesized brass section that pops up in <i>Requiem for Adam</i>’s second movement highlights a daring compositional mind at work (one notably unafraid to try out new textures in the service of mourning). While I’d previously paid scant attention to <i>The Cusp of Magic</i>, thinking it a lesser entry in Riley’s catalog, this box set helps prepare the listener for Riley’s increasingly hybrid aesthetic over time.</p>
<p>Those who already own and appreciate these albums may wonder if the half-hour of previously unreleased material justifies purchase of the entire box. But Nonesuch has been generous here (especially in the box-set economy), by making the fifth disc of the set available individually, under the title <i>Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector</i>. And yes: it’s a necessary addition to the catalog—though perhaps not for the reason the composer’s fans will expect. Crate-digging may compel Riley-heads to lunge straight for ""Lacrymosa - Remembering Kevin"" or ""One Earth, One People, One Love"", since we haven’t heard those items recorded before. But the highlight of the disc featuring new material winds up being a recent Kronos recording of ""Sunrise of the Planetary Dream Collector"". At one level, that’s surprising, since ""Sunrise"" is the first piece Riley wrote for Kronos, back in 1980, and it’s been a staple of the group’s repertoire for some time.</p>
<p>Employing both a 14-beat structure borrowed from raga and a series of melodic modes (based on A), Riley has said that he originally conceived of the piece as a ""jazz head arrangement"" that could allow for improvisation and juxtaposition of themes. But Kronos’ 1985 recording doesn’t have that kind of flow at all. It sounds stiff and brittle—as if the players are paying too much attention to the 14-beat pattern. By comparison, the new recording on this box set is a marvel. Instead of leaping right into the work’s hottest rhythmic passage, this version kicks off with a meditative drone section (in which each member of the quartet progressively doles out notes from one of Riley’s scales). Heard against the vibrato-less drone strings, sliding pitches from one violin simultaneously refer to Riley’s North Indian classical studies, as well as his feel for folk-song Americana. And when Kronos does finally launch into the memorable main theme, ""Sunrise"" has a new wind at its back—perhaps the kind that can only be captured after 36 years of collaborative effort.</p></div>"|20723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20723-one-earth-one-people-one-love-kronos-plays-terry-riley/|8.4|Seth Colter Walls

By turns technically punishing and spaciously anthemic, that pair of records still casts a shadow over his latest project, Mutoid Man. With Brodsky on vocals and guitar—along with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> drummer Ben Koller (who in the '00s also briefly played with Cave In) and bassist Nick Cageao—Mutoid Man released a debut EP in 2013 titled <i>Helium Head </i>that combined every element on Brodsky’s periodic table: hooks, mathy precision, metallic hardcore fury, and a lust for classic-rock extravagance.</p>
<p>That hasn’t changed on <i>Bleeder</i>, Mutoid Man’s first full-length. If anything those elements have become more pronounced, fighting each other in a war for supremacy that ends in a clench-jawed détente. The tension on tracks like ""Sweet Ivy"" and ""Deadlock"" is delicious; Brodsky’s needling riffs and liquid runs pit themselves against his alternately melodic and murderous vocals. Brodsky is his generation’s unheralded master of clean/scream singing, and that Cave In dynamic of old rears its head on ""1000 Mile Stare"" and ""Dread Dreams"", both of which recapture the magic of a dynamic that’s become a cliché since Brodsky helped pioneer it in the '90s: drawing you in with sugary, sensitive tunefulness before baring fangs and ripping out throats.</p>
<p><i>Bleeder</i>’s greatest strength, though, is in its wholehearted embrace of both numbskull hard rock and cerebral progressive metal, at a time when the two approaches have become almost mutually exclusive in heavy music. The album’s title track—which, at six minutes, is twice as long as any other song on the filler-free disc—simmers, lunges, and edges toward the dissonantly psychedelic, even as it throws off a chunky post-hardcore vibe. Like <i>Red</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"">King Crimson</a> after botched brain surgery, or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"">Mars Volta</a> after the miraculous intervention of an impeccable editor, Mutoid Man merges highbrow fretboard architecture with immediacy, punch, and a merciless severity.</p>
<p>So what is Brodsky singing about on <i>Bleeder</i>? A bunch of random cool-sounding stuff, apparently, without much concern for anything beyond how the syllables sound when pushed, pulled, or dragged past his tonsils. For someone who once labored manically over every note, blip, lick, texture, and phoneme—Cave In’s 14-minute prog-core magnum opus <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCpsE9sURIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Controlled Mayhem Then Erupts""</a> being a prime example—Brodsky is cutting loose and letting it all hang out on <i>Bleeder</i>. At least as much as he might be able to allow himself to do that, considering his virtuosity as both an instrumentalist and a songsmith. Mutoid Man may not be the resurrection of Cave In’s on-again-off-again majesty, but it savagely boils down Brodsky’s brainy ambition to a primal scream.</p></div>"|20608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20608-bleeder/|7.4|Jason Heller

While riding that wave, it's hard to imagine members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>' <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> imprint saying ""We need something from you <i>right this second</i>,"" which leaves us with an alternative explanation: namely, that the brief duration of <i>The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam</i> (he's calling it a ""mini-album,"" which is the euphemism du jour for EPs) is exactly the statement the bassist-singer-composer wanted to make at this moment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The songs here are airy, and often provisional-feeling, while Thundercat</span><span>'</span><span>s lyrics reliably invoke death, mourning, and vulnerability. The mini-album opens with an ethereal, vocal-led invocation entitled </span><span>""</span><span>Hard Times</span><span>"", </span><span>and follows this up with a track called </span><span>""</span><span>Song for the Dead</span><span>"", </span><span>which labors under some muffled-sounding percussion for most of its running time before stumbling into a clearer sonic field, near its conclusion. Every composition seems relentlessly aware of its own mortality. The greatest comfort on offer tends to be the nimble power of Thundercat</span><span>'</span><span>s virtuoso technique on his main axe. That instantly recognizable, feather-touch electric bass sound of his is potent, but also gossamer-delicate in a way that reinforces the mini-album'</span><span>s themes of impermanence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even when Thundercat comes up with with a monster, single-worthy groove, as on ""Them Changes""—the interlocking bass parts of which recall the supple funk Thundercat has contributed to <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a>'s <i>New Amerykah</i> series—he does not allow himself a rousing chorus, instead reverting to the wordless vowel-mewling of the mini-album's initial, more downtrodden tracks. He even fades the track into silence just as Washington starts a saxophone solo. One images that there's an extended ""Them Changes"" sitting in a folder on Thundercat's computer—though if so, it's obvious how giving listeners an epic version of this song might have thoroughly disrupted the equilibrium of a release as reflective as this one. Likewise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/"">Herbie Hancock</a>'s keyboard cameo—which comes during ""Lone Wolf and Cub""—isn't the place for guest-star grandstanding. (Though he sounds good.)</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-75b06b4a-2bfc-8d5d-f26e-59ff5da844a1"">In a series of Twitter messages posted shortly after this mini-album's release, Thundercat <a href=""https://twitter.com/Thundercat/status/613146324041531392"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> that he is continuing to come to terms with the ""insanely brutal"" deaths of some close friends, while also attempting to process the larger-scale racist injustices that still occur with disheartening regularity. In the final, almost-sunny-sounding track (over some atypically bright keyboard tones), <span class=""im HOEnZb adL"">the narrator encounters a strange but comforting entity. It sounds<br/> like Thundercat finds the figure's presence to be a welcome one—though tellingly, still has to ask ""can you tell me who you are?"" For those of us also muddling through various grim realities, it's tempting to think of this mysterious and unassuming release—which appeared with little advance notice—along similar terms. As it doesn't behave like many other recordings out in the world, you're at first blush tempted to ask what it's up to, and what it wants. But then the figure puts its arms around you, and you start to feel a bit better, even without a full explanation of what's going on. That's more than plenty of full-length records achieve.</span><br/></span></p></div>"|20760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20760-the-beyond-where-the-giants-roam/|8.3|Seth Colter Walls

(Damondre Grice) and Squadda B (Charles Glover). That year saw some of the Oakland natives’ best work: both installments of their <i>808s &amp; Dark Grapes</i> series, especially the cult-favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15784-main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii/"">second volume</a>, as well as Squadda’s solo opus, <i><a href=""https://greenovamusic.bandcamp.com/album/i-smoke-because-i-dont-care-about-death"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Smoke Because I Don’t Care About Death</a></i>. The duo had guested on A$AP Rocky’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/"">debut tape</a> and were collaborating regularly with man-of-the-moment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>. This was the year of Clams Casino’s first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/""><i>Instrumental Mixtape</i></a> and G-Side’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16053-g-side-the-island/""><i>iSLAND</i></a>; in short, it was the year of cloud rap, a vague-on-purpose label for these lo-fi, bass-heavy, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pyops3UGr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Heap-sampling</a> rappers and producers who named their mixtapes stuff like <i>Raindrop Music</i>. This scene lived mostly on the Internet and favored big ideas over lofty language; ""I undersell myself when I say shit,"" Squadda once proclaimed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That term ""cloud rap"" is now embarrassingly quaint to say aloud, having aged about as well as ""witch house,"" but the sound it represents is very much still alive. It’s just become harder to isolate, as mainstream and ""alternative"" rap have grown increasingly entangled in recent years and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>’s influence has become impossible to ignore. Mondre and Squadda came up breathing the same rarified East Bay air as the Based God, their scene’s unofficial patron saint. Cloud rap was based like a square is a rectangle—inseparable but distinct entities. Their lyrics weren’t as bizarre or funny as Lil B’s could be, but they were honest, emotional, and often very poignant—self-taught sociologists trying to understand the world and themselves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>808s &amp; Dark Grapes III</i><span> comes almost four years after its predecessor, and though Squadda still drops tapes semi-regularly, Main Attrakionz haven’t released a project since 2013. That wouldn’t be an especially long hiatus for some artists, but these guys used to hemorrhage music. Their </span><a href=""http://gasbreakdip.tumblr.com/post/39680911633/main-attrakionz-discography-w-links"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>streak from 2009-2012</span></a><span> was Gucci-level prolific; they made 100 tracks in June of '09, the summer both graduated high school. There’s so much music that falls through the cracks from that period, a snapshot of this ultra-specific slice of the rap Internet. The DatPiff description of 2010’s </span><i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Main-Attrakionz-Best-Duo-Ever-The-Greentape-mixtape.149266.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Best Duo Ever: The Greentape</a></i><span> reads like a eulogy to turn-of-the-aughts rap Tumblr greats, the kind of network that doesn’t really have a current analog. But after 2012, as their peers became bonafide stars (Rocky, Clams, Danny, Harry Fraud), Main Attrakionz faded into the background. Their lyrics had always prioritized inner peace over profit, and it seemed like they had some things to figure out before they got back to the game.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Those who would scoff at the dated micro-genre descriptor should take note: </span><i>808s III</i><span> doesn’t sound particularly ""cloudy"" at all. The album is bombastic and baroque, certainly not lo-fi; if anything, it evokes sunlight streaming through parting clouds, a sudden moment of clarity. Much of this is thanks to production duo Friendzone (or fellow Oakland natives James Laurence and Dylan Reznick), whose evocative compositions draw from J-pop, </span><i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Your-boy-SK-Dipset-Trance-Party-mixtape.177770.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dipset Trance Party</a></i><span>, video game scores and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hAaCU2uPak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The-Dream</span></a><span>. They made the beat for one of the all-time great MAz tracks, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoKjrfi-s30"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Perfect Skies""</span></a><span>, a song that grasped for optimism in an exhausting world. That mindset is the lifeblood of </span><i>808s III</i><span>, an album about perseverance, patience, getting your mind right. Mostly, it seems, it’s about redemption.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lead single ""Ain’t No Other Way"", with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29697-kreayshawn/"">Kreayshawn</a>-directed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6WmrSc6Gmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>video</span></a>, is exactly the song you come to Main Attrakionz for: blunted and casually gorgeous, advocating grounded positivity in spite of it all, getting by with a little help from their friends. ""In this cold world, you get lost,"" sings Squadda—it’s really more of a based R&amp;B song than a rap song—in what might be an abbreviated explanation for their hiatus. The often cruel unpredictability of life has been a central theme throughout the duo’s catalog, as it is here on ""Shoot the Dice"". This used to give their work a nihilistic bent, running counter to the chin-up basedness, which could manifest as righteous <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Squadda-B-of-Main-Attrakionz-Dear-America-Free-Ep-mixtape.133275.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>political fury</span></a> or escapist hedonism. Squadda and Mondre seem calmer now, more willing to live in the world as it is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And there are moments of pure elation, too, expanding beyond cloud rap’s woozy insularity and aiming higher. They giddily proclaim themselves ""spectacular and debonair"" on the shimmering ""G.O. Style"". The triumphant horns of ""What Else to Do"" evoke a hyperactive video game version of Drake’s ""Trophies"". And though MAz were staunchly ""I don’t like shit, I don’t go outside"" before it was cool, ""Dip"" is their closest thing to a club song, channeling a haunted-castle version of </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXeN2FsE7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Tipsy""</span></a><span> for 2015 (Squadda even shouts out JKwon’s </span><i>Hood Hop</i><span> in ""Shoot the Dice"", so this may be intentional). Easy standout ""Summa Time"" builds into an immense and poignant climax, exploding into fireworks as the duo set aside existential paranoia to celebrate the moment: ""Fuck it, let’s keep it going till the sun come up!""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The emotional crux is saved for closing track ""Two Man Horror Film"". Shady Blaze, always the most technically gifted rapper within Main Attrakionz's Green Ova crew, delivers a quietly gut-wrenching verse that speaks of channeling unspeakable grief—the loss of his newborn son in 2013—into songwriting. ""For the most part, I’m good,"" he concludes, in a moment of awe-inspiring grace. That gets right at the essence of Main Attrakionz, who are sharper and more consistent than ever here, even if the high points don’t quite match those of <i>808s II</i>: life is incredibly hard, but there are moments of beauty that make it worthwhile, often found through the people you love. ""Two Man Horror Film"" fades into a scavenged sound clip, a practice MAz have been fond of for years. It’s a selection of a speech from the 1998 movie <i>Bulworth</i>, a satire about a suicidal senator who burns out and, completely disillusioned, discovers rap and uses it as his own means of brutally honest political expression. ""You got to be a spirit—you can't be no ghost,"" it goes, a final reminder from cloud rap’s prodigal sons that life goes on, if you want it to.</p></div>"|20690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20690-808s-and-dark-grapes-iii/|7.4|Meaghan Garvey

Consider the tattoos on the UK producer's knuckles—""KICK"" on the right, ""DRUM"" on the left—or the fact that his chosen alias reads like an onomatopoeic transcription of <a href=""http://stickurz.com/1324-thickbox_default/batman-s-blam.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comic-book violence</a>. His name feels vaguely like mouthing an explosion, and his music has followed suit. Full of jackhammering kicks, splintered wooden percussion, and short-fuse breakdowns, it's typically as volatile as a coffee-tin full of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Granted, Blawan's music has never been hard simply for the sake of being hard: Just see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL_Bbyi3ub8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage""</a>, in which he flips a <a href=""http://www.whosampled.com/sample/165873/Blawan-Why-They-Hide-Their-Bodies-Under-My-Garage%3F-Fugees-How-Many-Mics/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fugees sample</a> into what sounds like the unhinged ranting of a serial killer and then piles screams and clangs and abattoir-grade reverb on top. That campy-scary tune, released in 2012, turned into an unexpected breakout hit: It's racked up close to a million plays on YouTube, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> was playing it in his sets for a while, and the Irish quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31978-girl-band/"">Girl Band</a> even covered the song, returning it to the slash-and-burn punk rock that obviously inspired it.</p>
<p>But Blawan's latest releases display a much subtler approach. The change is right there in the title of the recent inaugural EP on his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ternesc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TERNESC</a> label: <i>Warm Tonal Touch</i>. He's been making music with an all-hardware setup for a while now, but the first two records on his new label represent a new set of limitations, having been made entirely with modular synthesizers. You wouldn't necessarily know that from listening to them; where many modular users slip down rabbit-holes of complex evolving sequences or get tangled up in cat's cradles of blips and blurps, Blawan uses his machines more for color and shading—darkly lustrous streaks, silvery scribbles, crushed chalk smeared against a backdrop of woven Kevlar. It's not self-consciously ""synthesizer music"" in the way that a lot of modular creations are; it's still techno to the core.</p>
<p>The drums still come first, and they, too, are sourced from his modular setup. Why does this matter? It might not to the dancers, but for anyone interested in the myriad decisions that happen between turning on a power strip and turning out a finished track, it's notable that he's opted to go without the standard-issue kicks and snares that animate 99.99% of dance records; instead, he's carved his sounds from scratch, sculpting white noise into scratchy patterns that approximate techno's boom-tick template without simply replicating it. In ""Hanging Out the Birds"" and ""Mine Oh Mine"", the beats move in rippling patterns untethered to anything as obvious as a bass drum; instead of pumping in time to techno's conventional throb, they seem to slide across the surface, like water striders. ""Hanging Out the Birds"" is strangely relaxed and fleshed out with diffuse, almost beatific tones; ""Mine Oh Mine"", with its rapid-fire pitter-pat and chromatic churn, is a nail-biter made even more nerve-wracking by its refusal to reach anything like a climax. Only a soothing spoken-word bit offers the occasional respite from the roil.</p>
<p>With its heavier pulse and whip-cracking backbeats, ""Weakening Force"" is more like Blawan's previous records, but it sounds like it's been sanded down and worn away; it is to his more full-bodied work as a grave rubbing is to the granite slab. The heaviest (and best) of the bunch is ""Diatonic Valves"", which charges forward like a lawnmower chewing up gravel and yet still manages to be graceful, even lyrical, even though the sole melodic element is a banshee's wail that snakes dolefully through the upper register. For being so stripped down and so rough around the edges, it packs an incredible amount of tone, and emotion, into its swollen midrange, bringing to mind the ragged-yet-ethereal sound of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a> at their most relentless. It's a tantalizing glimpse of where Blawan might go next—sheathing the tats in velvet gloves without sacrificing an ounce of force.</p></div>"|20741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20741-hanging-out-the-birds-ep/|7.3|Philip Sherburne

We've no one to blame but ourselves, they report; meanwhile the third album by maximalist art-poppers Everything Everything feels like the final part of a trilogy about mankind's desperate self-destruction. </p>
<p>In its appealingly hyperactive way, the Manchester-based four-piece's 2010 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14611-man-alive/""><i>Man Alive</i></a>, confronted the human effects of media manipulation around war, body image, and the environment. 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17540-arc/""><i>Arc</i></a> took a morbid turn, casting depression and the shame of social inaction as a hopeless apocalyptic landscape. ""I'm lawful, I kept my head down/ I turned a blind eye, I played my cards right,"" frontman Jonathan Higgs sang on ""Undrowned"". And yet: ""I'm in debt, man!"" In an age of ISIS, mass shootings, and the rise of the UK right, there's no need for fictional catastrophes on their third record. <i>Get to Heaven</i> pivots on the violent last resorts of the disenfranchised, and the false prophets who claim to save them.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's rich of four middle-class white guys to think they have anything to say about being marginalized, but Higgs tries to empathize with what drives people to drastic measures—the subtext being that he's lingered on that emotional cusp. The booming ""Regret"" glimpses a vanishing act on the TV news—perhaps of young people joining ISIS, or volunteers signing up to help aid efforts. ""Maybe you're the coldest if you never felt it,"" sings Higgs of that desperation to <i>do something</i>, as the rest of the band chant the song's title like monks, over a '60s girl-group beat. ""Maybe you're the luckiest if you never did it.""</p>
<p>The intense, raging narratives on <i>Get to Heaven</i> are frequently rooted in character studies: The terrorist attempting to kill the queen, the convert to right-wing ideologies, the Good Man who admits that he too would be corrupted by power. The driving vantage point, though, is still his frantic mind. Where the forlorn <i>Arc</i> could feel like a study in learned helplessness, Everything Everything sound more enervated than ever on <i>Get to Heaven</i>. They push their maximalist tendencies to extremes, stretching every second with sound as a way of staving off the death that looms everywhere: ""I don't want to get older,"" as Higgs sings on ""Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread"". And on ""Zero Pharaoh"": ""They tell me there's a way to cheat death.""</p>
<p>Lead single ""Distant Past"" is the standout track, in which Higgs pleads for escape from the present day only to realize that certain backwards ideologies want to revive mentalities from a darker age. Underpinning it is a massive, strafing chorus that stokes the escapist fantasy with its hints to Edenic rave culture. Elsewhere, though, he gawks head on at horror. ""To the Blade"" is a yowling opening salvo about prejudice that splutters into a paranoid guitar solo borrowed from <i>Hail to the Thief</i>. Over ""Fortune 500""'s grave, burbling synths, Higgs sings sadly of a ""trail of destruction—but at least it's a trail,"" as he envisages being at the center of a plot to murder the queen. Heavy kick drums and more chanted vocals kick in at the chorus, ramping the tension somewhere nervy and disquieting.</p>
<p>They don't really let up on the lyrical desperation, but thankfully there are lighter shades on <i>Get to Heaven</i>, like the title track's jaunty Afrobeat guitar and nonchalant whistle, or the chorus of ""The Wheel (Is Turning Now)"", which erupts in warm euphoria that wouldn't shame Coldplay. The last two songs also offer welcome respite. On ""No Reptiles"", Higgs dismisses theories that world leaders are evil reptilian shapeshifters by pointing out that they're just ""soft-boiled eggs in shirts and ties"". And ""Warm Healer"" abandons the record's scheme altogether—it's a slow, sparkling song about losing the ability to love. There's doubt and desperation in everyone, they seem to suggest, and a little more empathy might go some way to preventing the destruction we wreak on the planet, and on each other. While <i>Get to Heaven</i>'s ceaseless terror and heavy arrangements can be overwhelming, more power to Everything Everything for attempting to offer a nuanced understanding of a broken world at a time when a lot of their significantly less imaginative British indie rock peers say <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/lostinshowbiz/2015/apr/30/russell-brand-not-alone-horrors-faris-badwan-voting-pointless"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worse than nothing</a>.</p></div>"|20443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20443-get-to-heaven/|7.2|Laura Snapes

You know the type: for a minute at a time, four very, <i>very</i> angry people assail you with a flurry of flailing, inexact blows, where their intensity and energy is very apparent and the skill is maybe not. The Armed will not say those things on <i>Untitled</i><i>. </i></p>
<p>This technically dazzling and sniper-precise Detroit collective can be called a ""hardcore supergroup,"" as that’s what usually happens when a band comes with prior affiliations—in this case, the Armed lists Slicer Dicer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32734-sumac"" target=""_blank"">Sumac</a>, and Baptists on their C.V. And despite having a finely honed visual and musical aesthetic, the Armed named their new LP <i>Untitled</i> and simply identify as a ""punk rock band""—in particular, the latter gives the connotation of them being noncommittal or lacking chops. But they’re doing so out of practicality: the Armed draw from extreme variations, but ""punk"" is always the common center. They’re ""math rock"" if you consider <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"" target=""_blank"">the Dillinger Escape Plan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/435-botch/"" target=""_blank"">Botch</a> to be so as well, wherein the math is more along the lines of solving advanced calculus at gunpoint. While there’s more shifty rhythmic unpredictability on <i>Untitled</i> than a footwork album, the band always hits you square in the sternum, promising immediate, legitimate threat. As you might guess from the cover, there’s a grim sense of everyman humor heard on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans"" target=""_blank"">Pissed Jeans</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30460-ken-mode"" target=""_blank"">KEN mode</a> record. Perhaps it’s not ""melodic hardcore,"" as the choruses are identified not by melody, but howls being molded into catchier rhythms, such as the communal call-and-response of ""Blessings"" or the anthemic yearning of ""Forever Scum"", which get a little too close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore"" target=""_blank"">Touché Amoré</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9J1Mjji_E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Anyone / Anything""</a>.</p>
<p>Start playing with all of those comparisons and you’re liable to bring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge"">Converge</a> into the conversation<span>—</span>and, not surprisingly, <i>Untitled</i> was recorded by Kurt Ballou. The production on <i>Untitled</i> is immaculate, however, ""production"" for this sort of music can often just come down to placing the microphones in the right spot and allowing the band to be heard as one would expect in its element. Ballou doesn’t disappoint, and he serves his purpose by ensuring this isn’t a slick record. This is how even the most adept hardcore bands can sound in dank basements, converted churches, and other makeshift venues<span>—</span>the guitars carom off and up concrete walls, the reverb is stony and unobtrusive. There isn’t a second of silence throughout <i>Untitled</i>: any time the guitars relent, a shriek of feedback goads them back into action. Whenever Nick Yacyshyn’s double kick drum gets activated, the speakers judder and cut out nearly every other sound, triggering a legitimate fear that an entire room is about to collapse on itself. ""Dead Actress"" is placed right at the center as a breather for four minutes, recalling the dubbier moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones/"">Deftones</a> or shoegaze sucking on exhaust or gunsmoke.</p>
<p>The unrelenting, grim sound of <i>Untitled</i> pairs with the Armed’s outlook, best summed up by another one of Ballou’s charges: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31564-modern-life-is-war/"">modern life is war</a>. Specifically, the cold, passive-aggressive battles that play out in online forums, in any local scene or really any place where social hierarchies are formulated on some unknown calculation of credibility and coolness. This being a supremely heavy punk record and all, you can likely guess what the Armed have to say about it: nothing is original; social media is compensation for a spiritual void; no one is to be trusted, not even the Armed. The omnidirectional rage is concentrated into nearly constant, blunt physical force, so a look at the lyrics sheet is liable to confirm what you’d assume. Even if you can’t <i>hear</i> it, there’s nothing you haven’t heard before: ""Genuine sentiment/ Is not in today’s fashion,"" ""Copy, paste, and like/ I curate my life,"" ""They built a house of lies on this hill/ Reigning on down from high, a soulless shill.""</p>
<p>Hardcore punk bands shouldn’t be required or expected to give a solution to their litany of societal problems, and it’s unclear at whom the Armed are pointing the finger on ""Ender""<span>—</span>""Knee jerk/ Purest reaction of all...release/ The purest intention of all."" <i>Untitled</i> provides a powerful utility if the mood is right: a soundtrack to times where the seemingly contradictory feelings of rage and exhaustion exist in equilibrium, and the only reaction is to just <i>strike</i>. This is a burdensome mood to maintain for even 15 minutes at a time. Experienced in small, invigorating bursts, <i>Untitled</i> can be galvanizing. But spend too much time in this claustrophobic environment and the Armed’s venting becomes toxic and suffocating.</p></div>"|20689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20689-untitled/|6.8|Ian Cohen

The Swedish quartet's opus was profoundly ahead of its time, arriving in the midst of sun-soaked ska (Less Than Jake, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones) and bratty, fratty buzz-bin bands like Eve 6. The album's lean towards the skronky, sulky, and socialistic put it at odds with the vibe of the time: it was too serious, too forlorn, too pretentious. As the years passed, its reputation grew, and it was eventually canonized and revered by everyone from Steve Albini to Hayley Williams of Paramore.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Eighteen years have passed since then, nearly two decades of silence kickstarted by the well-documented inter-band conflict explored in the documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c4R47oAyAc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Refused Are Fucking Dead</i></a>. A whole new generation of border-jumpers has risen from the wake of <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i>, with bands like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"" target=""_blank"">Dillinger Escape Plan</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bled"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Bled</a> venturing down the paths opened up by Refused's wrecking ball. And then, to everyone's surprise, they clawed their way out of the dirt in 2015 to announce a new album, <i>Freedom</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It didn't take a miracle to bring Refused back from the fucking dead—just a brief reunion tour in 2012. After years of not speaking to each other, Refused found themselves locked into a groove. ""Things happen, other things fall into place, and then all of a sudden you're in L.A. recording a Refused record,"" frontman Dennis Lyxzén <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/refused-on-new-album-f--k-what-people-expect-of-us-20150507"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>Rolling Stone</i> recently, sounding incredulous at the band's return. On the surface, <i>Freedom</i> is unlike its predecessor in almost every way. It's a conscious shift precipitated by the firing of guitarist Jon Brännström, whose mathy riffs contributed heavily to the band's power. With their profusion of melodic verses and crunchy guitar hooks, the album could easily find a home on modern rock stations alongside bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"">Rage Against the Machine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"">Muse</a>. Stomping funk-slab ""Françafrique"" is more or less a lesson in colonialism taught by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> (complete with a chorus of children à la ""Aeroplane""), while the slinky late-album cut ""Servants of Death"" recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s similarly skeezy hit ""Smooth Sailing"".  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Elektra"" and ""366"", the album's pair of contributions from pop producer supreme Shellback, are the source of the album's biggest controversy. Some fans may blanch at the thought of a Billboard mainstay producing Refused songs, but given this band's interpretive talents, anything's possible. If they can channel the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/9663-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a> through hardcore punk, who's to say they can't channel the sounds of Top 40? But Shellback's work here brings to mind the kind of hulking, high-definition mixes one would expect from Will Yip and Mutt Lange, and the tracks don't stand out from what surrounds them. Listening to the album from start to finish, the songs are indistinguishable—an ironic flaw, considering how the producer is a huge fan of the band who learned to play drums by hearing <i>The Shape of Punk to Come </i>(perhaps this reverence kept him from seeking out Britney for a guest feature).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As with </span><span><i>The Shape of Punk to Come,</i> <i>Freedom</i>'s<i> </i>lyrics </span><span>focus on what the band perceives as the hypocrisy and complacency inherent in European identity, and how such complacency leads to death, rot, and ruin. Lyxzén plays the role of sociopolitical loudmouth with relish, flinging heretical imagery left and right. ""Elektra"" opens with the grisly image of a towering monument of corpses; ""Old Friends/ New War"" frames Lyxzén's existence within ""centuries of fire."" And of course, there's his frothing, ham-fisted stadium chant of  ""Murder Murder Murder Murder Murder Murder/ Kill Kill Kill!"" on ""Françafrique"", a nine-word crowdpleaser worthy of a middle-school notebook. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The profusion of bloody births and spilled guts is jarring at first, but by the end of the album you become numb to it. You could argue that the repetition is an exercise in desensitizing the listener to the music's inherent violence, but that feels like a stretch. From the whole ""Go back to sleep"" bit on ""Useless Europeans"" to the calls to ""Kill the Man"" to rote atheistic exclamations (""Praise the Lord/God Is Dead!""), <i>Freedom</i>'s lyrics read like the adolescent poetry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"">Tool</a> had they favored Chomsky over Bill Hicks. The infamously awkward opening line of <i>The Shape of Punk to Come—</i>""I've got a bone to pick with capitalism and a few to BREAAAAAKK""—seems like Pulitzer material by comparison.</p>
<p>The biggest problem here doesn't lie with the Man, but rather with listeners like you and me, waiting with bated breath for an album to match <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i>. Refused call this the ""nostalgia circuit"" and they can't stand it, because it's what they've been railing against ever since they started. ""Working with somebody like Shellback is a great way of saying, 'We control what we do with this band'"" (""fuck you"", in other words). Fair enough: Refused have never been ones to kowtow to public opinion, only to pervert it, and in its hostile paradigm shift, <i>Freedom</i> reveals some of <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i>'s rebellious DNA. But even under the pretense of ironic ear candy, the band's hijacking of commonplace modern rock proves ultimately to be neither subversive nor satisfying. No, Refused are not fucking dead, but it's unclear from this album what they came back to accomplish.</p></div>"|20726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20726-freedom/|5.4|Zoe Camp

It liberates Bully's songwriter, singer, and guitarist from the oppressive weight she carries on the Nashville band’s debut album, <i>Feels Like</i>: Worn down by lying jackasses, locked in the ""invisible handcuffs"" of patriarchal expectation, eroded by the male gaze, her feelings discarded like garbage. Compounding all the external fuckery is a black hole of self-doubt and self-deceit that she’s trying to break through. ""My lies settle thicker than my milkshake/ But they both make my stomach ache/ And they’re both slowly weighing me down,"" she sings on ""Brainfreeze"", one of her few moments of pristine indie pop sweetness across these 11 songs.</p>
<p>In a startling shift from Bully’s easygoing 2014 debut EP, Bognanno spends much of <i>Feels Like</i> tearing down the house with her howl. She and the band—Clayton Parker on guitar, Reece Lazarus on bass, and Stewart Copeland (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Copeland"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no relation</a>) on drums—leave behind that EP’s warm and shaggy take on '90s guitar pop for a tougher, more pointed assault that initially sounds austere. Not that anything has been lost in translation between Bognanno’s mind and her microphone. With assistance from staff engineer Jon San Paolo, she recorded the whole thing herself at Chicago’s Electrical Audio, where she interned a few years ago; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini_discography"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in the house style</a>, she refers to herself as the engineer of these songs rather than the producer.</p>
<p>But over time <i>Feels Like</i>’s essential power becomes evident. ""I’m just looking for clarity to help me through,"" Bognanno sings on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17433-bully-trying/"">""Trying""</a>, and the relatively spare production allows the emotion of every guitar part to smack harder: On that song, it’s a yearning whine as she sings about her recurring worry that she’s ""growing so far from myself."" The chorus of ""Trash"" sounds as if she’s leaping up and down on a broken mattress, pretending it’s the head of the liar who treats her worried-over feelings as something disposable, while the killer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17375-bully-i-remember/"">""I Remember""</a> races as fast as her memories of a complex, enduring love. Bognanno is fond of making her choruses into stumbling blocks that stall the pace for a moment, but the joyous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17186-bully-milkman/"">""Milkman""</a> has a loopy waterslide rush that disguises the deceptively sour lyrics: Already trying to outrun her speeding mind, she also realizes that the more she loves a boy, the more he’ll lie to her.</p>
<p>The '90s nostalgia of <i>Feels Like</i> is undeniable, but the hooks are catchy and Bully are most reminiscent of an under-appreciated band—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/384-blake-babies/"">the Blake Babies</a> circa 1989’s <i>Earwig</i> and 1990 follow-up <i>Sunburn</i>. Melodically, Bully are operating on the same level as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1899-juliana-hatfield/"">Juliana Hatfield</a> and co. after they had taken a massive step up from their shambling 1987 debut, <i>Nicely Nicely</i>, and both bands makeover their beleaguered cries as exhilarating, fun pop-punk. Hatfield could be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4sNeWiY1uk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">incredibly self-flagellating</a>; Bognanno is never quite so brutal, but in spite of the shit she shoulders throughout <i>Feels Like</i>, she’s much harder on herself than any of the perpetrators. She’s an anxious introvert with a knack for slipping in sad details as mysterious asides. ""I’m not that social anyway,"" she sings on homebody anthem ""Reason"", where she admits that one of her favorite hobbies is watching her dog stare at the shed—though she’s happiest hiding out ""by the lake, at my dad’s house/ I can take that old bike that my mom left behind a very long, long time ago.""</p>
<p>Once she’s shut out the whole world, however, the noise in her head starts to take over. Nineteen years on, she can’t forgive herself for breaking her sister’s arm, she sings on ""Six"", even though as a kid she slept on her own broken arm for a night to try and make up for it. Time disappears on the moody ""Picture"", where she balks at having her photo taken—at being fixed in time at the point in her 25-year-old life where she’s trying to figure out how far she is from who she used to be, and which parts of herself she wants to make permanent. Within this explosive, rollicking music, Bognanno is as intimate a songwriter as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31640-courtney-barnett/"">Courtney Barnett</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"">Waxahatchee</a>'s Katie Crutchfield, her attempts at being honest with herself contrasted by the liars who want to sink her with them as they renege responsibility for their own lives.</p>
<p><i>Feels Like</i> doesn’t reference any specific dates or weather, but it feels like a summer coming-of-age album. Sure, there are the mentions of milkshakes and scabbed knees, along with the way Bully’s untamed punk should soundtrack windows-down freedom in rattling first cars. But there’s also that sense of lonely intimacy with oneself within what can feel like a vast void of time; six weeks where you tempt yourself with the promise of reinvention that you’ll probably never commit to, lay uncomfortably with your regrets, and fret that the future isn’t making itself clear. These are anthems for ""all of us and our unpaid dues,"" as Bognanno sings on ""Brainfreeze""; people who, per the album title, are slowly learning to trust their intuition and the weight of an emotion. On ""Picture"", one finally weighs too heavy on her, but in a good way: ""Break before I start to bend,"" she sings, finding herself in the act of resistance.</p></div>"|20484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20484-bully-feels-like/|7.8|Laura Snapes

Just because he's doing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18353-pete-rock-camp-lo-80-blocks-from-tiffanys-pt-ii/"">latter-day mixtapes with Camp Lo</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmQk14NWwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scoring extended Smoke DZA monologues</a> doesn't mean he can't bring the same insight and motivation that he brought to ""The World Is Yours"" or ""Be Easy"" or ""The Joy"". The man knows his craft and doesn't skimp on it, so it hardly matters whether an MC on one of his tracks is a household name or a hardcores-only attraction, so long as the beat's done justice. The question remains, then, how good a beat can be before it can work without an MC at all.</p>
<p>Great instrumental hip-hop records from great producers sound like inner voyages with their collected influences, filtered through their newest observations and wrangled into something unpredictable and evocative. Not-so-great instrumental records from great producers? Well, they kind of sound like demo reels. To be fair, the first <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1RWQP-jXs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>PeteStrumentals</i></a>, released way back in 2001, was a hell of a demo reel, as is its long-belated sequel <i>PeteStrumentals 2</i>: in both cases, the beat hooks you in the first few bars before you start fiending for somebody putting in an actual verse by the midpoint.</p>
<p>Still, it's at least worth delving into what shifts in style and technique both connect and separate <i>PeteStrumentals 2</i> from the sounds he was working with 14 years ago (or 24 years ago, for that matter). Those characteristic blasts of seamless horn loops and burbling keyboards—piano, Rhodes, or otherwise—still jump out as backbone elements, pieces that introduce themselves like flourishes and eventually work their way down into the marrow to become as integral as the drums. But it's those drums that still hit on (or around) The One that remain Pete's core means of expression even when he's rewriting his signature. The lead-in to opener ""Heaven &amp; Earth"" hints at choppy, juddering excursions that threaten to mess with basslines in micro-fractured doses, a tease at an acknowledgement of more contemporary and weirder ways to toy with samples. But its psychedelic dub descent eventually lands on a solid boom-clap foundation that rides on the deep juxtaposition of soulful expressions—elegance on the piano, oomph on the drums—that's made him one of the best at merging melodic grace and percussive power.</p>
<p>Where he's been taking his sound since his first flush of renown has put him in the position of being an elder statesman who still seems open to learning and mutating. That someone who was veteran enough to influence <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a> wound up having that influence reciprocated is worth highlighting. Maybe it's not that big of a surprise considering the two-way torch-passing meant he oversaw and arranged the postmortem <span><i>Jay Stay Paid</i>, </span><span>but it turns out he can still stake a claim to his own turf even when paying tribute (""Dilla Bounce (R.I.P.)""), whether he keeps his drums quantized or not, whether he pushes for familiar soul-jazz cool (""Air Smoove""), heated funk (""Accelerate""; ""PR 4 Prez""), and wistful R&amp;B (""I Wish""), or dives into something like ""Cosmic Slop"", which latches onto disembodied synth chords and builds up a track that runs on hypnotic ambience—albeit with a goldbrick-heavy bassline.</span></p>
<p>The atmosphere, meanwhile, trades on tweaks of nostalgic familiarity—sample-spotters will hear old standbys like David Axelrod and Isaac Hayes and Black Heat woven into the texture —but <i>PeteStrumentals 2</i> is too aware of the post-Ummah, Stones Throw-adjacent culture of contemporary beatmaking to coast on his golden-age pedigree. There are <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>-esque moments of abrupt soundbite drop-ins, narrative or otherwise, some of which—like the 34-second anti-police-brutality interlude ""Justice (Brotherhood &amp; Understanding)""—provide a deeper emotional core that the beats themselves only allude to. It's just disappointing that there aren't more of these little touches, or a more quick-moving barrage of ideas condensed into a more concentrated dose—the beats are all quality, but without voices there's not much they can do in three-and-a-half minutes that they don't have the strength and presence to do in two.</p></div>"|20574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20574-petestrumentals-2/|7.0|Nate Patrin

He grew up in a Baltimore enmeshed in the counterculture of the 1960s, living above a nightclub as a teen and partying in John Waters’ eclectic circle. He sang in local groups and became involved in activism, protesting the Vietnam War, marching with United Farm Workers civil rights leader <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cesar Chavez</a>, and fighting for gay rights at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Stonewall_riots"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stonewall riots</a> in New York City. Crucially, he connected with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">the Doors</a>’ road manager, Vince Treanor, and accompanied that group to the Isle of Wight festival, where he was exposed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>, and other bands that molded Smokey into the music-obsessive social butterfly he would become when he moved into Treanor's house in the Hollywood Hills shortly thereafter. It was there that Smokey was introduced to EJ Emmons, a little-known record producer whose biggest credit was co-producing with sunshine pop mastermind Curt Boettcher (Beach Boys, the Association). Smokey and Emmons, who quickly became a couple, decided to start recording together based on an easy rationale that would define much of their collaborative decisions in the decade to come: ""Well why not?""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their first single, and the opening track on <i>How Far Will You Go? The S&amp;M Recordings, 1973-81</i>, the first-ever collection of Smokey's music released via Melbourne-based <a href=""http://chaptermusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chapter Music</a>, was 1974’s ""Leather"". A punchy BDSM anthem inspired by Smokey’s first encounter with the newly liberated sex scenes thriving in places like New York’s premier leather bar The Eagle, the song found the duo firing on all cylinders: Smokey’s vampy vocals about being tied up come together with Emmons’ jaunty pianos and drums, making for an inimitable introduction that eventually became their best-selling single, most notably joining the rotation at integral glam rock nightclub Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco. The B-side, ""Miss Ray"", also included on <i>How Far Will You Go?</i>, further pushed their representation of gay culture to the fore in the shape of a strutting ode to a drag queen Smokey lived with in Baltimore.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But despite the catchiness of those first singles, Smokey’s brazenly gay lyrics were a hard sell to the record labels that could have ushered the group into the mainstream. He and Emmons, who at the time had industry connections to boot, were laughed out of meetings with heavyweights MGM and Mercury. It became clear that despite the gay rights movement now at work across the nation, there was no room for queer artists to be themselves <i>and</i> become nationwide music sensations, a fact that the openly gay, similarly forward-thinking Elektra signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32341-jobriath/"">Jobriath</a> would later disappointingly prove. But there was a silver lining for Smokey: It was from these consecutive rejections that S&amp;M Recordings was born, essentially serving as a hearty <i>fuck you</i> to the music industry that didn’t want to provide a platform for them, right down to the label’s shamelessly homo emblem: a burly, muscled arm with leather cuffs, S and M tattooed on the bicep.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Transferred and restored from S&amp;M Recordings’ original LPs and tapes by Emmons himself, <i>How Far Will You Go</i><i>?</i>'s 16 tracks are threaded together by deft production details and a forthright sense of humor that posits the duo as unsung heroes of those glam, pre-punk years, which, in essence, they were. There's Emmons' chugging disco production spliced with funny bits of spoken-word on ""DTNA"", which flows easily into the sultry cascade of multi-tracked vocals that intone behind Smokey's sighing performance on ""Topaz"". </span><span>You can hear expertly executed elements from various '70s-era music scenes, whether in the Bowie-inflected synth work of ""I’ll Always Love You"", the pianos on ""Topanga"" that evoke Elton John (who was rumored to have Smokey 7’’s in his personal jukebox), or the whistling rocket noises and whirring synth lines of nine-minute disco standout ""Piss Slave"". And, like Jobriath, Smokey always reveled in pushing the envelope, whether that meant inserting ""Piss Slave""’s confrontational mid-chorus onto dancefloors (""I wanna, I wanna, I wanna be your toilet!"") or casting truck stop tricks in a humanizing and compassionate light on the funk-indebted ""Million Dollar Babies"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>They were fearless in a time when doing so had a high, sometimes fatal price, </span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-43c7d4c1-224c-4f6f-fda0-d657eb292881"">and by 1980, Smokey had put out their final single on S&amp;M, ""Fire"", with previously-released B-side ""Strong Love"". The latter served as the title track to Chapter's excellent 2012 compilation</span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-43c7d4c1-224c-4f6f-fda0-d657eb292881""> <i><a href=""http://chaptermusic.bandcamp.com/album/strong-love-songs-of-gay-liberation-1972-81"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strong Love - Songs of Gay Liberation 1972-81</a></i>, and reappears here as well. Though nowhere near as overt as something like ""Piss Slave"", ""Strong Love"" is just as nervy and compelling, an anthem for gay love carried by Smokey's sneering, louche vocals. It's a song that serves as the quintessence of Smokey's appeal and ability, one you could see being released today and still shifting the paradigm, at least a little bit. Luckily for us, the duo agreed in a recent <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/smokey-was-too-gay-for-the-70s-but-theyre-the-perfect-amount-of-gay-for-2015"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> that there was a possibility for new music from Smokey in the future, now that <i>How Far Will You Go?</i> is out; let's just hope it doesn't take another 35 years before that's unearthed, too.</span></p></div>"|20660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20660-how-far-will-you-go-the-sm-recordings-1973-81/|7.5|Eric Torres

<p>Not a traditionalist by any stretch, Douglas has recorded with electronic musicians throughout his career, most recently with his group, Keystone, but also as far back as the 1997 live album <i>Sanctuary</i>. High Risk's self-titled debut album has a distinct character that sets it apart from those releastes, though. In the past, Douglas's work with electronics has often involved DJs and performers—DJ Olive, Ikue Mori, Jamie Saft, to name a few—that used samplers, record players, and electronic percussion to manipulate recorded sounds. Nestled into ensembles that were driven by more traditional instrumentation, these musicians created elastic textures that augmented the chaotic and improvisatory nature of the music.</p>
<p>High Risk is much more serene and meditative. The quartet—which also includes drummer Mark Guiliana and bassist Jonathan Maron—blends rhythm, melody, and atmosphere in equal measure. The musicians drift seamlessly between implied and solid grooves, with Saginaw adding drones, percussive loops, and live effect processing. There are no chording instruments like piano or guitar. Instead, it's Saginaw who provides the music's harmonic grounding via a series of static keyboard loops and sampled textures. His contributions are often reverb drenched and ethereal—think the dreamiest moments of '80s ECM records re-interpreted via Ableton Live and digital sound processing.</p>
<p>Over the course of the album's seven compositions, the quartet hit on a number of fusion jazz touchstones—<i>On the Corner-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a> (""Household Item""), the Headhunters (""Etiquette""), John Hassel's Fourth World music (""High Risk""), and even the mellow minimalism of Chicago post-rock ensemble, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>. But even though the music shifts style and perspective, the mood is uniform and singular. </p>
<p><i>High Risk </i>is not so much an album of jazz augmented by electronic instrumentation, but an album performed by players that are very conscious of and interested in electronic music. It's not just Saginaw dithering with a laptop, but also Guiliana mimicking delay trails on his kit or emulating the oddball swing of chopped and spliced rhythms. Over top, Douglas' playing is generally very mellow—reinforcing the ambient and meditative aspects of the music.</p>
<p>It's a special challenge to perform jazz—or perform among jazz musicians—while using electronics. Unlike a saxophone or piano, there's no defined role for a laptop, synthesizer, or sampler. Your presence is always experimental. More importantly, if you're a musician coming from a dance music background, you're typically arriving from a very exacting and non-group oriented form of composition.</p>
<p>So, it's a credit to Saginaw that he can hang in there with musicians who have spent the majority of their careers as free improvisers. High Risk's music values stasis over sudden shifts, but by slotting in a loop or processing the playing of his bandmates, Saginaw often manages to steer the mood of compositions and also create a sense of dialog with his bandmates. It's slo-mo, but spontaneous.</p></div>"|20652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20652-high-risk/|7.6|Aaron Leitko

His Columbia debut <i>Coming Home</i> deftly recalls all the well-bronzed giants of soul—your Aretha, your Otis, and especially, in Bridges' case, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9333-sam-cooke/"">Sam Cooke</a>. This kind of soul revival, brought over the last decade by places like <a href=""http://daptonerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daptone Records</a> and artists like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30335-alabama-shakes/"">Alabama Shakes</a>, the late <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"">Amy Winehouse</a> and others, has been almost universally embraced by (mostly older, white) music fans. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-93593543-2278-e0a2-e248-1cc8b74c3146""><span>(Bridges commented on this phenomenon recently in The Guardian, saying</span><span> ""I have a song called ""</span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXmIm6Bq3Tc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brown Skinned Girl</a>""</span><span>, and I ask 'Where my brown-skinned girls at?' And there's maybe one or two in the crowd. It's a little awkward sometimes.""</span><span>) Regardless of skin tone, fans of classic R&amp;B will dig this album as it wholly echoes the tropes we associate with the genre: Tons of reverb, backing female singers, organ, complementary horn arrangements, doo-wops, ballads, songs of love, loss and pretty girls who can shake that thing across several municipalities.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In other hands, this could be the eHow entry for ""How to make a retro soul record"". But Bridges has the talent and respect for the genre not to ham it up. Thanks to a backing band featuring Josh Block and Austin Jenkins of Austin-based utility players <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5577-white-denim/"">White Denim</a> (whose 2013 album <i>Corsicana Lemonade</i> deserves your attention), the tunes sound equally timeless and consistent. Bridges can sing magnificently, and has the obvious Sunday choir-honed chops. There is an appealing gentleness to his voice, and to his record, that sets him somewhat apart.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are some annoyances, however. Nostalgia is one thing, but true artists find a way to interject themselves into their music even if they're paying homage to a classic genre (Bridges would do well to revisit the work of labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14945-raphael-saadiq/"">Raphael Saadiq</a>, who did classic soul with his own unique spin). While he obviously has good intentions, at times, Bridges can't help but come off as an imitator. There's rarely any urgency in this album, even when he's promising a lost love that he would literally swim the Mississippi River to get her back (""Better Man""). Therein lies the main issue with <i>Coming Home</i>. Unlike the legends who inspired Bridges by squeezing every last drop of feeling out of their voices—Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, or even gospel heavyweights like the late Rev. James Cleveland—the emotion on the album never fully heats up past ""Yeah, I'm pretty keen about my record being sold in this Starbucks, thanks for asking!""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Speaking of Cooke, he said it best: ""As a singer grows older, his conception grows a little deeper, because he lives life and he understands what he is trying to say a little more."" Bridges is just starting out and there are enough signs on </span><i>Coming Home</i><span> that he's only going to get better. Songs like ""Lisa Sawyer"" (a deeply specific ballad dedicated to his mother), display why he's already getting looks from the likes of Jools Holland and why his recent Chicago gig at the legendary Green Mill had potential ticket-buyers in a frenzy once the event sold out. On the title track, Bridges sets out on his own path, using the spirits—the ones celebrated on Sunday morning at church, as well as the ones consumed on Saturday night in the juke joints—as his guide. While it's a little early in that journey, he has enough sheer talent that you want to stick around to see it all finally come together.</span></p></div>"|20725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20725-coming-home/|7.0|Ernest Wilkins

The songs are not overworked: the choruses do not explode, they merely unfurl. Her near-perfect major-label debut, 2013's <i>Same Trailer Different Park</i>, positioned her as something akin to the country <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>—the hyperbole was that she could save country music from itself. Musgraves stands in comically stark relief to some of her CMA-hoisting peers, and her ascendance does certainly feel corrective at a time when bro-country's red cup runneth over with EDM's structural dynamics, NRA talking points, and ""rapping."" She's hailed as a new model, one seemingly reverse-engineered from Nashville's Top 40: a perpetually stoned real girl, fixating on fine '70s countrypolitan flourishes and focusing on self-acceptance.</p>
<p>Musgraves grew up rural and working class in East Texas and firmly orients herself as someone not-that-far removed from a small town fate. Country, historically, espouses <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1oQiRdoPc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nothin'-fancy humility</a>, but in 2015, these qualities are often illustrated by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auFlxXFV9M4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">naming things</a>—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9j5G-FdSpk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cheap beer</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbhNLOQaW3g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old trucks</a>—that signify one's down-homeness. Mainstream country is currently a few years deep into a circa-2004 hip-hop problem, where recitation of the familiar nouns of late-stage capitalism stand as totems, or replace narrative altogether (instead of ""I slang in my white tee,"" it's ""White picket fence house on this dirt."") The exactitude of purchasing power and status is being GPS'd at all times. The lone examples of this behavior on <i>Pageant Material</i> are a citation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a> (who duets on his own lovely ""Are You Sure""), the invocation of a room shared with Gram Parsons' ghost on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"", and the title track double-entendre of ""the only Crown is in my glass."" When Musgraves sings ""Just 'cause it don't cost a lot/ Don't mean it's cheap,"" on ""Dime Store Cowgirl"" it's as much a personal thesis about simple values as a repudiation of the economy around her.</p>
<p>Musgraves' ""not""-ness is the pivot point of her artistic identity. Her songs exude a relaxed resonance because they have a lot less to prove. They feel personal, and you can locate Musgraves the artist in them (""And if I end up goin' down in flames/ Well, at least I know I did it my own way""). Mainstream country often poses an Us vs. Them chasm meant to alienate those who cannot identify with the lifestyle or values represented; for Musgraves, openness and acceptance are the paradigm. She rejects the mandates of Top 40, but maintains the hallmarks of country tradition, which makes liking her work easy and exacting critique tricky. A lot of country is about singing about what you aren't (or rather ""ain't"")—which she does often here, and most potently on the title track. One of the remarkable things about Musgraves is not how much she has deviated from country norms, but the way she expands them.</p>
<p>The most obvious way, and the one that press and the public have latched onto, is the feminist-at-her-liberty narratives with songs (most of which are co-written by her producers, Luke Laird and Shane McAnally, who were also behind the boards on<i> Same Trailer</i>). While this is worth noting and celebrating, in Musgraves' case it's overstated simplification, one that continually pits her as a straw(wo)man against the easy villainy of bro country™, instead of within a canon that spans from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKleTa94dC8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kitty Wells' ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels""</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgylOni0JSI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loretta Lynn's ""Fist City""</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB7ONnfIjaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Miranda Lambert's ""Kerosene""</a>. With <i>Pageant Material </i>there is less good-for-the-gander agenda than anticipated. Musgraves is confident and self-contained, but she's not measuring herself against anyone's standards but her own (the Big Machine-subtweeting ""Good 'Ol Boys Club"", and its chaser, ""Cup of Tea""), an idea that she references on most every song on the album. But under the microscope it's more than confidence, it's more than self-help self-love maxims. It's a disregard of the system; it's shrugging off the mantle of Southern Girlhood (""I'd rather lose for what I am/ Than win for what I ain't"" she sings on the title track).</p>
<p>And unlike many in her cohort, Musgraves doesn't hoist herself up as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3rgj39cKpU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a bad girl</a>. Not because she isn't one, but because in her world that dichotomy doesn't exist. Instead she spends much of the record refusing the obligation to a good reputation (""Biscuits"", ""Late to the Party"", or boasting ""I'm always higher than my hair"" on ""Pageant Material""). She celebrates an authentic self expression above all—Musgraves' tendentious <i>real</i>ness is what lends the album its quiet politics.</p>
<p>Tussling with her persona is fun and engaging work, but it's Musgraves' songcraft that provides the <i>whoa </i>moments. She has the ability to shift a phrase—like ""family is family"" or ""you can take me out of the country, but you can't take the country out of me""—out of cliche and into poignancy, or hell, even into something deep. She can pin 10 of these plainspoken lines back-to-back, without ever straining the song or its narrative or appearing to do any hard work at all. Her ability to pair song to sentiment is fairly flawless.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pageant Material</i> is a bit smoother than <i>Same Trailer</i> and musically there is less to grab on to. The album's maudlin center—the triptych of ""Somebody to Love"", ""Miserable"", and ""Die Fun""—gives it some gravitas. Her voice on these world-weary bits, especially the impeccably crafted ""Miserable"", give the album some of the heft it could use a little more of. It's an easy listen that clocks its 14 tracks swiftly, and can feel a little lightweight on repeated listens.</p>
<p>The binary of ""good"" country vs. ""bad"" is one we'd be wise to retire, and is the wrong narrative to frame a songwriter of Musgraves' caliber. She remixes all that we might call corny and shopworn in other, less deft hands. She's making gold records in service to small-town DGAF burner girls who managed to half get their shit together. Which is a truly strange universe for a pop star to be working in—nestling in with the ex-Swiftie fuck-up fringe, young women imagining beyond the dead ends and expectations set before them. While much of women's work in mainstream pop is hung up on pleasure (still important!) and what disposable income nets them (ditto), Musgraves is musing in a more quotidian slog of struggle and acceptance—the work of the self. It's a strange and forgiving album, less toothsome than the ones that preceded it, but Musgraves' resistance makes this album important, even when it's imperfect.</p></div>"|20679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20679-pageant-material/|8.0|Jessica Hopper

But it brings a further depth and resonance to territory that will be familiar to longtime fans, and it's vivid enough to serve as an entry point for those new to his work. For a veteran like Thompson, it's hard to ask for more than that.</p>
<p>Recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a> at his Loft Studio in Chicago—Tweedy also contributes backing guitar and vocals on some tracks—<i>Still </i>feels extremely present and immediate. There's no studio frosting; it's like listening to Thompson and his band perform directly in front of you with no other noise or distractions. (Considering the many overwrought production missteps of the Mitchell Froom years of his career, roughly 1986-1996, Thompson has no doubt learned that spare production allows the unique beauty of his guitar work, solos that thread through the songs like copper wire, and the quality of his songwriting to shine.) The folk backbone that Thompson has carried from his initial background with Fairport Convention is still strong and evident on tracks like ""She Never Could Resist a Winding Road"", and he plays musically with the historical connections between British folk, Appalachian folk, and the blues on ""Patty Don't You Put Me Down"".</p>
<p>The characters in Thompson's songwriting are always struggling, never satisfied. They squabble, they leave, they ache, they are hollow, they frustrate one another, and they are unbelievably cruel to one another. This makes the occasional moment of tenderness and empathy, when written with honesty, seem less maudlin or manipulative than genuine. ""No Peace, No End"" is ferocious, all teeth and claws. Much in the tradition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd3vsmWhYWI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Al Bowlly's in Heaven""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phjuu_geAcg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gethsemane""</a>, two personal-political classics from Thompson's oeuvre, it's about the scars of war on both the soldier and the world around him. ""Broken Doll"" uses the incredibly heavy-handed imagery of a doll that can't be mended to describe a woman who has endured unnamed and unspeakable trauma, but as Thompson's male protagonist struggles to love a woman who hurts immensely because she deserves it and does not ask any reward for himself for doing so—material that in less deft hands would cause immediate and permanent eyerolling—he finds a bloody sincerity that makes the song stark, real, and kind.</p>
<p>The gender dynamics of Thompson's songs can arch toward the uncomfortable territory of Troubled Women Toying With Men, or Troubled Women As Romantic And Uncomplicated Objects, but his male protagonists are always presented as just as flawed as his females, and there's always an air of deep self-deprecation. In ""All Buttoned Up"", a woman refuses to fuck her male partner for reasons unknown, and he's incredibly pissed off about it, but he stays with her —because she's really great otherwise, and he cares about her.</p>
<p>The biggest weak spot on <i>Still</i> is his throwaway goofball song—in the tradition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJFwfWSsXEg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Left Feet""</a>, ""My Daddy Is a Mummy"", and other such live crowd-pleasers, it's a song about a pirate with the misfortune to actually be named ""Long John Silver"". ""Beatnik Walking"", in which Thompson pokes gentle fun at himself and his loyal fanbase (grown-up original hippies and jazz fanatics), is much lighter and more enjoyable, as is ""Guitar Heroes"", an ode to the artists who shaped Thompson's style and to the love of the instrument itself. One clunker on an album full of gems doesn't drag everything else down, though, and Thompson deserves all our respect—he's been through the major-label wringer, found his place where he can be celebrated as he deserves among his independent fans, and is still making complicated, thoughtful, intricate, resonant music on his own terms many decades deep into his career.</p></div>"|20682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20682-still/|7.5|Jes Skolnik

Underoath and Anberlin often framed their devotionals in the more general language of emotional or physical apocalypse. Philadelphia five-piece mewithoutYou were signed to Tooth &amp; Nail in the mid-2000s, but their spiritual qualities are introspective and intersectional; lyricist Aaron Weiss draws together Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions, forming an intricate, collagist cosmology through which he relates to God.</p>
<p>Weiss' lyrics on <i>Pale Horses</i>, mewithoutYou's first album for punk label <a href=""http://www.runforcoverrecords.com/home.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Run for Cover</a>, detail his struggles with the densities of language and the inward mutations of faith, which writer John Jeremiah Sullivan once characterized as ""a logical door which locks behind you."" ""I've just been thinking and reading more about language and words and how hard their meanings are to pin down—even simple words, let alone complex, lofty ones that I've long since been fascinated with,"" Weiss said <a href=""https://myspace.com/article/2015/6/8/mewithoutyous-aaron-weiss-opens-up-about-his-lack-of-spiritual-confidence"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in an interview with Myspace</a> posted a few weeks ago. ""So I sort of questioned my ability to communicate anything worthwhile. If I'm not sure that I'm going to say something that's going to help anybody or say anything that's true, then I might as well make it sound pretty.""</p>
<p>The imagery on<i> Pale Horses</i> offers generous doses of apocalypse, drawing largely from Revelation 6, in which seven seals are broken and generate the end of the world; in one verse, Death materializes on a pale horse. In the song ""Red Cow"", ""green figs fall from the Nebraska sky""; in the Book of Revelation, this is an analogy for stars unscrewing from the depths of space. <i>Pale Horses</i> also absorbs several modernist texts; in the same Myspace interview Weiss mentions the influence of James Joyce, which contributes a kind of unconscious and shattering rhythm to his writing. ""Here again the chords clash,"" Weiss sings at the start of ""Watermelon Ascot"", reshaping a line in Ezra Pound's ""Sestina: Altaforte"", and through the rest of the verse (""Again the half-past/ Carrie Nation cut glass/ Prohibition children of the have caste"") his internal and associative rhyming begins to simulate the inversions and precise orbits of Pound's poetry. On previous albums Weiss tended to communicate through analogy and parable; on <i>Pale Horses </i>his words and references collapse on each other like glass in a mosaic, only obtaining sense and meaning after they've fallen together.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Pale Horses</i> functions as a kind of career summary, compressing their musical digressions into a coherent whole. It's also their first album recorded by Will Yip, who this year recorded dreamier, gauzier records by otherwise formally punk bands <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/"">Title Fight</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32853-turnover/"">Turnover</a>. To <i>Pale Horses</i> he mainly contributes a concussive drum sound reminiscent of the snares on Nirvana's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/""><i> In Utero</i></a>, where individual hits resemble the burst of a paper bag. The songs are motivated more by groove than any individual riff or melody, anchored by bass and drums around which guitars pulse in uneasy constellations. Under these conditions, songs tend to expand and change shape, often ending in places more aggressive and primal from which they began.</p>
<p>The final track on <i>Pale Horses</i>, ""Rainbow Signs"", begins gently and glacially, Weiss barely whispering over soft bruises of guitar. It ends with a guitar riff that metaphorically and physically peels away the earth, lifting out of the track like a cathedral through a desert floor. ""The sky, I'd been told/ Will roll up like a scroll,"" Weiss screams, and you could almost mistake his voice for a bloom of static. ""The sun will turn black as a dead raven's back/ But there's nowhere to hide from the judge's face."" But after the world recedes in a dense cloud of scripture, Weiss ends the record in a very personal and opaque place, with a dream of him and his deceased father, consciously merged and inwardly telling an intimate, unexplained joke about the Bible. It's one of the few completely successful and uncompromised methods of communication between people: An inside joke.</p></div>"|20688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20688-pale-horses/|7.2|Brad Nelson

Instead, it owed more to the flannelled, blue-collar sensibilities of the small factory towns outside of the city, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain"">Kurt Cobain</a>’s native Aberdeen, which helps account for why it resonated not only with tastemakers but also ordinary, meat-and-potato rock fans. T. Hardy Morris has long been fascinated by grunge's backwoods roots. ""It was rural music,"" the singer/guitarist contended in <a href=""http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/let-the-theme-reveal-itself-t-hardy-morris-on-grun.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent profile</a>, likening it to the sounds he grew up with in Georgia. ""It’s kind of like Southern rock.""</p>
<p>For the last decade, Morris has explored the parallels between grunge and Southern rock with his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27047-dead-confederate"">Dead Confederate</a>, though both styles sometimes took a backseat to that group’s stoner-rock tendencies. Recently, Morris has also been dabbling in side projects a good deal less gloomy than his primary band, recording a couple of LPs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5492-deer-tick/"">Deer Tick</a>’s Robbie Crowell and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a>’ Ian Saint Pé as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30377-diamond-rugs"">Diamond Rugs</a>, in addition to a pair of solo albums that play like mirror images of each other. Where Morris’s inaugural solo effort, 2013’s <i>Audition Tapes</i>, was a relatively sedated singer-songwriter affair, seeped in the weeping pedal steels and confessional spirit of so many Nashville records, <i>Drownin on a Mountaintop</i> is its temperamental opposite—wild, prickly, and unsentimental. The twang remains, but this time grunge and punk are the driving impulses.</p>
<p>As Morris tells it, fatherhood inspired <i>Mountaintop</i>’s rowdier sound. He rushed to finish the record before the birth of his first daughter, and it beats with the urgency of a man trying to purge some final youthful bad decisions from his system before it’s wholly irresponsible to do so. On song after song, Morris casts himself as a fuck up at best and a menace at worst—a trope he borrows from outlaw country, though unlike a true rebel, Morris can’t stop his thoughts from cycling back to the toll of his actions and the example he’s setting. He presents the album’s booziest, blusteriest song ""Likes of Me"" as a cautionary tale for his imagined children. ""Maybe I can scare you silly not to do the things I’ve done,"" he seethes maniacally, matching the song’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/""><i>In Utero</i></a>-sized stop/start riff with Cobain’s curdled yowl. On Dead Confederate’s first records, Morris was sometimes overeager to play up the echoes of Cobain in his voice, but over time his has developed its own character. Where Cobain’s croak was deliberate and authoritative, Morris’s is rangy and conniving. Even when he’s being earnest, he sounds like a grifter making a hard sell.</p>
<p>Unimpeded by the austere, psychedelic stretches that weigh down Dead Confederate’s albums,<i> Mountaintop</i> gives Morris’s voice ample space to roam, and it’s a thrill to hear him cut loose. That unbridled spirit comes at a cost, though, since <i>Mountaintop</i>’s loosest songs are so lackadaisically written they fall apart. With <i>Audition Tapes</i>, Morris penned considered tributes to the childhood friends he’d left behind, but there’s little of that depth here. Too many lyrics read like they were scribbled during between-take cigarette breaks. On ""Starting Gun"", he sets up the album’s shittiest pun: ""See that clock up on the wall? I wound it up, and it ticked me off."" A couple tracks later on ""Littleworth"" he grabs at the nearest adage, musing ""It may sound lazy but the truth hurts,"" and, as cautioned, it does sound lazy. The thrashing title track offers an even blunter commentary on how thinly written it is. ""What the hell is going on,"" Morris marvels after the chorus, ""How can you call this a song?""</p>
<p>There are two types of clumsy lyrics: Ones that pass with limited damage, and ones so invasive they bring entire songs to a halt. It’s those latter ones that Morris steers into again and again, which is unfortunate, since otherwise his crash fusion of grunge and country has never sounded better than it does on <i>Mountaintop</i>. He’s got the attitude down pat, but he doesn’t always have the songs to back it up.</p></div>"|20715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20715-hardy-the-hardknocks-drownin-on-a-mountaintop/|6.0|Evan Rytlewski

A collaboration with Icelandic performance artist Ragnar Kjartansson, <i>A Lot of Sorrow </i>wasn’t intended as a physical endurance test, but a study in the evolving emotional tenor of a work stretched to its limits: National frontman Matt Berninger <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1360811/the-nationals-matt-berninger-on-trouble-will-find-me-that-six-hour-moma-performance-and-going-back-on-the-road/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described</a> its aim as “reaching a different sort of euphoric, mantra-like state.” Releasing the entire performance in a box set composed of nine clear LPs, however, strips away the sad communion of the original Sunday afternoon show, leaving just the listener and approximately 105 iterations of “Sorrow”, spanning six hours, five minutes.</p>
<p>“Sorrow” is the second track on the National’s fifth album, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/""><i>High Violet</i></a>, and one of the few moments of joy on that fraught, scared record. “[It’s] about a person’s love affair with his own sadness,” Berninger has <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/matt-berninger-of-the-national-41019"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. “Sadness is not always the worst feeling. Sometimes it’s a really pleasurable thing to be overwhelmed with sadness.” It works beautifully: <i>High Violet</i> marked the point when Berninger started reaching for livelier vocal harmonies, but his helpless, heavy monotone on “Sorrow” is the perfect forlorn center, caught between resisting sanctuary while craving its embrace. The band anchor him there: Bryan Devendorf’s drums are a subtle hiss with a ‘60s girl group dimple, while guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner, and bassist Scott Devendorf modulate between three richly thrumming chords.</p>
<p>The luxurious purgatory that Berninger sings about in “Sorrow” is a crucial part of the National’s appeal, which <i>A Lot of Sorrow </i>tests. Every fan wants to believe that they have a special relationship with their favorite band—that they can access something within their work that others could never see—so choosing to engage fully with this kind of project is predicated on the hope that it would induce some kind of transcendent state. (Or, masochism.) But it is <i>a lot</i>—even for a card-carrying National devotee who’s seen them play 25 times in six years, who can’t make it through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/""><i>Alligator</i></a> without listening to “Baby, We’ll Be Fine” a dozen times straight, or <i>High Violet</i> without lingering on “Lemonworld” for half an hour. I enjoyed an hour of it through headphones on the way home to the suburbs, half-drunk after a <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a> show (a very National way to listen to the National), and did the remaining five hours in one go, partially while laying prone on the floor, and soon felt in need of a cold shower.</p>
<p>But <i>A Lot of Sorrow</i> clearly isn’t intended as a consumer item to be placed on your turntable in solemn, linear fashion, which justifies asking what it is for, divorced from its live, physical origins. This release exemplifies pretty much everything that the National’s detractors hate about them, which is rarely just their indulgently sad music. The Ohio-born five-piece are the best dressed straw men in the business, making people bristle at the idea of identifying with the ascendant, middle-class Brooklynite angst of their records. At any rate, it’s a social strata you’d probably have to occupy to afford a copy: sets cost $198 + a hefty postage charge (with all profits benefitting Partners In Health). A week prior to release, the 1500-edition run <a href=""http://thenational.sandbaghq.com/the-national-a-lot-of-sorrow-boxset.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hadn't sold out</a> yet.</p>
<p>There’s nothing quite as serious as a dead-weight of clear vinyl, yet the existence of <i>A Lot Of Sorrow </i>feels like a cosmic joke, both at the expense of the band’s self-seriousness (an image they’ve been trying to shed with their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpz_gUyImhw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg5geyUlU4Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50397-review-the-national-film-mistaken-for-strangers/""><i>Mistaken For Strangers</i></a> documentary), and of those who would accuse them of having made an entire career out of playing the same song over and over. If it weren’t for <i>A Lot Of Sorrow</i>'s artistic origins, you could almost interpret it as elegantly weaponized monotony, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Mark Kozelek</a>’s prolific prosaicness, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> apparently dumping his entire hard drive on Soundcloud after releasing his first album in 13 years. You want blood? We got it.</p>
<p>But much as it’s exhausting and unrealistic to absorb in one go, as much a millstone as a symbolic <i>objet d’art</i>, <i>A Lot of Sorrow</i> rewards patience in the most literal fashion. (Another inadvertent joke at the perception that everything the National make is “a grower”…) “I don’t wanna get over you”, Berninger sings in a faint plea every time, an Old Testament pop trope that works as an act of self-preservation and insurance against the responsibility of being the one who has to change. It’s a voluntary slow-death sentence, which he bears stoically throughout the six hours: joking, singing with a mouth full of sandwich halfway through Side O (Kjartansson brought them food and drinks throughout), and saying they’ll have to start over after he coughs during a chorus.</p>
<p>It’s only at the end of Side Q, around the 95th take, that Berninger breaks down. He gasps halfway through “sorrow’s a girl inside my cake” before missing a line and crying, having lost his nerve because he couldn’t see his wife and daughter in the crowd. His live performances are frequently marked by a frightening volatility, and he often openly declares that he needs <i>someone</i> in song, but he’s rarely vulnerable like this. Guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner and the band's backing musicians take the lead on vocals (and the crowd joins in), and Bryan Devendorf intuits that he should sit this one out.</p>
<p>Throughout, the unspoken conversation between the band is mesmeric: early on they play more muted versions, like steady long-distance runners. They never break between songs—there’s always that hissing drumbeat or a steady guitar line to guide the transition—and the Dessners constantly experiment with different textures. Sometimes the guitar parts swing like slack machinery; later they tremble with the seismic presence of a Richard Serra sculpture, shriek like birds, and swell drunkenly. I didn’t see the original performance, and had wondered if it might mirror <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>’s <i>Disintegration Loops</i>, fading as energy and morale grew dim, but the ceaseless invention here keeps the song alive.</p>
<p>We’re often curious about how a band—and particularly the singer—can remain engaged with the circumstances that originally informed their music night after night. Not that it’s the most apt reference, but perhaps it’s worth remembering the part of Katy Perry’s <i>Part of Me</i> documentary where she emerges beaming on stage seconds after crying over the breakdown of her marriage. After over 100 renditions of “Sorrow”, the National still sound close to its emotional heart, rather than inured to it. No naysayer will be converted by this completely absurd artifact, but it’s a moving manifestation of the relationship that fans have with any band that means anything to them, playing their songs over and over to tempt the point where the magic fades away. <i>A Lot of Sorrow</i> is a strange achievement and vindication. Stay down, champions, stay down.</p></div>"|20511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20511-a-lot-of-sorrow/|7.2|Laura Snapes

Ryan Lott—the film- and dance-score composer, former ad-music man, and mastermind of Son Lux since the <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">2008</span> release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11178-at-war-with-walls-mazes/""><i>At War with Walls &amp; Mazes</i></a>—has never been one to go it alone. He’s a constant collaborator, whether it be with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54209-listen-lorde-and-son-lux-easy-switch-screens/"">Lorde</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55058-boots-releases-winterspringsummerfall-mixtape-featuring-beyonce-kelela-jeremih-son-lux-shlohmo/"">Boots</a>, Shara Worden of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"">My Brighest Diamond</a>, or teaming up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti"">Serengeti</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19199-sisyphus-sisyphus/""><i>Sisyphus</i></a>. To tour the material from Son Lux’s previous full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18639-son-lux-lanterns/""><i>Lanterns</i></a>, Lott put together a three-piece band that included guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30784-rafiq-bhatia/"">Rafiq Bhatia</a> and drummer Ian Chang, and the trio parlayed their onstage chemistry into recording sessions for <i>Bones</i>.</p>
<p>Becoming a real-deal band hasn’t radically changed Son Lux. Lott’s vocals are still unmistakeable in their brittle breathiness, and the songs still come across like the multi-layered electronic manifestations of a classically trained pianist who studied composition in college but can’t suppress his inner beatmaker. But the collaboration with Bhatia and Chang—not to mention vocal contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17470-moses-sumney-seeds/"">Moses Sumney</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6823-dm-stith/"">DM Stith</a>, Hanna Benn, <a href=""http://ww2.kqed.org/pop/2015/04/09/holychild-talk-their-apple-watch-commercial-the-bay-area-and-more/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holychild</a>’s Liz Nistico, Daughter’s Elena Tonra and others—perceptibly aerates the Son Lux sound. Lott has a tendency to pile his influences in a way that can sometimes feel suffocating, like confetti crammed into a party popper, and on <i>Bones</i>, his bandmates pulled the string while also adding their own crinkled strips of color to the explosion. It’s not unlike the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a> are unmistakably Dave Longstreth’s project, but his talented bandmates are crucial to presenting his vision.</p>
<p>It tends to be the words that trip up Lott. He rarely writes traditionally structured songs, and he tends to go the mantra route with the words, to varying degrees of success. On <i>Bones</i><span>, though, the questions he poses have never been more pertinent. “Are we now what we’ll be? Are we fixed or free?” he asks on “Flight.” </span><i>Bones</i> is obsessed with exploring whether we can change our station and how or when to sound the alarm. There’s an undercurrent of class warfare and oppression, but <i>Bones</i> is not a protest album. These aren’t Occupy anthems or the soundtrack to protests in Ferguson or Charleston. Lott isn’t railing against a specific tragedy. It’s more general, and it can apply to your issue of choice. Lott merely realizes that it’s time to start railing.</p>
<p><i>Bones</i> soundtracks those moments or days or months or years when it feels like something isn’t right, and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep it all at arm’s length. Even for someone whom Lott calls “the most fortunate one,” it’s hard to stare at injustice, abuse, oppression, or just plain-old apathy and not be stirred to action—or, rather, stirred to <i>thinking</i> about action. Because that’s the emotion this album captures—that moment in between ignorance and action, when you know you should do something, and you just might.</p>
<p>“Am I the only one? Where are the others?” Lott sings, then concludes “I am the others.” It feels like things are about to get real. “We have the lungs and we have the air to shout,” he says, “...but we don’t.” It’s a downer, and it gets worse on “White Lies”, which starts soft and pretty despite ominous lyrics (“They take hold of our young/ They cut out our tongue”), then turns into a dark, industrial rave for the last minute. Given Lott’s film-scoring background, it’s easy to imagine the song’s coda soundtracking a scene set in a stroboscopic club from some tyrannical, dystopian future. And yet Son Lux hasn’t given up. “Your Day Will Come” lyrically reprises the opening track: “Close your eyes/ Swallow the sun/ You have only just begun.” Darkness may cover the outside world, but inside, hope is brewing.</p>
<p>Son Lux’s avant-pop has always leaned more heavily on avant than pop, and <i>Bones</i> is probably too skittery for a breakout commercial hit (though “Change is Everything” could be a dark horse). Given the album’s staccato beats, bronchitis vocals, strings that may not be strings, flutes that probably aren’t flutes, unexpected blasts of horn-like sounds that couldn’t possibly be horns, it’s not an album you can sing along to from front to back, and given the subject matter, it probably shouldn’t be. Sometimes knowing that you’re about to sing is enough.</p></div>"|20687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20687-bones/|7.2|Joel Oliphint

He has a bleeding heart, a big voice right out of musical theatre, and a pair of #1 singles under his belt. His band, fun., is one of those subversion-free mainstream rock bands—think Imagine Dragons or Mumford and Sons—to become chart staples during Obama’s presidency, which must undoubtedly perturb Kid Rock types prone to caterwauling about how rock stars used to kick ass. (If it helps, Ruess wrote “We Are Young” after getting kicked out of a cab for being too drunk.) Now, after a decade of performing with bands like fun. and the Format, Ruess has recorded a solo album that presents him as both soulful troubadour and arena hero—equal parts Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen—with mixed returns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Grand Romantic</i><span> comes with less fanfare than the debut album from fun. guitarist Jack Antonoff, who benefited from generous pre-release hype perhaps owing to his status as one-half of a power couple with “Girls” creator Lena Dunham. Antonoff’s album, recorded as Bleachers, was musically capable, but his voice wouldn’t stick out at a cocktail party. Ruess’s voice is milk and honey, on the other hand, but his song selection is comparably generic. </span><i>Grand Romantic</i><span>’s default mode is pro forma stadium rock: booming drums, moments of piano-driven clarity before some string-driven hurrah, perfunctory “la la”s and “na na” harmonies, a key change on a chorus or bridge that lets us know he’s <i>really going for it. </i>The marriage of Ruess’ vocal theatrics to Antonoff’s ear for layered songwriting brings otherwise-mundane sentiments (</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>being young is great</span></a><span>; </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQkBeOisNM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>so is going out at night</span></a><span>) within reach of transcendence. Apart, they lack definition.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ruess calls himself a grand romantic, but he’s weathered enough heartbreak to be reasonable about what the world holds. “I think that the album is very romantic, but not in some sort of overt buying-flowers-for-someone type of way,” he told </span><a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/2180062/nate-ruess-grand-romantic-stream/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>MTV</span></a><span>. That’s a funny thing to say about an album whose lead single is “Nothing Without Love”—opening line: “I am nothing without love”—but contrary to his stadium rock instincts, Ruess is more convincing with the lights dimmed. The balladry of “Take It Back” is wrapped around a tortured guitar solo played by Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, while Beck pops in for an adult contemporary duet on the country-tinged “What This World Is Coming To”. “Moment” offers a particularly tender vocal performance, with Ruess sounding so dejected about a failed entanglement you want to reach through the speakers and pat him on the head</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of the album was co-written with Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, veteran songwriters who’ve won awards working with stars like Kanye West, Lana Del Rey, Beyonce, and Taylor Swift. Ruess doesn’t have such an idiosyncratic personality, either as a pop star or a lyricist. (“Probably my biggest thing is that I just have a tough time sitting down and really committing to writing lyrics,” he tells </span><i><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nate-ruess-details-every-track-on-grand-romantic-solo-debut-20150610"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone</a></i><span>.) What he has is unflinching earnestness. He quotes E.E. Cummings like some beret-adorned fop on “AhHa”, and on “Brightside”, is completely unafraid to tell someone, ”I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes.” There’s no ponderous pose or hint of darkness like you’d get from Brandon Flowers or Julian Casablancas. His perspective is unapologetically,</span><span> blissfully unspecific, a GIF wall of the 28 Reasons Life Is Going To Be Okay. </span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-bef339c5-e33e-f31e-dbd3-0853be82241d""><span>That doesn’t make those lines about the Louvre go down any easier, but it helps you think of him as less a self-styled Great Man, and more a man who thinks the world can be great. “You Light My Fire” is a gloriously schmaltzy pop song replete with percussive xylophone plinks and hand claps—you can see Ruess mugging and snapping his fingers for “The Today Show” crowd. The title obviously recalls the Doors classic, but amusingly enough, Ruess wasn’t familiar with it. (To </span><i>Rolling Stone</i><span>: “People have lit a fire before. I'm sure it's not big deal."") Where Jim Morrison moaned about having extremely mysterious sex, Ruess goes complete cornball, bopping to and fro about this girl who revs him up. It’s a little goofy, and absolutely over-the-top, but he sounds natural—a welcoming moment where his antics coalesce around an identifiable personality. It shows how Ruess might succeed on his own as a good-hearted Midwestern boy—not quite a star, but someone capable of appreciating their light. </span></span></p></div>"|20717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20717-grand-romantic/|5.5|Jeremy Gordon

And so it's understandable to be skeptical of an all-male band named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33001-sorority-noise"" target=""_blank"">Sorority Noise</a><span>, often tagged as emo, making a song called “Art School Wannabe”. In it, Cameron Boucher sings in a nasal tone, pinpointing that post-pubescent sour spot where snark becomes an all-purpose defense mechanism against emotional disturbance. It bops along to a chipper shuffle that brings to mind, depending on your age and generosity, the Front Bottoms, mid-period </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a><span>, or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/327-ben-folds-five/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Folds Five</a><span>. But it also contains the lyric upon which the entirety of <i>Joy, Departed</i> hinges—“Maybe I’m just scared to admit that I might not be as dark as I think/ Maybe I’m not the person that I never wanted to be.”</span></p>
<p><span>On their 2014 debut </span><i><a href=""https://sororitynoise.bandcamp.com/album/forgettable"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forgettable</a></i><span>, Sorority Noise's pop-punk was so steeped in self-pity that the title felt like more of an epitaph than a punchline (“Nobody likes me/ That’s what I tell myself...I spent a lot of last year learning I don’t like me too”). </span><span>As indicated by ""Art School Wannabe"", </span><i>Joy, Departed</i><span> is motivated, above all, by a drive to get over your own bullshit, and this has become an emergent and necessary theme for other bands in its realm. A similar mindset serves as the basis for the near entirety of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32861-annabel"" target=""_blank"">Annabel</a><span>’s recently released </span><i><a href=""https://tinyengines.bandcamp.com/album/having-it-all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Having it All</a></i><span> and was touched upon on by </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball/"" target=""_blank"">Modern Baseball</a><span>'s “Two Good Things” and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31918-you-blew-it"" target=""_blank"">You Blew It!</a><span>’s “Better to Best”, both of whom contribute guest vocals on </span><i>Joy, Departed</i><span>. The Connecticut band also strains with ambition, and the most exciting thing about Sorority Noise and their ilk is that they’re courting a larger audience, reaching for something that seems to be out of their grasp. Both of these aspects can occasionally make </span><i>Joy, Departed</i><span> an uncomfortable listen, but they’re also the reason why it’s such a consistently engaging record.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last year, Sorority Noise have learned to channel their energy towards their arrangements, which have become more sophisticated, confident, well-produced and also more vertiginous in all aspects. </span><span>Boucher’s bedheaded vocals are contrasted against gorgeous, sighing strings on “Blissth” and “Fluorescent Black” and both build to soaring peaks that cruelly cut out, as if Sorority Noise temporarily forgot they were still an upstart emo band and were snapped back into reality out of their arena-rock dreams. “Your Soft Blood” has the gripping bombast of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes"" target=""_blank"">Bright Eyes</a><span> or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/874-cursive/"" target=""_blank"">Cursive</a><span> or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/388-max-bemis-say-anything"" target=""_blank"">Say Anything</a><span> from 2002-2004, projects where an untrained, verbose speaker is pulled between caustic punk and ornate chamber pop, fighting against the perception that they haven’t earned such grandiosity. </span></p>
<p><span>They haven't completely overlooked what worked on <i>Forgettable.</i> </span><span>The clean twee-punk center at the outset of “Corrigan” bravely holds as blaring fuzz guitars encroach in the chorus. During the verses of “Nolsey”, Boucher slumps around aimlessly like a </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC3y9llDXuM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teenage dirtbag</a><span>, before a surprising barbershop harmony leads into a glorious explosion of symphonic guitar.</span></p>
<p><span>The guitars tend to speak more directly than Boucher himself. Whereas Modern Baseball will just flat out admit to staying at home <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_1970165499""><span class=""aQJ"">on Friday</span></span> night, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYl46Jt-rbc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“wishing you were still my girlfriend,”</a><span>Boucher strives to find more convoluted, pungent ways to make the same point—he wants to be “the heroin that keeps you warm enough,” “the smoke too clear to see,” “in bloom for you.” Instead, he’s “the autumn wind that blows your hair and the hand that’s out of reach,” “a boathouse, alone on a lake,” and “the reason your leaves are withering.” It’s hard not to wince for a split second, but once the initial sting wears off, the underlying emotions are relatable. Much of</span><span> </span><i>Joy, Departed</i><span> </span><span>occupies an awkward space of figuring whether “love” means being of service or being validated, of wondering whether poetry enhances honesty or obscures it.</span></p>
<p>And yet it’s the fairly standard palm-mute/pedal-stomp dynamics of “Using” where Sorority Noise’s mania is most convincingly expressed. At the outset, Boucher gives into any number of things: pills, drugs, cigarettes, the like. It’s an inventory of self-negation until a group yell of, “I stopped wishing I was dead!""—the excitement of living again (or for once) expressed with redlining distortion, a surge of joy that’s so overwhelming and unfamiliar it still feels like rage. That lyric pops up a second time, during an ankle-breaking pivot to a new key.</p>
<p>Boucher claims it’s the first song that he wrote while trying to take ownership of the his battles with addiction and mental illness and turning it into something positive. After a friend recently committed suicide, <a href=""http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/sorority_noise_play_irresistible_grunge_pop_on_new_single_using_exclusive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told Alternative Press</a>, “Depression is not a trend...Stop glorifying sorrow and start lending a helping hand to those that need it the most.” You can tell it wasn’t the first song he wrote for <i>Joy, Departed</i> and that his revelation didn’t come easily: after “Using”, <i>Joy, Departed</i> concludes on its two most despairing tracks. It results in a perhaps unintentional but honest point about the fleeting nature of all emotions and that when the instinct for self-preservation kicks in, it should be grasped upon like a matter of life and death, because it may be exactly that.</p></div>"|20711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20711-joy-departed/|7.3|Ian Cohen

It was in many ways the period of spiritual incubation that’s allowed for the</span><span> sort of freer pop expressions of </span><i>Amanecer</i><span>. </span>Recorded between LA and Bogotá, <i>Amanecer</i> marks the first time Bomba Estéreo have worked with outside producers; chiefly Ricky Reed, who produced Jason Derulo’s “Talk Dirty” and worked on Pitbull’s <i>Globalization</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/bomba-estero"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">various</a> <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6576188/bomba-estereo-amanecer-listening-guide-track-by-track-ricky-reed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, Bomba’s core duo—vocalist Liliana Saumet and keyboardist/bassist Simón Mejía—have talked about creating an album with more “global” appeal. “Global,” in this case, seems to have meant a combination of glossier production; heftier, in-your-face poppiness; and moments that can justifiably be labeled EDM. This time, the Caribbean and Afro-Colombian elements of Bomba’s musical identity serve more often as accents than anchors. You can still hear the band’s particular brand of tropical bass though, which they call “tropical elegance”; it lives in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4980rwwAEtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tambor alegre</a> rhythms, the occasional <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpBpucgngOs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">champeta</a>-style guitar, the bass, of course. But ultimately, what propels the album is a new, more open sense of love.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a celebration, really. It feels a lot like a beachside party that begins late and goes early, moving from night to day, from clubbier dance tracks to poppier love songs. In that respect, </span><i>Amanecer</i><span>, meaning “dawn,” plays out like its title suggests. There’s a lot of variation within that transition as well. “Somos Dos”, a few tracks in, is essentially a sped-up </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/kizomba-zouk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>kizomba</span></a><span> number with a deep house vibe—kizomba being the slow, sensual Angolan popular music made for dancing </span><span>really</span><span> close. </span><span>On “</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPT90x5UzN8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Fiesta</span></a><span>”, by contrast, a Carnaval de Baranquilla parade comes crashing through. Carnival drums alternate with dubstep interludes, in a way that’s reminiscent of Dutch-Curaçaoan tropical rave band Kuenta i Tambú (K i T), though with less steam-rolling energy and more breathing room.</span></p>
<p>There is a sort of breeziness that buoys this album. The lyrics on “Voy”, like on much of the album, are simple but reflective, centering on love and partying, but also self-growth and positivity. And Saumet makes it a point to shout out her <span>hometown of Santa Marta and surrounding cities like Barranquilla. They’re Caribbean coastal centers that maintain strong ties to the Black Atlantic and African Diaspora, which the band actually seem to explore more on </span><i>Amanecer</i><span> than on past records. Sounds like </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iSgYI5d9P8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Colombian gaita flutes</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=shangaan%20electro""><span>shangaan electro</span></a><span>-esque kalimbas flicker in and out of the more mainstream musical framework.</span> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That wider musical palette strips down about halfway through, on the meditative and aptly titled “Algo Está Cambiando”—“Something is Changing.” Pop songs like “To’ My Love” and “Mar (Lo Que Siento)” daydream about possible futures with a lover. At times, the sweetness can verge on cloying, cheesy even (i.e. blippy lazer gun sounds, rote EDM drops). But Saumet’s sincerity makes up for it.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1bbb14df-1be8-95ce-4496-69deb4444264""><span>In fact, Saumet’s conviction does a lot of the emotional work on </span><i>Amanecer</i><span>, all the way through to the last moments: in a downtempo track reminiscent of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29582-chancha-via-circuito/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><span>Andean folktronica</span></a><span>, Saumet expresses a return to the earth. “Soy hija de la tierra,” she sings. </span><span>I’m the daughter of the earth.</span><span> “Tengo adentro lo que quiero.”</span><span> I have what I want within me.</span><span> Maybe it’s a foreshadowing of what’s to come for Bomba Estéreo, a return to their roots from their go at bigger pop.</span></span></p></div>"|20662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20662-amanecer/|6.8|Minna Zhou

This would be an issue if Oberst was using lines like, ""Now we're taking it back for the greater good/ Goddamn Robin Hoods"" and <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">""Freedom is not free/ Neither is apathy""</span> as a means of convincing listeners to vote in a primary election, draft a persuasive letter to their local representative, or go to law school. But <i>Payola</i> advocates chaining yourself to an ATM, taking a baseball bat to a limousine, and shouting every word at the nearest authority figure. And this makes Conor Oberst a writer of <i>awesome</i> punk rock lyrics.</p>
<p>It would appear that <i>Payola</i> is where Oberst's been storing the splenetic rage that fueled his most compelling work and has mostly gone missing since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/""><i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i></a>. But while <i>Payola</i> is his most urgent and angry work in a decade, it's by far his most fun record. Because really, it's his <i>only</i> fun record. This is the result of an important shift in a classic punk rock binary. On <i>Read Music/Speak Spanish</i>, Desaparecidos saw themselves in the lineage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash"">the Clash</a><span>—</span>a fair accusation as Oberst was months away from dropping his <i>Omaha Calling</i> magnum opus <i>Lifted</i> and Desaparecidos would later cover <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnc6ZBXCDk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spanish Bombs""</a>. Their songs were topical, idealistic and had no sense of humor whatsoever. Often singing in the same whole-body quaver as he did in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes"">Bright Eyes</a>, Oberst led you to believe these songs saw themselves as the actual solution to the suffocating, transactional nature of marriage, a spiritually broken American military, and the overabundance of Starbucks in Omaha. </p>
<p><i>Payola</i> is a discovery of their inner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3749-sex-pistols/"">Sex Pistols</a>: more cynical, <a href=""http://desaparecidos.inktankmerch.com/item/304/deport-conor-oberst-t"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more in character</a>, taking advantage of no-win, no-future situations to create potent, punk rock theater. Up against institutions too big to fail but also too big to defend themselves, Desaparecidos provide heavy ammo for cathartic finger-pointing and maximum collateral damage.</p>
<p>Though Oberst is largely responsible for Desaparecidos' profile, this is not his side project<span>—</span>this is a full-on <i>band</i> and one that has grown increasingly tight and versatile despite only intermittently existing in the 21st century. Infamously recorded in a week of chaotic sessions, <i>Read Music/Speak Spanish</i> played out like a demolition derby, riffs, corroded shouts, and clamorous drums careening into each other. <i>Payola</i> is fast and furious, but carefully engineered for maximum, straight-ahead velocity. Despite the professed influence of the Cro-Mags and T.S.O.L., Desaparecidos are not a convincing hardcore act. Most of their arsenal draws from pop music, New Wave or even metal<span>—</span>Oberst's major-key, happily resolving melodies would've fit into his folk songs while Denver Dalley gilds the edges with tapping solos and ingratiating call-and-response riffs with keyboardist Ian McElroy.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding: 18px 0px 0px; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Regardless of its throwback sonic inspiration, <i>Payola</i> sounds far more contemporary than <i>Read Music</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31229-so-so-glos"">So So Glos</a> appear on ""Slacktivist"" and provide context for the harmonized guitars and beer-muscled pop-punk. Meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5361-against-me"">Against Me!</a> has always balanced their most affecting, crucial work with potent sloganeering, so Laura Jane Grace is a perfect accomplice to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep7493LueOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">piss on the Wall Street frat houses</a> during ""Golden Parachutes"". It's hard to say whether Desaparecidos have truly influenced similarly minded, popular punk acts who have emerged in their absence or vice versa, but it lends <i>Payola </i>a current vibrancy that <i>Read Music </i>avoided<span>—</span>Patrick Stickles has been saddled with Bright Eyes comparisons from the get-go, and now that he's making compact rages against the machine like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17464-titus-andronicus-dimed-out/"">""Dimed Out""</a>, he's a real-time competitor with Conor Oberst's band. Meanwhile, ""Te Amo Camila Vallejo"" imagines if Joe Strummer had the foresight to write a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids"">Japandroids</a> song, a pound-the-steering wheel anthem about going to the ends of the Earth for a charismatic, beautiful woman. In this case, it just so happens to be the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/camila-vallejo-the-worlds-most-glamorous-revolutionary.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""World's Most Glamorous Revolutionary""</a>, a Communist leader of Chile's 2011 student uprisings and now an elected member of congress.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding: 18px 0px 0px; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But as with Strummer or any political writer who tries to give voice to people outside of his own demographic, Oberst could be accused of being out of his depth (not to mention the question of whether their name brings light to a <a href=""http://rfkcenter.org/desaparecidos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">terrible situation overseas</a> or is being utilized for its cachet). It would take a very willful misreading to accuse Desaparecidos of misappropriation—""Radicalized"" split screens a potential Islamic extremist and an American mourning his fallen brother in a double wide trailer, and it's not attempting the depth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1283-steve-earle"" target=""_blank"">Steve Earle</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISFNTRaXRiI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""John Walker's Blues""</a>or even the bite of Desaparecidos' own ""The Happiest Place on Earth"". This juxtaposition is built upon by the thematically linked ""10 Steps Behind"", presumably inspired by a religious tradition of requiring wives to trail their husbands. The imagery in ""10 Steps Behind"" remains intentionally vague—is the subject from the Middle East or Middle America? Do both cultures see women as property in their own way?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; padding: 18px 0px 0px; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">As with ""Radicalized"", the seething anger underlying ""10 Steps Behind"" is better conveyed through the blistering music and Oberst knows when to get out of the way. And mostly, chucking any pretense of nuance works in <i>Payola</i>'s favor. When discussing the policies of celebrity racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio, or the beneficiaries of the Wall Street bailout, or a cancer patient whose life is going to be determined by paperwork, these songs seem to ask, do you really need to hear both sides?</p>
<p>Whether or not <i>Payola</i> was ""worth the wait"" is a moot point<span>—</span>not much about <i>Read Music/Speak Spanish</i> suggested a follow-up was ever going to happen at all, so who was waiting really? But <i>Payola</i>'s weaker points are entirely due to its latency period: by the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59261-conor-obersts-band-desaparecidos-share-city-on-the-hill-video"">""City on the Hill""</a> had debuted, exactly half of this record had been publicly available. Every song here is effective and memorable, just some less so than others, and most of them are packed towards the end, repeating earlier ideas (""Von Maur Massacre"", ""Anonymous"").</p>
<p>And a topical record that's been cobbled together over the span of five years is going to sound dated in a 24-hour news cycle. It's not just the references to Occupy or the NSA's Fairview surveillance system or flashmobs, though those tend to jut out like 2012 RT's on your timeline. There's an Auto-Tune joke buried in ""Backsell"", but also a warning from former big league washout Britt Daniel, whose A&amp;R-ripping <a href=""http://saddle-creek.com/store/436"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Agony of Laffitte""</a> single made him and Oberst short-lived labelmates on <a href=""http://saddle-creek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saddle Creek</a>. Since the release of ""Backsell"" in 2012, however, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon"">Spoon</a> has signed to a major label started by a former Warner Bros. executive.</p>
<p>Then again, <i>Read Music/Speak Spanish</i> was written and recorded shortly after 9/11 and while it captured the spirit of its time, it actually proved to be prophetic<span>—</span>though criticized for its maladroit lyrics at the time, it (however clumsily) pledged feminist allegiance, fretted over the overinflated housing bubble and a war with no end in sight. The outlier was ""Mañana"", a desperate rallying cry where Oberst hoped against hope that humanity could create a new future rather than an increasingly shittier version of the past. They played it at their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39372-reunited-desaparecidos-bright-eyes-play-nebraska-immigration-benefit/"">first reunion show in 2010</a>, a benefit to oppose a Fremont, Neb. renter's ordinance that blatantly targeted the influx of Latinos into the town by requiring an oath of legal citizenry. The U.S Supreme Court declined intervention and a headline detailing its current status perfectly sums up <i>Payola</i>'s reason for existence: <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nebraska-immigrants-20140507-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""furor persists.""</a></p></div>"|20720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20720-payola/|7.6|Ian Cohen

Araw's <i>Gazebo Effect</i> feels like a beetle has crawled in your ear canal. Other times, it feels like you have water in there you can’t shake loose. Most times, it seems to render the ground beneath your feet a little less reliable. If you have spent time listening to records by the experimental psych outfit Sun Araw, the longtime creative project of Cameron Stallones, then these sensations will be comfortingly familiar. Stallones has chewed a termite’s path through the world, depositing a series of albums that, taken together, make a compelling argument for the virtue of prolonged disorientation.</p>
<p>In the past several years, Stallones has sought company to round out his music, which has resulted in projects like the FRKWYS collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30175-m-geddes-gengras/"">M. Geddes Gengras</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13147-the-congos/"">the Congos</a>' <i>Icon Give Thank</i>, as well as projects he’s given other names to, like <a href=""http://sunaraw.com/duppygun.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duppy Gun</a> and<a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products/the-celebrate-music-synthesizer-group"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Celebrate Music Synthesizer Group</a> to set them apart. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19107-sun-araw-belomancie/""><i>Belomancie</i></a>, he waved away collaborators like so much smoke from his eyes, bearing down on the most primordial elements of his often-already-pretty-primordial music.</p>
<p><i>Gazebo Effect,</i> like its predecessor <i>Belomancie</i>, is an album of experimental psych that unfolds in increments, like you’re listening to the very first cell divisions of something that will eventually emerge into a coherent piece of music. It was recorded collaboratively, and live, by a new configuration of the Sun Araw Band, this time given the slightly tweaked name S. Araw ""Trio"" XI. The other players are Alex Gray (who is credited with ""Computer Synthesis"" and ""Bamboo Saxophone"") and Mitchell Brown (who handles ""1/4"" Magnetic Tape, Yamaha CP35, Roland System 100 Synthesizer). The energy they generate is not too far from <i>Belomancie</i>, in that it feels like a place for your ear to wander without a real purpose in mind.</p>
<p>This is unclean, septic-feeling music, and you can feel the hands and oils that have covered it and worked it into its current shape. ""Upper Lawns"" fills the space in your headphones with a synth tone that buckles out of pitch so wildly it’s cartoonish. In ""Processional"", a thin high whine flits around some glowing, jazz-inflected synthesizer chords, like a bug orbiting a flickering light. Nothing feels like it moves <i>forward</i>, exactly, more like you’re watching a few elements move in hard-to-predict, lazy circles. The long piece ""Trellis"" has several sections like this, all in its later portions, where a guitar line will ping so uncontrollably that it will zigzag over the one of two clear visible lines you thought your mind’s eye had established in it.</p>
<p>There is something funny about the fact that two tracks here are titled ""Thesis"" and ""Rebuttal"". For one, the piece called ""Thesis"" is 21 bleary minutes, while the ""Rebuttal"" is two minutes of relatively sharp-edged keyboards. It’s impossible to guess at either the thesis being proposed, or the nature of its rebuttal. But it’s clear from observing Stallones’ output over the years that he works with a target on the horizon. It might seem deceptively serene from the outside, but his music has expanded to vista and then shrunk to pinprick, from album to album, while remaining as steady as lamp glow. We are the ones staring, hypnotized, at the magic he conjures.</p></div>"|20748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20748-gazebo-effect/|7.5|Jayson Greene

He kicked off his recording career in 2009 with the <i>Tour de Force</i> EP for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31868-willie-burns/"">Willie Burns</a>' <a href=""http://wtrecords.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">W.T. Records</a>, and a slim handful of releases and compilation tracks on labels like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas</a>' <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/99778-Internasjonal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Internasjonal</a>, the Berghain-related <a href=""http://ostgut.de/label/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ostgut Ton</a>, and Amsterdam's <a href=""rushhourmusic.com/"">Rush Hour</a> followed. But long before Choi began recording, he was laying the groundwork for a life in music, honing his skills as a DJ and working behind the counter at a Berlin record store specializing in funk and soul. In the past few years, Choi has developed a reputation as an exceptionally talented DJ with uncommonly deep crates, open ears, and nimble fingers; he's the rare DJ not only willing to venture from disco to house to techno and back again, all in a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/hunee/hunee-live-at-trouw-ade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">single set</a>, but with the skills to do so convincingly.</p>
<p>Until now, Choi's productions have largely reflected his fondness for vintage house and techno, but his debut album goes much further. While it draws from dance music, it's not defined by its norms. It's not a flashily or self-consciously experimental record, but the vision it showcases is unique. In its own, understated way, it represents an attempt to make music that doesn't so much conform to formal templates as it does reinforce dance music's implicit promise of freedom.</p>
<p>A sense of mysticism permeates the album. The opening ""Woods"" plays out like a kind of creation myth: Out of a misty swirl of synths and rainforest percussion, a reed-like melody materializes, and a pitch-bent synthesizer solo hides the suggestion of a human voice in its folds. The handclaps are less a matter of timekeeping than of ritual. It feels like a kind of invocation, and he returns to that idea throughout the record. The tempestuous, broken-beat miniature ""Burning Flower"" pairs smeared-on synths with an extended strip of opera—not synchronized or even harmonized, just threaded through the background, as though a neighbor had thrown on <i>Aida</i> and left the window open. Meanwhile, ""The World"" drapes a beaded curtain of percussion over an extended Sun Ra sample, yielding a heady variation on cosmic jazz.</p>
<p>Hunee's dancefloor cuts are no less transcendent. ""Error of the Average"" is dark, roiled techno-jazz in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"">Carl Craig</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32771-levon-vincent/"">Levon Vincent</a>, and the more laid-back ""Silent Sensations"" is a Janus-faced late-night jam, half toe-scuffing drums and bass, half aquamarine chords. ""Hiding the Moon"" begins as though under the influence of Berghain, just kick drum and clatter; gradually, though, tinny bell tones take us into gamelan-via-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry-Riley</a> territory. But Hunee doesn't do minimalism, and soon he adds Rhodes chords, wildly processed trumpets, and a bassline that sounds like a succession of slamming doors. Sampled birdsong serves as the cherry on the 11-layer cake.</p>
<p>For precedents, you could look to the aforementioned Carl Craig and Levon Vincent as well as producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27985-pepe-bradock/?u"">Pépé Bradock</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze</a>, and Sherard Ingram's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Tribe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Urban Tribe</a>. Like Bradock and Koze, Choi is both sentimental and a little squirrelly; like Ingram, he's a master of sounds that are gruff and tender in equal measure. ""Rare Happiness"", the album's breeziest cut, recalls both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjcqfJlYPd4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blaze's ""Lovelee Dae""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30503-recloose/"">Recloose</a>'s sweetly soulful productions. But by the end of the expertly paced album, he steps away from the dancefloor entirely. The beatless ""Bruises"" pairs mournful string loops with pitched-down vocal samples, and ""Amo (Admiration)"" creates a hypnotic miniature out of trumpets and delay. The cello in ""Bruises"" faintly suggests the influence of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>, but ultimately, neither track sounds like anyone else at all.</p>
<p>From his individual sounds and rhythms all the way up to his daring, freewheeling arrangements, Hunee's vision of techno feels unusually alive—not just enchanting but actually enchanted. It's as though that initial act of invocation had summoned real spirits; the air vibrates with their presence.</p></div>"|20646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20646-hunch-music/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

Recently reissued documentary <i>The Family Jams</i> chronicles the innocent days of freak folk, the painfully amateur footage mirroring a shambolic summer tour spent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/548-rejoicing-in-the-hands/"">rejoicing in the hands</a>. A decade on, a pristine redux of the collective's influence manifests in Morrissey's debut, aided by the production of scene original <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5090-noah-georgeson/"">Noah Georgeson</a>. Complementing Morrissey's piercing melismatics are softly thumbed acoustic guitars, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5WEuQUw8wY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">very familiar</a> harp motifs, and cosmic accents, along with a plush string section and period wardrobe. </p>
<p><span>Although Morrissey reaches back a decade and way beyond, to the likes of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5009-karen-dalton/"">Karen Dalton</a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a><span>, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a><span>, </span><i>Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful</i><span> feels like an accurate representation of right now. She's part of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"">raft</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">privileged</a> British musicians who can afford to be earnest and wide-eyed about the world, but it's something she does better than most of them. It's strange to see a generation wholeheartedly embrace their parents' tastes during a period of socio-political turmoil, and there's no grit in Morrissey's Vaseline lens.</span></p>
<p>Her voice is incredibly pure and agile: she's a drowsy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30852-jessica-pratt/"">Jessica Pratt</a>'s choirgirl little sister. But every song drowns in over-arrangements, perhaps in an attempt to mask a fairly persistent lack of melody. The exceptions are lovely. The verse of ""Pages of Gold"" floats on clouds of warped electric guitar, before a robust, skyward chorus that would have amply fit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29087-first-aid-kit/"">First Aid Kit</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19342-first-aid-kit-stay-gold/"">last record</a>. Similarly weightless is ""If You Can't Love This All Goes Away"", which features Morrissey's most understated and affecting vocal performance.</p>
<p>Morrissey's lyrics avoid hippie affect for plainspoken admission, telling a timeless coming-of-age story across 10 songs. The glinting ""Show Me"", written when she was 15, crystallizes the moment where childhood starts receding into the past. (""I've begun to see my life/ It's so different once it's been shone in its new light."") She forgives and gently warns a friend who's now seeing her manipulative ex on ""Sleeplessly Dreaming"", which has a little French chanson in its gait. By the end of <i>Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful</i>, she's reveling in the budding promise of pleasure in self-knowledge. ""This joy I'm now feeling is much more real/ I'll begin again as a seedling, running far to the fields"", she sings on the flinching ""Wildflower"" amid starry harp. Morrissey has often <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/12/flo-morrissey-pages-of-gold/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about</a> exaggerating her feelings in song to make up for her youthful lack of experience, but within the lavish <i>Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful</i> is a songwriter whose knack for subtle self-assertion needs bringing to the fore, not dressing up in quirk.</p></div>"|20678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20678-tomorrow-will-be-beautiful/|6.2|Laura Snapes

There are pop-punk yelps, post-punk groans, dream-pop whispers, and the clean, enunciated croons of mainstream stars. Katie Dey's first album <i>asdfasdf</i> positions her as an alien to vocal geography. The Melbourne-based artist is a singer as well as a songwriter, but in each of her songs, she completely corrodes her voice. While many home recordings paint the image of the artist singing real words into a real microphone attached to a real tape recorder, <i>asdfasdf</i> refuses to ground itself. It is hard to imagine these seven songs coming from a physical space; chaotic and gritty, they prioritize energy and motion, making audio fidelity feel like an obsolete concern.</p>
<p>Of Dey's peers on the <a href=""http://orchidtapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orchid Tapes</a> label, she finds the closest kinship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32330-alex-g/"">Alex G</a>, another purveyor of demented indie pop who makes resourceful use of pitch-shifting and bizarre instrumental choices. But women's voices in music are especially policed for annoyingness, and Dey pushes that quality to an extreme edge. The first you hear of her on ""don't be scared"" is a high-pitched croak processed beyond recognition among clean acoustic guitar riffs and unsteady drum beats. She later programs a synthesizer to mimic her vocal tone; aside from the vague definition around her words, the line between human and machine feels smeared and unstable, as if Dey were as present in all of her instruments as she is in her own voice.</p>
<p><i>asdfasdf</i>'s most defined and energetic song comes in the form of ""unkillable"", a minute and 20 seconds of buoyant melodies that constantly threaten to veer off course. Dey's lyrics shine through clearest here, with phrases like ""teen poetry"" and ""sucks the blood from my feet"" flashing through in strange, disembodied glimpses. The song is catchy, which makes it all the stranger. Most hooks go down smooth by design, but Dey's nightmare pop forces you to swallow something decomposing and sharp. The name of the song suggests its own inversion—not ""unlikable"", as it may read on first glance, but immortal, unstoppable, powerful.</p>
<p>Dey is hardly the first songwriter to use broken rules as weapons, but she takes palpable pleasure in the conventions she upends. Voices, especially women's, are expected to be pretty and easy to grasp, especially in quieter, gentler music. Dey amplifies her rough edges, splitting the space inside her tape machine and chasing herself down its fragments. <i>asdfasdf</i> sustains a level of textural complexity that most musicians won't attempt, and its clever melodic core supports the layers of abrasions. A warm playfulness radiates from deep inside Dey's music. Its inscrutability makes it all the more rewarding to wade through over and over again.</p></div>"|20685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20685-katie-dey-asdfasdf/|7.0|Sasha Geffen

And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in <a href=""http://www.slow-life.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/stones.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jackets and ties</a> and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway.</p>
<p>That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's <i>Beggars Banquet</i> and the following year's <i>Let It Bleed</i> on through this album and 1972's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14264-exile-on-main-st-deluxe-edition/""><i>Exile on Main St.</i></a>, the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and <i>Sticky Fingers</i> could reasonably be called their peak. <i>Beggars</i> and <i>Let It Bleed</i> might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; <i>Exile</i>'s tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. <i>Sticky Fingers</i> is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>""Brown Sugar"" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20071001200537/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""all the nasty subjects in one go""</a>). But words were secondary for the band at this point—<i>Sticky Fingers</i> is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R&amp;B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of ""Wild Horses"" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of ""Dead Flowers"" to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29916-fred-mcdowell/"">Mississippi Fred McDowell</a> cover (""You Gotta Move"") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R&amp;B of ""I Got the Blues"" to the crunchy boogie of ""Bitch"" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"", <i>Sticky Fingers</i> is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDxE9SaqUtI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">English boys doing their version of the blues</a>, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations.</p>
<p>By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, <i>Sticky Fingers</i> was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joafeJQ890A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duane Allman's playing from this period</a>.</p>
<p>But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way <i>Exile</i> is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (<i>Exile</i> mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor.</p>
<p>When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on ""Dead Flowers"" is obviously played for laughs, but ""You Gotta Move"" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. ""I Got the Blues"" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. ""Sister Morphine"" and ""Moonlight Mile"" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty.</p>
<p>With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zeppelin</a>, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of <i>Exile on Main St.</i> pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of ""Brown Sugar"" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year.</p>
<p>To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about <i>more</i>: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. </p>
<p>The Stones entered the '70s still <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g69labQKuuU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">young and beautiful</a>, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hic-dnps6MU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disco</a> and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xrs-8tA1Wk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miami Vice""</a> and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on <i>Sticky Fingers</i> and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.</p></div>"|20483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20483-sticky-fingers/|10.0|Mark Richardson

It observes the night of a young couple who meet, flirt, and stumble their way improbably into a violent heist. In the film's charged, uncertain atmosphere, the glow of anticipation from meeting someone new and the tingle of dread right before something awful happens both occur along one unbroken continuum: When life gets better, it is also one hair’s breadth away from getting worse.</p>
<p>The German producer Nils Frahm composed the film's score, and if you listened to it and tried to imagine the film he was working on, you'd probably arrive at a very different movie—something sweet-toned and modest, slightly grave, and above all, muted. Maybe a family drama where none of the members can quite muster the strength to say exactly what they're feeling. It is a mood that will feel familiar to anyone who has spent time with Frahm's solo piano albums, the most recent of which (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20471-solo/""><i>Solo</i></a>) he released for free just in April.</p>
<p>The <i>Victoria OST</i> marshals more instruments than his solo piano works, but not many more<span>—</span>each new sound, whether it's a husky-throated cello on ""Our Own Roof"" or the subcutaneous hum of organ keys on ""The Bank"", tiptoes in carefully and gingerly. Frahm’s score works along <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s fabled ignorable/interesting divide: You can soak in the long, receding tones like you would sit in the sun beneath a big window, or you can fixate on surgically tiny details, like the way you can nearly hear the felt of the piano hammers being brushed into individual fibers on ""A Stolen Car"", or the rustle of whatever foreign objects he’s placed on the strings to make them generate extra noises. Frahm strikes little ""off"" notes in the interstices of that piece's simple major chords, so that when they ring, they don’t ring ""clean""—there is a tendril of sour air in them, seemingly acknowledging the turmoil that plays out on the screen.</p>
<p>Moments like this in Frahm’s score are furtive and quiet: There is a foreboding drone piece called ""In the Parking Garage"", full of room tone and tiny, human-sounding scrapes, that hits your ear the way a parking garage's sodium lighting assaults your eye. And the album opens with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze</a> edit called ""Burn With Me"", in which a dry techno thump meets a dull knock and some nauseated synths. Frahm’s aesthetic shares something in common with Koze, whose touch suggests someone who would prefer to cover all exposed hard edges with blankets so no one gets hurt. Frahm's awareness seems repeatedly drawn to glowing spaces where notes ring out after they've been struck. These spaces mimic the way a memorable event lingers in our minds, acquiring new shades of meaning and slowly receding into the morass of our lived experience. In echo-rich, contemplative music like this, the event itself doesn’t matter nearly as much as its aftereffects, the way it changes over time and the way it changes you.</p></div>"|20671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20671-victoria-ost/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Tenement first gained significant attention in late 2011, when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjk7KJuMHCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stupid World""</a> started circulating. It was the kind of pissy, mid-fi pop-punk (""I don't want to live in this stupid world/ I don't fit in in this stupid world"") one would assume is constantly churned out during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11896-1039smoothed-out-slappy-hourskerplunk"" target=""_blank"">slap-happy hours</a> in their native Appleton, Wis. and sleepy residential exurbs just like it across the United States. They're now singed to Don Giovanni, current home of esteemed, confrontational punk acts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27878-screaming-females"" target=""_blank"">Screaming Females</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31119-priests"" target=""_blank"">Priests</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32890-downtown-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Downtown Boys</a>, so <i>Predatory Headlights</i> is liable to be the first Tenement album heard on a bigger scale. But Amos Pitsch has decided to make things considerably more difficult for himself and potential new listeners by dropping a record containing 25 songs and nearly 80 minutes of music.  </p>
<p>It's easy to appreciate the gumption of Tenement automatically putting themselves in a discussion with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1490-london-calling-25th-anniversary-legacy-edition"" target=""_blank""><i>London Calling</i></a>, <i>Zen Arcade</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a>' upcoming <i>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</i>. But <i>Predatory Headlights</i> isn't designed as a narrative, and it's certainly not a case of a band looking to prove they can do anything. Rather, it's a document of a band who feel empowered by <i>not</i> having a reputation to uphold, where they can still figure out their identity or happily choose not to have one at all.</p>
<p><i>Predatory Headlights</i> is bookended by the band doing what they're best at, with Pitsch penning compact, uptempo chorus-focused songs that aren't slick or cloying or beholden to formula enough to be true power pop. In particular, lead single ""Dull Joy"" toys with dissonant grunge arpeggios, disaffected British accents, and a jarring bridge of chipmunked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex"">T. Rex</a> harmonies, bearing a pleasing resemblance to alt-rock jokers like Cracker. Even when ""Near You"" or ""The Shriveled Finger"" hearken back to their formative days, Pitsch's vocals have enough heft and grit to set them apart. </p>
<p>Whether they're veering towards beery alt-country, piano-pop that plays like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon"">Spoon</a> with a punkish patina (""Curtains Closed""), or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a> tribute (""Garden of Secrecy""), most of <i>Predatory Headlights</i> sees Tenement working on their stylistic breadth without overextending themselves. Like so many other revered Midwestern punks, Pitsch prefers an out-of-step, everyman persona. He's quite literally a man on the street a number of times here, ""street"" being a physical or conceptual space where one can be an observer or participant in human failings and communication breakdowns.</p>
<p>Yet it's hard to seem humble when you're putting out an 80-minute record. Even if <i>Predatory Headlights</i> is a double album offered out of generosity, its consistency works against it. Songs like ""Harvest Time (Has Come)"" and ""Under the Storm Clouds"" are no differently structured or longer than what came before them. But less than 20 minutes in, the band seems incapable of hitting a peak or reaching a low. As a result, finishing <i>Predatory Headlights</i> in one sitting starts to feel impossible, or at least ill-advised. </p>
<p>In that case, you'll appreciate how easily it can be broken down into four 20-minute sections of vinyl. The flabbiest pockets lie in the midsection: half of Side C is taken up by ""A Frightening Place for Normal People"", an instrumental whose point could be made in two seconds: ""We listen to Duke Ellington."" But it goes on for about 10 minutes, a jazz odyssey in both the literal and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvGR8UX1L0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spinal Tap</a> sense of the term. It's the one thing on <i>Predatory Highlights</i> that has the feel of an aesthetic gauntlet, and I'd also guess it's the song that led Tenement to believe they really <i>did</i> need to make a double LP.</p>
<p><i>Predatory Headlights</i> grows on you only after it starts to shrink. Ditch the material that appears most filler-y<span>—</span>Side C, the instrumental interludes, the inert piano floater ""Ants &amp; Flies""<span>—</span>and you've sheared off a half-hour. Or, you could consider it to be a ""Tenement 2011-2015"" boxed set of sorts. This much material could've been parceled out as two LPs and maybe another transitional EP, a fairly standard output for a rock band over a four-year time period.

Knowledge of his day job might be a key to understanding the drifting spaciousness and fluid sense of his music. But really, it's hard to shake the impression Kalevi is one of those figures—like, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4187-sebastien-tellier/"">Sébastien Tellier</a>—who appears born into his role: a dashing synth-pop troubadour of Platonic perfection.</p>
<p>By his own account, Kalevi grew up on the progressive metal of Dream Theater and cut his teeth making hip-hop beats before refining his current style: a pastel-shaded blend of saxophone-stoked soft rock, electronic pop, and disco that feels at least as Gallic as it does Scandinavian, romantic of heart and melancholic in disposition. The prevailing mood of his music—louche, elegant, a little hazy around the edges—belies a forensic attention to detail that Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a>, or, before that, finicky studiohounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"">Steely Dan</a> brought to the recording process. It's unclear if <i>Jaakko Eino Kalevi</i> was made at huge expense, or scraped together for loose change, but with a mix job by Nicolas Vernhes everything feels just so, drums punchy and mechanistic, guitars luxuriant in their heady sustain.</p>
<p>The eponymous title prepares you, rightly, for a degree of self-absorption. ""<i>Minun nimeni on Jaakko Eino Kalevi</i>"" he sings, over and over on the opening ""JEK"", a theme song of sorts that remains heavy-lidded until around the two minute mark, when a glorious synth sequence fires up, shadowed by some exquisitely sad saxophone. Elsewhere, Kalevi sings in English, often in duet with co-vocalist Suad Khalifa. On ""Deeper Shadows"", their dolorous vocal and one-fingered synth motifs recall the endearing naifishness of early '80s continental pop groups such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elli_et_Jacno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elli et Jacno</a>, while the rippling synths and swooning vocals of ""Double Talk"" have a burnished beauty that reminds me of another Vernhes production, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"">Wild Nothing</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/""><i>Nocturne</i></a>. The sound is so pristine that you occasionally get the feeling the material comes to rest on it, like the twinkling lounge funk of ""Room"". Still, Kalevi never resorts to irony, and he's comfortable in his own rarefied tastes.</p>
<p><i>Jaakko Eino Kalevi</i> strikes a tone of millennial ennui; ""Don't Ask Me Why"" is suffused with the sort of youthful world-weariness that could easily find a home on some future Sofia Coppola soundtrack. Elsewhere, though, we get glimpses of a steelier spirit. ""Break the self/ And build it again"" chants Kalevi on ""Mind Like Muscle"", a hymn to self-improvement that revolves endlessly before finally dissolving into vaporous guitar. The loping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a> pop of ""Say"" hides a character assassination amidst its silky folds: ""They say that you rot and shatter/ They say that you leak dark matter,"" he sings, as jabbing sax notes twist from smile to snarl. Then comes the loaded question, discharged like a pistol: ""<i>Is it true that you once had a heart?</i>"" </p>
<p>Some have sought to draw comparison between Kalevi and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>, which feels like a red herring. Ariel Rosenberg appears compelled by an urgent need to deconstruct and reconstruct pop history and explode notions of good taste. Little of that tension is to be found here, and indeed some listeners might miss it. Not a huge problem, though. Kalevi speaks softly but moves boldly, and <i>Jaakko Eino Kalevi</i> feels like a refinement of his own unique spirit.</p></div>"|20695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20695-jaakko-eino-kalevi/|6.9|Louis Pattison

If she so chose, she surely has the skills and connections to make an expansive, cross-genre album studded with guest appearances, but she hasn't seemed interested in that. She has always kept her solo albums streamlined and direct, focusing her songs almost exclusively on her finger-picked guitar and radiant voice. Likewise, her thematic approach has never been panoramic; instead her albums tend to feel like private journals, wherein a particular mood is set and then sustained and refined.</p>
<p>The same holds true, with a few subtle but important variations, for Baird's third solo album, <i>Don't Weigh Down the Light</i>. Her past albums have featured several interpretations of traditional folk standards and well-wrought covers of such obscurities as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28570-the-house-of-love/"">House of Love</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnFH413cWF8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beatles and the Stones""</a>. In fact her style is so steeped in British and Appalachian folk forms that at times even her original songs have sounded as if they had been written in a previous century. On <i>Don't Weigh Down the Light</i>, however, all of the tracks are Baird originals, and are less reliant on traditional folk idioms.</p>
<p>Where her previous album, 2011's <i>Seasons on Earth</i>, was ornamented with pedal steel and other subtle country touches, Baird is here joined throughout by Charlie Saufley, formerly of SF acid rock heavyweights <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5182-the-assemble-head-in-sunburst-sound/"">the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound</a>. On several tracks here the duo of Baird and Saufley masquerade as a full band, with each playing multiple instruments and filling the songs' ample open spaces with gentle ripples of organ, 12-string guitar, and percussion. As a result <i>Don't Weigh Down the Light </i>is the closest Baird has come in her solo work to reclaiming the cosmic turf once occupied by Espers.</p>
<p>In the time since the release of <i>Seasons on Earth</i>, Baird moved from her longtime base of Philadelphia to San Francisco, and it doesn't feel too outlandish to suggest that Baird's move has had a substantial influence on <i>Don't Weigh Down the Light. </i>There is a general feel of transition and displacement permeating such tracks as ""Past Houses"" or ""Even the Walls Don't Want You to Go"". Midway through the album is a short track simply entitled ""Leaving Song"", featuring nothing but Baird's multi-tracked vocals, wordlessly cascading down in a manner that can sound alternately melancholic or prayer-like, depending on the listener's current frame of mind.</p>
<p>Brief though the track is, its placement seems noteworthy, almost as though it is the hinge upon which the rest of the album is meant to pivot. Curiously, the vocal melody of ""Leaving Song"" returns a few songs later as a background track on ""Even the Walls Don't Want You to Go"". This echoing, especially when coupled with the following reprise of the song ""Past Houses"", gives the album a circular feel, as though Baird's songs are doubling back upon themselves in a continuous loop of departures and arrivals.</p>
<p>Baird's voice sounds as potent and icy-clear as ever. As evidenced by her work with Espers and the Baird Sisters, her voice is well-suited to close-harmony singing, and here she makes frequent use of vocal multi-tracking, adding whispery harmonies at what sounds like the upper limits of her register. In combination with the casual jammy vibe on some of the instrumental passages, these airy harmonies recall some of the folkier aspects of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>. In recent months Baird and Saufley have joined forces with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a>'s Ethan Miller to form the West Coast psych outfit <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heron-Oblivion/1613161242245463"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heron Oblivion</a>, and if their work together on <i>Don't Weigh Down the Light</i> is any indication, that might herald even further fruitful departures.</p></div>"|20632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20632-dont-weigh-down-the-light/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

It was a tender moment for disco fans, and there was something healing in having her voice brought to life once more by the legendary producer. As critic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/staff/barry-walters/"">Barry Walters</a> <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/16/414679264/from-here-to-eternity-a-giorgio-moroder-primer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently put it</a>, Summer and Moroder shared an ""uncommon symbiosis…[that] crossed gender, color, national and cultural boundaries as disco's ultimate emissaries of universal love."" Who else would the packed crowd at Output rather hear play <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JUnwrbU6Wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love to Love You Baby""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TBmeK9Abg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel Love""</a> than Giorgio himself?</p>
<p>Earlier that same week, Giorgio could be heard recounting the beatific click of the Moog synthesizer on a newly released LP that would become one of the biggest albums of the year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>. The man hadn't produced much music of his own since the pomp of the <a href=""https://youtu.be/2fQF7o0Gp-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1990 FIFA World Cup theme</a>, but the Giorgio Renaissance was nigh. Naturally, news of a new album soon followed. Names like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"">Kylie Minogue</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"">Britney Spears</a> were mentioned as his post-Summer muses, and the septuagenarian name-dropped EDM grandchildren like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30466-avicii/"">Avicii</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5504-calvin-harris/"">Calvin Harris</a> in interviews.</p>
<p>The Eurodisco/Europop/proto-Eurotrance he set in motion in the 1970s was evident from the album's cheesy first single, ""74 Is the New 24"", which didn't bode well for his return. But going back to late '60s—see the album <i>That's Bubble Gum - That's Giorgio<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That's_Bubblegum_-_That's_Giorgio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></i>—questionable taste has almost always been part of his story. During his '70s disco heyday, Giorgio had the Midas Touch, and he carried that energy into the new decade and new wave, be it the symphonic synth soundtracks for spermatozoa on Sparks' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEwlRbey57U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tryouts for the Human Race""</a>, the razor guitars of Blondie's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StKVS0eI85I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Call Me""</a>, or the billowing synthetic curtain balladry of Berlin's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx51eegLTY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Take My Breath Away""</a>. But for all his platinum hits, Moroder was also a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_Top_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frank Stallone and Sammy Hagar collaborator</a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Déjà Vu</i> is rickety and wholly unnecessary, and Moroder's return feels like Rick Barry coming out of retirement to suit up for the Golden State Warriors. Some traces of Giorgio's champion-caliber game remain, from the slightly menacing Moog arpeggios that open ""74 Is the New 24"" to the vocodered growl accompanying Kylie on ""Right Here, Right Now"", but his skills are otherwise in such precipitous decline it's almost agonizing to witness.</p>
<p>Moroder is one of the most distinctive producers of 20th century pop and dance music, but on <i>Déjà Vu</i>, his sound is devoid of distinguishing features. The dinky synth melody of ""4 U With Love"" that opens the album evokes the kind of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK3ZP6frAMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mid-'70s froth</a> Moroder's visionary electronic productions blew off the dancefloor. Even worse, it's coupled with the kind of cookie-cutter beat and filter sweeps that most initiate trance producers have long deleted from their hard drives.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it was telling that Daft Punk deployed Moroder as interview subject rather than as musical contributor. But their influence hangs over this album to a degree. As if hoping to replicate the success of <i>RAM</i> or else pay homage to the robots for resuscitating his career, almost every track here deploys some variation of ""Get Lucky""'s silvery guitar riff. It's on the hook of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>-sung title track, amid the disco touches of ""Wildstar"", and on the subpar-Nick Jonas of the Matthew Korma cut ""Tempted"". Throughout, the songs sound both overly dramatic and oddly ordinary (see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30854-mykki-ekko/"">Mikky Ekko</a>'s ""Don't Let Go""); in a blind test, there might be no way to distinguish between these Moroder productions and a 100% Eurotrance compilation.</p>
<p>Which is a disservice to the singers who queued up to work with Moroder. Perhaps some of them are seeking to reclaim some of Summer's magic, but Moroder doesn't offer much assistance. Britney was perhaps best equipped to grapple with the producer's Svedka fembot beat with her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/6734-poptimist-10/"">previous Auto-Tuned dalliances</a>, but their already limp cover of Suzanne Vega's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-26hsZqwveA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tom's Diner""</a> derails thanks to Giorgio's own vocodered interlude. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2357-kelis/"">Kelis</a>, whose husky, near-androgynous voice best approximates Summer, almost carries off ""Back and Forth"", if only the song didn't grind to a halt at the chorus. Kylie, whose early-aughts pop pinnacle owed a great deal to the synergy of Summer-Moroder, feels weighed down by Giorgio's electropop, yet she still makes ""Right Here, Right Now"" work for her. Through sheer force of will, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"">Charli XCX</a> entwines her posh pout with Giorgio's ""Pocket Calculator"" vocal hook, transcending the Dance Dance Revolution production of ""Diamonds"" to claim the song as her own.</p>
<p>From Britney and Kelis to Kylie and Sia, <i>Déjà Vu</i> boasts a pantheon of pop goddesses, but Moroder only gives them bland boutique hotel electronic music to work with. The album oddly posits a parallel world where these singers are out of work, forgotten pop stars lending their voices to generic EDM tracks just to keep the lights on. If not for their presence on <i>Déjà Vu</i>, Moroder's once-unmistakable music would be all but anonymous.</p></div>"|20703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20703-deja-vu/|2.5|Andy Beta

There's already at least one remix of the track in existence that came with the producer's stamp of approval: an expansive but faithful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17360-todd-terje-inspector-norse-justin-van-der-volgen-mix/"">edit</a> from Justin Van Der Volgen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The title of Olsen's new remix EP, <i>It's It's Remix Time Time</i>, hints at the redundancy of it all, but I prefer to think of it as an echo effect slapped on with a wink and a grin. The EP is a collection of remixes that echoes Olsen's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/starter/9332-todd-terjes-15-best-disco-edits/"">history as a remixer and beloved producer of edits</a> that polished up everything from yacht rock and worldbeat to forgotten Latin-flavored disco. It's a back catalog that now reads like a primer on the influences that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/""><span><i>It's Album Time</i> </span></a>a beacon of un-trendy cultural omnivorism, and comprises a legacy that Olsen likes to hint at on newer releases (earlier this year, he resurrected Tangoterje, a goofy alias from his edits days, for a credit on the <i>Alfonso Muskedender Remixed</i> EP).</p>
<p>Luckily, on this EP the ""Inspector Norse"" baton isn't passed off to just anyone<span>—</span>the biggest showcase here is for French house legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27985-pepe-bradock/"">Pépé Bradock</a>, whose two contributions elevate the whole release above any sense of end-of-the-album-cycle obligation. Like Olsen, Bradock is a veteran remixer with a talent for spinning chintzy soundbites into something beyond the sum of its parts. Like the best remixes do, his version of ""Inspector Norse"" remakes the track in his own image, turning it into a sizzling deep house track with chunky percussion and, most startlingly, a sexy, acid-fried saxophone line in place of the original's blippy melody.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Likewise, Bradock's remix of ""Swing Star"", culled from a pair of album cuts that originally appeared on the </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/"">It's the Arps</a> </i><span>EP, boldly flips the original's tone. By far the darkest and most dissonant thing on the EP, Bradock's version grates Olsen's cosmic flourishes into a nasty stew of burping percussion and queasy drones that somehow coalesce into something euphoric. It's as if Bradock visited the same resort shindig as Olsen on a day when the air conditioning was broken. Such is Bradock's finesse as a mixer that faintly recognizable details from ""Swing Star"" sound as natural in this setting as they did in the more cheerful version on </span><i>It's Album Time</i><span>. If life's a beach, then this is the inevitable heat rash.</span></p>
<p>If there's a more unlikely candidate for a satisfying remix than ""Inspector Norse"", it might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15595-todd-terje-strandbar-disko/"">""Strandbar""</a>. Olsen already released his own alternate genre-fied versions of the track months before the shortened version appeared on<i> It's Album Time</i>, and with three examples of meticulous mixing and subtle variations on the books, it's hard to imagine needing yet another angle on the track. Maybe for that reason, the two producers tackling it here, French pop voyager <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28040-joakim/"">Joakim Bouaziz</a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/606088-Eric-Duncan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric Duncan</a> of hard-partying duo Rub N Tug, mostly play it straight, altering the mood of the song by playing up what's already there. Both Duncan and Bouaziz's reworkings sound surprisingly dry after the EP's first half, dialing up the aggression of the percussion and downplaying the original's starry-eyed romanticism.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-419ef478-ffc0-824b-414a-3fac7675de0c"">In the case of his right-hand-animator <a href=""http://www.benkalt.no/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bendik Kaltenborn</a>, Olsen's collaborative tendencies have undoubtedly strengthened his oddball persona and made it more thematically rich. <i>It's It's Remix Time Time </i>is ultimately a fun way for Olsen to give a generous nod to his peers, and while not everything on it is essential, it's still reasonable to assume Todd Terje won't ever leave you totally high and dry.</span></p></div>"|20694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20694-its-its-remix-time-time-ep/|6.2|Abigail Garnett

That full-length resembles other bands that fall into the category of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_black_metal_musical_groups"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""USBM""</a>—there is a sense of magnitude to False's music, which is enriched with atmospheric orchestration. But they don't fall into a ""more is less"" problem, bogging down and overextending their tracks with unmemorable passages. With <i>Untitled</i>, False expand on their sound without diluting it, proving they are worthy of their promise and making good on the tantalizing glimpses of their earlier works. </p>
<p>The secret to the album's power is in large part to their understated approach to melody. Juxtaposing harmony and dissonance is old hat in extreme music, and especially so with the more recent successes of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"">Alcest</a>, but False presents that same contrast as a kind of musical photo negative, where melody and harmony lead naturally into entropy. Opener ""Saturnalia"" builds with a slow burning ferocity before exploding into a storm of discordant wails and growls, while both ""The Deluge"" and closer ""Hedgecraft"" venture close to what would undoubtedly be an easily accessible melodic hook, if they followed the impulse all the way. As it turns out, that subdued and suggestive approach to a payoff gives the record another one of its most formidable strengths.</p>
<p>For all the winding orchestration of <i>Untitled</i> (remember: there are six members in this band), moments of needless filler are rare-to-nonexistent. Considering the fact that only one of the album's five tracks falls shy of the 10-minute mark, that is a remarkable achievement.<b></b> Black metal, as a subgenre, is both steeped in musical complexity and devoted to the simplicity of its form. That is, regardless of how far the music itself may spiral outside the self-imposed bounds of black metal, its fulcrum remains the straightforward blast-beat, the tremolo-driven guitars, and the interpretation of its thrash and death metal forbearers. With <i>Untitled</i>, False have not reinvented any forms or introduced some unchartered territory for black metal. There is plenty of wanton ugliness here, both in the scrape of the vocals and the murk of the production. But the songs also find intriguing divergent paths before returning every track to its chaotic source. </p>
<p>One of extreme music's most divisive and yet at once magnetic subgenres, black metal is as musically steeped in complexity as it is in the simplicity of its form. False reckon brilliantly with both halves of this equation. They have simply offered a new perspective on the shadow and light, the ugliness and beauty, that define their genre.

Along with saxophonists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32915-kamasi-washington/""><span>Kamasi Washington</span></a> and Terrace Martin, and bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><span>Thundercat</span></a>, Glasper was featured prominently on Kendrick Lamar's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">To Pimp A Butterfly</a></i>, which gives the pianist greater name recognition with hip-hop fans. On songs with rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11216-black-milk/""><span>Black Milk</span></a> and multi-instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32229-taylor-mcferrin/""><span>Taylor McFerrin</span></a>, Glasper played the background, yet you could easily distinguish him from the other sonic elements. As frontman of the Robert Glasper Experiment—his eclectic side band—Glasper takes on an aggressive, rock-infused edge, and his <i>Black Radio</i> albums for <a href=""http://www.bluenote.net/newyork/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Note</a> won Grammy awards. He, bassist Derrick Hodge, drummer Mark Colenburg, and vocalist Casey Benjamin put compelling spins on the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> (the Experiment's 13-minute rendition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uim54vLmiCU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box""</span></a> is essential listening, for sure.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, if you're looking for the Experiment's raw electric outbursts, you won't find them on <i>Covered</i>. For this release, Glasper reverts to the jazz trio with which he recorded his first two Blue Note albums—2005's <i>Canvas</i> and 2007's <i>In My Element</i>. With bassist Vicente Archer and drummer Damion Reid, Glasper recreates instrumentals from <i>Black Radio</i> and <i>Black Radio 2</i>, remixing tracks from occasional collaborators Musiq Soulchild (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgPpowVNEfE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""So Beautiful""</span></a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"">Bilal</a> (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOa7aRhOH0g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Levels""</span></a>). Much like his work with the Experiment, Glasper tackles all genres, though on <i>Covered</i>, the results are more straightforward than anything with his other band. The <i>B</i><i>lack Radio</i> albums were decidedly soulful, even if they drifted occasionally across genre lines. For <i>Covered</i>, ""I wanted to do a nice happy medium, and do songs that I like, basically from my iPod,"" Glasper says on the LP's introduction.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Recorded live before an audience at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, </span><i>Covered</i><span> is driven entirely by piano, percussion, and bass. It's a no-frills record that recedes into the background without much fuss, which works for and against the album's overall impact. </span><span>While </span><i>Covered</i><span> is technically jazz, the trio drifts into R&amp;B while keeping a deliberate pace</span><span>. </span><span>This is light fare and</span><span>, at times, it's easy to forget </span><i>Covered</i><span> is playing, which feels strange for a Glasper project. Aside from the playful ""In Case You Forgot"", in which Glasper interpolates a moment of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" before letting it crash into a heap to audience chuckles, there isn't a lot of energy here. Some of these arrangements are hampered by the overly meditative vibe, and the album feels tedious in certain spots. The trio covers Radiohead's </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOoCixFA8OI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Reckoner""</span></a><span> and John Legend's </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1Zl3BbLCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Good Morning""</span></a><span>, but the versions feel flat without the original vocals and hew too closely to the studio recordings. In a way, </span><i>Covered</i><span> suffers because of the music that came before it: On both </span><i>Black Radio</i><span> editions, Glasper blended the roots of jazz with a sultry R&amp;B ethos, effectively speaking to the Blue Note audience while reaching out to other demographics. </span><i>Covered</i><span> is a decent recording, but unless you attended its live taping and saw the band's interplay in person, it's tough to get invigorated by this.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perhaps that's the point: </span><i>Covered</i><span> seems driven by the need for calm amidst societal chaos. The final song of Glasper's </span><i>Black Radio 2</i><span> was a remake of Stevie Wonder's ""Jesus Children of America"", dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn. Glasper makes similar reflections with </span><i>Covered</i><span>—on ""Got Over"", a brief interlude in which actor/activist Harry Belafonte ponders his journey as a black man in the United States, and on the album's final track, a remix of Kendrick Lamar's ""I'm Dying of Thirst"", which doubles as an extended roll call of minorities killed by police. It's a sobering end to a reflective record, and a conclusion that properly advocates for the importance of black life. As current events spiral out of control, even Glasper had to slow down for a moment.</span></p></div>"|20573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20573-covered/|6.7|Marcus J. Moore

He also performs alone: on his last solo ventures—2012's <a href=""https://dust-editions.bandcamp.com/album/dreamless-sleep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dreamless Sleep</i></a> and <a href=""https://dust-editions.bandcamp.com/album/night-dust"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Night Dust</i></a>—he used guitars, but ones that were so heavily processed and reconfigured that it wasn't obvious what they were on first or subsequent listens. In a recent <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/10/barn-owl-evan-caminiti-interview-meridian-modular-synth/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Fact he commented on this increased tweaking of the instrument: ""I got to a point where I was running it through so many effects pedals that it was basically not even a guitar anymore.""</p>
<p>Which leads us to Caminiti's fifth solo album, <i>Meridian</i>, which he composed and performed on modular synthesizer, working in subtle beats, bass tones, hushed noise, and blackened field recordings (you'll have a hard time picking out the field recordings, though, unless we're to assume they were all recorded in a cave in Hell). It's a tight 41 minutes, each of the nine songs featuring a one-word title that evokes the shape or overall texture of a piece (""Arc"", ""Steam""), the dark eeriness of the album as a whole (""Overtaken"", ""Curtains""), or the song's ostensible emotional state (""Collapse"").</p>
<p>Caminiti has said this material emerged from performing—which he does with live electronics, not a laptop—and that the album's meant to be played loud, so the pulses course through your body. (The title ""Meridian"" ostensibly references the idea of energy's movement through the body on paths called meridians.) It does work in this regard, but you can also listen closely with headphones; this way, the compositions feel endlessly deep. Many—foggy and droning, always sparkling and elegant—evoke horror films, but not at the moment of attack; it's more the calm seconds after the worst has finally happened and you, as the viewer, feel a sense of relief alongside your quickened pulse. And not all of it's spooky. On his <a href=""https://dust-editions.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>, Caminiti tags the music ""devotional,"" ""ambient,"" ""electronic,"" ""experimental,"" and ""noise,"" and the word that makes the most sense to me from that list is ""devotional.""</p>
<p>The tracks here are stately and patient. They drift and never feel rushed, and it's easy to lose yourself in them and leave your surroundings a bit while listening. That said, some of it, like the swaggering mid-section of ""Collapse"", could almost inspire dancing. The noisier ""Excelsior"" threatens to wake up the neighbors. At times, the tracks are lullabies for dreaming about plastic sheep and at others, they are Tangerine Nightmares.</p>
<p>Many of the songs on <i>Meridian</i> get louder as they go along, but none lose their ghostly, not-all-there vibe. (The song ""Steam"" really does sound like steam.) Some of the songs may even leave you thinking they could use another element, but in the end, it's nice that they remain as spare as they do, the edges left soft and fuzzy, the way you see things in the dark.</p></div>"|20698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20698-meridian/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

At this point, the Toronto band is basically a heavy guitar pop group fronted by the unmistakable hardcore bark of Damian ""Pink Eyes"" Abraham. They're hardcore in spirit and attitude and Wikipedia entry only: 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19400-fucked-up-glass-boys/""><i>Glass Boys</i></a> was more digital-age <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2891-minor-threat/"">Minor Threat</a> (and the same goes for 2011’s hour-plus rock opera <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/""><i>David Comes to Life</i></a>, really).</p>
<p>As far as living up to their name, it's in their ongoing Zodiac series where they let the freak flag fly. Since 2006's <i>Year of the Dog</i>, they've released an EP (sometimes only ""EP"" in name) once every 12 months or so featuring music inspired by different years of the Chinese calendar. These songs are often long and more experimental. The seventh in the series<i>, Year of the Hare</i>, includes a 21-minute title track that was written and recorded in 2013 and a eight-minute B-side recorded in 2014. The cover art was designed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> frontman Jake Bannon, who's released <i>Year of the Hare</i> on his <a href=""http://www.deathwishinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deathwish</a> imprint, but this music isn't especially heavy.</p>
<p>Instead, it sounds like the kind of outsider psychedelia that may have popped up on a weirdo imprint like <a href=""http://siltbreezerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Siltbreeze</a> at some point in the '90s alongside <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strapping_Fieldhands"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Strapping Fieldhands</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/"">Harry Pussy</a>. The B-side, ""California Cold"", actually made me think of psyched-out noise-freaks <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/419880-Temple-of-Bon-Matin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temple of Bon Matin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a> for the first time in awhile. The vocals are hazy and occasionally buried, the guitars reminiscent of a blown-out ""Free Bird"". There are shakers, saxophone, and flute. It's a lusciously murky offering, one that works as an anthem before folding in on itself and breaking apart in interesting ways, and overall is the stronger of the songs here.</p>
<p>The title track finds them experimenting with the process of recording itself. ""Year of the Hare"" starts in silence for two minutes before an acoustic guitar strums and the song slowly picks up pace. But throughout these 21 minutes, tape is spliced and edits are intentionally obvious: you get the sound of a cable unplugging (and the connection being reestablished), an empty studio layered over and over, a plaintive piano starting and stopping and warping, music skidding out into a dead-end and then negotiating a new climax. ""Year of the Hare"" feels, at times, very much like their version of a modern-classical experiment: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a> collaborating with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_of_Today"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Youth of Today</a>. It's not until about the six-minute mark when they allow themselves to go full bore into the song, and here it becomes an enjoyable Fucked Up anthem. Though, after repeat listens, it remains unclear if you really needed to go through the rest to experience that rush.</p>
<p>Abraham and guest vocalist Isla Craig sing<span>—</span>at different times, it's more like Act I and Act II than a duet<span>—</span>about various rabbits, from the popular culture of <i>Alice of Wonderland</i> (""There's only one way to stop a mad watch"") to the kind you find in your backyard. There are ""hare/hair/heir"" puns and references to endless fucking and endless proliferating. These lyrics were written by guitarist and producer Mike Haliechuk, who has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59822-fucked-up-share-year-of-the-hare-interactive-video/"">said</a> that the song ""focuses on time, and becoming lost in it. The modern way of life, getting stuck in time-sucking gadgets and trends, stress and scheduling.""</p>
<p>The song itself is circular, finishing how it began; it feels very much like an endless loop, Abraham howling somewhere in the middle: ""Mad as a march hare, two days late/ They stole all my time and ate all my space/ A thousand rabbits with a million heirs/ It's always tea time in the year of the hare."" The track was accompanied by an unsolvable interactive <a href=""http://yearofthehare.fuckedup.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> that features an office worker being haunted by rabbits on the subway, in his office, and at home. I couldn't get the video to work properly, so just kept refreshing my browser, until I started to wonder if that's actually what they wanted me to do. </p>
<p>All of this is admirable enough, even if, at this point, the commentary is a bit obvious. But hey, Fucked Up have continued to stretch and find new ways to carry on, and for a hardcore group that formed in 2001, this is worthy of respect. Doubling down on all of this, the band is about to go out on a Zodiac-themed tour, performing Zodiac songs (some never before performed live) as a nine-piece featuring all the members of the group, Doomsquad.</p>
<p>You have to wonder, though, if it isn't time to scale back a little, and to find complexities in a more compact approach. You can add layers and length endlessly, but that often dilutes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12469-chinese-democracy/""><i>Chinese Democracy</i></a> vs. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite_for_Destruction"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Appetite for Destruction</i></a>, if you will). Sometimes a power trio is more than enough. Because while ""Year of the Hare"" offers nice sounds and concepts, it essentially works best as background music. All said, I'm not sure if background music's what I want from a band who, on more than one occasion, literally caused the hair on my neck to stand up.</p></div>"|20607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20607-year-of-the-hare-ep/|6.0|Brandon Stosuy

You might not know who Norbert Putnam is, or Pig Robbins, or Kenny Buttrey, or Buddy Spicher, but odds are you’ve heard them on records by the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/""><span>Byrds</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/""><span>Neil Young</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17325-joan-baez/""><span>Joan Baez</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23480-the-steve-miller-band/""><span>Steve Miller</span></a><span>, three of the four solo </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/""><span>Beatles</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/648-jj-cale/""><span>J.J. Cale</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5702-simon-garfunkel/""><span>Simon &amp; Garfunkel</span></a><span>, among others.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""The Nashville Cats"" was a name applied retroactively to this scene by the Country Music Hall of Fame to lend shape and specificity to the moment. The new compilation <i>Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City </i>is a 36-track companion piece to the Hall of Fame's <a href=""http://countrymusichalloffame.org/exhibits/exhibitdetail/dylan-cash-and-the-nashville-cats-a-new-music-city"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibit of the same name</a>, and while the release is a little confusing to unpack, it doesn't diminish the power of the music contained in it. These songs are credited to well-known stars, but in this setting their names are less important than the ones behind them. Casually blurring the lines between country and rock, these session players helped to redefine pop music away from its coastal loci and re-settle it just north of the Deep South.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Blonde on Blonde</i><span> was the scene’s big bang: In 1966, Dylan decamped to Nashville to record at the CBS studios, hiring mostly local musicians to flesh out songs for what would become one of his best records. This was unusual at the time, as the only people making albums in the country music capital of the world were country musicians. Still, few could argue with the results, then or now. Representing that breakthrough album here </span><span>is ""Absolutely Sweet Marie"", which sounds newly punchy in this context, with that crackling organ groove acting as a sly parody perhaps of the entire L.A. scene. In Dylan’s wake, more and more artists flew into Nashville for sessions, some with only a tenuous connection to ""country."" They might have sounded like mere tourists in Music City were it not for the so-called Cats who sound alternately funky and stately, majestic and gutterbound, lowdown and high lonesome.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Many of these tracks are familiar to anyone with even a passing knowledge of rock history, but even the most popular tunes sound fresh in this context, as the session players push new sounds to the forefront. The ambient jaw harp on </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/""><span>Leonard Cohen</span></a><span>’s ""Bird on the Wire"" pops and crackles with a new vibrancy, lending the song an off-kilter edge. The song quietly malfunctions even as Cohen sings it. Dylan and Cash exert a heavy influence, with six tracks between them—including the duet ""Girl from the North Country"", and Cash emerges as a genially paternal figure, encouraging a new generation to push the boundaries of both country and rock.  It’s hard to imagine a man better suited to act as an ambassador.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Many artists went to Nashville specifically to cover Dylan, and the well-chosen covers here</span><span> show how his impressionistic lyrics gave session players license to invent new flourishes. The folk duo Ian &amp; Sylvia brighten up his composition ""This Wheel’s on Fire"" even as the musicians instill the arrangement with subtle foreboding, as though they’ve spotted some ruination on the horizon. And the Byrds’ cover of ""You Ain’t Going Nowhere"" sounds both regal and randy, thanks to the way Lloyd Green’s spry pedal steel trips lustily around the song.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d4271e18-fd55-6c5d-c2da-2d3e1c9a3f2b""><i>Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats</i><span> makes a fine primer on country rock, although fans steeped in the genre may find some of it redundant. While the compilers might have hunted for lesser-known or unreleased tracks (the only exclusive is an alternate take on Dylan’s ""If Not For You""), the bigger shortcoming is the lack of info on the individual session musicians in the liner notes. There’s very little about Buttrey, Spicher, Putnam, and their fellow Cats in the packaging, not even a listing of who plays on which songs. It doesn’t detract from the music, but such an oversight is odd considering how thoroughly the exhibit itself documents them individually. Like any good catalog, however, this album is an extension of the exhibit, not a substitute. Perhaps the best way to hear it is on your way to or from the Hall of Fame, where the exhibit is up through the end of 2016. </span></span></p></div>"|20696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20696-dylan-cash-and-the-nashville-cats-a-new-music-city/|7.7|Stephen M.

And that's as much to do with the fact that the Unicorns' first and only widely released album was a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/music/cold-fusion-montreals-explosive-music-scene.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">zeitgeist</a>-defining <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19685-the-unicorns-who-will-cut-our-hair-when-were-gone/"">masterwork</a> as the fact that its unwieldy art-pop presented a yarn ball's worth of ideas—prog fantasias, pop harmonies, garage rock, synth-freaked funk, horror-movie soundtracks—that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6004-th-corn-gangg/"">each</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2148-islands/"">of</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12142-moody-motorcycle/"">Thorburn's</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"">subsequent</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15752-i-am-an-attic/"">projects</a> have untangled and laid out in an orderly, linear fashion. While the scenery behind him has routinely changed, Thorburn's voice has retained its childlike sense of wonder and mischief, establishing a through line that connects his present-day pursuits to his former flagship band.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And that ""former"" tag apparently still applies—while the Unicorns got back together to play select dates in 2014, the reunion has yet to yield any concrete plans for new recordings. (The fact that Thorburn and songwriting foil Alden Penner seem to now be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40873-michael-cera-joins-mister-heavenly/"">sharing</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59411-the-unicorns-alden-penner-teams-with-michael-cera-for-new-ep-and-tour/""><span>custody</span></a> of Michael Cera suggests the lines of communication between the two remain open.) As ever, Thorburn quickly moved onto the next thing, and then the thing after that: coming off his gig soundtracking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57125-nick-thorburn-the-unicorns-islands-shares-music-from-this-american-life-spinoff-serial/""><span>last fall's most-talked-about podcast</span></a>, he's swiftly re-emerged with his second solo album. But <i>City of Quartz</i> feels less like a continuation of 2011's intimate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15752-i-am-an-attic/""><i>I Am an Attic</i></a> than the aftershock of a summer spent relearning how to play <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BcT3jQl9h0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tuff Ghost""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGrt-wj3_RQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Mountain""</a>. Quite simply, this is the closest Thorburn's post-Unicorns work has come to recreating that band's self-contained, fantastical sound world—the raucous live-band energy of old may be displaced by a hermetic one-man studio operation, but that uncanny balance of quirky and creepy remains.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As an album title, </span><i>City of Quartz</i><span> makes for a great video game name, and the synthesizer symphony comprising its title track serves as the record's welcome-screen song, suggesting entry into some imaginary dimension. The vibe of </span><i>City of Quartz</i><span> is low-lit and obsessive, the sound of Thorburn tinkering with pawn-shop machines in the dead of night beneath a flickering bulb. This is pop music made with synthesizers, but it's not what you'd call normally synth-pop—even when Diamonds builds his minimalist beats into proper grooves, the songs are tense and twitchy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But within </span><i>City of Quartz</i><span>'s claustrophobic confines, Thorburn is dreaming of life outside his cellar door. He spends much of the album chasing the sun, pondering the mysteries of the moon, and celebrating a love the size of an ocean: ""Like a wave, I crash into you all day,"" he professes on the winsome tropical pop of ""Bohemian Groove"", conjuring both the uncontrollable rush of romance and its often messy aftermath. Meanwhile, the kaleidoscopic highlight ""Witch Window"" paints nostalgic scenes of kids sneaking off through bedroom windows as a metaphor for escape from our adult-life dramas and traumas: ""these wounds do not betray my suffering today/ they are a triumph over death and decay,"" Thorburn sings, over a soothing organ drone.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9d22ae6e-eb61-1eb8-ee98-e99fada57c55"">They're the sort of affirming moments that makes you wish Thorburn would let the light in more often. The album suffers from pacing problems: The biggest bangers—the frisky, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a> funk of ""Love Is Stranger"" and the Charlie Manson-sampling instrumental jam ""I'm Nobody""—are positioned near the beginning and end, while the space in between is given over to simmered-down set pieces that drag down the album's momentum. But the closing ""God Internet"" provides a perfect composite of what <i>City of Quartz</i> does so well, offsetting digitally rendered grandiosity with interior-monologue musings. ""Open a windowpane/ I don't feel nothing anymore,"" Thorburn offers by way of farewell, ""just calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm..."" But, true to form, even this seeming moment of bliss is laced with unease—because you're not quite sure if he's talking about escaping from his room or into his browser. </span></p></div>"|20623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20623-city-of-quartz/|6.8|Stuart Berman

It was an important record for the producer, bringing the kind of credibility he never found making more commercial house as Rune RK. He titled the album after his birth year, and it was also a means of working through complicated childhood memories. Born to a German mother and an Irish father, Kölsch's upbringing was split between Copenhagen's anarchic Christiana district, a hippie commune, and his grandparents' upscale digs in Germany. He frequently felt like a fish out of water, and he responded by creating an imaginary world; <i>1977</i>, he says, was based on ""these weird ideas and concepts I had on my mind at the time.""</p>
<p>From its title, we can guess that <i>1983 </i>also mines childhood for inspiration. Like Kölsch's previous album, this one is primarily instrumental, but there are clues to incidents in his past. The lyrics to ""Bloodline"", a bittersweet anthem sung by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29595-whomadewho/"">WhoMadeWho</a>'s Tomas Hoeffding, sketch the outlines of an unspoken trauma. In ""Papageno 30 Years Later"", vocalist Waa Industry channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony</a>'s fluttering falsetto as he admits, ""It feels right to be falling apart""—a nod, Kölsch has said, to an incident in his youth when he was made acutely aware that he didn't fit into polite society. And then there's ""Die Anderen"", a wistful fusion of gliding tech-house with classical piano whose title translates as ""The Other"".</p>
<p>Kompakt co-founder Michael Mayer is fond of saying that the label is ""pro-sadness on the dancefloor,"" so Kölsch is clearly right at home. But despite its melancholy undercurrents, <i>1983</i> looks to dance for catharsis. To achieve these ends, Kölsch has a specific formula down pat, and his songs tend to feel like variations upon a single structure: stately eight-bar chord progressions fleshed out with cycling arpeggios and yearning, contrapuntal melodies. He's fond of fat, meaty keyboard sounds, rich with harmonics—supersaw leads, organs, pianos—and he's got a way of stacking his sounds so that they colonize the entire spectrum, from the rumbling bass in your gut to the shimmering stars in your eyes. While they're unabashedly emotional, the tracks are also marked by restraint. A typical Kölsch song comprises no more than a handful of moving parts, and there are no choruses or bridges, just hypnotic phrases that gently rise and fall. Unusually for main-room dance music, he goes light on the drums, letting his synths do most of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>A sense of déjà vu permeates much of the album. The driving string melody of ""Talbot""—it's one of a handful of songs featuring Gregor Schwellenbach, a classical musician who has <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/gregor_schwellenbach_spielt_20_jahre_kompakt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-recorded</a> a number of Kompakt classics for chamber instruments—echoes Rhythim Is Rhythim's iconic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GnFvdaEl2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strings of Life""</a>. The ascending synthesizer line in ""Paces"" is reminiscent of the rising-and-falling melody of Octave One's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmg_DtZ0Scw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Water""</a>. And the pumping pianos of ""Cassiopeia"" could be an homage to Westbam and Nena's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxndKNHFg8E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oldschool, Baby (Piano Mix)""</a>, a feel-good piano-house anthem that Michael Mayer included on his Fabric mix CD in 2003.</p>
<p>But that sense of déjà vu also extends to Kölsch's own catalog. Like his last record, <i>1983</i> features a couple of sensitive vocal numbers, one resonant piano-house hook, and scads of buzzing major chords, and by the end, the songs begin to blur together. On an album of 13 tracks, it would have been nice to have a few that don't follow the same template. Still, there's no doubting Kölsch's mastery of his chosen style, and a few of the album's cuts—like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>-influenced ""The Road"", or the Border Community-inspired ""Two Birds""—are as compelling as anything in Kompakt's recent catalog. For fans of sadness on the dancefloor, <i>1983 </i>is a fine reason to keep the hanky handy.</p></div>"|20676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20676-1983/|6.5|Philip Sherburne

She helped inspired fashion trends, paved the way for similar solo singers, and—most impressively—outlasted all of her competition, adapting to new styles that helped her stay fresh to the often-fickle Japanese casual music consumer. Beginning her career in the <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZBavHrUhuP8?t=1m16s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">highly goofy</a> group Super Monkey's, she went solo after label higher-ups singled her out, and she rose to prominence through a mix of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L88wQ8iSff0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dance numbers</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQMfyE1nsI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ballads</a>. Since, she's glided from R&amp;B to poppy hip-hop.  She's an unknown entity Stateside—well, at least to those who didn't <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nd5Ce_RXbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watch Toonami daily</a>—but huge in Asia. In Japan, at least, she really has nothing left to prove.</p>
<p>This January, Japanese publication <i>Business Journal</i> <a href=""http://aramajapan.com/news/gossip/namie-amuro-rumored-to-be-planning-american-debut/16047/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> that Amuro bought a house in Los Angeles and is preparing to take a shot at the American market. Her 13th album, <i>_genic</i>, is not quite that bid for American domination: It hasn't been backed by a media blitz or hyped-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17502-diplo-cl-riff-raff-and-og-maco-doctor-pepper/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">collaborations</a>. It isn't even available in the States yet, though the rest of her discography hitting iTunes hints that it eventually will be. Yet the album still implies a shift in approach. Amuro sings mostly in English, and teamed up with a couple well-known Western producers, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22173-david-guetta/"">David Guetta</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, she has tacked towards EDM, but where recent attempts have felt like cheap replicas,  <i>_genic</i> sounds more inspired and confident. ""Time Has Come"" sells the drama of wanting to escape ""this sleeping town"" via sudden tempo changes, while ""Stranger"" delivers a stuttering hook, adding an element of welcome unease. (At one point, EDM wonderkid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32956-zedd/"">Zedd</a>, who <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80S59RatDUA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">provided a song</a> for Amuro's last album, was rumored to be the producer behind the song ""Stranger"", but his name is nowhere to be found in the notes.)</p>
<p>Amuro stumbles at various points, such as on ""Every Woman"", a well-intentioned but awkward empowerment anthem, and the love-as-schoolyard whistler ""It"". The album's big Guetta collaboration, relegated to the bonus track ""What I Did for Love"", is its most formulaic number. The other big tripping point is Amuro's decision to primarily sing in English, a choice she made three albums ago. Her English-speaking fans tend to mock her relentlessly for this, and at times she slips over pronunciation. Yet her lyrics have never been a high point even in Japanese, and on <i>_genic</i> she delivers her words directly and with a confidence that smooths over any small mistakes.</p>
<p>Then there is ""B Who I Want 2 Be"", one of the weirder songs to grace a major-label pop album in 2015. Many would glance at the credits and assume it stands out because of PC Music-affiliated producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">Sophie</a>. The song boasts his signature artificial fizz, but it's his decision to leave plenty of space for the singers that ends up his best move. That's because ""2 B"" finds Amuro dueting with singing-synthesizer avatar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/345-hatsune-miku/"">Hatsune Miku</a>, though the way Vocaloid artist Mitchie M tunes her results in a song where the two singers blur into one digi-voice. There's a definite <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Uncanny Valley</a> vibe, but everything clicks together just right to create a disorientingly catchy number.</p>
<p>Still, <i>_genic</i>'s best moment is its most straightforward. ""Golden Touch"" breakbeats forward, every few seconds leading to synths that burst like fireworks over the song. It all builds to one of the most joyful choruses of Amuro's career, the sort of hook begging to be blasted by passing cars. It's song-of-the-summer material thanks to its directness, mirrored by an equally lighthearted and effective <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_UhKcAy6xc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>. It's great pop because no one involved sounds like they're worrying about how to tailor her music to new audiences. If Amuro ever takes advantage of her new digs and tries to debut properly in the U.S., she should try to hold onto the simplicity of this feeling.</p></div>"|20730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20730-_genic/|6.7|Patrick St. Michel

In his singles, albums, and remixes, the immersive sensation of shoegaze and psychedelia meets the pointillist precision of minimal techno. So while his affinity for beautiful surface textures conjures feelings of drifting ecstasy, his crisp percussion and fondness for 4/4 propulsion concentrates those airy feelings into diamond-hard bursts. His music can get disorienting and even a bit creepy, but the darker effects feel more like the inevitable result of wandering, like a child taking a wrong turn in one of Grimm's fairy tales. At heart, Koze's music is warm and joyous, designed to make you feel good.</p>
<p>There's a strange kind of alchemy at work on the best DJ mixes, where the sensibility of the music and the connections between the tracks have so much integrity that it's if the person mixing made the music on their own. Koze's entry in the long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=dj-kicks"">series</a> is remarkable not just because it's structured so well and flows so seamlessly as an album, but also because it offers insight into its mixer's mind, and feels a bit like an autobiography in sound. As it moves from a front half heavy on blunted hip-hop (as a kid in the '80s, Koze was a competitive hip-hop DJ) into deliciously weird singer-songwriter turns and finally ends with gorgeous selections of gentle house and techno, you begin to hear Koze's music emerge out of the music of others. Along the way, he tinkers subtly with the tracks, transforming them via remixes and edits to make the whole feel like one long suite.</p>
<p>In the record's early stretch, Koze draws heavily from the <a href=""https://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> catalog. On the evidence here, he favors producers that can isolate samples from the '60s and '70s—a guitar pattern, a swoop of strings—and warp them into a hypnotic loop that offers a kind of commentary on sound and memory. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> is one master of this approach, and Koze includes the former's collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"">Freddie Gibbs</a>, ""Shame"", along with his beat on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28575-strong-arm-steady/"">Strong Arm Steady</a>'s ""Best of Times"". But work from <a href=""https://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mndsgn</a> and Swiss producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28672-dimlite/"">Dimlite</a> mine a similar vein, a woozy post-Dilla environment heavy on groove with a deep interest in sonic detail.</p>
<p>The first half also shows Koze's fondness for expressive, unusual voices. On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/781-clouddead/"">cLOUDDEAD</a>'s ""Dead Dogs Two"", verses sit uneasily between nerd-rap and twee, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30228-homeboy-sandman/"">Homeboy Sandman</a>'s vocals on ""Holiday"" sound more like one half of a slurred conversation than a declaration. The slapback echo of Trish Keenan's vocals on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>'s ""Tears in the Typing Pool"" dislodge the song from time, making it resemble a '60s-era Disney animated feature rather than a 2005 album on <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>. And the mash-up of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a> side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28740-the-2-bears/"">the 2 Bears</a> with an instrumental from Cincinnati producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4971-hi-tek/"">Hi-Tek</a>, putting the bedroom soul vocals front and center, offers the perfect transition from the album's beat-head opening to the dreamier electronics that come later.</p>
<p>The set builds and becomes more interesting as it goes, and Koze takes a firmer hand, tweaking house tracks by <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sessionvictim"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Session Victim</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32620-frank-tony/"">Frank &amp; Tony</a>, and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/marcel-fengler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marcel Fengler</a> to bring out their inner Koze-ness. The moment late in Fengler's ""Jaz"", when the sleek techno opens into a clearing and the wistful piano of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32653-portable/"">Portable</a>'s 2014 masterpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17237-portable-surrender/"">""Surrender""</a> enters, is one of the most breathtaking mix segues in recent memory. And the fact that Koze can make a William Shatner song produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15117-ben-folds/"">Ben Folds</a> (""It Hasn't Happened Yet"", from Shatner's 2004 album <i>Has Been</i>) sound logical in this context is a testament to his magical ear.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_A._Cummings"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marker Starling</a>'s ""In Stride"", another odd highlight, like the Broadcast cut, sounds like it could come from one of four different decades, but it actually came out in 2010 on <a href=""http://www.tinangelrecords.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tin Angel</a>. It's easy to assume that lovely songs like this, first released on a small indie label during a time of vast musical abundance, are easily lost forever, banished to the forgotten tip of the long tail. But Koze finds home for these misfit songs, and by doing so gets you thinking about possibilities, what else that might be out there waiting to be rediscovered.</p></div>"|20677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20677-dj-kicks/|8.0|Mark Richardson

In the weeks leading up to the release of High on Fire’s masterful seventh album, <i>Luminiferous</i>, listeners began to notice that the singer’s long-latent suspicions and esoteric interests had morphed at last into legitimate conspiracy theories. During ""The Black Plot"", the album’s exuberant opener and first tease, Pike grunts about the need to hide your mind because of nearby aliens and relents to the damage an evil global scheme has already caused. During subsequent browbeater ""The Sunless Years"", Pike growls about dropping acid, spotting satellites, and huffing chemtrails. ""Someone please tell them,"" he shouts mid-verse, ""this is our fucking lives."" When <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/high-on-fire-talk-aliens-acid-trips-and-why-new-album-doesnt-suck-20150608"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i> asked Pike about those ideas</a>, he reinforced them rather than recant: a book by noted <a href=""http://www.vice.com/video/david-icke-and-the-lizard-apocalypse"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">snake oil salesman David Icke</a> had opened his eyes. 9/11 was an inside job. And the aliens built both the ziggurats and pyramids. “Dude, I say a lot of fucked-up shit!” Pike admitted. As it does, <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/06/09/high-on-fires-matt-pike-is-a-conspiracy-theorist/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the metal Internet laughed online</a>.</p>
<p>But if that’s the stuff that drives Pike and his increasingly volatile and complex rhythm section to play with the gumption and zeal of <i>Luminiferous</i>, so be it. These nine tracks are among the most enthusiastic and bracing of High on Fire’s career, with mammoth riffs and hooks spurred on by a momentous band. <i>Luminiferous</i> feels like a classic compendium of High on Fire’s successes. There are mid-tempo marches, like the arching wallop of ""The Falconist"", and breathless moments that push the accelerator on doom metal until the pedal seems to stick, like the clawing ""The Dark Side of the Compass"" and the irrepressible ""The Black Plot"".</p>
<p>The parts themselves have never sounded better. Pike, who supplies a solo for every song, is an audacious, unapologetic leader. Drummer Des Kensel has become an exceptional drummer, able to shoehorn blast beats inside weighted sludge riffs and actually swing through the most straightforward moments. Bassist Jeff Matz is an expert at interlocking with both sides, sharing the load of the riffs and the rhythms until they’re all too big to resist. Now approaching their second decade as a consistent trio, High on Fire’s interplay has become a marvel. To wit, Pike’s set of brief solos during ""The Falconist""—and the way Kensel and Matz subtract and add time around it—warrants jazz-level scholarship.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Luminiferous </i>is at its best when High on Fire seem to be preaching about these zany ideas, as if Pike has some great revelation that must be shared with his disciples. ""Slave the Hive"", for instance, ricochets between hardcore built by a doom metal toolkit and shout-out-loud classic rock played by madmen on speed. ""They got us wired to the reptile brain,"" the band howls during the hook. ""Your life is not the same. This world is insane."" It’s the kind of silly, serious rallying cry that’s meant to be yelled back at the band onstage, even if you don’t buy it. That infectious feeling applies to the relentless title track, too, a pick-sliding monster that reaches back to the days of punk-and-metal crossover to lecture on <a href=""http://www.whydontyoutrythis.com/2013/08/440hz-music-conspiracy-to-detune-good-vibrations-from-natural-432hz.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theories of Hertz-based mind control</a> and the deeds of white-wigged barristers. Pike unleashes soul-scraping yells between the verses and over the coda. It is a quasi-religious paroxysm; he’s hollering about despising government overlords the way a gospel shouter might scream about loving the Lord.</p>
<p>Every number on <i>Luminiferous</i>—and for the most part, in High on Fire’s entire collection—begins with some jolt, be it a heavy drum roll from Kensel or a big swipe at the guitar from Pike. But late into this album, High on Fire take one of their most unlikely detours ever, opening ""The Cave"" with a pensive bass solo and colorful clouds of textural abstraction. Acoustic guitar trots along to a steady beat, and Pike legitimately croons lines about putting life, the road, and even conspiracy theories on hold long enough to fall in love. They seesaw between distorted, supercharged choruses and muted verses, arriving somewhere between a power ballad and a post-grunge acoustic anthem. It suggests broader possibilities for High on Fire than the established strum-churn-and-solo <i>modus operandi</i> and provides a welcome break to this parade of heavy hitters. What’s more, ""The Cave"" indicates that Pike’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39249-sleep-reunite-for-tour/"" target=""_blank"">time in the reunited Sleep</a> has served him well, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEl92SfUv3k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">causing him to slow down</a> and be more than some shirtless 43-year-old dude with tough-guy lyrics. Al Cisneros, ""The Cave"" suggests, is not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sleep’s only surviving master of mood</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sleep, two decades ago, the hard-living Pike couldn’t help keep that band together long enough to release its third album, an epic poem about a mecca made of marijuana. Few might have predicted that, countless narcotic trips later, the now-sober Pike would be one of metal’s most trustworthy bandleaders, fronting a trio so consistent that <i>Luminiferous</i> feels only like the next point in a long line of remarkable records. Yes, High on Fire add a few new tricks here, especially through an enhanced ability to push and pull tempos at will. But for the most part, they remain a powerful trio with perfect chemistry, capable of embedding great hooks and marvels of rhythm section athleticism within riff-worshipping hits. ""Before, I’d be all like, ‘How do we top the last one?’"" Pike told <i>Rolling Stone</i> of <i>Luminiferous </i><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/high-on-fire-talk-aliens-acid-trips-and-why-new-album-doesnt-suck-20150608"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in the same interview</a> that turned him back into a minor metal meme. ""It’s not better—it’s just a different version of myself that I’ve been trying to express all along."" That’s not crazy talk. That’s fact.</p></div>"|20651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20651-luminiferous/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

It's a hard album to pin down, at moments bright and tender, at times as dark and scuzzy, and the contrast helps mitigate the sameness that sometimes plagued their previous efforts.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Beginning with their second LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17916-no-joy-wait-to-pleasure/""><i>Wait to Pleasure</i></a> and continuing through the 2013 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18707-no-joy-pastel-and-pass-out-ep/""><i>Pastel and Pass Out</i></a>, you could hear the band seeking ways to deepen their sound.</span> <i>More Faithful</i> was recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> producer Jorge Elbrecht in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, and there's a little bit of the city and moments of the sea present on nearly every track. ""Moon in My Mouth"", a psyched-out, dreamy track with a swaying, beach-punk riff, showcases singer Jazamine White-Gluz's bright vocals and lulls the listener. It's punk rock taken poolside, city mice taking a break from the harsh squall. The sound is both massive and soft around its edges, layering elements of surf-rock and psychedelia into the harsh din of Laura Lloyd's guitars.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Light and dark are constantly at play across the album's surface, like shadows from moving clouds. Album opener ""Remember Nothing"" is a dissonant, clanging contrast to the mellow vibes of ""Moon"", opening with a fast, hi-hat-reliant drum beat and a muddy riff that wouldn't sound out of place on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> record. Then the vocals enter, and leaven the murk with a hint of tenderness. ""Burial in Twos"" starts out spacious and gorgeous, with a wide-open ringing riff and pinging synth hits, before some gristly electric guitars enter and grind their teeth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's a feeling that nothing on the album is accidental. The squealing, careening ""Chalk Snake"", which is so <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>-esque it veers into the realm of pastiche, ends by juxtaposing a high-pitched note of guitar squall with a piano line that almost sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>. It's these subversive little moments that help No Joy avoid the diminishing returns that often plagues shoegazers. And although they're still obviously committed to noise, still praying at the fuzzy altar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, they're a band that's still evolving, and letting a little bit of light in through the cracks has served them well.</p></div>"|20673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20673-more-faithful/|7.6|Maud Deitch

It depicts the late astronaut Christa McAuliffe floating in a zero gravity chamber—a notorious form of training that fellow astronauts have coined ""the vomit comet""—not too long before the 1986 Challenger Disaster which took her life. What's so remarkable about the photo is that McAuliffe doesn't look the least bit sick or discomforted as she coasts, her grin visible under the harsh rays of the sun. ""It's one of the most conflicted things I've ever seen,"" co-founder and guitarist Chris Alfieri said of Meyers' photo (a recreation of which serves as the cover to <i>Settler</i>) in a recent press release, ""to be so happy, at the peak of life, only to have it all gone right after.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Alfieri's statement may scan pessimistic, but it's actually one rooted in joy and amazement. One could argue that a similar philosophy—a vibrant, violent celebration of life in the face of death and destruction—informs the New Hampshire band's output, particularly their 2013 debut full-length </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18504-vattnet-viskar-sky-swallower/""><span><i>Sky Swallower</i></span></a><span>, a transcendental epic that sought to translate nature's fury into devastating pastorals. On that record, the quartet's palette mostly consisted of Norwegian black metal interwoven with sludge and shoegaze; </span><i>Settler</i><span>, its successor, is more atmospheric and strident, operating with mathematical precision and a playwright's eye for tragedy. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The central conflict driving <i>Settler </i>concerns the tenuous relationship between the individual and the infinite, and how to reconcile the stubbornness of life with a harsh, largely indifferent universe. In Alfieri's eyes, the forces of nature are as brilliant and complex as a rocket scientist's thesis, and deserve to be treated as so: hence, we have ""Colony"", a celebratory ode to ants that he penned after reading that <a href=""http://www.aol.com/article/2014/05/27/ant-networks-could-be-more-complex-than-google-algorithms/20893769/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the insects' communication networks are likely more complex than Google algorithms</a>. The band kicks the dust off an anthill to reveal a kicking, screaming utopia of insects, the hive-mind as a supercomputer; the distorted, robotic chants of ""zero"" and ""one"" that overtake the bridge aren't the working of some supercomputer bent on world domination, but rather ""We"" in binary code. This helps ground the album in human experience, and it's a humanity that is further intensified on ""Glory"" as its mournful solo succumbs to a panic attack of dissonant, anxious chords—the aural equivalent, perhaps, of an oxygen shortage. On ""Impact"", barreling drums and stratospheric riffs challenge guitarist/vocalist Nicholas Thornbury's decree of earthly independence—""I stand upon the ground""—by pitching the whole mix into the heavens.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b17b20cc-f793-e33d-9094-8bbc379a8e50""><i>Settler</i>'s life-affirming themes, black metal inflections, and space-age atmospherics (not to mention its decidedly non-brutal cover art) might remind some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/""><i>Sunbather</i></a>, but <i>Settler</i> is sludgier, the melodies more obfuscated, and the vocals grittier and less processed. In fact, the mix proves to be one of the only sticking points for the album. Lo-fi recording methods are perfect for hardcore-leaning bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32123-dodsferd/"">Dodsferd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>, but <i>Settler</i>'s compressed vocals and often-muddied drums put up a significant roadblock to attaining the heights the songs reach for. And yet, despite minor stumbles, <i>Settler</i> manages to find its way back into orbit, coasting along at the perfect pace for the duration of the 40-minute, eight-track runtime. Vattnet Viskar may have huge imaginations, but they temper this drive far better than most of their peers, and, in a sense, accomplish the impossible with a galactic epic that doesn’t have to travel light years to make its point.</span></p></div>"|20601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20601-settler/|7.4|Zoe Camp

Princess Chelsea, the songwriting project of Auckland-based singer Chelsea Nikkel, enters the fray with her second album, <i>The Great Cybernetic Depression</i>. Singing in a light deadpan against wild, bright production, Chelsea doesn't decry the Internet outright, nor does she revel in its potential utopianism. She skirts both easy roads to present an album whose lyrical content cuts hard lines against its pastel hues.</p>
<p><i>The Great Cybernetic Depression</i> allegedly takes place 10 years in the future, when human relationships are even shallower and more atomized than they are now. The feeling of scrolling through a potential love interest's Instagram for half an hour hangs thick over the album's atmosphere; Chelsea packs anxiety flat and slick into her disaffected delivery. There is longing here, and it comes through in lyrics like ""I will love you from far away/ Just not quite enough."" But it never breaks her careful, polished facade.</p>
<p>Formerly Chelsea's partner on the runaway YouTube hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TV_128Fz2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Cigarette Duet""</a>, Jonathan Bree returns for a few more numbers, but instead of lending depth to the album's world, he simply emphasizes its flatness. Bree and Chelsea both sing in easy, back-and-forth melodies, like they're performing a lullaby or the jingle to an instructional video. Even the lyrics tend to stick to monosyllables. The duet ""Is It All OK?"" indulges in some degree of world-building, hinting at an apocalyptic event that decimated the whole planet a decade ago. Crystalline arpeggios roll in waves behind both singers, and the beats branch out, but Chelsea and Bree's voices march on, affectless.</p>
<p>Instead of retreating to guitar and piano as emblems of a pre-computerized past, Chelsea melts both instruments into a synth-heavy mix. She even pushes them to their most comical extremes; ""When the World Turns Grey"" and ""We Were Meant 2 B"" both ripple with hot, sweet guitar solos like something yanked from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1822-guns-n-roses/"">Guns N' Roses</a> songbook and performed by a Guitar Center hopeful. They come out of nowhere, erupting from sugarplum synth decor just in time for you to realize that the songs have been power ballads all along. The space between accelerationist pop music and '80s hair metal has never looked so small.</p>
<p>The album's lead single and clear standout, ""Too Many People"" teeters on the fine edge that the rest of <i>The Great Cybernetic Depression</i> slips around. Chelsea sings of a city packed to the brim with miserable souls as keyboard lines sparkle beneath her, like ""Eleanor Rigby"" recast in Swarovski. Her lyrics are simple and her melodies even simpler, but the song hits like a fable marking an essential truth of her isolated post-urban condition. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">The Beatles</a>' lonely Liverpool became our own lonely laptop screens: a million windows glowing, and none of them unlocked. Princess Chelsea presses something deep and sad between two narrow panes of glass: Everyone is closer to everyone else, but everyone is more scattered by the glut.</p></div>"|20700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20700-the-great-cybernetic-depression/|6.6|Sasha Geffen

But he doesn’t seem to want to be defined by his hip-hop dabbling anymore. Mohawke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9624-this-and-this-and-that-too-is-a-hudson-mohawke-production/"">said as much</a> in conversation with Pitchfork this spring, where he was reticent to even utter the word ""rap."" And so the guiding principle for Mohawke's sophomore album, <i>Lantern</i>, is to showcase his versatility. He’s been pecking away at the record since he got swept up into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a> machine, and it feels like a conscious subversion of everything people might expect to hear from a guy with credits on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18511-drake-nothing-was-the-same/""><i>Nothing Was the Same</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18277-pusha-t-my-name-is-my-name/""><i>My Name Is My Name</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17802-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/""><i>I Am Not a Human Being II</i></a>.</p>
<p>For one, there aren’t any rappers on <i>Lantern</i>. It isn’t your typical producer's showcase, and our maestro doesn’t hide behind a parade of cleverly curated guest features. Only five of the album’s 14 songs bother with vocals at all, and the performers slide neatly into Hud Mo's vehicles, commanding attention as necessary but often hanging back in the mix, another paintbrush by the artist’s easel. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony</a> tiptoes around a napping lover on ""Indian Steps"", while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a> mourns a doomed romance on ""Resistance"". Neither voice raises above a whisper as they bob gently over sparse, swirling arrangements. <i>Lantern</i>’s quieter tracks are broken up with moments of bedlam—Irfane’s helium-voiced lead on ""Very First Breath"" is the calming focal point in a disorienting array of bleating video game keys—and when it gets loud, the album's guest vocalists are terra firma underneath a pulverizing armada of synths.</p>
<p>The album’s more ambitiously orchestrated sections are a rewarding new look for the producer. The widescreen majesty of ""Kettles"" and ""Scud Books"" fully realize a sound Mohawke hinted at years ago with cuts like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wKqgI7Ba9o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shower Melody""</a>, off his 2009 <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a> debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/""><i>Butter</i></a>. ""Kettles"" abandons the idea that Mohawke needs to make electronic music at all, opting for heart-swelling neoclassical instead, before ""Scud Books"" takes everything he tried on the previous song and crams it back into a trap cut. ""Lil Djembe"" picks up Eastern instruments and drops a conventional approach to melody for a two-and-a-half minute excursion that presents one of the few times here Mohawke’s ideas come off better on paper than in execution.</p>
<p><i>Lantern</i>’s risk-taking is daring and giddy, but its favored mode, and Hudson Mohawke’s best, is hooky, crowded, rap-conscious electropop. Lead single ""Ryderz"" employs an old trick from Mohawke’s benefactor Mr. West—overlaying a sped-up soul sample with syrupy embellishments —to heart-busting success. ""Shadows"" assembles an army of 8-bit synths, then runs them through a quick, showy drop for a cheap but mercenary thrill. The album’s closing stretch plays sneaky games with pace. ""Portrait of Luci""’s much-needed breather quickly proves to be a fake-out; ""System"" follows, combining manic keys and a pulsating, insistent kick drum for the album’s most conventionally clubby indulgence before ""Brand New World"" closes things out at half the speed, loud, ratty guitar in tow like an homage to the overdriven brat pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"">Sleigh Bells</a>.</p>
<p>Hudson Mohawke became an EDM circuit sensation sort of by accident three years ago with the success of TNGHT, and he spent the year after that with his hand in a number of 2013’s biggest rap releases. But <i>Lantern</i> finds him wisely darting outside both scenes before anyone gets a chance to pigeonhole him. Scores of great producers settle quickly into an identifiable sound after a big break and proceed to churn out variations on the same song until the calls stop coming. But Mohawke’s puckish eagerness to try new things when the most eyes are trained on him suggests he’s thinking past his next move to the one after that. A less talented hand might’ve faltered juggling six different genres as Mohawke does throughout <i>Lantern</i>, but his knowledge of what gets a crowd moving, coupled with his good cheer in both playing directly to it and coyly holding back as he pleases help keep the album’s experiments a minimum of fun and danceable, but more often shocking and delightful.</p></div>"|20675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20675-lantern/|7.4|Craig Jenkins

During the nine tracks of his trio KEN mode’s sixth album, <i>Success</i>, the acerbic singer lashes out at rules of order, lambasts illusions of intimacy, and lampoons lives of day jobs and cubicle labor. During the slow, seething closer ""Dead Actors"", he asks when you last did something that mattered. But before you even have time to contemplate an answer, he cynically deadpans, ""Does any of it hold any weight?"" Actually, it doesn’t: For the first time, the once-great KEN mode sounds petulant and petty, a band whose irascible aesthetic has corroded into annoyance. On <i>Success</i>, they become the inverse of a futile party band telling an unresponsive crowd to move closer, to dance and have a little fun. Despite all of Matthewson’s rage, and despite some of the most memorable hooks of KEN mode’s career, his ire only ostracizes.</p>
<p>Vitriol has been a consistent component of KEN mode’s discography for a dozen years, as one might expect for a band that took <a href=""http://fightland.vice.com/blog/my-walkout-song---jesse-matthewson-of-ken-mode"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Henry Rollins’ ""Kill Everyone Now"" mantra as a name.</a> During 2011’s <i>Venerable</i>, which earned <a href=""http://www.theprp.com/2012/04/01/news/ken-mode-win-2012-metalhard-music-album-juno-award-for-vulnerable/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Juno Award</a>, Matthewson dubbed religion a marketing scheme and blamed human frailty on social expectation. And on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17608-ken-mode-entrench/""><i>Entrench</i></a>, which netted both Juno and <a href=""http://polarismusicprize.ca/album/entrench/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Polaris nominations</a>, he scorned sentimentality, domestic dreams, and the ways online distractions forestall personal responsibility. In the past, however, Matthewson’s grievances worked as fuel for an explosive and dynamic group, capable of shifting between many manners of belligerence—hardcore and noise rock, death metal and post-punk, doom and drone—in an instant. All that movement shrouded Matthewson’s misanthropy, so the music suggested vague attitudes more than specific ideals. Those records were big, mad messes.</p>
<p>But on <i>Success</i>, recorded in Winnipeg by fellow sourpuss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a>, KEN mode drops most of that variety in favor of the kind of minimal, misanthropic noise rock for which the producer and his peers have long been known. Albini’s clarity as an engineer does them few favors. He pulls back the layers until Matthewson mostly delivers his harangues over a throbbing, blown-out rhythm section, sometimes adding astringent guitar when the chorus comes. The move leaves the listener to focus largely on the frontman’s spoken or screamed lyrics, consisting of not-so-nuanced thoughts on environmental apathy and lifelong depression. The yelled refrain of ""These Tight Jeans""—""Pointless negativity on demand""—becomes an ironic indictment of KEN mode itself.</p>
<p>Unveiled and ineffectual, Matthewson’s gripes get boring quickly. The sense that you’ve heard these songs before—or at least their frameworks and tricks—doesn’t help. The speak-sing rise of ""Dead Actors"" suggests that Albini mailed KEN mode copies of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Hurts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>1000 Hurts</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/""><i>Spiderland</i></a> and told them to connect the dots. With its jarring power-trio plod and hurled existential quandaries, ""A Catalog of Small Disappointments"" seems like a game of ""Show and Tell with Mr. Steve"", where the new pupils prove just how much they’ve paid attention.</p>
<p>Matthewson’s back-and-forth volleys with Jill Clapham during ""These Tight Jeans"" are electrifying, but they seem as scripted and self-aware as the song’s high-wire guitar solo. They’re surefire ways to interrupt the surly, stomping bro-ness of the album at large. While ""The Owl"" gets tough on grunge, the brief, chomping ""I Just Liked Fire"" finds Matthewson doing his best David Yow yowl. (It is also, lo and behold, a song about fucking.) KEN mode’s best moments have been thrilling because they plucked the most invigorating pieces from many different sources and repurposed them with devilish glee. But <i>Success</i> sounds like they’ve spent a year or so stuck in the van, listening to little but a BitTorrent culled from the catalogues of SST, AmRep, Sub Pop, and Touch &amp; Go. This old-school move feels, well, old and ornery.</p>
<p>Over time, the constant needling and kvetching of a band like KEN mode creates a trap: Keep creating the same agitated, aggressive rock that’s already won awards, and run the risk of becoming the kind of bloated parody you’ve spent your career blasting. Or pivot to something new and potentially stumble in the process. On <i>Success</i>, KEN mode’s altered musical approach is the only thing more tiring than Matthewson’s broadsides. They’re ensnared by a decade of talking shit they’re no longer equipped to handle.</p></div>"|20552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20552-success/|5.9|Grayson Haver Currin

During that span of time, the scattered scene they once represented has only receded even further into the past, leaving them unmoored—out of time at best, irrelevant at worst. A decade ago Jason Hammel and Kori Gardner were one of so many co-ed power-pop duos competing for that cold <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9698-music-from-the-oc-mix-6-covering-our-tracks/"">""O.C.""</a> cash: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5526-georgie-james/"">Georgie James</a> out of D.C., the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3624-the-rosebuds/"">Rosebuds</a> out of North Carolina, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2589-the-like-young/"">Like Young</a> from Chicago, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4513-viva-voce/"">Viva Voce</a> from way out in Portland. Most of them were romantically entangled; all of them got by more on energy than on actual hooks.</p>
<p>Few were quite so early to the scene as Mates of State, who hooked up in 1997 and started a band shortly after. At first, they were drums (Hammel) and organ (Gardner), but soon they expanded into synths and programmed beats, even the occasional guitar—all without losing their default setting of aggressively cute. That adaptability might have been their saving grace, as Mates soldiered on while others stumbled. On one hand, they were on the fringe of a postmillennial movement loosely known as ""joycore,"" which tried to make pop exuberance sound radical, if not quite radicalized. But Mates of State made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/212-architecture-in-helsinki/"">Architecture in Helsinki</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1835-the-go-team/"">Go! Team</a> sound like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Fall</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> by comparison, perhaps because their primary subject wasn’t the world around them but the world they made together. Listeners were either charmed or chagrined by the moony eyes they made at each other onstage. Even if they never enjoyed much mainstream success beyond the occasional television soundtrack placement, you can hear their influence in the DIY pop of <a href=""https://youtu.be/vIcCXh2l8JE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karmin</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5805-the-ting-tings/"">Ting Tings</a>, which is not the most enviable legacy. </p>
<p>The tone of this review might sound like an obituary, but Mates of State are far from dead. ""Staring Contest"", the first track on their comeback EP <i>You’re Going to Make It,</i> almost makes a case for this type of precocious blisspop, with its cheeky burbles of synths, its roughhousing-with-the-kids drums, and the intimate interplay between Hammel and Gardner’s vocals. ""I used to be wild!"" they exclaim to each other. ""I’m wild about you!"" The best thing about the song is that they don’t sound like they’re lamenting their mutual domestication, but celebrating it. They’d rather be tamed.</p>
<p>On the very next song, however, they sound too tame—old and curmudgeonly even. ""Beautiful Kids"" is one of those songs that rails against the youngs and their selfie sticks and social medias while bemoaning the death of magazines and stuff. ""You’re always staring into cracked scenes,"" they accuse. ""You should stare into my eyes more."" They build a bridge out of dial tones and cash registers: ""you go click click click…"" It’s one of the most embarrassing musical passages of the year. By comparison, ""I Want to Run"" and ""Gonna Get It"" both play it safe, risking little by relying on that pop ebullience that comes suspiciously easy to them.</p>
<p>Domesticity is one of the great undersung subjects in pop music. The immensity and excitement of new love has inspired countless tunes since forever, and the devastation and misery of dead love has inspired even more. But there are far fewer songs about love that endure and flourish from one comfortable day to the next, through anniversaries and birthdays, through kids and mortgages, through all the hard work that makes a marriage work. <i>You’re Going to Make It</i> makes life sound like one big bouncy castle of fun, and that unquestioned contentment renders Mates of State musically anonymous. By the time Gardner bares her soul on closer ""Sides of Boxes"", the gravity of the situation—her realization that her daughters will grow up and eventually leave—sounds incongruous and disjointed. ""It’s like a cannonball went through our home, you are almost fully grown,"" she sings as the song fades poignantly. It sounds like the start of a compelling album, not the end of an inert EP.</p></div>"|20645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20645-youre-going-to-make-it-ep/|3.9|Stephen M. Deusner

To be fair, Cracknell was originally one among many guest vocalists; the door simply stopped revolving after she walked in. And <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/06/07/412026487/first-listen-sarah-cracknell-red-kite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as has been noted</a>, a band comprised of one female vocalist/lyricist and a couple male producer/pop geeks (in the case of music journalist Bob Stanley, <i>professional</i> pop geeks) leads to certain assumptions about who's contributing what.</p>
<p>But for someone supposedly replaceable, the dozens of sophisto-dance vocalists who've emulated Cracknell make poor auditions. And consider her one-and-a-half solo albums: 1997's <i>Lipslide </i>and 2000's EP <i>Kelly's Locker, </i>released and re-released in various permutations through the years, most recently as part of 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17439-casino-classics-lipslide/"">Casino Classics</a>. Lipslide</i> is stylistically all over the place, and nothing about it should cohere—but the voice is decidedly Cracknell's, and the flourishes both instrumental (string palpitations, synth glissandos, a pervasive lacelike delicacy) and lyrical (dance songs dropped into casually dystopian settings, characters sketched to the tossed-off but telling detail) are clearly of one mind. And then there's Cracknell's <i>literal </i>voice: an instrument tissue-sheer and expensive as silk, which can sound arch, wistful, lived-in and glamorous at once. Even Cracknell's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnBbMdHDsp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nastier patrician tracks</a> end up sounding cozy.</p>
<p>""Cozy"" is how Cracknell <a href=""http://www.mtviggy.com/articles/saint-etienne-sarah-cracknell-red-kite-2015-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">describes</a> <i>Red Kite</i>, her first major solo project in 15 years. Recorded in a barn by her house and inspired by the surrounding countryside, <i>Red Kite </i>at times evokes the wispy folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14255-tiger-bay-finisterre/""><i>Tiger Bay </i></a>and its B-sides, or the quieter moments on <i>Lipslide. </i>Like Saint Etienne, it's quite conscious of its<i> </i>antecedents, from the pastel '60s pop Saint Etienne's perennially besotted with, to the decidedly English folk of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandy Denny</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>. In Cracknell's discography, though, the album stands apart,<i> </i>pastoral where <i>Lipslide </i>was glossy, homespun where Saint Etienne were sophisticated. Produced by Carwyn Ellis, the album sounds comfortably lived-in upon first listen—the lilting first few notes of ""On the Swings"", the gentle ""In the Dark"". Cracknell's voice, more than a decade on, has lost none of its luster, save a world-weary undertone that's developed, most notably on ""The Mutineer"".</p>
<p>Cracknell writes characters, not autobiography; for every track that seems to deliberately play on her public image, like the mysterious, unattainable woman swooned after on ""On the Swings"", there are five more about people so scripted or surveilled or artfully moody they could only exist in another, slightly more cinematic world than ours. Where <i>Red Kite </i>differs from Cracknell and Saint Etienne's more typical work is scope. ""I Close My Eyes"" follows a woman on the underground and slips, <i><a href=""http://www.ryman-novel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">253</a></i><a href=""http://www.ryman-novel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">-style</a>, into her private reveries. As reveries go, they're low-drama, mostly about being ambivalently single, and the lyrics would be banal on paper: ""never wanted to commit, but you never know."" The drama's in what goes unvoiced; in the way the steady plod of the train commingles with the violins and descants conjured up around it, evoking a haunting, romantic interiority.</p>
<p>Muted <i>Red Kite </i>may be, but it is not dour. ""Hearts Are for Breaking"" is a sparkling, cruel indi pop song—a love triangle, sleek as the instrument and pointed as the shape—that a hundred acts, starting with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a>, could covet. In this same vein is ""Nothing Left to Talk About"", which takes a decidedly unromantic premise—the lovelorn narrator of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biKRfFb-pCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""4 Months, 2 Weeks""</a> trying to charm and swoon her way past her ex-lover's exasperated rejection (played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2660-manic-street-preachers/"">Manic Street Preachers</a>' Nicky Wire)—and makes it sound as knowing as an old friendship.</p>
<p>If <i>Red Kite </i>falters, it's where it deviates from the pastoral coziness—specifically ""I Am Not Your Enemy"", which evokes psychedelic rock in sound but not quite in menace. Far more successful are the plainspoken likes of ""Take the Silver"", featuring folk-rockers the Rails and evoking Dusty Springfield, or the marimba lullaby of ""Favourite Chair"", which like much of <i>Red Kite </i>is the musical equivalent of sinking into one. One-note? Perhaps, but the note is hypnotic. There is much to be said for an album that is simply exceedingly <i>nice, </i>like a hug or a blanket<i>. </i>Saint Etienne earned its cult following in part for infusing dance music with high-style escapism; Cracknell proves here—if she hadn't already—that she's as adept at the escapism that comes of imagining settling down.</p></div>"|20644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20644-red-kite/|7.1|Katherine St. Asaph

His music fits loosely into categories like ambient, drone, noise, and industrial, yet in interviews, he takes pains to stress that it's not reducible to any of those descriptors. His music is frequently darkly foreboding, but he insists that it isn't ""intentionally dark,"" as he told <i>The Wire</i>, and he is careful to keep the usual industrial clichés at arm's length: ""I've never played with suggestive or dark imagery. You'll never see a graveyard on the cover of one of my records."" And while his music depends heavily upon field recordings and acoustic sources, it warily maintains its distance from the physical world.</p>
<p><i>Olympic Mess</i> is Helm's fourth release for Bill Kouligas' <a href=""http://p-a-n.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PAN</a> label, following the 2012 album <i>Impossible Symmetry</i> and subsequent <i>Silencer </i>and <i>The Hollow Organs</i> EPs. The new album stems from a period in which Younger says that he immersed himself in ""loop-based industrial music, dub techno, and Balearic disco,"" but take that backstory with a grain of salt. If his music isn't ""intentionally dark,"" it definitely isn't intentionally any of <i>those</i> things, either. <i>Olympic Mess</i> turns out to be much more interesting, precisely because it remains so hard to pin down. It might be slipperier, even, than his previous work, despite the fact that <i>Olympic Mess</i> is his most structured record yet. Beneath the hazy, abstracted shapes, there's a sense of flow and a sense of purpose. As in the best abstract art, nothing feels haphazard or merely random; every burble, blip, clang, ping, chirp, and whoosh is a voice in a vast symphony. There's no doubting that there is a kind of logic at play.</p>
<p>While murky rumbles remain a primary reference point, the album is shot through with light and color. Virtually all of the album's tracks thrive upon the tension between shadows and shimmer, and the latter wins out again and again. The 12-minute ""Outerzone 2015"", the album's centerpiece, moves gradually from rain-barrel clang to scrapes and whines, creating accidental harmonies as it throws off sparks. The title track, running watery loops against a high-pitched buzz, is also surprisingly dulcet, and almost delicate; you wouldn't think that there was a way of linking <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Pop+Ambient""><i>Pop Ambient</i></a> series with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>'s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Metal Machine Music</i></a>, but here we are.</p>
<p><i>Olympic Mess</i> is full of elliptical loops that give the music its shape. Sometimes they churn along unaccompanied; elsewhere, they throb in concert with other loops but out of sync with them, creating a wild, oceanic push-and-pull. But the music is never defined by its rhythms, and none of its tracks feature a steady pulse from beginning to end. Instead, tiny micro-currents bubble up from the depths, play out for a spell, and are eventually subsumed. At its best, and when heard in the right headspace, <i>Olympic Mess</i> gives you the feeling of listening differently.</p>
<p>Only one track seems out of place: ""Strawberry Chapstick"", a four-minute spoken-word sketch read—not, it seems, by Younger—in an almost inaudible whisper, the mic crackling and popping like a campfire. It appears to be a long scrap of found footage, and its mundanity (""I'm 22 years old […] I am 5'8"", my whole family is pretty tall […] I'm a musician—I don't make a living playing music but I do play a couple instruments"") jerks you out of Younger's finely wrought illusions and zaps you back to the real world. <i>Olympic Mess</i> speaks volumes without utilizing language or conventional musical tropes; it's an experience so captivating that language only breaks the spell.</p></div>"|20642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20642-olympic-mess/|7.2|Philip Sherburne

Sparks' Ron Mael responded by sending Franz Ferdinand a demo for a song called ""Piss Off"".</p>
<p>But Sparks are nothing if not ironists, and both bands are long-haulers, and at some point they finally got it together to make an album together, under a name you wouldn't guess would naturally occur to the sixty-something Mael brothers. Appropriately, the first public sign of their collaboration came when Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh-qv-1rMU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">joined Sparks</a> for the latter's ""When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'"" on stage a few months ago.</p>
<p>As much as FFS' members have been going on about how everyone made concessions to the partnership, in practice this is effectively a Sparks record with a particularly sharp, focused backing band. That's something they've needed for a long time, despite how much fun the Maels' unaccompanied ""Two Hands, One Mouth"" tour was. The central lyrical topic is Ron Mael's favorite subject, the gross stupidity of masculinity; the musical hooks are mostly Sparksian rather than Franzian. Every song is also, to one extent or another, a vocal duet between Russell Mael and Kapranos. The former's demi-operatic falsetto and pinpoint enunciation are the focal point of his band's arrangements, and the latter's crisp baritone has generally blended in with <i>his</i> group's sound, so their dynamic's not too even either.</p>
<p>""Even"" isn't what's called for here, though, and they know it: the longest and most elaborate track is a suite called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAwp5syXyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Collaborations Don't Work""</a>. ""Warhol didn't need to ask De Kooning 'bout art/ Frank Lloyd Wright always ate à la carte,"" Kapranos growls, before Russell Mael joins him with an ionospheric harmony: ""Wish I'd been that smart"". Indeed, <i>FFS</i> doesn't always work—the album's middle section keeps falling into the latter-day Sparks snare of hitting on some clever phrase (""the man without a tan,"" ""the power couple's coming around"") and repeating it until it's certain that everyone's gotten the point. And the chemistry between the two bands isn't so perfect that a second collaborative album would be preferable to whatever either of them has up its sleeve next.</p>
<p>When <i>FFS</i> does click, though, it's a little delight. That initial song Ron Mael contributed, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3WrlwNA1zw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Piss Off""</a>, instantly earns its place on the next Sparks greatest-hits collection: it's a jaunty, lyrically withering rocker of the sort they used to crank out in the '70s. The airy, buzzing funk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E3ACnEqRQI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Call Girl""</a> (hook: ""why don't you call, girl"") is the kind of thing Franz Ferdinand do exceptionally well, although lyrics like ""I gave up blow and Adderall for you/ So I'd have dough and spend it all on you"" have Sparks' fingerprints all over them. This is not a meeting of equals, and it doesn't have to be. It's a marquee-name band throwing their weight behind a cult act that clearly inspired them—and the cult act showing who's really in charge.</p></div>"|20665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20665-ffs/|7.1|Douglas Wolk

His dusky deep house withholds more than it reveals; it's given to minor keys and downy textures overlaid with his own sparse, impressionistic rapping—if ""rapping"" is even the right word for a style of vocalization that could almost be mistaken for talking in his sleep. Above all, the music never complicates itself unnecessarily. Why use two elements where one would do? For that matter, why use one where none would do? Forget less-is-more; his approach seems more like less-is-just-enough.</p>
<p>The same goes for the Cleveland-born, Brooklyn-based producer's release strategy. Ever since he emerged, in 2013, with <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/galcher-lustwerk/100-galcher-mono"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>100% Galcher</i></a>, a free, downloadable mixtape of original productions for the <a href=""http://blowinguptheworkshop.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blowing Up the Workshop</a> series, he's courted a fair amount of attention from fans of underground house music, certainly more than you might expect for a virtually unknown artist and a mixtape with zero promotion behind it. Many musicians in his position, it's safe to say, would have been happy to be courted by labels, happier still to sign on the dotted line. Lustwerk didn't, though. He put out an EP on <a href=""http://www.tsubarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tsuba Records</a> and self-released a downloadable mini-LP under the alias <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32467-road-hog/"">Road Hog</a>, and he played some gigs, but aside from those trial balloons, he kept a low profile.</p>
<p>Now, more than two years after <i>100% Galcher </i>blew up Blowing Up the Workshop's servers, he's finally returned to releasing music, and he's doing it, once again, 100% Galcher. As he recently explained to <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2015/03/10/galcher-lustwerk-launches-lustwerk-music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juno Plus</a>, he met with labels about putting out the material featured on the mixtape, but ""things weren't clear enough for me. I had a lot of unanswered questions. I decided that I would get the most personal experience (and also the most money) by releasing them myself."" The <i>Parlay </i>EP's three tracks (the fourth is an instrumental mix of the title track) were all featured in the mixtape, but they sound ever so slightly better here: shinier, crisper, more enveloping. That might be explained, in part, by the fact that he was forced to remake them when his computer crashed shortly after he uploaded the mix.</p>
<p>For all their outward similarities—the scratchy, unadorned drum-machine patterns, softly glowing chords, and gruffly muttered vocals—it's striking how much variety Lustwerk gets out of such a tightly focused style. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17391-galcher-lustwerk-parlay/"">""Parlay""</a>, with its steady groove and references to rocking the drop-top, is all about the pleasures of the open road. Not a lot happens, besides a few sparkling notes in the upper register; a single chord flickers, unchanging, like a highway mirage. But nothing has to happen; it's hypnotic enough as it is. More variation is built into ""Dockside"", in which a handful of chords vamp around a two-note figure that threads the track from end to end. For the chorus, if you can call it that, Lustwerk's voice slips into a sing-speaking cadence with the faintest suggestion of dancehall reggae, and it's exciting to hear him testing the possibilities within the narrow limits of his preferred style.</p>
<p>""Kaint"" is the most harmonically rich of the three—two chords in the right hand flutter against a three-note bassline—but it's also the most vaporous. The synths are the color and consistency of a Campari and soda, and the only percussion is a lone lawn-sprinkler hi-hat flicking back and forth. There is no kick drum. It falls to the bassline to serve as an anchor—and to Lustwerk's own baritone, which occasionally murmurs, ""Remember?"" as though he had just been stirred from a daydream. The song's oddest feature is a wordless grunt, looped in time with the music and buried almost inaudibly deep in the mix. In ""Parlay"", there's a similar sense of disturbance beneath the surface, in the form of a noisy, metallic filigree that curls around the beat. Even Lustwerk's restraint doesn't stop him from indulging a fondness for odd details, and it's in the tension between those two urges that his music really shines.</p></div>"|20650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20650-parlay-ep/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

Everyone seeking to understand the current rap landscape should know this. After his cousin Young Bleed (yup, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGnMQsG4avI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Ya Do Dat""</a> Young Bleed of No Limit Records fame) helped him sign with the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9055-pimp-c/"">Pimp C</a>'s Trill Entertainment in 2001, Boosie released a series of mixtapes and albums that set his career on fire. Through the combination of his unique voice (imagine a frog on helium getting bear-hugged by a bodybuilder), his gargantuan output, his so-raw-it's-kinda-uncomfortable level of honesty, and his never-ending traditional chitlin' circuit tour of small town clubs and hood spots, he amassed the (some would say blasphemous) moniker of the ""Tupac of the South."" His legacy is heard in everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"">Meek Mill</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30125-starlito/"">Starlito</a> to fellow Baton Rouge resident <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31127-kevin-gates/"">Kevin Gates</a>, despite being only 32 years of age. This is the man who helped popularize the term ""ratchet"", for God's sake. (Seahawks fans, take note: He's also responsible<a href=""https://youtu.be/GZYeA4XS0Rk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> for making ""Beast Mode""</span></a> a thing, a fact that Marshawn Lynch <a href=""http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/sports/article/exclusive-marshawn-lynch-talks-beast-mode-fashion-and-tom-brady%E2%80%99s-wife"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>readily admits</span></a>.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Boosie went to jail in 2010 facing first-degree murder and conspiracy charges, and after a brief fear <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rapper-lil-boosie-indicted-for-first-degree-murder-death-penalty-possible-says-da/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that he might be sentenced to death</a>, he finished up his sentence early last year. He returned to a new world, where <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/10/lil-boosie-facetime-iphone-prison-technology/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mundane things like iPhone tech </a>seemed foreign and new. After his <a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/30777/boosie-life-after-deathrow.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Life After Deathrow</i></a> mixtape in October, he's back with his sixth studio album, a new deal with Atlantic Records, and a renewed vigor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A rapper with that pedigree could have phoned in this record, content to rest on his reputation. Instead, <i>Touch Down 2 Cause Hell</i> is unremittingly intense from the cover image to the sharpened guest appearances. The established stars who appear on this record—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>—manage to sound better than they have in years (""Spoil You"", ""Mercy on My Soul"" and ""Drop Top Music"", respectively), all flawlessly executing that whole effortlessly charismatic ""I'm happy, sex is pretty nice, and money is great"" thing that they do. Boosie also scores appearances from younger voices like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> (aka The Artists Formerly Known as Rich Gang) who all appear, with middling results. Not surprisingly, longtime collaborator and former Trill Ent. labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5688-webbie/"">Webbie</a> appears, and listeners new to Boosie can get a taste of their raunchy chemistry, which powered projects like 2003's classic album <i>Ghetto Stories </i>and street hits like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFv76Ev7CeU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On That Level""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In a way, the album plays out like a classic gangster-movie script. A man serves some time, comes home, and proceeds to restore his world to the way things were before he went away. Boosie jumps in with vigor, opening the album with a brief ""Minor setback for a major comeback"" line before absolutely rapping his ass off on the Black Metaphor-produced ""Intro - Get 'Em Boosie"". After the reintroduction, he lays waste to the pretenders who have popped up while he was in jail (on ""No Juice"" and ""Hip Hop Hooray""), laments those who are no longer here (on the Keyshia Cole-assisted ""Black Heaven""), opines on love (""She Don't Love Me""), and even manages to have some fun.

The barrier between Top 40 radio and the avant-garde was crumbling. Superstars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> aggressively asserted their autonomy as artists and a new crop of pop stars, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, launched sorties on the pop charts from small clubs and social media platforms. It seemed reasonable to believe we were coming into a new age where pop stars (especially female ones) could be taken seriously, rather than considered witless dupes of corporate machines.</p>
<p>It was a great time for Ryn Weaver to release her first single, ""OctaHate"", which has racked up millions of plays and even crossed over onto some of Billboard’s edgier charts since she posted it to SoundCloud just over a year ago. Though social-media endorsements by new-wave pop stars <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Williams"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hayley Williams</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"">Charli XCX</a> (who co-wrote it) gave the song a boost, as did the name-brand production from Benny Blanco, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30860-cashmere-cat/"">Cashmere Cat</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"">Passion Pit</a>’s Michael Angelakos, its success rests on Weaver’s ability to deliver a convincingly growly performance on the Beyoncé-esque verses and give soaring wings to the surprisingly headbangable EDM-metal chorus. But it turns out that the new kind of pop artist has some of the same problems as the old kind when it comes to figuring out how to follow up on a breakout first single.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In fact, there’s nothing on Weaver’s debut album, <i>The Fool</i>, that comes close to matching the intense pop rush of ""OctaHate"". That’s not a terminal problem in and of itself. Plenty of great pop stars—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> being two notable examples—have dropped stunning first singles followed months later by albums full of songs that aren’t as good, then gone on to successful and even critically-acclaimed careers. The difference is that Lorde and Rihanna’s records took what listeners responded to in the singles—the persona of the precociously world-weary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> fan, the party girl with the slightly aggressive wild streak—and filled them out into a complete identity, while <i>The Fool</i> doesn’t seem to know what to do with ""OctaHate""’s momentum.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The single introduced us to an artist who could confidently weave between glitchy bubblegum and pounding EDM thrash while delivering a gutsy, emotive performance that deftly plucked at the heartstrings. On the album, Weaver can’t seem to figure out who she is. For half of it, she aims for Lorde-ish post-rap electronic minimalism, on the other for stomping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford</a>-style folk-pop. These are disparate, well-trampled sounds that don’t generate any fresh sparks when brought together.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Spreading out that way could have been intended as a way to show off Weaver’s range, but it feels more like waffling, like neither she nor Blanco and Angelakos (who produced and co-wrote the album) could figure out whether to position her as a slightly angsty postmodern pop queen or a touchably warm and organic contemporary folkster, and instead decided to pursue both incompatible styles at once, fingers crossed that one of them panned out. Even Weaver’s vocal performance is hesitant throughout, adding to an overall feeling of unsureness that clashes with ""OctaHate""’s bracing, glitched-up confidence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unfortunately, the few points where the album actually comes together, like the disco-dusted ""Sail On"" and the California country ballad ""Here Is Home"", aren’t enough to make it stand out in an increasingly crowded field. Weaver’s benefitted greatly from the rising tide of artists who are challenging pop’s sonic and structural rules, but on <i>The Fool</i> she sounds like she’s lost at sea.</span></p></div>"|20641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20641-the-fool/|4.9|Miles Raymer

In a recent <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2015/06/01/407058268/sharon-van-etten-explains-the-heartbreak-behind-her-new-ep-track-by-track"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NPR discussion</a> about her new EP, the 34-year-old songwriter said of its subject, ""It’s someone I still care about but don’t speak with any more."" <i>I Don’t Want to Let You Down</i> comes from the <i>Are We There</i> sessions, but contains few of that record’s naked declarations: <i>I love you but I’m lost</i>. <i>Your love is killing me</i>. <i>Nothing will change</i>. Whether by design or just the nature of album off-cuts, these four songs (plus a live rendition of ""Tell Me"", from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16233-tramp/""><i>Tramp </i></a>era) are messier things that fit the unclean nature of long-term severance.</p>
<p>For Van Etten to tell NPR, ""I’m not very good at communicating my emotions,"" might seem like a huge joke: few singer-songwriters have cut to the quick as brutally as she has over her four studio albums. But processing feelings on paper is different than knowing what to say to someone’s face. ""I Don’t Want to Let You Down"" zooms into that moment of pause before you hurt someone with hasty words: ""Decompress and calm your head/ Teach you not to rush/ Turn them out, to see your words/ Trust me, stay and stay."" Despite all her best intentions, the accusations of abandonment and betrayal come fast on ""Just Like Blood"". At the start, her verses about drowning and reaching are blurred and hard to pick out, but over trembling church organ and warm strings, she reaches a defiant, unequivocal peak.</p>
<p>Van Etten has never been shy about letting listeners hear her works-in-progress—the bonus reissue of <i>Tramp</i> came with the entire album in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17474-tramp-deluxe-edition/"">demo form</a>, and there’s no end of rarities and alternate versions of her songs around for those who care to look. This EP was released to herald her inaugural South American tour, and contains songs that didn't make <i>Are We There</i>. Obviously, it’s not her strongest work. The title track is a bit of a thrumming plodder, and the choruses often repeat a single phrase. Her knack for expressive, muscular phrasing pushes them into interesting, sometimes challenging places, but they feel a little unrefined. However, ""I Always Fall Apart"" is a gorgeous piano ballad that was likely left off <i>Are We There</i> in place of the equally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>-like ""I Love You But I’m Lost"", but which works as a proud coda to its counterpart’s anxious panic. ""It’s not my fault,"" she sings of the way she falls to pieces. ""It’s just my flaw/ It’s who I am.""</p>
<p><i>I Don’t Want to Let You Down</i> may be a stopgap release, but there’s a crucial moment in Van Etten’s songwriting nestled towards the end. ""Pay My Debts"" is one of her classic slow-burns, but with an unusually grave synthetic palette. On <i>Tramp</i>, she repeatedly begged that someone take her seriously, trying to convince them—and probably herself in turn—of the self-assured woman behind her words. Van Etten has been frank about the fact that she ultimately chose her career over her relationship, and on ""Pay My Debts"", in a calm moment amidst the turmoil, she claims the only thing worth keeping from the aftermath: ""I know myself better than you do.""</p></div>"|20576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20576-sharon-van-etten-i-dont-want-to-let-you-down-ep/|7.0|Laura Snapes

With their fifth studio album, it's safe to bet that the quartet will have little trouble eliciting an energy of '70s-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a> proportions. Erika Wennerstrom has always possessed the kind of powerhouse vocals that electrify a crowd, and the atmosphere of <i>Restless Ones</i> lives up to that intensity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Heartless Bastards' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16285-arrow/"">previous</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12697-the-mountain/"">releases</a> tackled classic country themes—lonesomeness, wanderlust—and their new record is no different. ""Eastern Wind"" is the prime road trip anthem, though, and maybe the most well-constructed track. It's a twangy rock'n'roll song that dips into psych rock when thunderous solos and percussion attacks feel that they might take over. But Heartless Bastards know when to rein it in, and the song's structure stays intact. This is more than can be said for ""Journey"", which is burdened by unwieldy layers of clashing guitars. The latter also contains some of the album's weakest lyrics (""Oh now it's suddenly clear/ The journey is the destination"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Wennerstrom's voice is just as exquisitely engaging in its world-weary twang as always. There are a few lines that err on the cheesy side, but hearing her moan lines like ""I'm an open wound"" among twinkling strings on ""The Fool"" makes it easier to forgive them. Her most rewarding songwriting is found on honky-tonk ballad ""Pocket Full of Thirst"", when she wistfully croons, ""I set myself on fire/ And I jumped into the lake/ Disguised myself as someone else/ So you could not break me."" Wennerstrom is a blues singer through and through, soaking up as much heartache as she can bear, and the track is a refreshing break from the jumble of competing guitars on the rest of the album.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Restless Ones</i><span> establishes Heartless Bastards as a straightforward arena-rock band, one that's grown more refined with time. The</span><span> production value shows, which works for and against them simultaneously. Fans of their original lo-fi, garage-rock approach will be disappointed to find that even the grittier guitars sound pristine and polished. But this is a band that was born to be heard via massive, blaring speakers, using their colossal sound to fill every corner of a cavernous stadium. In that respect, it's hard to begrudge them for fulfilling their destiny.</span></p></div>"|20683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20683-restless-ones/|6.6|Tess Duncan

A percussionist by training, he’s been subverting techno’s omnipresent thump since the early '90s, when he was one half of the Berlin duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a> and the four-on-the-floor beat’s primacy still remained largely unchallenged. Over the years his beats have grown even subtler as he’s figured out ways to maintain techno’s propulsive needs without falling back on its tropes, and connected it to styles like dub in an attempt to create some sort of abstract, weightlessly chill sonic space.</p>
<p>One of Von Oswald’s favorite tricks is to take the heavy workload that in techno tracks usually falls on the kick drum and redistribute it across the few other instruments in his typically high-minimalist compositions. An inspired sonic engineer, he often enlists keyboard licks or delay effects to carry more rhythmic weight than usual, and as a result his compositions are urgent and danceable but rarely revolve around a 4/4 kick.</p>
<p>Von Oswald’s found an ideal partner in master drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"">Tony Allen</a>, who’s been creating trance-inducing works that duck and dive around the beat since his days as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela</a>’s chief rhythmic architect. Allen’s recently joined Von Oswald and modular synth guru <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5943-max-loderbauer/"">Max Loderbauer</a> in Von Oswald’s namesake trio, taking over for Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1214-vladislav-delay/"">Vladislav Delay</a>) on drums, and their first album together shows that the group’s quickly cohered into something interesting.</p>
<p>The addition of a superstar collaborator, along with <i>S</i><i>ounding Lines</i>’ open-ended arrangements and tracks that are numbered instead of named, all suggest the kind of high-powered jam session that usually sounds better on paper than on record, but Allen, Von Oswald, and Loderbauer work well together. Their playing has a loose, improvisatory feel but a strong sense of purpose. Even when they stretch a groove out toward the 10-minute mark they maintain the cohesiveness of a good jazz combo.</p>
<p>Jazz has become one of the Trio’s touchstones, or at least it’s made itself more present on <i>Sounding Lines</i> than on earlier recordings. Clearly a lot of that influence comes from Allen, whose expressive style has its roots in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Blakey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art Blakey</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Roach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Roach</a>’s frenetic but focused performances. The album opener ""1"" starts out centered around a happily burbling synth bass line, but Allen’s hi-hat takes the lead for a sizable chunk of the track’s 10 minutes, and his bop-inspired playing is so expressive and so casually virtuosic–and Loderbauer and Von Oswald’s backup is so judiciously minimal–that he easily pulls it off.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the group brings some of its other influences to the front, to varying effect. On ""4"" they fully indulge their dub sides, and the resulting track works better when you let yourself get caught up in its gently wafting mood than if you focus in on what it’s actually doing. ""7"", on the other hand, dives headfirst into '70s jazz funk with a cheeky clavinet riff and greasy hi-hats, and manages to strip away the decades of kitsch that those signifiers have accumulated, rediscovering an unexpected vibrancy lurking underneath.</p>
<p>At its best moments, <i>Sounding Lines</i> drifts in an intriguingly ambiguous space where each member invokes the genres they’re best known for playing while bending generously to accommodate their partners—Von Oswald bringing out his underutilized funky side, Allen using his inimitable Afrobeat style to sculpt a techno beat in negative space, and Loderbauer washing the whole thing in warm ambience. The three showcase a strong and singular shared vision, and in the moments where the music pulls you in deep enough to share it with them, it’s a beautiful thing.</p></div>"|20674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20674-sounding-lines/|6.3|Miles Raymer

The garage foursome hails from Manchester, a city whose post-industrial malaise is as famous for feeding its native bands' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">romanticized melancholy</a> as it is for the textile industry that built it. While railing against your environment is stultifying, Holgate suggests (""Sick for days watching the rain/ Everybody looks the same""), that frustration is useful for the way it stokes rebellion and keeps imaginations hungry. It's punk 101, though not a lesson that <i>Wild Nights</i> heeds: its 11 songs betray little trace of insurrection or fantasy, nor PINS' bold presence in the UK indie scene. </p>
<p>PINS went out to Joshua Tree's Rancho de la Luna to record the follow-up to 2013's <i>Girls Like Us </i>with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1404-eagles-of-death-metal/"">Eagles of Death Metal</a>'s Dave Catching. Despite being over 5000 miles from home, their attempt at making desert rock still sounds ferociously pedestrian. In almost every song, Lois McDonald's guitar lumbers over droning organ, and their collective dead-eyed girl-gang vocals hew rigidly to bassist Anna Donigan and drummer Sophie Galpin's unadventurous rhythm section, stripping away their debut's accented identity and self-produced scrappiness. ""Young Girls"" and ""Dazed By You"" have a little more surf-pop pep—the latter spiraling somewhere appealingly chaotic in its final minutes—but the lyrics are devoid of action or joy. ""The best comes to those who wait/ I'm waiting, yes I'll wait,"" Holgate sings on ""Dazed"", which appears to be about being bored on a plane.</p>
<p><i>Wild Nights</i>' drab sound might have been saved if the lyrics had some life to them. As it stands, the rhyme schemes sound indebted to Manchester's most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29794-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/"">famous son</a> (""Glittered <i>eyes</i> like butter<i>flies</i>/ Yester<i>day</i> so far <i>away</i>/ Sunday <i>morning</i> it's all dis<i>torting</i>,"" goes opener ""Baby Bhangs"") and the total passivity is maddening.<i> </i>No-good boys are tolerated, girls look best when they're sad/bad, and indecision begets numbness and solitude. There's finally a little action on the rushing ""Oh Lord"", about a tryst with a stranger, but somehow they manage to completely smother any sense of danger or high-stakes: ""He didn't know who I was/ I was a girl looking for love"" feels like characterization that wouldn't even pass muster in the fanfic community.</p>
<p>When PINS released the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UvTPoDGzrY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for lead single ""Too Little Too Late"", they said that the lyrics ""spewed out like hot lava from an angry volcano."" The cool result (remember <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1254-the-duke-spirit/"">the Duke Spirit</a>?) doesn't match their pitch—it's a tale of infatuation gone sour that climaxes in a painfully weak ultimatum: ""Yeah, you said you said you're sorry but I've heard it all before/ Yeah, you said you're sorry, but are you sure?"" In a post-""Girls""/Cat Marnell age where messy female expression is such a marketable commodity—confession as currency, struggle as legitimacy—perhaps there's something faintly rebellious about PINS withholding emotional depth (while <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173343"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">calling the record <i>Wild</i> <i>Nights</i></a>!). That's probably a stretch, though: their writing comes off as hesitant rather than any particular aesthetic choice.</p>
<p>However, <i>Wild</i><i> Nights</i>' standout song makes a virtue of that hesitation, and in doing so, reveals a trace of inner life. Curdled '60s hand-clapper ""If Only"" is the only number that doesn't feature a ""you"", only ""I"", and Holgate conveys her isolation and awkwardness in the simplest terms: ""Most of the time I feel wrong/ Like I am no one/ I get so lost/ I want it all to stop."" It's the briefest glimpse of promise. PINS has become a halfway-notable British indie band (in domestic terms) because of their industriousness: they run their own label, <a href=""http://www.hausofpins.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HAUS OF PINS</a>, and gig relentlessly, whether on their own small tours, or as the opening act for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32965-babes-in-toyland/"">Babes in Toyland</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drenge_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drenge</a>. If they've more like ""If Only"" in them, they might stand a chance of becoming more than perpetual supporting players.</p></div>"|20577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20577-wild-nights/|4.0|Laura Snapes

Beyond his formidable chops, which speak for themselves, he excels as a curator, a role that classical soloists are increasingly expected to fill. Along with Ursula Oppens, Brubaker executed that role fabulously on the 2014 ECM album </span><i><a href=""http://player.ecmrecords.com/meredith-monk--piano-songs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Piano Songs</a></i><span>, which contained two-piano arrangements of pieces by the great New York composer Meredith Monk (whose work is usually heard sung, often with accompaniment on one piano). Those performances were faithful to the source material, but also visionary</span><span>—</span><span>a new </span><span>way ""in</span><span>"" </span><span>to music written by an icon whose work was a key part of the 1970s New York scene.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In that light, it's easy to skim the release details of <i>Glass Piano</i>, Brubaker’s new album of piano pieces by another New York icon, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>, and think it's a little too obvious. <i>Glass Piano</i> mostly repeats the program of the composer’s own <i><a href=""http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/solo_piano.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solo Piano</a></i> album, from 1989. On account of that recording’s major-label distribution (and its decades of popularity), its contents—including ""Mad Rush"", the five-part ""Metamorphosis"", and ""Wichita Vortex Sutra""—amount to some of the most famous Glass compositions. These are often the only pieces a casual listener will know from Glass’s large body of work (which is more diverse than is often understood). So far this year, I count two other <a href=""http://www.deccaclassics.com/en/cat/4788079"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">major</a> <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/philip-glass-mad-rush/id950026221"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">releases</a> covering almost all these same items. Plus, Brubaker has already recorded a version of ""Wichita"" on a previous album, <i>Hope Street Tunnel Blues</i>. Novelty isn’t everything—but that’s a lot of competition to invite (including against oneself).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even when stacked against these odds, two of his latest readings distinguish themselves brilliantly. Instead of turning ""Mad Rush"" into the 16-minute barnstorm of arpeggios that its title suggests, Brubaker inserts pregnant pauses throughout, and pushes the soft-then-loud dynamics to extremes. (His performance is also noticeably longer than Glass’s, on <i>Solo Piano</i>.) At the three-minute mark, when the pianist reaches a pivot point in the score where each hand diverges from the middle of the keyboard, the transition feels grander and more consequential than in other recordings. Instead of a slight turn on a steady highway, the moment feels like tipping over a waterfall’s ledge.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Even better is Brubaker</span><span>’</span><span>s new version of </span><span>""</span><span>Wichita Vortex Sutra</span><span>"", </span><span>which closes <i>Glass Piano</i>. The title of Glass</span><span>’</span><span>s piece comes from a poem by his late friend Allen Ginsberg. On their collaborative album </span><i><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/philip-glass-hydrogen-jukebox/id637079161"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hydrogen Jukebox</a></i><span>, Ginsberg recited a portion of what has been </span><a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/last-antiwar-poem"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>described</span></a><span> as </span><span>""</span><span>the last antiwar poem</span><span>"" </span><span>over Glass</span><span>’</span><span>s playing. For that expanded context alone, the Glass-Ginsberg duo rendition will always be a milestone. But Brubaker's version here feels exuberant and visionary, in line with the mystic rapture of Ginsberg’s loftiest stanzas in the poem.</span><span> The way Glass</span><span>’</span><span>s quieter motifs motor along here seems like an acknowledgement of the modernity-blues that Ginsberg</span><span>’</span><span>s poem also evokes (</span><span>""t</span><span>he honkytonk tinkle/ of a city piano/ to calm the nerves of taxpaying housewives of a Sunday morn</span><span>""</span><span>).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Inevitably, Brubaker</span><span>’</span><span>s accomplishments at the beginning and end of the album draw</span><span> attention to the lesser moments in between them</span><span>. The pianist</span><span>’</span><span>s version of the lengthy </span><span>""</span><span>Metamorphosis</span><span>"" </span><span>is fine, even crisp, </span><span>but it doesn</span><span>’</span><span>t contain all that much in the way of insight or surprise. Likewise, a reading of a </span><span>""</span><span>Knee Play</span><span>"" </span><span>from the opera <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> makes for a fun interlude, though it</span><span>’</span><span>s not essential. Still, while Glass</span><span>’</span><span>s hardcore fans might find themselves more enticed by fresh recordings of rarer pieces (such as Gidon Kremer</span><span>’</span><span>s </span><a href=""http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/us/cat/4794817"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>new CD</span></a><span> dominated by Glass</span><span>’</span><span>s Violin Concerto No. 2), they shouldn</span><span>’</span><span>t dismiss <i>Glass Piano</i> just because they think they know what they're getting. </span></p></div>"|20672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20672-glass-piano/|7.0|Seth Colter Walls

Since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a> evolved into Sun Kil Moon in the early part of the last decade, almost everything about the latter band was low-key and under the radar. Kozelek often toured alone with his nylon-string acoustic guitar, his music was generally slow and quiet, and he released a great many records that were happily received by his cult and mostly ignored otherwise. But nothing about the band seemed keyed into the now or connected to the churn of digital culture.</p>
<p>All that changed in the last 18 months, for two reasons. One, Kozelek noticed that the stupid things he'd been prone to saying for many years (what has been described as a ""sense of humor"") could have a life outside the concert hall, from calling concertgoers ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56588-mark-kozelek-tells-fucking-hillbilly-audience-to-shut-the-fuck-up/"">hillbillies</a>"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56717-mark-kozelek-trash-talks-the-war-on-drugs-during-ottawa-folk-festival-set/"">picking fights with other bands</a>. And two, in the last five years Kozelek's music has become diaristic in the extreme, which allows the mundane details of his life to enter his songs, lending them a bloggy quality. At times, these two streams came together in an ugly way, as when he wrote and released a single called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/"">""War on Drugs: Suck My Cock""</a> and, more recently, when he <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/i-interviewed-mark-kozelek-he-called-me-a-bitch-on-stage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disparaged a female journalist (and Pitchfork contributing editor) from the stage in London</a>. The end result of these developments is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to imagine Sun Kil Moon's music outside of how it, and he, are discussed on social media. And since Mark Kozelek's music is so specifically autobiographical, and because he is the central character in each of these songs, it's doubly hard for his behavior not to have some impact.</p>
<p>Even setting all that aside, if Mark Kozelek had spent the last year and a half playing his music and—to reference a lesson he supposedly learned from his father in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSVSJuowhc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Love My Dad""</a>—minding his own business, <i>Universal Themes</i> would still be a disappointing record. The songs are longer, the hooks are fewer, and the ""then I did this, then I did that"" observations are less profound and less likely to have you reflecting on your own life. It's ultimately a spotty album from a guy who has released a lot of spotty albums.</p>
<p><i>Universal Themes</i> does have a certain amount of experimentation; some of it is almost proggy as it moves through sections and adds and removes textures while Kozelek plays with instrumental breakdowns. ""With a Sort of Grace I Walked to the Bathroom to Cry"", for example, pivots between spacious arpeggiated acoustic segments to what is more or less ""hard rock,"" even if the latter is unconvincing. ""Ali/Spinks 2"" has a middle section of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>-like guitar screeches that sounds a little out of place considering how relaxed and minimal the rest of the arrangement is. There's plenty of time to add these wrinkles: the eight songs average almost nine minutes each, and in a few of them you feel every second as it ticks by. Even so, a few tracks, despite their length, make no impression even after many listens. ""Cry Me a River Williamsburg Sleeve Tattoo Blues"" is a funny title in search of a song, while ""This Is My First Day and I'm Indian and I Work at a Gas Station"" is an unfunny title in search of a delete key.</p>
<p>Still, the fact is, no one else writes songs like this, and when everything clicks, Kozelek's music can still be moving. Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17231-sun-kil-moon-the-possum/"">""The Possum""</a> uses an image of a wounded rodent as a jumping-off point for a meditation on life, death, friendship, and the beauty of the struggle through it all. ""Garden of Lavender""—which really is, in part, about a garden where Kozelek is growing lavender—has some lovely guitar arrangements and manages to convey the ineffable feeling of time passing and living inside of a moment while also watching it happen from the outside. But these are exceptions. For the record as a whole, the fact that Kozelek is droning on in so much detail is more interesting than what he's actually saying. There are many, many words, but, unlike with <i>Benji</i>, they add up to very little. </p>
<p><i>Benji</i> remains a one-off masterpiece because it's the place where Kozelek's rambling style cohered around a concept, the perfect meeting of content and form. The narrator of those songs seemed vulnerable, like he was risking something by putting it out there, and the stories of life and death were riveting in part because they seemed so familiar. It was a record of a particular time, place, and circumstance, and it was sonically as well as thematically coherent. It was also a record in large part about others, of Kozelek looking outward and trying to figure out what made people tick and what they cared about and what their lives meant, even if the answers weren't always clear. Here, there's nothing at stake. <i>Universal Themes</i> moves in the other direction, away from connection, and it pulls inward. It feels claustrophobic, a world drawing in on itself and getting smaller and smaller.</p></div>"|20693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20693-universal-themes/|6.0|Mark Richardson

No, the most apeshit response was reserved for the lead single from 1992's notorious, radio-repelling <i>Angel Dust</i>, ""Midlife Crisis""—which made sense, given that the majority of Faith No More's audience is now old enough to have gone through one. But if the moment confirmed the long-term triumph of Faith No More's artistic peak over its commercial one, the band weren't ones to bask in the validation. Just as ""Midlife Crisis"" was about to emerge from its brooding mid-song breakdown into its climactic final chorus, Faith No More deviously denied the crowd the opportunity for one last cathartic sing-along. Instead, they kicked into a spot-on approximation of Boz Scaggs' 1976 proto-disco perennial <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hKBmTAADo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lowdown""</a>, over which frontman Mike Patton sang the remaining lyrics to ""Midlife Crisis"" in his most lecherous lounge-lizard warble.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It was a perfect Faith No More moment, crystallizing both their contrarian impulses and this ostensible hard rock group's long-time fascination with pop music. While it's common for metal and post-hardcore bands to pummel chart hits and golden oldies </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs_v0mc4G_w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>into submission</span></a><span>, Faith No More have always seemed in awe of pop music's shimmering surfaces and disarming capabilities. As that ""Lowdown"" prank in Toronto illustrated, Faith No More don't cover soft-rock songs to make fun of them, but to make light of themselves, to deflate the chest-puffing machismo endemic to metal and unravel the tinfoil of </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjXkOplqrWo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>hard rock's proverbial cucumber</span></a><span>. And as these expanded, double-disc reissues of </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span> and </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> reaffirm, Faith No More are a flamboyant, omnivorous pop act trapped in a metal band's body; their sound is the musical equivalent of a G.I. Joe doll dressed in a Barbie bikini with its limbs torn off. But if their reputation has been defined by a penchant for maniacal mash-ups, the band's deep-seated reverence for songcraft has always been the most perverse thing about them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For younger listeners whose tastes were shaped by the genre-agnostic Internet, it may be hard to square <i>The Real Thing</i> with its reputation as an alt-rock trailblazer. Because, for the most part, what we largely consider alt- or indie-rock today was shaped by popular '80s UK bands—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">The Cure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>—who came of age with punk but used its principles to forge a synth-centric mode of pop music wholly liberated from rock's blues-based tradition. Their California alt-rock counterparts, while also raised on punk, were less interested in opening up a new emotional and sonic vocabulary than bastardizing their formative influences: think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2166-janes-addiction/"">Jane's Addiction</a>'s goth take on Zeppelin grandeur, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3396-primus/"">Primus</a>' bizarro-world Rush revisionism, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbone"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fishbone</a>'s skewed ska, or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' mosh-pit updates of Dylan and Stevie Wonder. It speaks volumes about the conservatism of mainstream American music at the time that all a rock band needed was some slap bass and dyed dreads to get consigned to the ""120 Minutes"" set.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Amid their funky-punky peers, however, Faith No More were the freaks who didn't quite fit in with the other freaks. Neither as overtly sexual as Jane's Addiction or the Chili Peppers, nor as wilfully weird as their Bay Area buds in Primus, their lineup represented a veritable <i>Breakfast Club</i> detention room of rock archetypes, fusing elements of metal, prog rock, hip-hop and new wave. And it's that last element that ultimately set the band apart—through the omnipresent textural gloss of keyboardist Roddy Bottum, Faith No More were the only band of their ilk to openly embrace the synth-shined sound of '80s UK pop, then considered the antithesis of underground American rock. (Even as late as 1992, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"">Rage Against the Machine</a> were boasting in the liner notes of their debut album that they used ""no synthesizers, keyboards or samples"" as an unassailable measure of their realness.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Faith No More's third album overall (and second to see wide release via Slash/Warner), </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span> is the moment where the band's seemingly incompatible aesthetics locked into seamless formation. This can largely be attributed to the arrival of Mike Patton, whose sing/scream vocal gesticulations better personified the manic contradictions in the band's sound than outgoing vocalist Chuck Mosely's bratty monotone. But the band were also more confident in the grandiosity of their sound, with bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin's heavy but dextrous rhythms deftly mediating between Bottum's synths and Jim Martin's thrash-schooled shredding. The hair-raising intro to ""From Out of Nowhere"", with the entire band hammering at full throttle, is to this album what ""Ride of the Valkyries"" was to </span><i>Apocalypse Now</i><span>, a full-bore battle cry blown up to widescreen scale. And while ""Epic"" was perfectly timed to satiate the then-burgeoning appetite for rap-rock, the most interesting stuff was happening outside of Patton's staccato verses: that bulldozing fanfare of an opening riff, the beaming, anthemic chorus, Martin's Brian May-inspired soloing, that mournful, </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/ZG_k5CSYKhg?t=3m43s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>fish-killing</span></a><span> piano coda.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But while <i>The Real Thing</i> represents an important chapter in Faith No More's history, there's a reason why the album barely registers on the setlists of the band's current tour: a lot of it is hard to extricate from its date of origin. And that's a function of both its connection to a long-past funk-metal zeitgeist and the band's own subsequent development. It's hard to imagine any band, let alone Faith No More, attempting another song like ""Epic"" today, not just because of lingering associations between rap-rock and <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/19-worst-things-about-woodstock-99-20140731?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Rapestock</span></a>, but the fact that the vocabularies of hip-hop and rock—once united by a shared affinity for <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/19-worst-things-about-woodstock-99-20140731?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>booming breaks</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GND7sPNwWko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>crunchy riffs</span></a>—have expanded and diverged in vastly different directions. However, Patton's long-abandoned MC moves aren't the only thing that marks <i>The Real Thing</i> as a definite product of 1989. While the dubbed-out title track centerpiece and the explosive ""Zombie Eaters"" (a template for the sort of stentorian power ballads FNM friends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a> embrace on <i>The Black Album</i>) serve powerful displays of Patton's melodic/monstrous extremes, he had yet to fully emerge as the hydra-headed vocal dynamo we know him as today, while the unnecessary note-for-note cover of ""War Pigs"" is a rare instance of Faith No More approaching an obvious influence in an obvious fashion. (At the very least, it provided Bordin with good practice for his future gig as <a href=""http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/the-drummers-of-black-sabbath-593382/7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Bill Ward's understudy</span></a>.) And in spite of showcasing Bottum's crucial keyboard work, pop songs like ""Falling to Pieces"" and ""Underwater Love"" didn't do much to dissuade skeptics who had pegged Faith No More as Chili Peppers copyists. The band's next album, however, would ensure no one ever confused Patton with Anthony Kiedis ever again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Angel Dust</i><span> was hardly the spiteful act of career suicide their nervous major-label minders at Warner Bros. anticipated—it actually cracked the </span><i>Billboard</i><span> Top 10 and went gold in the U.S., while selling loads more in Europe. But in a post-</span><i>Nevermind</i><span> era when the stakes were growing ever higher for alt-rock bands—particularly ones following up a platinum-seller—</span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> asserted Faith No More's willingness to stay in the game, but only if they could play by their own rules. And they were as eager to upset the expectations of industry execs clamoring for another MTV-ready hit as the metalheads in their base who were just showing up for the megaton riffage. What makes </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> an eminently fascinating record is not the fact that a band on the cusp of greater success would deign to release an album with songs called ""Crack Hitler"" and ""Jizzlobber"" that were just as ugly and filthy as their titles suggest. It's that Faith No More's most wantonly subversive album is also their most gorgeously rendered.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unlike </span><span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_de_lo_habitual"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other</a> </span><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19407-soundgarden-superunknown/"">alt-rock</a> </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/""><span>opuses</span></a><span> of its vintage, </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> didn't feel like a mere Lollapalooza-era update of '70s classic-rock gatefold epics; this was a new, fiercely modernist form of heavy rock music, painstakingly constructed from emerging strains of electronica and sample-based production, international influences and the depths of underground metal. (At the time, the aesthetic shift was extreme enough to drive resident hesher Martin out of the band.) Though retaining the heft of </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span>'s weightiest tracks, the riffs and rhythms were slowed down and contorted into mostly unmoshable forms, while Bottum's synth arias—which imply the presence of an orchestra with a single keystroke—project nauseated grandeur. Patton's always been cagey about explaining his lyrics, but the overwhelming feeling of </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> is one of America rotting at the core, numbed by TV and overindulgence, overrun with bigoted deadbeat dads, wracked with domestic unrest and psychological turmoil. ""Does life seem worthwhile to you?"" Patton asks on the opening ""Land of Sunshine"", amid a nightmarish flurry of creepy carnivalesque laughter and hammy infomercial pitches—and the bleak landscape catalogued on </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> doesn't give you much reason to answer in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span>'s unpleasant imagery is countered by Faith No More's most audacious and playful musical experiments to date. There is the chanted ""Midlife Crisis"" mid-section that sounds like it was imported from an Enigma record; the pretty pan flute-inspired melody of ""A Small Victory"" that leads to a funky Madchester organ break; ""Be Aggressive""'s appropriation of high-school cheerleader songs into a homoerotic oral-sex anthem designed to be unwittingly shouted out by the band's mostly straight fans. They're the sort of ideas that sound ridiculous on paper, but are perfectly integrated into the album's elaborate design. Likewise, ""Everything's Ruined"" should be the mess its title suggests, shifting through a bright, bass-popping groove, melancholy verses, a rap-metal bridge, soaring soft-rock chorus and David Gilmour-esque guitar solos; instead, this portrait of familial breakdown proves to be the album's emotional center, with Patton's dejected declaration of the title chorus coming just as the song finally opens up into a sweeping, piano-inflected vista.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Faith No More followed up </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span>'s conceptual complexity with their simplest gesture: a straight-up, I-can't-believe-they're-not-being-ironic cover of the Commodores' 1977 slow-dance standard ""Easy"", which was recorded during the album's sessions but held over for the </span><i>Songs to Make Love To</i><span> EP. (It would be absorbed into the tracklist of overseas </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> issues, but really does not fit thematically with the album at all.) ""Easy"" would crack the UK Top 10, and, to date, it's Faith No More's last single to chart on the </span><i>Billboard</i><span> Top 100 in the U.S. However, its significance to the band's story is somewhat overemphasized by this reissue, which includes three very similar versions of the song. The current archival campaign </span><a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/faith-no-more/85012"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>was not initiated by the band</span></a><span>, but rather the music's current rights holders at Warner/Rhino, who are capitalizing on renewed back-catalogue interest stemming from Faith No More's first new album in 18 years, the self-released </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20339-sol-invictus/"">Sol Invictus</a></i><span>. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Both </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span> and </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> come appended with an extra disc of period-specific bonus tracks (pared down for the double-vinyl editions), however, Faith No More's high standards of quality control mean the vaults weren't exactly teeming with treasured leftovers. </span>Aside from solid <i>Real Thing</i>-era outtakes ""The Cowboy Song"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" (not an Aerosmith cover, but a dry run for future <i>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey</i> soundtrack entry ""The Perfect Crime""), Faith No More's castaways tended to take the form of tossed-off genre exercises, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/?""><i>Zeppelin III</i></a>-style acoustic interlude ""The Grade"", polka parody ""Das Schutzenfest"", and an Elvisized take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1266-dead-kennedys/"">the Dead Kennedys</a>' ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"". The rest of the bonus bounty comprises alternate takes (including some amusing time-capsule examples of early alt-rock dance remixes) and live tracks that don't deviate all too much from the originals, save for Patton's tendency to ad lib House of Pain, Bay City Rollers and Rob Base lyrics into his own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the unhinged atmosphere of Faith No More's early-'90s concerts provides a convenient yardstick for gauging just how far the band had evolved in three short years—from the metal-damaged misfits comically growling ""SATAN!"" as ""War Pigs"" enters meltdown mode, to the cinematically minded aesthetes who opted to close <i>Angel Dust</i> with a meditative rendition of John Barry's <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> theme. At the time, that choice felt like the biggest WTF gesture on an album full of them, all that crushing brutalism and shape-shifting chicanery anti-climaxing in a moment of pure, unblemished beauty. But the move feels more appropriate now than ever—after all, like John Schlesinger's film, <i>Angel Dust</i> was a source of outrage at the time of its release, but has since ascended to the realm of a modern classic.</p></div>"|20606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20606-faith-no-more-the-real-thing-angel-dust/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Though retaining the heft of </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span>'s weightiest tracks, the riffs and rhythms were slowed down and contorted into mostly unmoshable forms, while Bottum's synth arias—which imply the presence of an orchestra with a single keystroke—project nauseated grandeur. Patton's always been cagey about explaining his lyrics, but the overwhelming feeling of </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> is one of America rotting at the core, numbed by TV and overindulgence, overrun with bigoted deadbeat dads, wracked with domestic unrest and psychological turmoil. ""Does life seem worthwhile to you?"" Patton asks on the opening ""Land of Sunshine"", amid a nightmarish flurry of creepy carnivalesque laughter and hammy infomercial pitches—and the bleak landscape catalogued on </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> doesn't give you much reason to answer in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span>'s unpleasant imagery is countered by Faith No More's most audacious and playful musical experiments to date. There is the chanted ""Midlife Crisis"" mid-section that sounds like it was imported from an Enigma record; the pretty pan flute-inspired melody of ""A Small Victory"" that leads to a funky Madchester organ break; ""Be Aggressive""'s appropriation of high-school cheerleader songs into a homoerotic oral-sex anthem designed to be unwittingly shouted out by the band's mostly straight fans. They're the sort of ideas that sound ridiculous on paper, but are perfectly integrated into the album's elaborate design. Likewise, ""Everything's Ruined"" should be the mess its title suggests, shifting through a bright, bass-popping groove, melancholy verses, a rap-metal bridge, soaring soft-rock chorus and David Gilmour-esque guitar solos; instead, this portrait of familial breakdown proves to be the album's emotional center, with Patton's dejected declaration of the title chorus coming just as the song finally opens up into a sweeping, piano-inflected vista.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Faith No More followed up </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span>'s conceptual complexity with their simplest gesture: a straight-up, I-can't-believe-they're-not-being-ironic cover of the Commodores' 1977 slow-dance standard ""Easy"", which was recorded during the album's sessions but held over for the </span><i>Songs to Make Love To</i><span> EP. (It would be absorbed into the tracklist of overseas </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> issues, but really does not fit thematically with the album at all.) ""Easy"" would crack the UK Top 10, and, to date, it's Faith No More's last single to chart on the </span><i>Billboard</i><span> Top 100 in the U.S. However, its significance to the band's story is somewhat overemphasized by this reissue, which includes three very similar versions of the song. The current archival campaign </span><a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/faith-no-more/85012"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>was not initiated by the band</span></a><span>, but rather the music's current rights holders at Warner/Rhino, who are capitalizing on renewed back-catalogue interest stemming from Faith No More's first new album in 18 years, the self-released </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20339-sol-invictus/"">Sol Invictus</a></i><span>. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Both </span><i>The Real Thing</i><span> and </span><i>Angel Dust</i><span> come appended with an extra disc of period-specific bonus tracks (pared down for the double-vinyl editions), however, Faith No More's high standards of quality control mean the vaults weren't exactly teeming with treasured leftovers. </span>Aside from solid <i>Real Thing</i>-era outtakes ""The Cowboy Song"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" (not an Aerosmith cover, but a dry run for future <i>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey</i> soundtrack entry ""The Perfect Crime""), Faith No More's castaways tended to take the form of tossed-off genre exercises, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/?""><i>Zeppelin III</i></a>-style acoustic interlude ""The Grade"", polka parody ""Das Schutzenfest"", and an Elvisized take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1266-dead-kennedys/"">the Dead Kennedys</a>' ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"". The rest of the bonus bounty comprises alternate takes (including some amusing time-capsule examples of early alt-rock dance remixes) and live tracks that don't deviate all too much from the originals, save for Patton's tendency to ad lib House of Pain, Bay City Rollers and Rob Base lyrics into his own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the unhinged atmosphere of Faith No More's early-'90s concerts provides a convenient yardstick for gauging just how far the band had evolved in three short years—from the metal-damaged misfits comically growling ""SATAN!"" as ""War Pigs"" enters meltdown mode, to the cinematically minded aesthetes who opted to close <i>Angel Dust</i> with a meditative rendition of John Barry's <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> theme. At the time, that choice felt like the biggest WTF gesture on an album full of them, all that crushing brutalism and shape-shifting chicanery anti-climaxing in a moment of pure, unblemished beauty. But the move feels more appropriate now than ever—after all, like John Schlesinger's film, <i>Angel Dust</i> was a source of outrage at the time of its release, but has since ascended to the realm of a modern classic.</p></div>"|20606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20606-faith-no-more-the-real-thing-angel-dust/|8.8|Stuart Berman

He was referring to an </span><span>audience's</span><span> experience, but </span><span><i>Catharsis</i>, </span><span>the debut album by Austin post-punk outfit Institute, is a vessel for the, uh, cathartic process of vocalist Moses Brown. (One of the songs here is called ""Admit I'm Shit"", after all.) Brown is singularly fixated on enumerating personal miseries and cultivating a sickly delivery atop the band's forbidding punk. That makes the record's appeal somewhat perverse, but gawking at Brown's unrestrained auto-evisceration turns out to be a rewarding purge for us, too.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the opening minute and a half of ""I Am Living Death"", Brown does little more than wail. He capitulates in the first line: ""Nothing can make life worthwhile."" On ""Admit I'm Shit"", he grotesquely stretches the titular refrain across a downcast, spare guitar lead. On ""Cheerlessness"", he lingers woozily on the long ""</span><span>o"" </span><span>in the couplet, ""Abhorred it/ Abhorred it,"" and then snaps, ""But I digress/ Excuse me!,"" as if offended at the interruption of someone trying to help relieve his suffering. Elsewhere, Brown sputters, ""I've got no love, I've got no passion"" and refers to ""constantly needing to say I'm sorry."" A maimed dog and references to puberty pop up, but </span><i>Catharsis </i><span>specifies little besides the depth of Brown's woes. At that, it's very forthcoming.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's a sardonic sense of purpose to all of this wretchedness, and it's part of what makes <i>Catharsis</i> intriguing. The vocal delivery of artists affiliated with, say, New York's so-called Ground Zero Hardcore set or the ascendant Northwest Indiana punk scene skew similarly infirm and enervated. Punk's tendency has been to measure strength in terms of perceived ""brutality,"" but there is new interest, and new value, in purposefully playing the cretin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band plays rigid counterpoint to Brown's wallowing, opting for a stiff eighth-note gait at all times. The instrumental tones are chilled, with the high and low frequencies sucked out in favor of all mid-range. It's willfully numbed, and more deserving of the line ""I've got no passion"" than Brown's vocals. Except for the budget blues wank lodged in the riff on opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17446-institute-perpetual-ebb/"">""Perpetual Ebb""</a> (which was an exciting single but plays like an outlier in context), the band is unflaggingly austere.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-410878a0-d8e2-e0c0-15ba-12194ca2b804""><span>The word ""catharsis"" tends to be overused, grasped at by bookish young people to describe any art-induced mood swing. </span><i>Catharsis </i><span>is a self-absorbed record, even juvenile. It leans on the clichéd overstatements of teenagers who might claim to be ""dead inside."" You might reach for ""banal,"" a word plastered on the lyric sheet for no apparent reason. Still, the band's anguished exhibitionism also feels refreshing. Brown never signals recovery or completion of the purge, but catharsis </span><span>at least occurs in the way Aristotle meant it: for the audience. By the end, we feel both vacated and spent. </span></span></p></div>"|20599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20599-catharsis/|7.2|Sam Lefebvre

It's easy to see what the 25-year-old singer might be getting at—the number suggests balance, structure, and rhythm, with plenty of musical and metaphysical significance—but Derulo seems more attracted to the general idea than the specifics. Clichés persist for a reason, after all: they can be incredibly effective. ""We want to go see a great movie because we want to be moved,"" he said later in the same interview. ""We want to laugh, we want to cry, we want to feel something."" Sure enough, Derulo has always aimed directly towards the hot-blooded center of a situation, be it lust, love, or heartbreak. It's not about nuance or distinction: it's about impact, drawing the most inclusive and thereby, most powerful, emotion out of three minutes and change.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Such is the secret to Derulo's success, particularly as of last year's </span><i>Talk Dirty</i><span> (a savvy, U.S.-exclusive repackaging of his third full-length, </span><i>Tattoos</i><span>). His best songs are so vast and all-embracing in scope that, paradoxically, they become ultra-specific to their moment in time; as with pop-crossover monoliths like Usher's ""Yeah!"" or Flo Rida's ""Get Low,"" his hits have a tendency to bloom into zeitgeist mile-markers despite not being ""about"" much of anything at all. And though critics persistently peg him as unmemorable, Derulo's presence on the charts is by now intractable. He was the most-played male artist on all of radio in 2014—this from the guy whose most recognizable calling card was once his insistence on </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak-OUYwCbmo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>singing his own name</span></a><span>, and is now his insistence on </span><a href=""http://radio.com/2013/08/15/jason-derulo-talks-new-music-why-he-has-retired-singing-his-name/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>not singing his own name</span></a><span>. He's a quiet trendsetter, though even his influence is hilariously faceless: ""Talk Dirty"" instigated the sudden rise of what Derulo himself called the ""instrumental hook,"" its dominant recorder solo, of all things, directly inspiring hits from </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1g8G_njx8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Ariana Grande</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBHQbu5rbdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Fifth Harmony</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Cg572dafQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Flo Rida</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On </span><i>Everything is 4</i><span>, Derulo continues </span><i>Talk Dirty</i><span>'s shift from indiscreet R&amp;B huckster to audacious pop juggernaut. He's always been able to slip between genres with relative ease: he's </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHQllGh_Ls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>collaborated</span></a><span> with Florida Georgia Line, done acoustic Imogen Heap </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxLiDtaL4HM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>interpolations</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oGUHRXT-wA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>evoked</span></a><span> the puppy-dog hookiness of early-00's pop punk. But on </span><i>Talk Dirty</i><span>, Derulo honed in on more explicitly club-friendly sounds, positioning himself as one of R&amp;B's few capable EDM fusionists, along with the likes of Ne-Yo and Chris Brown. The album was far from cohesive, but he seemed to have a clearer idea of his strengths: fewer simpering campfire ballads, more brazen grabs at the Top 40 jugular.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Everything is 4</i> doesn't stray far from this formula, though it veers further towards 80's pop, funk, and overt Michael Jackson worship than his previous work—and while the results are varied (defiantly so, even), the highs are higher than ever. ""Want to Want Me"" is Derulo's best song, a crisp, feel-good blast of infatuated power-pop that feels warmer and more lived-in than any of his previous singles. ""Try Me"" goes breezy and Balearic, with production from Norwegian newcomer Matoma and an inspired-sounding guest verse from Jennifer Lopez. Album closer ""X2CU"" coats post-breakup stunting in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis gloss before trailing off into a sweeping, Terius Nash-esque outro. But for every hit here, there is an egregiously stupid counterpoint: ""Get Ugly"" is a brutal attempt to reprise the ubiquitous <a href=""about:blank"">""Wiggle,""</a> though the result is more like ""Sexyback"" re-imagined under the influence of a half dozen Jaeger bombs. ""Broke"" is the ultimate low point: a bluesy clunker that unites (at long last!) Keith Urban and Stevie fucking Wonder, who is forced to interpolate ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" over hokey harmonica breakdowns. It's not pretty.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But for all its blatantly ill-conceived moments, there's something charming about the sheer audacity of Derulo's often bizarre choices. Even when it falls flat, there is character here: real risks, and hints at a point of view, mixed in with the usual grab bag of assorted lust/love platitudes. And though the criticisms regarding his lack of a strong and identifiable persona, a ""Thing"" to call his own, are certainly well-founded, <i>Everything is 4</i> makes a case for Derulo's shape-shifting vagueness as compelling, especially in the age of the celebrity overshare. The more we are able to learn about our musical heroes via social media, the more complicated our relationships with them become. In that sense, it's weirdly refreshing that Derulo has bypassed the almighty cult of personality in favor of proud unknowability.</p></div>"|20669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20669-everything-is-4/|6.6|Meaghan Garvey

And that's because the Bay State breakout acts of late sound like, well, actual indie rock. There are instantly identifiable '90s precedents for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz"">Speedy Ortiz</a>'s acerbic pop quizzes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier/"">the Hotelier</a>'s strident anarcho-punk, the confrontation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23650-pile"">Pile</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31405-krill/"">Krill</a>, the downer fuzz of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30359-california-x"">California X</a>. But even though they're all from collegiate environs and feature guitar-heavy setups, don't call them ""college rock""—the politics of each strongly suggest they don't long for the days when that <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2015/04/against_indie_new_albums_from_modest_mouse_sufjan_stevens_and_more_show.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">economically and racially loaded term</a> was used. All of which makes the lack of information regarding Sweet John Bloom actually helpful. They let you know right up front that they're a Massachusetts indie rock band comprised of members from a few <i>other</i> Massachusetts indie rock bands, and little else. But that's all you really need to know going in. Their second LP<i> Weird Prayer</i> takes one of those ""What '90s Group Are You?"" quizzes and somehow gets ""all of the above.""</p>
<p>Well, ""all of the above"" over the span of about 35 minutes, not at the same time. ""I think I'm breaking, maybe breaking out/ Slightly cracking, inside there's someone else,"" yelps Sweet John Bloom's namesake on the opening ""Shapeshifter""<span>—</span>I'd call the title a little too on-the-nose if there was any indication that Sweet John Bloom considered themselves to be clever or meta. Each of <i>Weird Prayer</i>'s 15 tracks finds the quartet to be anxious, yearning, and establishing their identity as one that's liable to shift within the span of a few minutes. At any given point, they'll have the Budweiser-soaked rock star visions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices"">Guided By Voices</a> (""Blood Moon""), amble with the superficially effortless sprawl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement"">Pavement</a> (""Nothing Is Natural""), pledge allegiance to high-strung Midwestern emo (""Weird Prayer"") or the hoarse lo-fi whispers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a> (""Bury Ruby""). <i>Weird Prayer</i> has diversity, but relative to 2015, not a lot of range. It's a winner's history of indie rock that doesn't contain a lot of footnotes or room for contrarianism.</p>
<p>And all of the aforementioned had really mixed emotions about the concept of ""winning""<span>—</span>their anthems seemed accidental, success laden upon them by critics and idealist fans rather than embraced as a birthright of a rock band. At the very least, they represented something current and were superlative among their peers in real time. Sweet John Bloom, on the other hand, write good songs. There are at least 10 of them on <i>Weird Prayer</i>. Some of them generate their staying power from melodic sticking points, others from a lyric that hits straight on in between so many that work the angles.</p>
<p>But unlike their current peers in Massachusetts, it's tough to figure out where Sweet John Bloom's record collection ends and they begin. From the moment Bloom's agitated, adenoidal yelp is laid over a rhythm section that rollicks just enough to push them off the grid, Sweet John Bloom beg comparisons to the current pacesetter for comprehensive indie rock, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>. While lacking Andrew Savage's arch, referential lyricism, sifting through Bloom's words at least suggests he's a cerebral dude about his bummer attitude<span>—</span>""Pieces of your youth that you grew up clinging to/ Come later to find in life that none of it was true."" But Parquet Courts without their arch, referential lyricism is basically <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4395-tapes-n-tapes/"">Tapes 'n Tapes</a><span>—</span>they can write songs, <i>catchy</i> ones too, but they'll always have to be talked about as nostalgists by their frame of reference.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Weird Prayer</i> is at its best when Sweet John Bloom embrace the possibility that they're a power-pop band rather than an indie rock one. ""Blood Moon"" ekes further towards the Buzz Bin than ""120 Minutes"", with a chorus and bridge that leap rather than fall forward. Clear highlight ""Tell Me"" channels the enduring, simplistic appeal of teen angst into adult situations<span>—</span>doesn't matter if it's a boss, a spouse, a landlord, whatever, when Bloom hollers, ""I know what you want to say/ I know what you're trying to tell me right now/ But I ain't gonna hear it,"" you might as well be confronting your high school gym teacher. Similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32128-posse/"">Posse</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16706-shut-up/"">""Shut Up""</a>, a particularly excellent piece of '90s indie fan-fic from last year, ""Tell Me"" is a bold song about doing nothing, being passive as a form of aggression. In lieu of having a firm lyrical or philosophical platform, Sweet John Bloom somehow stand out most when they take a seat.</p></div>"|20291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20291-weird-prayer/|6.3|Ian Cohen

As she mentions several times throughout <i>Apocalypse, girl, </i>she recorded her latest album when she was 33, and like a lot of people in their Jesus year she found herself at an existential crossroads. <i>Apocalypse, girl</i> has plenty of what-does-it-all-mean moments—Hval reckons with longing and self-doubt, tentatively considers ideas of domesticity and traditional standards of satisfaction, and fantasizes about spiritual (or possibly even literal) rebirth—but she seems to have come out of her crisis even more committed to following the challenging path she’s chosen for herself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Musically, <i>Apocalypse</i> pushes boundaries that were barely visible on her last album. For all its noisy interludes and sharply angular melodies, a lot of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18135-jenny-heval-innocence-is-kinky/"">Innocence Is Kinky</a> </i>was straightforward, held down by fairly conventional arrangements of guitar, drums, and keys. Working with producer Lasse Marhaug (who met Hval when he interviewed her for his fanzine in 2014) and an ensemble of skilled improv players that includes members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2161-jaga-jazzist/"">Jaga Jazzist</a>, she deconstructs her pop sensibilities while still assembling catchy and memorable compositions. There’s a dreamy kind of ambiguity to how the songs are put together: Pop melodies emerge from washes of abstract sound, and sometimes they’ll take charge of the song, but sometimes they simply fade back into the churn. Standout track ""Heaven"" starts off with vocals over the white noise sound of falling rain, then pivots into moody, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>-like electropop, and finishes in a tonal cloud of strings and harp.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hval takes a similar approach to her lyrics, floating intriguing bits of concrete imagery in a matrix of stream-of-consciousness abstraction—Queens-bound subway cars and a scrap of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a>’s ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" tumbling past enigmatic, impressionistic lines like ""I separate from feelings/ Complex harmonic notion/ Harmonic notion."" As a lyricist, Hval sometimes feels like she has less in common with traditional songwriters than with text artists like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Holzer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jenny Holzer</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracey_Emin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Emin</a>. Like them, her deployment of words lands hardest when it hits a gnomically confrontational tone. And in terms of gnomic confrontation, it’s hard to beat the phrase ""soft dick rock.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Halfway through ""Kingsize"", the album opener full of pungent abstract lines like ""I beckon the cupcake, the huge capitalist clit,"" Hval pauses the song to whisper the question, ""What is SOFT DICK ROCK?"" How you react during the silence she lets hang in the air for a beat after the question—whether you laugh out loud or frown perplexedly—will probably determine how you feel about the rest of the album.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most obvious and immediately gratifying answer to Hval’s question is that soft dick rock is simply the spirit of fragile male ego and fear of women that rock music (among other pop styles) has sustained for the better part of a century. Baby boomer guitar gods hogging stages well into their senescence are soft dick rock; so are younger and more critically well-defended artists keeping the patriarchy alive and breathing in the counterculture.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But ""soft dick rock"" could also be music that runs counter to rock’s testosterone-driven nature. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17362-jenny-heval-that-battle-is-over/"">""That Battle Is Over""</a> is <i>Apocalypse, girl</i>’s most straightforward pop moment, with a shuffling quasi-hip-hop beat, an unhurried organ progression, and Hval singing with an uncharacteristically bluesy inflection. The lyrics are about reckoning with the legacy of an older generation’s revolution, and the question of whether the advances they made are actually doing Hval any good.

<p>And while even the big singles are supposed to hew to <i>Drones</i>’ concept, Bellamy never gets <i>too</i> specific. Lyrics like, ""Don’t leave me out to die/ I gave you everything"" led many to assume opener ""Dead Inside"" was about Bellamy’s ex-<i>fiancée</i> Kate Hudson, when it’s actually the protagonist’s blue-pill indoctrination into an army of murderbots. ""Defector"" probably wasn’t made with the intention of mirroring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9-xoRmduV4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taco Bell’s latest ad campaign</a>, but it’s way more fun to hear, ""Yeah, I’m free/ From society/ You can’t control me/ I’m a defector!"", as Bellamy waxing ecstatic about the A.M. Crunchwrap. </p>
<p>Even Muse seem to have thought their most recent work was getting too convoluted, so they’ve played up <i>Drones</i> as <a href=""http://www.1033theapp.com/muses-drones-is-a-back-to-basics-album-says-band/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""by our standards...back to basics""</a>. At their most humble, Muse were the most histrionic of the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition""><i>OK Computer</i></a> world, so <i>Drones</i> represents a chance to reflect on what Muse consider to be their ""basics"". For starters, <i>Drones</i> is ""basic"" in the sense that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13384-hail-to-the-thief-special-collectors-edition/""><i>Hail to the Thief</i></a> would be way too subtle of a pun to fit here. In both sound and its refusal to speak in anything other than the most literal, explanatory terms, <i>Drones</i> is somewhere between ""Iron Man"" and ""Mr. Roboto"". A ""[Drill Sergeant]"" interlude ends with its subject yelling ""ARE YOU A HUMAN DRONE?"", which leads into the chorus of ""Psycho""<span>—</span>""I could use someone like you/ Someone who’ll kill on my command/ And ask no questions."" ""Psycho"" itself splices <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a>’s boogie ""2x4"" and the first half of <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, although think of Marilyn Manson playing the role of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.</p>
<p>Musically, they've ditched the influence of industrial and festival EDM that resulted in the most ludicrous parts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13453-the-resistance/""><i>The Resistance</i></a> and <i>The 2nd Law</i>, which were also the best parts. While ""Dead Inside"" recalls the phallic funk thrust of <i>2nd Law</i> highlight ""Panic Station"", everything here is otherwise locked and loaded for <a href=""http://www.harmonixmusic.com/games/rock-band/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rock Band 4</i></a>. On some level, it’s heartening to know this stuff can still exist in 2015—the marathon tapping solo on ""Reapers"" or the 720-hp revving of ""The Handler"" are almost thrilling in their commitment. But even Muse's down-and-dirty rock record includes a 10-minute suite, and the very next song is an a cappella chorale of a thousand Matt Bellamys. Moreover, <i>Drones</i> is produced by Mutt Lange and boasts cover art from Matt Mahurin, who spent the early '90s slathering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps317u9Rhl0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bush</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ1kAzZ04Tg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNh-iw7gsuI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundgarden</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeIBfWQYbuI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a> in the grunge-glam sludge. The last time Lange and Mahurin collaborated on the same record, Def Leppard was asking us to<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP9wVS857v8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> stand up and kick love into motion</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever pleasure can be generated from Bellamy’s admirable melodic sense and overblown hooks is negated by Muse’s insistence that they’re <i>profound</i> rather than fun. They’re too humorless to be camp, unwilling to explore the obvious homoerotic subtext of the plot (I mean, just <a href=""https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tzenzxydbbn4yijzzy6kk4kmrqy?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read the lyrics to ""Psycho""</a>) and unshakable in their errant belief they’re tearing down a power structure rather than solidifying it. <i>Drones</i> might as well be overlain with <i>Entourage, </i>à la <i>Wizard of Oz</i>/<i>Dark Side of the Moon,</i> for the ultimate in critical hate-consumption. Muse’s operatic vocal runs, tablature-bustin’ riffs, and CGI'd production feel unmistakably similar to the way Doug Ellin brandishes yachts, celebrity cameos, and bared breasts. If it’s luxury porn, just own up—we know it when we see it.</p></div>"|20520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20520-drones/|4.5|Ian Cohen

Spitting bile through clenched teeth, Mark Morgan conjured flanged wastelands via guitar; Jon Lockie pounded primal, desperate drums; and Richard Hoffman whipped up hypnotic, Lotto-hopper basslines. At Sightings’ most ferocious, on uncompromising slabs like 2002’s </span><span><i>Michigan Haters</i> </span><span>and 2005’s </span><i>End Times</i><span>, these elements entangled so thrillingly and violently that they became impossible to separate.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The band unexpectedly called it a day in the spring of 2013. Recorded during the sessions for that year’s </span><span><i>Terribly Well</i> </span><span>LP, </span><i>Amusers and Puzzlers </i><span>feels less like a swan song than the inevitable next evolutionary step. Though the crude no wave of 2002’s </span><i>Sightings</i><span> would give way, over the years, to sharper fidelity and songcraft and the odd stylistic tangent—check 2004’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7145-arrived-in-gold/""><i>Arrived in Gold</i></a><span>, a photo-negative spin on the band’s enervating convulsions—true change surfaced with 2011’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15480-future-accidents/""><i>Future Accidents</i></a><span>. The 19-minute long instrumental ""Public Remains"" ushered in a studied, queasy ambience that split the difference between cut-up drone, dub, and gutter blues. Indeed, this muted malevolence would carry over to the wordless cyborg whirr and stammer of </span><i>Terribly Well</i><span>’s ""Yellow""—even as the surrounding tunes snarled characteristically, if less caustically.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Amusers and Puzzlers</i><span> strikes a similar balance of short order bomb-out and wandering balm. ""Counterfeited"" segues from squirmy bass-led melodic figure to crazed percussive thump and back, as guitars seethe and squawk off in the corner. ""13"" strains, stipples, and thrums, all sandpaper tension and slurried distortion; the pulverizing ""Trials of Peter"" shoves in every direction at once. ""1982"" imagines a manic atonal triptych—short-circuiting guitar next to irrepressible bass bounce next to coiled drumkit OCD—then slowly increases the tempo as Morgan transforms into the world’s most unhinged carnival barker; it’s like listening to a punk song being fed into a clogged garbage disposal.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The irradiated, 16-minute ""Syllabus of Error"" casts a long bummer of a shadow over the rest, representative of T</span><span>he Ghost of Sightings Future</span><span> in a way that ""Public Remains"" and ""Yellow"" could only hint at. A brittle patchwork of drones thrumming at various frequencies and abrupt static smears, ""Syllabus"" feels unsettling, haunted—at once slighter and more haphazard than its predecessors. Gorgeous, aquatic guitar chords drift idly past or flame out curtly; feedback threatens to knife the variegated din. Glassine, sonar effects sound. A rattling buzz lends the tableau an additional air of menace that eventually consumes any warmth that might have been implied early on. This was clearly the direction Sightings were headed in, and had they soldiered forward, it would have been fascinating to hear where they'd eventually wind up.</span></p></div>"|20631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20631-amusers-and-puzzlers/|7.5|Raymond Cummings

In the early '90s, she co-founded the noise-rock band <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33x436EPGpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gift Horse</a> with Jef Whitehead (later of Wrest and Leviathan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8660-show-no-mercy/"">infamy</a>).

She also formed her own dark folk-rock outfit, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqdg6ed2wPc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bee and Flower</a>, which has released music on Neurosis’ label <a href=""http://www.neurotrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neurot</a>, and she’s served as a touring bassist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/222-american-music-club/"">American Music Club</a>. Her upcoming guest appearances include slide guitar on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/relapserecords/05-an-index-of-air-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""An Index of Air""</a> from <i>Infinite Dissolution</i>, the imminent full-length by the experimental metal/noise band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"">Locrian</a>. These projects are distinct, but together they help echolocate the lush, prickly drone of Schechter’s latest ongoing concern, Insect Ark.</p>
<p><i>Portal/Well</i> is Insect Ark’s debut album, after a pair of 7''s and a stellar 2013 EP, <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bKLJye89a8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Long Arms</a></i>. But where <i>Long Arms</i> seemed constricted by its three-song runtime, <i>Portal/Well</i> sprawls. Performed entirely by Schechter, the album is built primarily out of programmed drums, synthesizers, radically effected lap steel guitar, and ominously monumental basslines. In that sense it’s more or less a bedroom recording project—only the bedroom involved is in the locked attic of a decaying mansion that’s cocooned with cobwebs and haunted by shadowy memories.</p>
<p>That aura of estrangement, metamorphosis, and loss is mirrored in the gauzy blur of ""Octavia"", a monstrously slow meditation that feels more like an accumulation of stray sounds over eons than any kind of conventionally arranged song. At the same time it’s <i>Portal/Well</i>’s most alluringly melodic track, even if that melody is telescoped into a cosmic smear of shoegaze ghostliness without anything so tidy as a resolution. ""Octavia"", though, is a stadium anthem compared to ""Low Moon"", whose minimalist incantations of static are more abstract and disorienting—a study in gray washes and grainy textures that defines the sonic envelope of <i>Portal/Well</i>, from the amp-hum ambience of ""Parallel Twin"" to the corroded majesty of ""Taalith"". It’s a heavy record, both in timbre and disposition, but it avoids the apocalyptic template of tension-climax-aftermath in favor of something less rigid and linear, without even the cold comfort of a causal link between destruction and remorse.</p>
<p>As grim as it can get, <i>Portal/Well</i> isn’t another trite ode to annihilation. The title track oozes an eerie curiosity, with Schechter’s nomadic bass and slithering licks of guitar probing the deepest reaches of classic prog. It’s not as emotionally gripping as some of the album’s bleaker moments, but it grounds Insect Ark in a tradition—one of cerebral rock played with passion and without compromise. That approach doesn’t always work as well as it could; the aimlessly hallucinatory ""Lowlands"", for example, barely serves as a brief interlude, let alone a song of its own. But taken as a whole, the album is more about enduring than ending, a doorway into hollowness and lonesomeness that contracts and dilates with a horrific rhythm.</p>
<p>Schechter has recently doubled the roster of Insect Ark by enlisting Ashley Spungin of the experimental doom duo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO8W5PzSu2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taurus</a> on drums and electronics. Although Spungin doesn’t appear on <i>Portal/Well</i>, her addition to Insect Ark seems foreshadowed by the album; like Taurus, Insect Ark is informed by the unsettling, alienating '70s soundtrack work of groups like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SI7SYh47Ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goblin</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOkfBbVZEGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. That eerie, cinematic scope rears its head on ""The Collector""<i>, Portal/Well</i>’s most evocative track. Like some vast beast tossing in its sleep, the song lurches from staccato chunks of bass to nightmarish cascades of synths, all the while maintaining a queasy, menacing dream logic. <i>Portal/Well</i> may not have a feature film to go with it, but with compositions as vivid and immersive as Schechter’s, it doesn’t need one.</p></div>"|20655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20655-portalwell/|7.3|Jason Heller

The band name furthers that notion. <i>World</i>'s cover, a sigil of a cross and death's sickle, is imposing and cryptic. But appearances can be deceiving: The album's six songs work within the limits of hardcore and industrial to create a monolithic record that slyly undermines its central thrust.</p>
<p>Let's get the only criticism, a fairly minor one at that, out of the way—the opener and title track is far and away the best song. Who would think that a stark industrial song, with a rhythm ready to break down and self-destruct at any moment, would be a summer jam? Over a sharp and thin <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"">Ministry</a>-like attack, Greenberg programs a drum track suggestive of a metal drummer stuck in a blast-beat fugue state. His guitar grows increasingly paranoid as the song progresses, and Berdan's shrieks contribute to the tension, but ""World"" never loses its hook. Greenberg's pop instincts he cultivated during his tenure in The Men shine through Berdan's screeching voice and the brittle guitar. Thankfully, he's returned those talents to heavy music, not settling for bar rock. The Men were best when they simultaneously rode the lines of making clubs feel like stadiums and punk as destructive freedom, and Uniform might be, spiritually, the closest thing we'll get to their older works.</p>
<p>On ""Buyer's Remorse"", Uniform exhume '80s hardcore. Hardcore as a genre has explored dystopia plenty, but Uniform bob and swing with an urgency as if the stage-divers, instead of flailing about in the disorganization of their own lives, are out to specifically target you. ""Indifference"" moves toward a dark dance atmosphere, where Greenberg shifts his programming from metal purgatory to militaristic bass and snare. Feedback gets corralled into moaning riffs. Occasionally the guitar reaches blissful heights, contrasting and mocking the hell below. Dance music's utopian promise of one love and its undeniable undercurrent of sleaze all mix together, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17665-prurient-through-the-window/""><i>Through the Window</i></a> with guitar in the mix.</p>
<p><i>World</i>'s last two songs, ""Lost Causes"", a collaboration with former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a> member Drew McDowall, and ""Learning to Forget"" are slower than the rest of the album, and would seem like Uniform's letting you coast off anesthetized. Not quite: ""Causes"" submerges the band's torment under unsettlingly pleasant drift, bringing Uniform's themes of suppression to their logical conclusion. Greenberg's guitar comes back roaring in ""Learning"", with Berdan, once the angry punk kid, rambling hushed and defeated. There's no pulse, and signs of life have been stamped out. The last two songs demonstrate how the spirit dies long before the flesh.</p></div>"|20654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20654-perfect-world/|7.6|Andy O'Connor

Beyond the slippery nature of the music, there’s also the fact that whatever amount of fame he achieved happened some years after he died at age 40 in 1992, so we never got much of a chance to hear from the man himself. And then on top of all that, he almost never finished anything—even <i>he</i> had trouble figuring out what his music should be. Russell left behind fragments and half-completed tracks with a lot of empty spaces and unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Those empty spaces are where we, the listeners, come in. The members of Russell’s audience, most of whom assembled long after he was gone, each individually provide the missing pieces of the puzzle, and so reactions to his music tend to be very personal. The first time I heard of Arthur Russell someone on a <a href=""http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?action=showall&amp;boardid=41&amp;threadid=11944"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">message board</a> called his music ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a> in dub,"" and that descriptor always stuck with me. It captured his essential contrast, between the most close-mic'd and hushed bedroom singer-songwriter, whose music epitomizes a life alone, and the expansive, outward-looking productions designed, ultimately, as a tool for the massed activity of dance. Russell loved dance music and the collective possibility of the disco, but he also holed up by himself in rooms and created songs that sounded like one-to-one confessions. So his music speaks to an oddly paradoxical existential state that nevertheless feels very familiar: a warm and playful state of communal loneliness.</p>
<p>In his lifetime, he released just one full-length under his own name (his strangest and also arguably his best—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/""><i>World of Echo</i></a>). But since he recorded and tinkered constantly, we’ve been met in this century with a raft of compilations, ""lost albums,"" and coulda-been albums, all of which, save the still-brilliant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6907-the-world-of-arthur-russell/""><i>The World of Arthur Russell</i></a>, the <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a> comp that kicked off the Russell appreciation in 2004, and 1994's <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/8492-Point-Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Point Music</a>-released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9374-another-thought/"">Another Thought</a></i>,<i> </i>have been overseen by Steve Knutson of the <a href=""http://audikarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Audika</a> imprint. Because the vast majority of people who have heard his music experienced it in the context of an archival release more than a decade after his death, Russell has developed an unusual cult consisting mostly of record obsessives. Arthur Russell, as we know him, is the product of contemporary reissue culture.</p>
<p><i>Corn</i> is another lost album that, unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12375-love-is-overtaking-me/""><i>Love Is Overtaking Me</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6908-calling-out-of-context/""><i>Calling Out of Context</i></a>, was close to being released at some point in the early 1980s, according to some notes and test pressings. That’s somewhat ironic, though, because, of the major Russell reissue projects so far, the nine tracks on <i>Corn</i> sound the most like demos. <i>Solid</i> demos, to be sure, with complete arrangements and decent fidelity, but there’s something skeletal about these tracks that separates it from both the fizzy new wave of <i>Context</i> and the clear, full acoustic tracks on <i>Love</i>. A number of these tracks have also been released in other versions, in some cases with better sound quality, and a few of those are his most well-known tracks. ""See My Brother, He’s Jumping Out (Let’s Go Swimming #2)"", best known via the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqfKH1ooYzs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Walter Gibbons mix on <i>World</i></a>, is one, and the take of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKgPmnjbAy8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Keeping Up""</a> on <i>Another Thought<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9374-another-thought/""></a></i>, with background vocals by Jennifer Warnes, still seems definitive compared to the one here. A more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5gjfN5lns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fleshed-out</a> ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"" was collected on <i>Another Thought</i>, but in this dry and ultra-stripped down version the smallest unit of sound is given so much weight.</p>
<p>Despite the familiarity, <i>Corn</i> holds together remarkably well. These songs feel like they belong together and are meant to be heard on <i>this</i> record, in this sequence. And where previous Russell reissue projects tended to cluster tracks in a similar style together, this record shows the full range of what he was up to and makes it coherent. Broadly speaking, the record is mostly drum machine-driven electro-pop, without the abandon of Russell in disco mode or the intimacy of his acoustic tracks, but all of his styles are in here somewhere. ""Lucky Cloud"" is as straightforward a pop song as Russell allowed himself. The two versions of ""Corn"" and ""Hiding Your Present From You"" are more free-form jams, with Russell soloing on a cello run through a distortion pedal. And the closing ""Ocean Movie"" is an abstract instrumental, almost neo-krautrock in its heavily textured spaciness. In a sense <i>Corn</i> feels like a lo-fi, weirder version of <i>The World of Arthur Russell</i>, in the way it serves as an introduction to all his different approaches while also demonstrating so clearly the threads between them.</p>
<p>It’s unusual to recommend so highly an album like this one, where you can realistically say that it’s the third- or fourth-best posthumous release from an obscure artist. And there is no doubt that this isn’t the place to start with Russell. But while the default reaction in cases like this are cynicism—barrel-scraping to cash in on a legacy—the Audika project has been something else. My guess is that being in the Arthur Russell business has never been a good way to make a lot of money, not while he was alive and certainly not now. Regardless, because these collections are presented with such care, put together and sequenced in order to give the listener an experience, they come over as acts of generosity.</p></div>"|20568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20568-corn/|8.3|Mark Richardson

Smith</a>’s fearsome reputation as rock's consummate contrarian crank and irascible iconoclast, the first two decades of the Fall’s evolution could more or less be charted alongside developments in British music at large. From the primitivist punk of their late-'70s releases, to the synth-powered pop of their chart-breaching mid-'80s output, to the baggy grooves of early '90s dancefloor infiltrators like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soXdnisOWCs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Telephone Thing""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1S6WsqIia8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Free Range""</a>, the Fall weren’t so much an antidote to popular music as a funhouse-mirror distortion of it, with Smith’s anti-social snarl having a corrupting effect on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_W4uc66lM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jaunty honky-tonk shuffles</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4VdcMXVO_g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>soccer-stadium-worthy sing-alongs</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHQfFre8yJA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the great British songbook</span></a><span>. But by the mid-'90s—not coincidentally, the time when UK rock music turned slavishly retro—the Fall’s path diverged sharply from the mainstream forevermore. Since the turn of the millennium, they’ve been firmly lodged in their post-modern phase, reformulating their well-established inspirations—rockabilly, '60s garage, Beefheart, Krautrock, avant-garde noise—into a ceaseless stream of pastiche-packed albums that </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2980-fall-heads-roll/""><span>occasionally</span></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14202-your-future-our-clutter/""><span> cohere</span></a><span>, but mostly confound.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Technically speaking, </span><i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i><span> is the Fall’s 31st album, but given their rudderless recent trajectory, it could just as easily be their 27th or 29th. That’s not so much a comment on the consistency of the current Fall lineup—which has remarkably remained in place for a record-breaking eight years now—as the fact that each new Fall album that’s surfaced over the past decade has represented a discrete, hermetically sealed unit, impervious to environmental or temporal influence. They've become a timeless band in the truest sense of the word, their records resembling both mysterious unearthed artifacts and garbled transmissions from an indeterminate future. On <i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i>, even the customary pop-cultural references—always <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERtVHcQJKE4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m7s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a reliable measure</a> for carbon-dating a Fall record—feel oddly anachronistic, the album climaxing with back-to-back scuzz-punk screeds about Facebook (""Fibre Book Troll"") and smartphone addiction (""Quit iPhone"") that could’ve just as easily appeared on a Fall record back in 2008. </span></p>
<p>Ironically, the Fall’s most tight-knit lineup ever—now appended with a second drummer—has proven to be the most aesthetically malleable: on <i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i>, they flit from space-age bachelor pad synth doodles (""Black Roof"") to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18732-william-onyeabor-who-is-william-onyeabor/""><span>William Onyeabor</span></a>-style West African hypno-groove (""Junger Cloth"") to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a> cover-band karaoke (""Stout Man"", which is basically what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spF0gR54XUU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Cock In My Pocket""</span></a> would sound like if Iggy got kicked in the nuts). But, in spite of their surprising stability, this iteration of the Fall is strangely lacking in audible camaraderie, and on <i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i>, the distance between frontman and backing band feels more pronounced than ever. More often than not, the album comes off less like a product of intuitive interaction than the group churning out rehearsal-space warm-up exercises for Smith to spew over, shifting course and fading out at random. Strip away his loogie-gargling, melody-averse vocals from the lockstep dub-disco of ""Dedication Not Medication"", the squelching funk of ""Pledge!"", and the loose-limbed swing of ""Snazzy"", and the Fall effectively resemble the world’s most cantankerous jam band.</p>
<p><span><span>The Fall are nobody's idea of a pop band, but Smith has always understood the value of a big hook, something you can grab and swing on while the ground below crumbles.</span></span><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e48f4f05-bcf7-119d-42d7-a284274a4cae""><span> And though their legend has been built upon volatility and relentless non-conformism, the band produce their most vital work when they adhere to rock-song schematics while scribbling between the lines. </span><span><i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i></span><span> opens with a corker in ""Venice With the Girls"" (yet another fine addition to the lineage of derisive Fall songs about </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StNEZugOZ_k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>leisure</span></a><span>-</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QftnPNjQXs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>class</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl5l1ErGtkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> travellers</span></a><span>), but, in typically perverse logic, the album’s most tightly wound song is also its most sprawling. Clocking in at 10 exhilarating minutes, ""Auto Chip 2014-2016"" not only boasts <span id=""docs-internal-guid-e48f4f05-bcf7-119d-42d7-a284274a4cae""><span><i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i></span></span>’s most quintessentially Fall-like chant, it finds the band, for once, casting out with a clear destination in sight, gradually applying pedal pressure on a sun-bound motorik rhythm until it achieves lift-off. ""Sufferin’!"" goes the song’s one-word earworm of a chorus—ironically, it’s the rare moment on </span><i>Sub-Lingual Tablet</i><span> when we’re not.</span></span></p></div>"|20639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20639-sub-lingual-tablet/|6.0|Stuart Berman

A former student of electro-acoustic composition at the Conservatoire de Paris, she began, in the mid '00s, with lo-fi synthesizer music, hazy and diffuse and steeped in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> tradition—full of misty Roland pads, new age sparkle, and tape hiss. And she made quite a lot of it, too, turning out at least seven albums between 2008 and 2010, many of them CDRs. Coming into the new decade, though, she became more deliberate. She put out fewer releases, but they were far more sharply defined. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18213-stellar-om-source-joy-one-mile/""><i>Joy One Mile</i></a>, released in 2013 on <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG</a>, adopted snapping drum machines and references to techno and rave. It was full of hard surfaces and sharp edges, and while it was often woozier and more idiosyncratic than most functionalist club music, it wasn't hard to see where its allegiances lay, what kind of feelings it wanted to evoke.</p>
<p>On <i>Nite-Glo</i>, Stellar OM Source's transformation is complete. From the opening notes of ""Sudden""—a rubbery TB-303 bassline perforated by needling analog hi-hats—it's clear that we're in techno terrain. All four tracks are marked by four-to-the-floor drum machines, squirrelly acid basslines, and wiry synth accents; there's not a lot to indicate whether they're from 1988 or 2018. Their stripped-down sound comes, in part, from the fact that she recorded the EP on the road, utilizing her touring setup. (In order to keep her luggage beneath the airlines' 20-kilogram limit, she keeps her kit light, just a handful of hardware machines.) And their clubby punch comes, likewise, from the fact that they were developed night after night in dark, sweaty rooms under the age-old, after-midnight rubric, ""Fuck art, let's dance.""</p>
<p>But to say that Gualdi has fallen into techno is not to say that she has gotten complacent. Much of the pleasure here lies in the way that she takes well-worn forms and makes them fresh again. In the opening ""Sudden"", the bassline strikes a perfect balance between softness and bite, and the staccato claps and snares lend a hint of delirium, but what brings the track alive are the more unexpected elements: a breathy vocal sample that casts a thin yellow light in the midst of all that darkness, like a flashlight in a coal cellar; the improbable major chords that flare up towards the end, giddy and shivering.</p>
<p>A similar sense of displacement animates everything here. ""Never"" begins with an acid bassline that might be an answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13181-larry-heard/"">Larry Heard</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdIQTEYXDP4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Sun Can't Compare""</a>, and for nearly three minutes, it all feels pretty straightforward. But then she introduces a gauzy augmented chord, and it's like a skylight above the dance floor has been thrown open. The new notes aren't discordant, necessarily, but they're not really in key, either; if you heard it in a club, you might assume that the spine-tingling frisson came from a new record being worked into the mix. And, per Gualdi's real-time techniques, the track just keeps morphing, as the bassline gives way to a sprightly funk motif, and the whole tune locks into a gritty Sheffield-bleep vibe. ""Live"" drizzles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8VY5dxq5CU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mentasm""</a> stabs over squelchy chords and dissolves into a spray of atonal squawks, and ""Sure"" somehow manages to go from grinding acid to brightly colored, ballooning chords; at the end, it morphs once again into scowling new-wave electro. In an interview with <i><a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/02/stellar-om-source-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT</a></i>, Gualdi has said that unspecified personal losses helped give shape to the album, but it never sounds melancholic, exactly. To the contrary, a spirit of play reigns supreme.</p></div>"|20640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20640-nite-glo-ep/|7.1|Philip Sherburne

Their self-titled 2007 debut was an austere <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikebana"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ikebana</a> arrangement of bass, drums, vocals, and guitar that felt like an exercise in making a post-punk record out of the fewest number of notes possible. On their next album, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16231-prinzhorn-dance-school/""><i>Clay Class</i></a>, Tobin Prinz and Suzi Horn streamlined even more by removing some of the rhythmic flourishes. Coming into their third LP it seemed like there wasn’t a superfluous gesture left for the pair to remove from their sound, but they’ve managed to find some anyhow. <i>Home Economics</i> is in some ways an even more spartan album than its predecessors, and on other levels it’s a far richer listen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There isn’t a note on </span><i>Home Economics</i><span> that doesn’t feel like it had to make it through several rounds of cuts to secure a spot on the record. In the album’s 20 or so minutes—Horn and Prinz have reached the point where six songs qualifies as an album—there’s not a superfluous millisecond. It’s a minor monument to obsessive compulsive behavior and brutal efficiency.</span></p>
<p>The funny thing is that while the pair have been surgically removing elements, a very human kind of warmth has crept in. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10601-prinzhorn-dance-school/""><i>Prinzhorn Dance School</i></a> and <i>Clay Class</i> felt like a tightly edited version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>, the band’s latest feels like a Zen-garden <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>. Prinz and Horn have not only adopted an expanded worldview that allows room for considering interpersonal relationships outside the context of the capitalist-imperialist system, they’ve also started to show an unexpected gift for creating pop hooks. The aggressive edge from their earlier work hasn’t gone away completely, and you can still feel it lurking just below the surface, which gives songs like the immensely catchy opening track ""Reign"" or the sweetly tender ""Clean"" the same sense of tentativeness—an almost tangible feeling of someone hesitantly letting down their guard in hopes of connecting with someone else—that give <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w43uSMJntgw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Temptation""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt5JdZTD9k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bizarre Love Triangle""</a> their emotional wallop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Without this newfound softness, </span><i>Home Economics</i><span> would have been much harder to connect with. The pair play negative space like an instrument; at several points on the record, an instrument will appear to be building up to a flourish before dropping out completely—silence as solo. But rather than feeling stark and severe, there’s an elegant grace in the simplicity. It makes a listener lean in to find an unexpectedly warm embrace.</span></p></div>"|20600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20600-home-economics/|6.7|Miles Raymer

They traded audio files and compiled an album—2004’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3321-connected/""><i>Connected</i></a>—before they’d ever seen each other. The LP marked a creative shift for Phonte who, at the time, was known only as an MC with rap group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2608-little-brother/"">Little Brother</a>.</p>
<p>For Nicolay, <i>Connected</i> was a coming out of sorts; its success brought more attention to his atmospheric blend of soul and electronica. Years before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/"">Rhye</a> gained attention for their airy Quiet Storm-inflected R&amp;B, Nic created the same sorts of Eurocentric grooves. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9503-here/""><i>Here</i></a>, his 2006 LP, tinkered with hip-hop soul and featured <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Wiz Khalifa</a> long before he became ""The Stoner Guy."" By 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12630-leave-it-all-behind/""><i>Leave It All Behind</i></a>, Phonte ditched rap to mostly sing full time; Nicolay’s melodies grew bigger and brighter, an evolution that continued on 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11548-saturday-night-ft-carlitta-durand/""><i>City Lights Vol. 2: Shibuya</i></a>, which was inspired by his first visit to Tokyo.</p>
<p>In turn, <i>City Lights Vol. 3: Soweto</i> was recorded after the Foreign Exchange’s first trip to South Africa in 2014. Where <i>Shibuya</i> felt like a scenic stroll through Tokyo’s nightlife, <i>Soweto</i> is lush and vibrant, carried by a persistent thump that picks up steam as the album progresses. This isn't an album of singles; it’s a summery mix of breezy dance tunes, sequenced without pauses for a unified listening experience. You can pluck out certain numbers, but <i>Soweto</i> is meant to be played in the order it's presented. At times, Nicolay sings through a Vocoder, and narrator Nomusa Nzima walks us through the nuances of South Africa's Zulu dialect.</p>
<p>Though the LP follows <i>Shibuya</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5920-city-lights-volume-15/""><i>City Lights Vol. 1.5</i></a><i> </i>in Nic’s discography, it has the same radiant vibe as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18531-the-foreign-exchange-love-in-flying-colors/""><i>Love in Flying Colors</i></a>, his group’s 2013 release. Phonte is somewhat of a co-star here; his tenor crops up sporadically amongst the producer’s tropical arrangements, joined occasionally by Carmen Rodgers and Tamisha Waden. Yet on the album’s two best songs—""The Brightest Star"" and ""The Secret""—the Foreign Exchange collaborators assume a more prominent role.</p>
<p><i>Soweto</i> pivots between dark and light textures. Songs like ""Aurora"" and ""The Chase"" recall <i>Shibuya</i>’s pastoral mood, but the energy ramps up by album midpoint ""The Brightest Star"". Nicolay's renditions of South African dance rhythms are both faithful and distinctive, and you can hear his aesthetic in many of the album's small decisions. On ""Sun Rings/Uprising"", for instance, Nic uses light keys and synthesizers to initiate the piece. By its second half, he stacks the percussion and lifts the mood. <i>Soweto</i> is an understated record, not meant to be a power punch. It could soundtrack your next cookout, or your next morning run, and while it's modest, it keeps a good party going.</p></div>"|20637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20637-city-lights-vol-3-soweto/|6.8|Marcus J.

These moments bookend a world and a worldview; as its title suggests, the album is a musical vacation. Instead of following a straightforward path, Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment spill outward, finding new inlets and tributaries to explore. <i>Surf</i> contains multitudes, contradictions: ambitious, but playfully so; lighthearted in spirit but fiercely moral; wide-ranging in its influences, mapped onto a coherent whole. It's a new sound built on lots of older ones—indie, hip-hop, funk, rock, gospel, various strains of R&amp;B, <i>The Lion King</i> soundtrack—and despite bringing on a large cast and letting each person play their part, the guests all exist on the Social Experiment's terrain. The album touches on many ideas and moods, but above all, is a celebration of friendship, and a tribute to the alchemic power of collaboration.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>'s success allowed the group the space to take such a purposefully meandering approach. In the wake of his hugely successful sophomore tape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/""><i>Acid Rap</i></a>, Chance ignored the industry's baits and lures. Freed from its constraints and pressures, with a devoted flock waiting eagerly behind him, he's directed his time and energy to his friends. So as you may have heard, this album does not belong to Chance the Rapper, but to Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment (that's Nico Segal and Peter ""Cottontale"" Wilkins, Nate Fox, Greg ""Stix"" Landfair Jr., and Chancelor Bennett himself). The group has extraordinary range, and thanks to time on the road as Chance's touring band, the chops to execute. But whatever the name on the packaging, this project <i>does</i> belong to Chance the Rapper: He is still the album's main draw, and despite the number of guests and the cover art billing, its guiding spirit feels reflective of his own ideas and values—albeit in a less intensive, less personal form than on <i>Acid Rap</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Donnie Trumpet, though, is our official headliner, and as such, the album intermittently features his horn's impressionistic interludes. On ""Nothing Came to Me"" and ""Something Came to Me"", his smeared, effects-laden playing recalls <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ellis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Ellis</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27976-jon-hassel/"">Jon Hassell</a>. But Donnie Trumpet also makes his presence known throughout the record, punctuating the marching band-meets-MJ dancefloor record ""Slip Slide"", or taking a fiery solo on ""Just Wait"". The overall sonic blueprint coheres gradually, as a diverse range of records bundle up a diverse range of sounds: say, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13390-bone-thugs-n-harmony/"">Bone Thugs</a>-style harmony (""Just Wait""), a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_James"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick James</a>-style funk groove (""Wanna Be Cool""), or an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic5vxw3eijY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American Boy""</a>-style disco record (""Go"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the variety of influences and ideas, the vision coheres in the details: use of space, rhythmic variation, creative whimsy, a musicality that feels consciously shaped to convey levity, comfort, and freedom. Certain tracks feel more like frames without pictures, melted sandcastles rather than the fully functioning parapets of actual songs. In some sense, the constellation of sounds isn't far from a DJ mix. Think, maybe, of the beachfront party eclecticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"">the Avalanches</a> as produced by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizell_Brothers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mizell Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Franklin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kirk Franklin</a>, heavily featuring the Art Ensemble of Chicago's Lester Bowie.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But these pieces are linked in large part by the quirks of Chance's personality. And these quirks can sometimes be divisive. It's hard to imagine anyone could be <i>mad</i> at Chance: as rap stars go, he appears about as decent and well-adjusted as a person can possibly be. But he boldly and unapologetically embraces aesthetics that, historically, aren't fashionable, or are seen as uncool: the affected staginess of musical theater, the lyrical pretensions of slam poetry, a nostalgia not just for the memories of childhood, but the very feelings of childhood innocence. His debut project <i><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper/sets/chance-the-rapper-10day"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10 Day</a> </i>stood out so starkly in its innocence, it was easy to see it as unconscious naivete; now, it seems quite purposeful, a point Chance makes explicit on ""Wanna Be Cool"", a song featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/superduperkyle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KYLE</a> with vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>. The record's message of self-love in the face of social pressure, and the fruitlessness of cool-chasing, aren't merely ""Hip to Be Square"" updates for 2015, but represents Chance's wider philosophical approach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Acid Rap</i><span>, an easy critical favorite, dealt with ""serious"" subjects, autobiographical and sociopolitical, and implied a looming darkness: an artist who'd created a space for himself and his friends to flourish wrestled with the encroaching troubles of the outside world. Here, the anxiety is tamped down (we're on vacation, after all), and many songs indulge in the rhetoric of self-affirmation and positivity, like the gleeful release of a submerged balloon rushing to the surface. But this isn't a blind, didactic positivity: it often takes the shape of wisdom, and is actually quite practical, an argument and set of tools for living in the real world, as on the coda of ""Slip Side"": ""It ain’t so easy, but it’s not so hard/ To stand up, stand up, but it’s just too easy to sit back down."" (Alternately, the hook to ""Just Wait""—""Good things come to those that wait""—repeated in a similar mantra format, is the rare moment more suited to a coffee mug.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But just as this album suggest a coherent personal philosophy, Chance resists taking himself too seriously, most explicitly on the ambiguous ""Windows"", which he's <a href=""https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/604738668624936960"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called</a> his favorite song on the tape: ""Don't trust a word I say."" That record itself is driven primarily by its enigmatic lyrics and unusual composition, its vocals a tonal color, with foregrounded percussion. But if we are not to listen to his words, his actions provide an equally responsible blueprint: his generosity with the guest list is democratic in the extreme. Chance and Donnie elevate friends from his hometown (rappers <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sabapivot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saba</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32699-leather-corduroys/"">Joey Purp</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a> and <a href=""http://www.nonamegypsy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Noname Gypsy</a>) to equal footing with musical legends (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"">Busta Rhymes</a>) and established stars (Quavo from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>). In several instances, it is the locals whose parts shine brightest: poet and singer <a href=""http://jamilawoodswrites.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jamila Woods</a>' feature on ""Questions"", in addition to providing tonal balance, is the album's emotive heart, a moment of elegiac reflection.</p>
<p>The core of Chance's principled approach might suggest a line of continuity with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and what the writer Reggie Ugwu described as his <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/reggieugwu/the-radical-christianity-of-kendrick-lamar#.fndJBzyNr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""radical Christianity.""</a> And certainly, his music is rooted in gospel, and he stakes a moral position when such stances are readily dismissed in certain corners. Church is even referenced explicitly in ""Sunday Candy"". But Chance's position on religion is elusive. ""Sunday Candy"" could certainly be read as a statement of religious intent, but it's first and foremost a song about familial love, and all of the particulars of Christianity become vivid, evocative associations not with spiritual life through religion, but through love of friends and family.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1fd9c8ea-bb27-5f80-535f-fdc469b92758"">There's a classic disco record by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32742-dinosaur-l/"">Dinosaur L</a>—a group built around the avant-garde cellist and disco producer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>—called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfPcF-sBOD0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Go Bang""</a>, popular at the Paradise Garage, in which vocalists shout out: ""I want to see, all my friends at once!/ I'd do anything, to get the chance to go back!"" In many ways, what feels fulfilling about <i>Surf</i> is in the fantasy of its creation: of musicians and friends who've secured the fanbase to experiment, working together to explore their creative impulses, letting each artist's fingerprints help shape a singular product. It's that sense of collaboration that energizes this project, and as much as this feels like an accomplishment already, it points equally to future possibilities. Chance has admitted to fantasies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>-level pop success, and while he's taking his time here, there's an element of looking to the future even in his rapping. While written with absolute precision and poetic skill that rivals the best rappers currently working, Chance's words tumble from his mouth effortlessly, as if he's already done with the verse by the time he recites it, looking to what's next. </span></p></div>"|20664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/|8.3|David Drake

The 10 songs on <i>Before the World Was Big</i> not only employ a bare minimum of chords (two, pretty much always) but a minimum of notes. If you’d never held a guitar, or even seen one, you could be gently coached to play <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17387-girlpool-ideal-world/"">""Ideal World""</a>, the album’s opening track, within three minutes of being handed one. The same is true of many others.</p>
<p>And yet, <span><i>Before the World Was Bi</i>g</span><span> brims with a mysterious power, a charged and palpable sense of hope and awe. Focusing on the clean bones of the songs only leads you to be astonished by how </span><i>full</i><span> they feel. This is music with no corners, no hidden places in the arrangements, and the emotions emerge with gratifying clarity. Harmony Tividad and Cleo Tucker—who sing occasionally in harmony and occasionally in unison, but </span><i>always</i><span> together—seem to be singing in the center of an empty, well-lit room, staring directly at you. To listen to </span><i>Before the World Was Big</i><span> is to meet their gaze and feel slightly unnerved and exhilarated. It is a quiet album of uncommon intensity.</span></p>
<p>Tividad and Tucker formed Girlpool when they were 17 and 18, and they told anyone who asked them at the time that they were drawn to each other for their shared sense of purpose: ""We wanted something that was honest and straightforward,"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/girlpool-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""We both wanted to be super vulnerable…Because of the stripped down nature of our music, if one of us messes up, it’s incredibly noticeable. We’re not trying to hide."" In part, it is this clarity of purpose that resounds from the empty spaces on their debut LP. Their EP was shouted, and in its hardy squall, you could hear two powerful voices honing in on some way they might make a dent in the universe. Sometimes, it felt like watching a kid run into a wall.</p>
<p>They sound calmer and infinitely more assured here. The final song’s title, ""I Like That You Can See It"", stands as a simple manifesto. The song is about harnessing nerves and vulnerability as sources of power, and it repeats the striking image: ""Is it pouring out my body? My nervous aching?/ I like that you can see it."" The arrangement performs the same act. There are two chords, played with two fingers, and yet the song feels bigger every time you listen to it.</p>
<p>Somewhere between their formation and now, Tividad and Tucker have divined the starry-eyed power of the purest indie-pop. It is a romanticism that thrives on potential energy, on the contemplation of things that haven't quite happened. Romanticism occurs in the distance between what <i>might</i> happen and what does, and listening to <i>Before the World Was Big</i> feels like walking through this exalted liminal space. ""I feel safest in knowing that I am true/ When I look in your eyes, the idea of you,"" they sing with clarion force on ""Ideal World"". ""I just miss how it felt standing next to you/ Wearing matching dresses before the world was big,"" they chant on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17440-girlpool-before-the-world-was-big/"">title track</a>, a line that doubles into a round-robin singalong.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-57af1e4a-c02e-a13d-47d6-5bbd8f2cf952""><span>Tividad and Tucker’s voices are foregrounded, always. They sing about real-life friends, by their first names. They reference each other by first name in their lyrics. ""I am still looking for sureness in the way I say my name,"" they sing on ""Chinatown"". Their twinned vocals gives the album a powerful and traceable through line—these are songs about two specific friends who have realized that the world is a less frightening place, that you feel surer and safer in it, with someone else by you.<br/></span></span></p></div>"|20465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20465-before-the-world-was-big/|7.8|Jayson Greene

When the quartet released their last album, 2000’s <i>Flower of Disease</i>, the new project of guitarist Greg Anderson, an amplifier-worship duo he called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, had issued<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16130-void-the-iron-soul-of-nothing/"" target=""_blank""> its debut LP only months earlier.</a> Scream—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16130-void-the-iron-soul-of-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">childhood hardcore Virginia crew</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talent crucible</a> of Goatsnake singer Pete Stahl—had yet to reunite. And <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/09/16/the-obsessed-to-reunite-at-least-for-one-show/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">neither had</a> the Obsessed, the atavistic doom squad of drummer Greg Rogers. But in recent years, the rise or reactivation of those respective projects and a wave of young acts exploring a Goatsnake-like mix of Southern rock heroics and distortion-heavy harangues have retroactively elevated the band to a near-mythical position. In the first life, Goatsnake existed for less than five years and issued two good albums; in the afterlife and now the resurrection, they have fostered a legacy much more significant than the original output ever portended.</p>
<p>After occasional concerts during the last five years, Goatsnake returned to the studio last summer to stage a proper comeback. The resulting nine-song set, <i>Black Age</i> <i>Blues</i>, affirms their long-standing love of metal force<i> and</i> classic-rock verve without pushing the mix to many new extremes. Though they swapped bassist Scott Reeder for Sourvein player Scott <i>Renner </i>(what are the chances?), Goatsnake staged the album as a literal continuation of <i>Flower of Disease</i>. That LP ended with a song called ""The River"", which closed with an eerie, extended strings-and-sirens dénouement. So this record opens with ""Another River to Cross"", which begins by sampling that old ellipsis before the band slams down with four-piece force. They sound excellent and energized, Anderson’s riff racing through switchbacks beneath Stahl’s arching, almost-gleeful reflections on mortality. The next 40 minutes wind through mid-tempo rumbles and howling harmonica solos, blustery riffs and muscular drum fills, Zeppelin references and ""C.C. Rider"" nods, songs about existential crises and songs about earthly delights. With hazy hooks powered by a mighty band, <i>Black Age Blues</i> is, as advertised, very much the third Goatsnake album.</p>
<p>But <i>Black Age Blues</i> is strongest when it suggests that the members and their musical relationships have evolved during Goatsnake’s recess, especially when the past presents new stylistic tension. For his part, Stahl is more confident and convincing as a Southern soul-loving leader. He commands a small background choir—""Dem Preachers’ Daughters,"" they call themselves—throughout the record, sometimes letting them lift his leads and sometimes dueling with their harmonies. He <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP9xMobANJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stutters syllables like an unabashed Robert Plant acolyte</a> and stretches his words skywards like a gospel singer bound for glory. These traits thrill when they clash with Anderson’s own development as an ultra-low-and-slow guitarist. ""House of the Moon"", for instance, opens with a rich tone and ominous lurch that suggest Sunn O))). Even as the choir joins Stahl to exclaim things like ""Shine on"" during the chorus, Anderson burrows deeper, his menacing variations providing a sinister foil to the ascendant soul vocals. And near the end of the great ""Coffee &amp; Whiskey"", Anderson and Stahl wrestle on tape. The singer squeals and exhorts like he’s moonlighting with the Faces. The guitarist, meanwhile, strangles a dense theme into submission, refusing to join the joy ride. That disparity was always a key to Goatsnake, but as the interests of its members have grown, such frisson has become as vital to the sound as the songs themselves.</p>
<p>Through little fault of Goatsnake’s own, listening to <i>Black Age Blues</i> can sometimes feel like watching wizened blues musicians play the music of their now-distant youth. The style is familiar enough to be comforting, but it’s also inherently trite and redundant. You’ve already heard the permutations that have followed. Since Goatsnake released <i>Flower of Disease</i>, there’s been a renaissance of provocative doom, particularly from bands doubly influenced by psychedelic and Southern rock. It’s impossible not to think about how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5466-weedeater/"">Weedeater</a> might <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjrdfAWBO_E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">distort and destroy</a> the chemical surge of ""Coffee &amp; Whiskey"" or to what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNrr9YUGjQk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new lysergic limits Kylesa</a> could push closer ""A Killing Blues"". Goatsnake add some tricks and twists for <i>Black Age Blues</i>, but as if in deference to the supergroup side-project’s nature, they don’t aim to reinvent themselves or their sound. Instead, they simply have fun playing with the past and delivering at least a few new anthems in the process. At least that’s better than plenty of their reunited peers cashing in on the festival circuit even attempt, let alone accomplish.</p></div>"|20598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20598-black-age-blues/|7.3|Grayson Haver Currin

There’s another way of working that isn’t as widely discussed, but under the right conditions can produce equally good results, and that’s taking your worst, dumbest ideas and blindly smashing them together. And that’s apparently how the Mothmen made their 1981 album <i>Pay Attention!</i>, an interestingly strange post-punk artifact that’s being reissued by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/"">Adrian Sherwood</a>’s <a href=""https://www.on-usound.com//home?hs=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On-U Sound</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band obviously had musical smarts. Three of its four members were in the original lineup of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">the Durutti Column</a>, and all three quit together after Factory records founder Tony Wilson proved himself to be too meddlesome a boss. (The fourth, tellingly, came from a comedy band called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_y_Lost_Trios_Paranoias"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias</a>.) Three of them went on to have lifelong careers in the music industry that included producing records, managing artists, running labels, and, for two of them, stints in the rhythm section of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_Red"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Simply Red</a>. (Guitarist David Rowbotham fell on hard times and was brutally murdered in 1991, but earned a measure of musical immortality as the subject of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5891-happy-mondays/"">Happy Mondays</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QYJTnZqmI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cowboy Dave""</a>.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>During their time in the Mothmen, though, all four seem to have ignored those smarts, or possibly consulted them solely to do the opposite of what those smarts said. In the reissue’s lengthy liner notes, drummer Chris Joyce describes their creative process as centering around getting tremendously stoned and having unpremeditated free-form basement jam sessions that they recorded on cassette tapes in case anything worth saving emerged.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Between their outre composition methods, the UK post-punk scene’s permissive attitude toward genre combinations, and the band’s high amounts of music nerdiness, <i>Pay Attention!</i> covers an impressive amount of stylistic ground, and produces a number of fascinatingly strange juxtapositions. Intergalactically chill dub reggae turns on a dime into anxiety-riddled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> impressions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a>’s naive psychedelic twee pop collides with bombastic prog rock. ""Dr. Who"" sound effects are recruited to make Moroccan-style trance music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As you should expect from such helter skelter creative means, some of the material falls short. The 20-minute-long <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain-Beefheart</a>-meets-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Musicians_of_Joujouka"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the-Master-Musicians-of-Joujouka</a> jam ""Mothman"", for instance, is at least 19 minutes too long. (Although both the song itself and the band’s decision to give it its own side of the album say a lot about the quality of hash they were smoking.) But a respectable number of <i>Pay Attention!</i>’s songs, and the various bonus tracks included with the reissue, manage to get off the ground, even if they’re a little ungainly in flight. Even at their stoner goofiest the band had a knack for channeling a particular kind of electric discordant charge that gave their work an unpredictable but potent vibrancy—the same kind of crackle that you get from acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a> who seem to take similar delight in being counterintuitive. So while the Mothmen have always been a footnote in the history of post-punk (something this reissue’s not likely to change), it’s a footnote that adds a fascinating kink to the bigger story around it.</p></div>"|20657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20657-pay-attention/|6.0|Miles Raymer

Three of the four tracks on his second EP, 2011's <i>GRN</i>, were barely more than a minute long; the longest came in at 1:47. They were beautiful things—lustrous instrumental hip-hop jams full of fluttering chiptune frequencies—but they seemed to bear out Lao Tzu's (and <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRxHYHPzs7s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blade Runner's</a></i>) dictum about flames that burn twice as bright. On the following year's <a href=""https://astronautico.bandcamp.com/album/blk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>BLK</i> EP</a>, the Atlanta native had no problem stretching out and developing his ideas to three- and four-minute lengths, but this time, his footwork- and skweee-inspired beats flew by so fast, it was as if a record pressed at 33 were being played back at 78.</p>
<p>On his self-titled debut album, he returns to Earth-time. Stylistically, most of the record's eight tracks follow the jazzy, broken-beat house of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"">Floating Points</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>. Loggins is fond of synthesizers with a rough shine and drum grooves that fuse scratchy machine programming with fluid playing from his collaborators Avila Santo and Michael J. Thomas III. He's got a bricoleur's sensibility, too: ""Works"" fleshes out a shuffling disco groove with grinding metallic accents and a filigree of delay that recalls Manuel Göttsching's Balearic classic, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMVpL3B_6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""E2-E4""</a>; in ""Market Solution"", the drum programming has a no-nonsense flair similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29516-daphni/"">Daphni</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpK5GltULXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ye Ye""</a>, while the sine-wave bassline sounds, ever so faintly, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5034-vince-guaraldi/"">Vince Guaraldi</a> covering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_xEZWAtow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sleng Teng""</a>.</p>
<p>But Loggins has his own voice, and one of the indicators is how naturally the whole thing flows. The opener, ""Pneumatic for the People"", is a dramatic scene-setter—bright keys, freeform soloing, rolling drum fills with lots of splash and ride cymbal—that seamlessly segues into ""Works"". There's something almost triumphant about the latter—it's radiant, giddy, some real standing-on-top-of-a-waterfall shit, right down to the rainbow-like spray of frequencies his keys give off. ""Market Solution"" sinks into a groove that's more efficient but just as ecstatic—get a load of those sampled yelps and glistening arpeggios—and then he dials it back a notch with ""Median"", a beatific organ piece that sounds like a bedroom producer's response to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>.</p>
<p>On an album of highlights, ""Cole Dub"" is the biggest moment—a thumping, glowing, full-band house number full of jazzy Rhodes riffing, live percussion, and dubbed-out saxophone (courtesy Sonnymoon's Dane Orr) that's as sunny as tape can handle without melting from the heat. Even Loggins seems to know that it's all downhill from there: ""Rag"" is a straight-ahead dancefloor track, and the ambient ""Castle"" brings everything to a close with sunrise synths and understated grace. </p>
<p>Well, almost. There's one more song, ""Tophat"", an eight-minute bass-and-drums jam—a coda, more than anything. But it feels deserved. The album's biggest shift from Time Wharp's previous work is the confidence he shows in letting his songs develop at a relaxed pace. After a set as effortless and joyful as this, it's natural to want one last dance.</p></div>"|20636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20636-time-wharp/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

He was talking about his new solo album <i>Chrissybaby Forever</i>, which he made available to stream on May 27, a few days before its official digital release, and the sentiment prompted a question: What does a ""back to the basics"" album look like for an artist who traffics in the basics? Owens named his breakout group, which consisted of two men, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"">Girls</a>."" His songs relied on the simplest, most dog-eared lyrics imaginable, and he reached for chord progressions that you can anticipate in your bones. His first solo album, 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17529-lysandre/""><i>Lysandre</i></a>, was written almost entirely in the key of A. Open chords, open voicings, open arrangements—everything open. How do you reduce further down than that?</p>
<p><i>Chrissybaby</i> is the product of a fruitful, month-long recording session with engineer JJ Wiesler, with Owens playing all the instruments. (It turns out this is what he means by ""back to the basics."") The album opens with the same strummed chord that introduced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuoTjYYqe4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lust for Life""</a>; Owens is unafraid of reminding you of other work, even songs he's already written. But <i>Chrissybaby</i> turns out to be more imaginative, looser, more lively, and more appealing than his music has been in a few years. There are quirks and little touches here, hiccups or fillips that he might have beveled off of previous projects for fear they added resistance to his classic pop songwriting. These songs are allowed to be weirder, and in smaller bites they're tangier and stranger than they've tasted in awhile.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The best tracks on the short album are a good argument that Owens is more appealing the less grandiose he gets. He whistles pretty melodies on ""Heroine (Got Nothing on You)"" like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16651-ram/""><i>Ram</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a>. ""I Love You Like I Do"" consists of a few lines about loving someone for who they are with the lyric sheet instruction ""(repeat to infinity)."" It is sung by a chorale of female voices, and it feels both like a lullaby and a distillation of Owens' mission, which is to use pop music to comfort and uplift you, and to remind you that you are loved.</p>
<p>It's hard to be as captivated by his innocence or his openness, though you can still be comforted and charmed by it. ""It's not 1+1, or ABC/ It's not a formula or a mystery/ It's not right or wrong, it's just the music of my heart"" is the chorus to ""Music of My Heart"", and typing it out feels like enumerating the chemical makeup of sugar. The point of the song is the <i>feeling</i>, and the feeling he creates is generous and relaxed and, again, open. The song around the lyrics moves in enough interesting directions to keep it from turning into a scented greeting card: It's a series of tiny sounds (a squelching, distorted bass, some hand percussion, isolated guitar strokes) appearing in corners of a spacious arrangement like cartoon gophers popping their heads up in an open field.</p>
<p>There are a few flickering shadows in the lyrics here and there. ""Me Oh My"" is a weightless, silvery song about mistrust, and on ""Selfish Feelings"" he sings, bluntly, about lust and physical need. ""Inside Out"" wrestles in his plain language with despair and doubt. They are faint reminders of the darker, bigger things he can tackle when he sets his sights on them, and of his ability to set stories taken directly from his life in elemental, universal terms. When he sings ""I<span>'m still out looking for a spiritual release/ I</span><span>'m not an antichrist I just can't fake belief"" on ""Inside Out"", it resounds with both painfully specific and powerfully general meaning.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Chrissybaby</i> is 16 songs long, which might be more of this particular pleasant, low-stakes mood than you need at one uninterrupted stretch. Sometimes you might crave a sharper thought than he seems interested in formulating, or a darker sound than he wants to make. But that's all right. He's going to make another record soon, almost certainly (to hear him tell it, he wrote and recorded this one almost before he realized it was happening), and even if his moment in the zeitgeist has passed, he seems like an artist who is always going to be here, telling us what he needs us to hear in the most direct language he can find. He is going to remain open, and so should we.</p></div>"|20663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20663-chrissybaby-forever/|6.9|Jayson Greene

The Virginia band formed in 2009, during indie rock's brief beach craze, and that sunny moniker made it mighty easy to group them with all those other acts making nostalgic, heavily reverbed pop, even though their own take on the style had more of a wiry, punk edge. That they shared bills with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"">Best Coast</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"">Dum Dum Girls</a> only further typecast them. ""We came out at a time when jangly, summertime and beachy songs were a thing. And we got lumped in together,"" singer/guitarist Nicole Yun <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/eternal-summers-nicole-yun-on-new-album-gold-and-stone-roanoke-ariel-pink"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently lamented</a>. ""I knew in my heart of hearts that I wanted our music to sound more sonically distorted and aggressive than all that.""</p>
<p>Most of the big names from the beach boom have fallen on hard times, either breaking up, fading away, or struggling to recapture their early spark, but Eternal Summers have proven more adaptive than many of the bands they came up with. Over the years they've added a member, bassist Jonathan Woods, who helped the duo fill some of their considerable empty space, and gradually built up their sound into something far statelier than the scrappy pop of their initial singles, adopting moves from shoegaze, C86 pop, and a wide array of '90s alternative. <i>Gold and Stone</i>, the band's fourth album in five years, is the latest testament to their ever-broadening range.</p>
<p>As might be expected from an album released so soon after last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19062-eternal-summers-the-drop-beneath/"">The Drop Beneath</a></i> and recorded at the same Austin, Texas studio, the record picks up where its predecessor left off, expanding on the anthemic grandeur that record introduced. The group remains loyal to their usual muses—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>, most prominently—but they continue to reshuffle those influences into some surprising configurations. At its most vibrant, <i>Gold and Stone</i> recalls another recent dream-pop album with an unsettled infrastructure, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow/"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19478-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow-sea-when-absent/"">Sea When Absent</a></i>, especially in its embrace of interruption. Whenever things begin to feel too complacent—whenever the guitars shimmer too blissfully for too long—there's always a shake-up on the horizon. The moody strums of opener ""Unassigned"" give way to shots of feedback and clatter. The plucky single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17443-eternal-summers-together-or-alone/"">""Together or Alone""</a> cuts its chipper groove with hysteric shouts.</p>
<p>Though Yun usually defaults to the sweet, celestial voice of so many shoegaze singers, she's not afraid to roll in the mud, too. On ""Black Diamond"" she adopts a punk sneer to shame an over-controlling lover—""If you want I could be strung up in pearls for you,"" she sings, her voice raw with contempt—and she works herself into a huffy fit on the album's fiercest rocker, ""Play Dead"", another kiss-off. These heated moments are aberrations, little breaks from the Eternal Summers' default dreaminess, but they show so much personality that it's hard not to wish there were a few more of them. Agitation flatters this band.</p>
<p>In interviews, Yun has explained that Eternal Summers record under self-imposed deadlines, which would explain their efficient, album-a-year clip. Those deadlines also seem to have shaped the band's compact songwriting. There are moments on <i>Gold and Stone</i> when it seems like these songs long to wander off, to further explore some of these textures and moods, but not a single track extends past the four-minute mark, almost as if out of fear of throwing the album off its tight schedule. Yun's grown into such a sharp guitar player that a logical next step for the band might be to toss the timeline out the window for their fifth album and record an unchecked, sprawling epic in the style of one of the more unlikely bands the group has cited as recent inspiration, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/91-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead/"">…And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead</a>. Or they could just return to the same studio for a week to cut another album as concise and efficient as this one. It speaks to Eternal Summers' versatility that either sounds like a winning proposition.</p></div>"|20658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20658-gold-and-stone/|7.3|Evan Rytlewski

They are the sort of band that does more than their peers, but don't make much fuss about how they're ""different."" You hear a deep understanding of black metal's origins in their music as well as sneaky, understated radicalism.</span> In particular, Akitsa combines the isolation of second-wave black metal, the primal punkiness of first wave, and power electronics into a defiant, affirming body of work. They also paved the way for the burgeoning Québécois black metal scene, while remaining above it all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Grands Tyrans</i> is their fifth full-length, their first since 2010's <i>Au crépuscule de l'espérance</i>, and it also sees O.T. taking over Akitsa from his bandmate Néant. It's their leanest and most focused effort, while not abandoning the diversity that puts them far ahead of many of their contemporaries. ""Dévoilé"" seems like a pretty typical black metal track at first: it opens with a brief passage of dry-toned guitar before giving way to six minutes of hallowed shrieks and melodies arising from static-like guitar. If you're a black metal fan, this is the sort of thing you've heard on plenty of budget cassettes. But O.T.'s ambitions come through in the forthright grandiosity of ""Dévoilé""'s melody. ""Faucon"" is another song that elevates conventions, with O.T.'s playing creating a vicious slashing effect that's much harsher than what you would normally find in recordings this lo-fi. You can feel the purpose in his movements, as if he's actually harming the guitar itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">O.T. doesn't deny starting out with the thrash basics like many a metalhead, and ""Le feu de l'abîme"" is the closest to classic metal that Akitsa's gotten. With O.T. warbling over what could be a blackened <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Manilla_Road/379"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manilla Road</a> passage, ""L'abîme"" resembles present-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"">Darkthrone</a> had they not abandoned the cold buzz they ushered in. ""Chimères"" takes the impulses of ""L'abîme"" and pushes them into nearly surrealistic realms. O.T. becomes a grinning jester, lending an almost <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi!"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oi!</a>-like wobble to his riffs and clean vocals. The title track warps doom into Akitsa's likeness not by just simply slowing the pace, but by laying down warped dungeon synth below and O.T. transforming his clean singing into a snotty cry. For all the shit black metal gets for drowning in the tars of tradition, Akitsa are adept at breathing new life into well-worn metal forms, then conforming them into their blackened vision.</p></div>"|20619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20619-grands-tyrans/|7.7|Andy O'Connor

They were ahead of the curve on integrating chamber music with post-rock, and even further ahead on drawing inspiration from 20th-century minimalism rather than older classical music. With the addition of key members Christian Frederickson on viola and Rachel Grimes on piano, they were just in front of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed</a> and just behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">Dirty Three</a>, whom they resembled in their lonesome, ramshackle temperament. They put out some indelible records in the back half of the '90s and continued into the mid-'00s.</p>
<p>Since then, Rachel Grimes has struck out on a post-classical career that jettisons the rock vestiges of the band that coincidentally took her name. She started small, with respectable post-minimal solo piano pieces, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13798-book-of-leaves/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Book of Leaves</i></a>. Now, she is after a larger quarry: the contemporary chamber ensemble. But she does not quite capture it on <i>The Clearing</i>. With more than a dozen musicians (including electronic processing by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2530-loscil/"">Scott Morgan of Loscil</a>) revolving through laborious arrangements, the record feels under-composed and overdesigned. The grace that marks the best of Rachel's and Grimes' solo piano is oppressed by ambitious but vague gestures that evoke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a>'s enigmatic piano phrasing and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"">La Monte Young</a>'s keen long tones to unclear ends.</p>
<p>At first, the record rigidly alternates between short interludes and long tracks, though the pattern relaxes as it goes along. The former range from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-like slow-motion tumble of ""The Air"" to ""Transverse Plane Vertical"", where a string section, a bassist, a harpist, a drummer, and several winds all crowd into a kind of country-less folk dance. Oddly, these shorter pieces are some of the most thorough. On the longer ones, perfunctory harshness tries to distract from inchoate forms. Neither the glockenspiel-like embellishments nor the dissonant bleats of cello and viola have much to do with the irritating stuck piano note on the title track. Lower piano notes add to the textural and harmonic murk, though the strings contain the germ of an idea—Middle Eastern ululations as sternly imagined by Mahler, perhaps. But no melody lodges in the ear, and the piece plods. It's a very long eight minutes that never really seems to arrive. </p>
<p>It's not the only time an idea refuses to take shape. On ""The Herald"", Jacob Duncan's saxophone brings in a nocturnal soft-jazz flavor, which is not bad except for the desultory blurts of piano. The piano part improves when the jazz subsides, but the alternation of these two modes is unsatisfying; they refuse to become compatible. Eventually, the piano begins to play melodiously with the winds and the track slips into a pocket, if not exactly a resolved structure. Grimes usually fares best with sonority. Though ""Further Foundation"" has awkward spots, particularly in its clunky pizzicato, it's relatively pretty and unencumbered, with a piano line like sheets of rain washing down a window. The music comes unclogged, tapping into some of the old post-rock sweep and space. The latter can be especially hard to find. ""In the Vapor With the Air Underneath"" is like an un-limpid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a>. The piano patters tightly against its own granulated shine, and the lack of breathing room, with clumpy timbres and clotted harmonies, is characteristic of the record.</p>
<p>We relate to instrumental music in ways beyond how it sounds—we also relate to the composer's decisions and intentions. It's on this second level that <i>The Clearing </i>can be<i> </i>confusing. ""The Air at Night"" is a long ambient outro with little to distinguish it at the compositional level. It becomes especially stark when the usual slow piano chords, played with unvarying timing, return, their tone made limp and wilted for some reason. It's a wan centerpiece for such a long table, and I have no instinct as to how to interpret the gesture, which is to say, how to feel. Grimes drops us into some deep thickets, but gives us no compass by which to find our way, and her record's titular concept proves elusive.</p></div>"|20635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20635-the-clearing/|5.7|Brian Howe

That’s the hand that plays the bass lines on piano, the hand used by early keys pounders like <a href=""https://youtu.be/1dC0DseCyYE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/RlrK8nuvodI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moon Mullican</a>, and <a href=""https://youtu.be/ywm9RhBI3Lk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fats Domino</a> to put a little bit of boogie in their blues. That left hand gave ""Great Balls of Fire"" its lusty pep and ""Blueberry Hill"" its making-time thrill. So, when the Deslondes open their self-titled debut with a walking piano line played way, way down the left side of the keyboard, they’re not just playing a rhythm that sounds distinctive in 2015 but also conveying an entire pop history that spans New Orleans rhythm and blues, early Memphis rock, Louisiana Hayride country, and every pick-up jazz band ever to busk on Royal Street.</p>
<p>Plus, it just sounds damn good. ""Fought the Blues and Won"" lopes along on that syncopated bass line, which makes the band’s hangdog harmonies come off a bit more determined, even if they don’t sound quite triumphant. The blues will just show up again tomorrow, and they’re bracing for another fight. “It might hit you from all sides, or right between the eyes,” sings Riley Downing, one of four singers and five songwriters in the Deslondes. “Keep on going.”</p>
<p>Using the piano as a rhythm section instrument certainly distinguishes the band from a lot of their country peers, who more often use it for melody or atmosphere. The Deslondes are highlights of an unlikely country scene based in New Orleans of all places, a city with a rich and renowned music history that includes everything but country. But a new generation of acts—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32080-hurray-for-the-riff-raff/"">Hurray for the Riff Raff</a>, Luke Winslow King, the Longtime Goners, and the late, lamented Sundown Songs—is marrying twang with Crescent City rhythms. The Deslondes cut their teeth in street bands busking for tourist change and in pick-up acts playing backyard barbecues, both of which can be laboratories for testing new ideas and distilling songs down to their essence.</p>
<p>So their debut introduces a band that sounds confident and fully formed. Every song contains some new flourish or some new idea to distinguish it, whether it’s the spidery pedal steel of ""Low Down Soul"", the spiky guitar riff that comes out of nowhere on ""The Real Deal"", or even the quiet clarinet solo that illuminates closer ""Out on the Rise"" from the inside. They take nothing about country or R&amp;B or New Orleans for granted, but consider everything anew. ""Less Honkin’ More Tonkin’"" is too fast to really honkytonk to, and that’s okay because it’s about a traffic jam. Even ""Louise"", the most traditionally brokenhearted song here, is interrupted by a shuffling two-step guitar rhythm, as though the Deslondes know that the best thing about Johnny Cash wasn’t the clothes or the myth but the men backing him.</p>
<p>Somehow the country gospel of ""Those Were (Could’ve Been) the Days"" and the Morricone-on-the-cowboy-trail arrangement of ""Time to Believe In"" actually sound fresh in 2015. Even as these songs delve deep into the past, they never sound calculated or revivalist, which is refreshing after the parade of tweed jackets and uplifting choruses that have defined Americana for the last several years. Instead, <i>The Deslondes</i> sounds like something scavenged and salvaged, as though the band members found that walking bass line or that rockabilly rhythm just lying around on the street, unused and abandoned. They know it’d be a shame to let it go to waste.</p></div>"|20565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20565-the-deslondes/|7.9|Stephen M. Deusner
