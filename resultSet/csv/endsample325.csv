Witchcraft kicked things off with their worship of 70s Pentagram and Black Sabbath's self-titled. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27949-graveyard/"" target=""_blank"">Graveyard</a> became the Swedish representatives when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5586-witchcraft/"" target=""_blank"">Witchcraft</a> wasn't all that hip anymore. Kadavar are leading the German front. The Devil's Blood made “occult rock” the new thing for overly discerning metal listeners to hate. British unit <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31307-uncle-acid-and-the-deadbeats/"" target=""_blank"">Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats</a> think there's room for one more. <i>Mind Control</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, their latest, almost makes the case.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats have clear influences from the heavier side of 1970s rock, but they don't feel like a band from that time. Take 70s Pentagram's core guitar sound, meld it with the foreboding gloom of their 80s work, and you've got an idea of what the Deadbeats are going for. The guitars have a smokey, hypnotic murk to them, slathered over Uncle Acid's snaky vocals. Not that it stops “Evil Love” from being a bouncy romp, or opener “Mt. Abraxis” from dooming out gloriously. They also play up their psych edge more than their contemporaries-- not by being a garage rock band that cranks up the reverb, but through their disorienting production and arrangements. <i>Mind Control</i> take a turn for the mellow on its second half, bringing their psych influences into prominence. “Follow the Leader” is the most subdued number here, with marimbas accentuating soft feedback, while “Devil's Work”'s heavy, plodding intro builds up into a dark dirge. If modern sludge bands have ruined that idea for you, take comfort in that Uncle Acid vocals really add to the slow banging. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Most of the songs on <i>Mind Control</i> are worth a few spins, but nothing on here quite matches “I'll Cut You Down” from Uncle Acid's 2011 album <i>Bloodlust</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31255-ghost-bc/"" target=""_blank"">Ghost</a> mostly succeeds at sex appeal through menace, but with “Cut”, Uncle Acid beat the ghouls at their own game. The venomous declaration, “I was born a wicked man, no hopes or dreams/ I get my kicks from torturing and screams/ I lust for women's blood, and their evil ways/ I twist my words to what the good book says” becomes even more sinister with the song's foot-stomping, head-bobbing power. “Poison Apple”, released as a single in March, comes the closest to besting “Cut”. <i>Bloodlust</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was about murder, frenzy, and ids running wild, while</span><i> Control</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is about seductive coercion. Not exactly subtle, but most heavy music isn't and probably shouldn't be. It makes sense not from just a lyrical standpoint but also musically, as <i>Bloodlust</i> had a harder sound to compliment those lyrics.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">“Valley of the Dolls” is where <i>Control</i> loses its ability to truly stand above, dragging on with no real purpose. It's the only bad song on the whole record, but even just one lapse can throw off the vibe. <i>Control</i> almost shows real signs of vitality in a necrophillic genre. Still, Black Sabbath tickets start at 70 bucks and Bobby Liebling, though doing better, is still pushing it in years. If <i>Control</i> gets Uncle Acid on tour and into the psyches of more listeners, we can put those “Dolls” in the closet.</p></div>"|18059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18059-uncle-acid-and-the-deadbeats-mind-control/|6.8|Andy O'Connor

Fortunately, from such inauspicious beginnings came great wonder. That recording, as part of the prog-leaning group <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Red+Noise+%283%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Noise</a>, came from their sole album from 1970, <i>Sarcelles - Lochères</i>. The band subsequently split in two, mirroring the actions of German krautrock collective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/"">Amon Düül</a>. While one half of the group soldiered on under the name <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Komintern"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Komintern</a>, Vian was preparing his masterwork. Released six years after <i>Sarcelles - Lochères</i>, the playful spirit of that album remained on <i>Bruits et Temps Analogues</i>, even if the tools for getting the job done were remarkably different. Here, Vian cooks up a form of cosmic jazz, made with the aid of various Moog and ARP synths, plus a backing band that includes drummer Mino Cinelu (Weather Report, Miles Davis, Gong).</p>
<p>It's the type of recording that's circulated in small underground circles for years, partly abetted by Vian's inclusion (along with Red Noise) on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3079-nurse-with-wound/"">Nurse With Wound</a>'s notorious <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_with_Wound_list"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">list</a> of artists that inspired them. There's a sense of a beginning rather than an end, a feeling that Vian was onto something that he could have developed further. Instead, he fell silent in subsequent decades, just leaving this singular recording hanging. Vian leans heavily on his analog arsenal, but there's plenty of room for bursts of guitar noodling (courtesy of Bernard Lavialle) and Cinelu's impeccably fussy rolls. The circular, clean-cut guitar riff that drives ""Sphere"" even sounds like a precursor to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">the Sea and Cake</a>'s central sound. But this is an album that doesn't stay in place for long. Sometimes it's purely made up of intricately overlapping keyboard parts, similar in tone to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29358-harald-grosskopf/"">Harald Grosskopf</a>'s analog wanderings; elsewhere there's an airy, new age feel; on ""Old Vienna"" a form of mania sets in, as rhythms escalate wildly in tempo.</p>
<p>The way the album lurches in mood adds to the mystery, with the quirky parts bolted on to more somber fare, occasionally making it sound like a Moog demonstration record that was intended to be taken utterly seriously. Vian's motivations for making this are anyone's guess, but somehow he managed to sequence it so a crazy burst of machine noise could effortlessly slide into a piece of elegant Moog-driven funk and then back out into utter chaos again (""R &amp; B Degenerit !""). Of course there were many other artists testing out the boundaries of old ARP synths and similar instruments during the 70s, but here Vian demonstrates both a mastery of the tools at his disposal and a wide-open mind as to where they could take him. His work with Red Noise awkwardly hopped through an array of genres, but here there's a more seamless blend, with his keyboard work tying together all the maniacal shifts charging through his mind.</p>
<p>This reissue of <i>Bruits et Temps Analogues</i> by the <a href=""http://www.staubgold.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Staubgold</a> label doesn't add anything to what came before; no outtakes, no demos, no lost material excavated from the vaults. It's better that way, leaving something of the original spirit of the LP intact. What's most perplexing about Vian's short career is the breadcrumb trail he left behind here, offering hints of further experimentation to come. ""Tricentennial Drag"" appears to be leading us somewhere else altogether via a series of primitive cut-ups, bursts of sheer aggression, and blaring police sirens. It was nothing particularly new for the time, perhaps even a little dated when you consider the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Noise</a> were working in a similar zone some eight years prior. But it sounds like the germ of an idea he was about to exploit. Instead, all that’s left is this, sealed by a back cover image of Vian that's easy to romanticize, depicting him <a href=""http://www.progarchives.com/progressive_rock_discography_band/6246.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rowing away on an old wooden canoe</a> to some unspecified destination.</p></div>"|18027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18027-patrick-vian-bruits-et-temps-analogues/|7.2|Nick Neyland

He should know. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> singer and lyricist gave up on his own Blogspot site, <a href=""http://internetvibes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Internet Vibes</a>, seven years ago, as he finished up his English studies at Columbia University (the final post's title: ""I HATE BLOGGING""). But before he graduated from the ye olde blogosphere, Koenig held forth on a vast array of topics-- from geography, to Wellington boots, to music writer <a href=""http://www.robertchristgau.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Christgau</a>'s allegedly unfair critique of Billy Joel's oeuvre-- looking at everything from a incisively self-aware, curious, and optimistic angle. What's most impressive is the way he's able to connect art and ideas from different eras and continents into a kind of ecstatic worldview. One particularly inspired <a href=""http://internetvibes.blogspot.com/2005/10/late-breaking-news.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ramble</a> spins an analytic web from a friend's visit to Morocco, the history of the Strait of Gibraltar, a 1984 interview between Bob Dylan and Bono, the film <i>The Secret of Roan Inish,</i> and <i>National Geographic</i>'s famed Afghan refugee cover-- and not only does it make sense, it's written in a way that's funny and smart and completely inclusive. Pretty good for a 22-year-old kid from middle-class New Jersey. Now 28, Koenig's creative medium has changed, but his omnivorous cultural appetite has not.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15133-vampire-weekend-step/"">""Step""</a>, the third song on Vampire Weekend's third album, <i>Modern Vampires of the City</i>-- the record that is already forcing one-time haters of this band to <a href=""https://twitter.com/necessarymeans/status/332246648841437185"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rethink</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/ekoreen/status/332612668693295104"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/DisguisedPoser/status/332693346000719872"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entire</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/roybetter/status/332221033136410624"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lives</a>. At its core, the song reads like an ode to obsessive music fandom in which the object of Koenig's affection is ""entombed within boombox and walkman."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> are name-checked. But the sense of infatuation extends beyond a list of influences and is embedded into the music itself. The chorus and parts of the melody are borrowed from wordy Oakland rap act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29161-souls-of-mischief/"">Souls of Mischief</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBmr_b-Rpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Step to My Girl""</a>-- which itself samples Grover Washington, Jr.'s version of a Bread song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqXek853SDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aubrey""</a>. But ""Step"" avoids back-patting nostalgia and debunks bogus generational hierarchies while using the past to inspire the present. It's also melancholy, with Vampire Weekend musical mastermind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12072-rostam-batmanglij/"">Rostam Batmanglij</a> surrounding Koenig's musings with lilting harpsichord ambience. Because, as we know, music is a young man's pursuit. ""Wisdom's a gift but you'd trade it for youth,"" Koenig sings.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, Vampire Weekend make a damn good case for wisdom all across <i>Modern Vampires</i>. Yes, this is a more grown-up album. It largely trades in the Africa-inspired giddiness of their first two records for a sound that's distinctly innate and closer to the ear. There's more air in these songs, more spontaneity, more dynamics. The overarching themes-- death and a dubious sense of faith-- are certainly Serious. But you never feel like you're being preached at while listening to this album. Koenig and company are probably more clever and gifted than you, sure-- but they're not rubbing your face in it or anything. Their message is one of collective understanding and betterment, and <i>Modern Vampires</i> is the kind of album that'll have you Googling for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buddhist temples</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Old Testament allusions</a> at 3 a.m. while listening to reggae great <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLc2C_pjWpE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ras Michael</a> (who's sampled on opener ""Obvious Bicycle""). Now, you don't <i>have</i> to get obsessed to enjoy this music, but it's presented with such care that you can't help but <i>want</i> to learn about its deeper meanings. So while Koenig gave up a potential teaching career to take his chances as a rock singer, he's still doling out knowledge in his own way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though the record often traverses in darkness-- the zipped-tight ""Finger Back"" alludes to historic atrocities and brutality while ""Hudson"", easily the band's bleakest track to date, imagines an apocalyptic Manhattan-- there's also hope here. Partly because Vampire Weekend seem to have internalized all of the positive traits of their internet-soaked generation while resisting the ugly ones: they'll offer <a href=""https://twitter.com/arzE/status/331440422826151937"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jokes</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/matsoR/status/327213538131210240"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">humanity</a> on Twitter without navel-gazing; they'll play a concert for a credit-card company while roping in Steve Buscemi for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqKGim1Ko9jzaberx_jkpwvWzAjfplYC-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promo videos</a> that are no-shit funny; they'll use the tools of modernity to expand their universe rather than contract it. And then they'll go ahead and crack your heart in two.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Along with the more lived-in sonics, <i>Modern Vampires</i> has the band taking a leap forward into emotional directness. Koenig and Batmanglij truly seem of one mind here, as the vocals and music interact with each other in an effortless flow. While skronks and snares pop on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49954-listen-vampire-weekend-diane-young-and-step/"">""Diane Young""</a>, the singer matches the live-fast intensity hit-for-hit. The song is a dissection of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">27 Club</a> rock'n'roll myth, where Koenig's voice on the sly ""baby, baby, baby"" bridge is manipulated to intoxicating effect.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Then there's ""Hannah Hunt"". In some sense, it seems like Vampire Weekend's entire career thus far has led to this one song. It begins with the hiss of wind and some vague background chatter-- the sounds of the everyday-- before it's all quickly tuned out in favor of Batmanglij's piano and bassist Chris Baio's upright plucks. Koenig comes in soft, telling of a couple on a cross-country road trip. His details-- crawling vines, mysterious men of faith, newspaper kindling-- are sparse, delicate, perfect. And then, after two minutes and 40 seconds of quiet beauty, the song blooms, and Koenig lets it absolutely rip: ""If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah/ There's no future/ There's no answer/ Though we live on the U.S. dollar/ You and me, we got our own sense of time."" On an album preoccupied with the ominous ticking of clocks, this is the moment that stops them cold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Koenig has said in recent interviews that the band's three albums make up a trilogy. ""Hannah Hunt"" could be a sobering continuation of <i>Contra</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a>-ian <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN8mjY7JMSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Run""</a>, where two people decide to up and leave their known lives in search of some sort of American transcendence. There's also a perilous chandelier at the center of new track ""Everlasting Arms"", perhaps a callback to the hanging lights that cover the band's debut LP. And the <i>Modern Vampires </i>font is the same exact one used in a <a href=""http://vimeo.com/28464"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trailer</a> for Koenig's absurd-looking college-era werewolf movie, from which Vampire Weekend got its name. These little links are not only satisfying, but inevitable. After years of engaging with anything and everything in reach, Vampire Weekend are now a primary source in their own right.</p></div>"|17963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17963-vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city/|9.3|Ryan Dombal

On his new album, <i>Bright Sunny South,</i> he covers both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"">Mariah Carey</a> and Tim McGraw, who join the illustrious ranks of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blvWsHNNdfE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dock Boggs</a>, children's folk singer Ella Jenkins, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10546-tears-for-fears/"">Tears for Fears</a>, and Katrina and the Waves in his catalogue of covers. He brings the sentiments from each song into his own weird world-- some Appalachian mountain holler, essentially removed from time. These covers could have come across as cheap stunts, not unlike those acoustic approximations of rap hits, but instead they’ve become essential to Amidon’s catalog. Born into a musical family and trained since infancy on fiddle and banjo, he does not view old-time music as an easy path to authenticity, just as he has no use for suspenders and tweed. On the other hand, he understands that the folk tradition extends to pop music. Amidon is not awestruck by the songs he sings, whether they’re several decades or several months old, and that gives his music-- especially on his new album-- a breeziness that underscores rather than undercuts the songs’ sense of persistent loneliness.</p>
<p>Not quite as stylized as 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14149-i-see-the-sign/""><i>I See the Sign</i></a>, but certainly no less ambitious, <i>Bright Sunny South</i> is a quiet, austere album that emphasizes Amidon’s banjo playing and singing. Again he’s working with longtime friend and collaborator Thomas Bartlett (a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1258-doveman/"">Doveman</a>). But the new presence here is Jerry Boys, the legendary studio engineer best known for his work with Steeleye Span, Sandy Denny, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a>. He creates in these songs a naturalistic space, suggesting the shape of a room or a copse of trees around the performer, while still maintaining a throughline with Amidon’s previous albums. Songs like “I Wish I Wish” and the title track, a lament by a soldier leaving home, sound emotionally and musically austere: less folk hymns than interior monologues full of barely repressed angers and resignations.</p>
<p>From the ground up Amidon reimagines these old tunes, some of which have been sung both in and out of the indie-folk realm innumerable times (“I Wish I Wish”, for example, comes from the same source material as Uncle Tupelo’s “I Wish My Baby Was Born”, off <i>March 16-20, 1992</i>, although the two versions sound remarkably different). His voice goes eloquently flat at particularly dramatic moments, usually to evoke some desperation at parting ways with a loved one, and his strange phrasing molds these melodies into new and unexpected shapes. On the shape-note hymn “Weeping Mary”-- famously recorded in the 1970s by the Word of Mouth Chorus, whose membership included Amidon’s parents-- he lets his voice trail off into an arrhythmic murmur, chewing over the syllables as well as the concept of “glory glory glory.”</p>
<p>Yet the best moments on <i>Bright Sunny South </i>may actually be the least lonely passages, the ones that emphasize a group dynamic. Working with a skeleton crew of a band-- mostly strings and percussion, with brief interjections of horns-- Amidon interrupts the delicate reveries of “He’s Taken My Feet” for a noisy bridge, as though he’s stolen a glimpse of Hell to reinforce his salvation. As he ponders that very concept on “Weeping Mary”, the song goes in and out of focus, as Bartlett creates a prismatic shift of woodwinds. “As I Roved Out” may be the loosest, the loudest, and the most unhinged Amidon has ever sounded on record. As he scribbles out a rackety riff on his banjo, he turns to the instrument for moral support. “What is it, banjo?” he beseeches, just as drummer Chris Vatalaro runs away with the song. “Did you ever feel such pain?” Even at its most baroque, the music remains essential to the tangled stories these songs recount and the troubled characters Amidon inhabits.</p>
<p>About that Mariah Carey cover. “Shake It Off” was the third single on 2005 album, <i>The Emancipation of Mimi</i>, but it remains minor on <i>Bright Sunny South</i> as well. Played on piano at a molasses pace, the songs sounds stiff on its own and shoehorned into the tracklist, as Amidon cannot sell the commercial references to Calgon (tellingly, he omits the verse about Louis Vuitton). He fares better with Tim McGraw’s ruminative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15030-sam-amidon-my-old-friend/"">“My Old Friend”</a>, from 2004’s <i>Live Like You Were Dying. </i>As though a refute to anyone who would mindlessly dismiss commercial country music, Amidon retains the song’s melodic skeleton, slows it down a notch, transposes it to a minor key, and creates something that sounds like the long-lost sequel to “I See A Darkness”, another song about old friends with a long history. And that’s what distinguishes Amidon from the pack of folk revivalists currently enamored with pre-rock Americana: He not only has an impressively deep knowledge of traditional song forms, but takes liberties with the country's past in order to document his own personal present.</p></div>"|17996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17996-sam-amidon-bright-sunny-south/|7.7|Stephen M.

But when done properly, these styles generate all of the enthusiasm of punk while turning its traditional logic about formal training on its head: What if your love of music inspires you to train to the point where you can accomplish anything you want? That’s what Tera Melos get at on their fourth album, <i>X’ed Out, </i>a super-collider of genres, riffs and mad rhythms that<i> </i>is often thrilling, occasionally exhausting, and, unlike most chops-based music, never dull.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way. Their previous work was often chops for chops'-sake, impressive on a theoretical level, manifesting in songs as spazzed-out and inscrutable as their titles-- “Guy vs D.C. Sniper,” “A Spoonful Of Slurry (is Good for What Ails You),” to name a few. While their instrumental capacities are still plenty baffling, Tera Melos appear to be relishing the opportunity to encounter new difficulties; whereas jamming a 7/4 riff against a 12/8 backbeat is a puzzle that can be solved with enough effort, the stuff <i>X'ed Out </i>goes for is sparked by the metaphysical-- ingenuity and serendipity. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Tera Melos sound exhilarated by the potential of not having an idea of where these songs might end up. <i>X’ed Out</i> begins on a monotone, palm-muted riff that could’ve found itself on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">Strokes</a> record; in fact, when Nick Reinhart’s vaporous falsetto first enters, it sounds a great deal like “Tap Out” from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Comedown Machine</a>. </i>A couple of clean guitar runs nestle their way into the mix, and all of a sudden, it’s more in the style of looping enthusiasts like Dustin Wong. And then... a circle-pit ready chorus in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>’ favorite time signature?</p>
<p>The name of that song is “Weird Circles”, which becomes a prophetic statement. <i>X’ed Out </i>is full of loops that don’t quite close, song structures that aren’t verses and choruses so much as geometric patterns jutting against each other at strange angles, genres ricocheting in a game of pinball. Siphon out the hooks of “Weird Circles”, “Sunburn”, and “Tropic Lame”, and you have the basis for 2013’s most excellent skate punk EP. Isolate the beatless and beatific drift of “Snake Lake” and “No Phase”, and Tera Melos make a case for themselves as a covert dream pop act. Come across “New Chlorine” or “Until Lufthansa” in the wild and Tera Melos is a fine reminder of a time when Jawbox and Jawbreaker were getting major-label deals.</p>
<p>Which is to say that while <i>X’ed Out </i>is Tera Melos’ most accessible work by a large margin, it’s still all relative. There are hooks all over the place and just as many ways to deliver them-- guitars that sound more like steel drums, phonetic cooing, ridiculous drum fills. But Tera Melos aren’t pop craftsmen working in ornate arrangements; they’re playing with such frantic speed and precision, it’s more like they’re trying to defuse live bombs. This makes Tera Melos a cozy fit on Sargent House, a label which has cornered the market on carnival rock with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28477-fang-island/"" target=""_blank"">Fang Island</a>, And So I Watch You From Afar and Bosnian Rainbows. It’s not divisive so much as deep niche-- this stuff isn’t for everyone, largely because the accompanying up-with-people delivery that can be somewhat grating. But <i>X’ed Out </i>offers the same thrill rides without the sugary stodge. Granted, Reinhart’s vocals are so airy that they often sound indecipherable in isolation, to say nothing of when they’re placed amidst Tera Melos’ whirligig arrangements. That said, there’s substance and protein here-- the music is always given muscle to counteract the finger-tapping treble and you can suss out lyrics about punk rock bills, street names, and other clues to the emotional and physical geography of <i>X’ed Out</i>.</p>
<p>They're still subject to incomprehensibility; besides being the longest track on <i>X’ed Out, </i>“Slimed” relies too much on overeager skronk to fill the time, as if to give listeners an idea of what they previously missed out on. On the opposite end, while “X’ed Out and Tired” is sensible as a closing sigh of relief, as a straight-up acoustic strummer, it doesn’t make much of a case for Tera Melos to unplug just yet. Those both come later on,<i> </i>when the listener is likely to be more exhausted than the people actually playing the music. While it’s exciting to hear a veteran band sharply change course on the fly, Tera Melos doesn’t always have a grasp on the mundane things like pacing or sequencing that make for a smoother LP experience. Still, even if it’s a fourth album delivered with the enthusiasm and conviction of a debut, Tera Melos sound too damn geeked about where they are now to let <i>X’ed Out </i>be a definitive document.</p></div>"|18107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18107-tera-melos-xed-out/|7.1|Ian Cohen

On top of that, the ones sold in America supposedly came with only the Japanese instructions. Programming even a simple bassline on the 303 was essentially impossible for the average musician. But Phuture figured out how to wrangle a constantly evolving, jarring, harsh electronic ""squelch"" from the machine, and in 1985, recorded “Acid Tracks”, a 12-minute opus of squealing synth noise. After sitting on it for two years, they gave it to Ron Hardy, a DJ at Chicago’s legendary Music Box. As one of the most prominent figures in house’s creation, he ignited a craze in the city for what came to be called “acid house.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The craze would catch on in England in the late 80s, where acid house begat rave culture, but Soul Jazz’s new two-disc genre survey, <i>Acid: Mysterons Invade the Jackin’ Zone</i>, keeps its focus squarely on Chicago. “Acid Tracks” isn’t on it, but its 22 songs give a thorough overview of the genre's local legacy-- and we do get one Phuture song, plus a monsoon of squelches, in the form of “Slam”, credited to Phuture Pfantasy Club.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Listening to the compilation, what's immediately clear is how beautifully simple acid house could be. In fact, the more minimal it is, the better. One of its best tracks, Armando’s 1988 single “151”, consists almost entirely of a four-on-the-floor kick drum, a hi-hat, an electronic whirr, and a gnarly, trance-inducing, one-note 303 line. When some electronic handclaps come in at the four-minute mark, it qualifies as an event. And yet there’s nothing lacking in the arrangement. It’s brutally efficient, with a bare minimum of moving parts, and nothing to distract listeners from dancing. In front of the right crowd a DJ could easily stretch it out to at least 10 minutes without upsetting anyone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Interspersed throughout the compilation are cuts from what the liner notes refer to as the Chicago “experimental house” scene that was happening concurrently. These selections provide a break from the relentless 303 squelch, as well as highlighting some of the more interesting house music coming out of the city during a time when-- to quote “I Believe” by A Black Man, A Black Man and Another Black Man (one of the pseudonyms used by legendary house DJ Farley Jackmaster Funk)-- certain artists were “messing up by trying to make it commercial,” which would eventually lead to the satiny, spiritless vocal house that dominated clubs during the 90s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Acid</i> comes packaged with a short graphic novel by Paolo Parisi that offers an alternate acid house history, where the style plays a part in an ongoing battle between extradimensional creatures in which the digital dancehall of early-80s Jamaica also had a role. That’s obviously not how things really went down, but hearing the radical way that acid house producers were warping and twisting sound back then it would be easy to believe that aliens were involved somehow.</p></div>"|18040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18040-acid-mysterons-invade-the-jakin-zone/|7.4|Miles Raymer

It's a music that exclusively trades on finding beauty in the awkward fit, both in the way it sounds and the way it's executed. When listening to a Focus Group album, expect to hear organ drones collide with the clatter of typewriter keys, with indecipherable dialogue extracted from impossibly obscure European art films laced over the top. There is no neat segue between parts. Instead, it sounds like House is sticking pieces of tape together by hand, quickly cycling through fragments of pop culture ephemera in tracks that last two minutes or less (it's usually less). He's probably not working that way, but it's a nice image to have in mind when listening to the Focus Group: House, the mad inventor, lost in a blizzard of unspooled tape that he's gradually feeding into an old <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studer</a>, the whole process only making sense to him alone.</p>
<p>That working model served House well initially, but in recent times he's branched out a little. There's been a blurring of the lines between the Focus Group and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>, to the point where it's no longer clear where one group begins and the other ends. The <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/"" target=""_blank"">...Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/""></a></i> album bore both their names; a subsequent Broadcast tour (sadly their last due to the subsequent passing of singer Trish Keenan) drew heavily on films made for them by House; and Broadcast's soundtrack to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17492-berberian-sound-studio-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/""><i>Berberian Sound Studio</i></a> lent hard on the kind of cut-up work they'd undertaken on <i>Witch Cults</i>. Now, this album bears the credit: ""All titles composed by the Focus Group with help from Broadcast."" Still, <i>Elektrik Karousel</i> feels like the vision of one man, whose bastardization of the word ""carousel"" in the title couldn't be more appropriate. The whole thing passes in such a blur of color that you feel winded just trying to keep up.</p>
<p>Concerns may arise from anyone well-versed in this stuff, especially as the ""hauntology"" sub-genre has had its moment, and other Focus Group albums were delivered with a similar love of parcelling everything up in small packets of multi-colored splendor. But the <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label has been surprisingly resilient. Last year's <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/artist/artist_pyecorneraudio.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pye Corner Audio</a> album for the label is among their best releases, effortlessly surpassing most of the sub-par <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Carpenter</a> clones littering up download folders. <i>Elektrik Karousel</i> works in the opposite direction, strengthening House's position in a field in which he's mostly alone. He's shed many of the horror leanings here, instead bringing the folkier side of the Focus Group into tighter view. The styling of titles like ""Kinky Korner Klub"" and ""The Kool Kranium"" bring <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001910/?ref_=sr_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kenneth Anger</a>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kustom_Kar_Kommandos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kustom Kar Kommandos</i></a> to mind, but the mood throughout is more wistful autumnal picnic than it is occultist dinner party at the Dakota.</p>
<p>Those folk elements always existed in the Focus Group's palette, but the prevailing mood on prior albums could mostly be divided up into gleeful tinkering with vintage pop elements and the giallo chills that partly made the Ghost Box label so notable. On <i>Elektrik Karousel</i> there's a stronger sense of melancholy, lending this music a weight it didn’t reach for in the past. It's even there in the most experimental pieces, such as the positively epic (by Focus Group standards) six-minute piece ""The Magic Pendulum"", which builds around a sad horn motif and leaden organ drones. At times it's stunningly pretty-- the one-minute plinky-plonky loop that ""Let's Listen"" works around is one of the few times that House should have worked against his instinct for brevity. But that's the Focus Group, moving on quickly, leaving tiny mysteries trailing behind. Except this time a piece of the puzzle, an explanation for the shades of sorrow, is provided in the liner notes: ""Thank you Trish for the sounds you sent"".</p></div>"|18069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18069-the-focus-group-the-elektrik-karousel/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Critiquing a particularly hollow and noxious stereotypical female character that was cropping up in films like <i>Garden State</i> and <i>Elizabethtown</i>, Nathin Rabin<a href=""http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-bataan-death-march-of-whimsy-case-file-1-eliza,15577/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> coined</a> the popular term back in 2007. But awash in an endless stream of analysis, over-analysis, <a href=""http://flavorwire.com/311490/exclusive-supercut-75-years-of-manic-pixie-dream-girls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">supercuts</a>, and admittedly pretty hilarious <a href=""https://twitter.com/ZooeySiri"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">parody Twitter accounts</a>, Bartyzel now thinks the term has “outlived its usefulness and become a part of the very marginalizing trend that it was designed to rally against.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Not convinced? Look no further than the common perception of Miss Polka-Dots-and-Cupcakes 2013 herself, Zooey Deschanel. The title star of Fox's sitcom “New Girl” and sundress-clad half of AM radio nostalgists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5676-she-him/"">She &amp; Him</a>, Deschanel has also become the English language’s most popular synonym for “Manic Pixie Dream Girl.” Her pretty-vacant role in <i>(500) Days of Summer</i> and the misleadingly “adorkable” marketing campaign behind “New Girl” notwithstanding, there’s more to Deschanel than the stereotype suggests. True, most musicians have to deal with misconceptions and pigeonholing in some form or another, but pop culture has caricatured Deschanel in a way that’s quietly denied her artistic agency. Need proof? Last week, I conducted a very unscientific experiment: I asked five people in casual conversation if they knew that Deschanel wrote all the original songs on She &amp; Him's albums. All five of these admirably honest people gulped, looked down at their shoes and said no, they did not.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A big reason why it’s easy to underestimate Deschanel is that the actor-moonlighting-as-pop-musican is ripe for both parody and Dogstar jokes-- still, I'd bet the keys to my<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IucL7_szrHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> red Plymouth</a> that most people wouldn't have a hard time believing that Jared Leto at least <i>wrote</i> all of the bloated-ego space-operas on the last 30 Seconds to Mars record. But like the unexpectedly complex character arc of her “New Girl” character Jess Day, Deschanel's breezy, inviting, confidently arranged tunes come as a pleasant surprise to those who've dismissed her on flimsy principle (or hypothetical twee allergy) alone. <i>Volume 3</i>-- the latest collection of sun-dappled pop songs she’s recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"" target=""_blank"">M. Ward</a> under the name She &amp; Him-- provides further proof. Pulling tricks from the songbook of 60s pop and country crooners like Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline, She &amp; Him bask unabashedly in the glow of nostalgia, but Deschanel also finds a way to assert a unique personality within the pop idiom. “I’m stronger than the picture you took before you left,” she sings in her amiable, mid-morning yawn of an alto on “Turn to White”, one of <i>Volume 3</i>’s highlights. “In the light, it faded to white.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps even moreso than the first two She &amp; Him albums, <i>Volume 3</i> has an an alluringly casual feel: Deschanel has a certain kind of charisma that allows a song to hang loosely but never fall apart. On a few occasions, things get a little too lax: she mumbles the verses of “Somebody Sweet to Talk To” like a person recovering from dental surgery, but she gets it together in time for a sprightly chorus that ends up being one of the album’s catchiest melodies. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a>’s production is at once detailed and featherlight. It sometimes recalls the gilded edges and baroque flourishes on his lush, self-produced 2009 record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12681-hold-time/""><i>Hold Time</i></a>, but the songs themselves aren’t as tight as, say,<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs7Ks3AWwOc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> “Never Had Nobody Like You”</a> (an M. Ward track on which Deschanel provides back-up vocals). Ward gives them enough room to sway leisurely, as though a warm breeze is rustling through.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Volume 3</i> is the first She &amp; Him album since Deschanel’s divorce from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab for Cutie</a> frontman Ben Gibbard, but those scouring the lyrics for gossip might be a tad disappointed: <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/Ray-j-i-hit-it-first-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unlike Ray J</a>, Deschanel is tactfully tight-lipped about her personal business. The best songs here <i>are</i> the ones about heartbreak, but that’s been true on every She &amp; Him album. Deschanel is not a confessional or even very specific lyricist, but she often gets mileage out of zinging, gently self-deprecating turns of phrase like the ones on the excellent opener “I’ve Got Your Number, Son”. “What’s a man without all the attention?/ Well he’s just a man,” she sings, “Who am I without all your affection?/ I’m a nobody, too.” She has a way with that kind of line that Jenny Lewis has perfected-- cutting in one breath and knowingly self-lacerating in the next.</p>
<p>But that’s precisely why Deschanel's music ultimately transcends the Manic Pixie Dream Girl tag: She spends the following 13 songs asserting that she’s <i>not</i> a nobody when she’s alone. It doesn’t shy away from sorrow, but as far as heartbreak albums go, <i>Volume 3</i> is surprisingly resilient. When she’s wallowing-- as on the drizzly piano ballad “London”, one of the album’s more forgettable numbers-- Deschanel finds comfort in the fact that at least everybody else around her is wallowing, too. “We all go through it together, but we all go at it alone,” she sings on “Together”. The sentiment might be depressing if it weren’t tucked inside the most infectious melody on the whole record.</p></div>"|17990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17990-she-him-volume-3/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Grotty, homemade glo-fi singles such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11441-despicable-dogs/"" target=""_blank"">“Despicable Dogs”</a> turned a few ears in their native Brooklyn, but by the time Small Black cleaned up for their 2010 Jagjaguwar debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14790-new-chain/"" target=""_blank"">New Chain</a>, </i>they came off like a regular ol’ synth-pop act with good timing as opposed to an obsessive tinkerer like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a> or <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a>. The less said about their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12623-moon-killer/"">hip-hop mixtape</a>, the better-- just know that they were hardly the only dudes trying to make cloud-rap beats in 2011. And now with indie getting all grown and sexy, they’ve followed suit on <i>Limits of Desire</i>, a record whose production puts their music in sharper relief, but does so with an R&amp;B slickness that once again puts Small Black right in the center of the zeitgeist rather than above or outside of it.</p>
<p>Lead single and opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15033-small-black-free-at-dawn/"" target=""_blank"">“Free at Dawn”</a> at least shows us they made the right call. It’s the most exemplary of how their hi-fi sound-- described by frontman Josh Kolenick as a <a href=""http://stereogum.com/1305091/small-black-%E2%80%A8frontman-josh-kolenik-on-his-bands-new-album-relationships-and-taming-the-chillwave-dragon/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“million dollar record on a very low budget”</a>-- can prove complementary to the underlying elements of their songwriting. Kolenik’s breathy vocals handle melodies that take long, broad turns, the bass pulses lightly and everything that contributes to the soft, gently ascendant arc-- a sustained guitar riff, light harmonic kisses, lush reverb-- knows not to disturb this groove. Though Kolenik describes what it might feel like to be “reckless as rain,” “Free at Dawn” is more of a controlled, physical sensation, of a tall, cold one being swept against a sweaty brow.</p>
<p>It’s a nice feeling, one that Small Black can occasionally retrigger throughout <i>Limits of Desire. </i>But Small Black push through 45 minutes of this without generating the necessary heat to keep things interesting. As a vocalist, Kolenik remains more functional than expressive, his range limited in terms of both emotion and melody. In isolation, any of the 10 songs on <i>Limits of Desire </i>are a soothing balm; in sequential order, they’re distinguishable only by increment: “Canoe” is the one with the cooed, falsetto hook rather than the heavily sighed one (“No Stranger”), “Shook Loves” <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeuEGr_UTzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">may or may not be inspired by Mobb Deep</a>, and closer “Outskirts” is six minutes of aloe-infused synth-pop ambience instead of four.</p>
<p>Considering chillwave artists were never been shy about their R&amp;B influences and sought to evoke a sensuality that was foreign to most guitar-based music at the time, Small Black is capable of making a smooth transition to the present. But unlike the nu-makeout music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29552-vondelpark/"" target=""_blank"">Vondelpark</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>, <i>Limits of Desire </i>lacks crisp definition and spark, instead relying on the same old smeary tactics of reverb, gloss, and languor; thanks to the frictionless production, you can feel the high thread count of the sheets, but never another person.</p>
<p>A generous reading might suggest that’s the entire point. Judging from its title and the garish, <i>meaningful </i>symbolism of its cover art, <i>Limits of Desire </i>is meant to be a conceptual piece about communication breakdowns and failures of the flesh. But as much as Kolenik describes these chasms, he’s more wont to contribute to them. Throughout, he shows a weakness for emo softserve (“Through the thick and lovely smoke/ Full of guts but so shy/ Tell me what you want, she says”), though more often those sentiments are nudged uncomfortably towards poetry, but just end up not being enough of either (“She was the end of ruins/ A full rush of air”). It’s apt, as musically and lyrically, <i>Limits of Desire </i>plays on the double meaning of “sweet nothings”; you get the feeling that Small Black do want to break free of their past, but they’re not always convincing at showing how badly they want it.</p></div>"|18001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18001-small-black-limits-of-desire/|6.2|Ian Cohen

They're a four-piece band from Los Angeles, originally started by Alejandro Cohen and Samuel Cooper. It's hard to picture their debut full length, <i>Replicant Moods</i>, as the work of four people, mainly because it has more in common with the quiet elation of lone producers like Barcelona's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"">John Talabot</a>. Still, like Talabot, Pharaohs aren't averse to bringing in occasional outside forces. This album's collaboration with the avant-leaning Estonian singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29905-maria-minerva/"">Maria Minerva</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15008-pharaohs-miraculous-feet-ft-maria-minerva/"">""Miraculous Feet""</a> even mirrors the pop raptures of Talabot's 2011 match-up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"">Glasser</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12174-families-feat-glasser/"">""Families""</a>. Elsewhere, the classicist approach taken to house and Italo influences is a natural evolution from ""Uhh Uhh"" off the band's debut EP, where they resembled a less drug-addled version of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5891-happy-mondays/"">Happy Mondays</a>.</p>
<p>An element of the ultra-relaxed groove from that EP remains here, but mostly everything is tighter and more economical than the music that came before. Often it's close in content to the vintage Roland tweaks of certain songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"">the Rapture</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6693-echoes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Echoes</i></a>, which in turn formed barely disguised homages to the techno groundwork of pioneers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10131-kevin-saunderson/"">Kevin Saunderson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24096-derrick-may/"">Derrick May</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7891-juan-atkins/"">Juan Atkins</a>. In fact, the entirety of <i>Replicant Moods</i> carries a similar ethos to much of the <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> label, where popular tropes from dance music history reverberate in a contemporary setting. What's impressive is how effortless it all sounds, flicking from dark to light with barely a graceless join in sight. Pharaohs have a real feel for pace, mood, and setting, whether it’s through harder-edged Detroit techno adoration (""Everything"") or in sun-scorched stretches of plain euphoria (""Replicant Moods"").</p>
<p>The tougher stuff doesn't make up the bulk of this album. Instead, Pharaohs are most interested in inhabiting the stretch of clubland that builds toward full-on comedown. ""Beyond Within"" is the only track that reaches for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_del_Mar"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cafe del Mar</a>-inspired ambience, with the rest making transitory steps into that zone, from the lightness of the Minerva-fronted song to the acid gulps that stretch out across the retro-rusty drum patterns of ""Again"". This music doesn't take you anywhere new and nor does it set out to; instead it demonstrates how certain house and electro moves have a certain timelessness when executed with the kind of skill displayed here. It wouldn't be easy to put a place and time on <i>Replicant Moods</i> if played cold, with no knowledge of from when and where it came. ""F &amp; M Suite"" even feels like a close cousin of T-Coy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsL6W7Y5NFU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Carino""</a>, a classic Latin-inspired house tune from back in 1987.</p>
<p>Pharaohs succeed principally because they don't feel the weight of all those influences bearing down upon them. The parts all feel familiar, but the way the tracks here effortlessly transport you out of the everyday is an enviable trick that suggests this isn't a band that feels in awe of the material they're sourcing. It's an interesting route they’ve taken-- ""Uhh Uhh"" suggested something that was edging ass-backward out of a rock format into a more club oriented form, and they've taken that impulse and really sharpened it into something aimed squarely at the dancefloor. There's something to be said for waiting to make an opening statement, for working on your craft. It's paid off for Pharaohs on <i>Replicant Moods</i>. They sound less sloppy, more in control of what they're doing. ""Uhh Uhh"" was a perfectly serviceable, rough-around-the-edges calling card. But here? Here they just sound sublime.</p></div>"|18036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18036-pharaohs-replicant-moods/|7.5|Nick Neyland

Whether you're judging by speed and technicality or by sheer enveloping atmosphere-- see recent releases by Wormed and Defeated Sanity on one hand, or Portal and Abyssal on the other-- you'll have no trouble finding albums with more impressive on-paper stats. What this ninth <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2090-immolation/"" target=""_blank"">Immolation</a> full-length is, though, is something even more satisfying: a state-of-the-art <i>Immolation</i> LP, and a continuation of a hot streak by one of the most rewarding veteran acts in the genre. The Yonkers band, co-led since its 1988 inception by guitarist Robert Vigna and bassist/vocalist Ross Dolan, has never paid much mind to death metal's arms race of extremity; like their contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28082-suffocation/"" target=""_blank"">Suffocation</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30858-incantation/"" target=""_blank"">Incantation</a>, Immolation are currently producing some of the strongest material of their career, an expertly calibrated blend of the byzantine and the straightforwardly brutal, simply by following their own muse.</p>
<p>If there is such a being, he or she communes directly with Vigna-- the band's sole composer-- who wields his riffs like paint, splashed at irregular intervals, or spread out in more methodical arcs and whorls. Since the beginning, Vigna has employed death metal's stock cadences sparingly. The blastbeat isn't an auto-pilot move for him; his riffs clank and lurch, skank and shimmy, high and low registers dialoging incessantly like two opposing hand puppets, one that goes ""chunk"" and the other that goes ""squeal."" Parts appear first in basic form and then take on an eerie neon-like vibrancy thanks to the guitarist's signature whirring harmonies.</p>
<p>This M.O. has remained more or less intact since <i>Dawn of Possession</i>, Immolation's 1991 debut full-length. What has changed is the ferocity of the band's delivery-- which peaked in the early 2000s on extraordinary albums like <i>Close to a World Below</i> and <i>Unholy Cult</i>-- and, more recently, the integrity of their songcraft. With 2010's <i>Majesty and Decay</i>, Immolation were writing the kind of death-metal ""hits"" that distinguish the genre's most elite catalogs-- those of bands like Morbid Angel, Obituary and Cannibal Corpse. <i>Providence</i>, from 2011, was the best kind of stopgap: an EP that upheld <i>Majesty</i>'s standard while adding a new element of trancelike, downtempo repetition, further cementing Immolation's indifference to shock and awe for its own sake.</p>
<p><i>Kingdom of Conspiracy</i> is exactly the record any fan of the two bulls-eyes that preceded would've hoped for. It's less offbeat than <i>Providence or Majesty</i> and <i>Decay</i>; there are few surprises here and even less fat. But as a summation of what Immolation does well, it's close to flawless. The production values are pristine. Mid-period Immolation albums embraced an organic grit, but now the band is all about fierce clarity. Vigna's current method is to compose and arrange entirely on the computer, via Ableton Live; the members then learn the songs and perform them piecemeal in the studio. The end result has a mechanized quality that takes some getting used to, but suits the material well. <i>Kingdom of Conspiracy</i>'s core mission is the perfect articulation of Vigna's outlandish ideas. </p>
<p>Even though the album's aesthetic terrain is well-mapped, it's hard not to marvel at Vigna's inventions. ""Echoes of Despair"" is an instant Immolation classic, a perfect illustration of how the band manages to obey the basic tenets of death metal while sounding completely off-the-wall. The intro section staggers forward in top-heavy waltz time, a feel rarely employed in the genre. The song eventually arrives at a blastbeat passage, but first, it makes its way through a series of a brilliantly demented riffs, full of zigzagging chugs and divebombing squeaks. For all its weirdness, the track builds logically to its steamroller of a climax, demonstrating Immolation's trademark feat of simultaneously spinning your head around and inciting old-school fist-pumping.</p>
<p>Other tracks favor atmosphere over density. ""The Great Sleep"" is a mood-driven piece, a demonstration of Vigna's compositional economy. It features a series of tanklike riffs, lumbering and deliberate, offset by majestic leads. The band give each idea its due; they don't move on until each section seems indelible. As well as any item in the Immolation discography, it sums up the way the band juxtaposes frenzied technicality and poetic simplicity in the service of sturdy, memorable writing.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Kingdom of Conspiracy</i> hangs out in the Immolation wheelhouse, while making slight tweaks to the formula. As in their back catalog, the band rails at length here against those who would wield religion as a tool of control, but on songs like ""A Spectacle of Lies"", they widen their scope to include what scans as post-9/11 fearmongering. Lines like ""Inventing the problem/ Naming the enemy/ Creating the conflict"" don't exactly jump off the page, but in the context of the band's firestorm riffage, they capture the right mood of seething outrage. Ross Dolan's uniformly gruff vocal style serves a similar purpose: His delivery isn't the most distinctive or versatile in death metal, but like a top-tier hardcore barker, he summons a rare conviction, focusing Vigna's bizarre creations to a diamond-hard point.</p>
<p>Strangely, there's something heartwarming about <i>Kingdom of Conspiracy</i>. It isn't just the realization that Immolation have retained their staunch intensity for 25 years and counting; it's that you can still hear them pushing to do better, and to do so purely on their own terms, without regard for the kind of arbitrary benchmarks that have threatened to turn death metal from a richly expressive medium into either an athletic contest or inscrutable art project. Immolation are at heart a band that's comfortable in their well-established style; fans know they're not going to throw out a wild curveball like Morbid Angel's industrial-steeped 2011 head-scratcher <i>Illud Divinum Insanus</i>. At the same time, they've managed to find new ways to refine and progress. There's a pride in their steadfast devotion, not to mention a joy. A record as lean, untrendy and straight-up satisfying as <i>Kingdom of Conspiracy</i> could only have arisen out of the passionate care of lifers such as Robert Vigna and Ross Dolan. Their songs might fixate on hate, but they radiate a master craftsman's love.</p></div>"|18002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18002-immolation-kingdom-of-conspiracy/|8.0|Hank Shteamer

The largely accessible, inoffensive hard rock sensibilities of so-called “occult rock” slotted nicely into that yawning void, and judging by the glittering near-mainstream success of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31255-ghost-bc/"" target=""_blank"">Ghost B.C.</a> and cult following surrounding the now-defunct <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30113-the-devils-blood/"" target=""_blank"">Devil’s Blood</a>, it’s got some staying power. Black Widow and Coven singer Jinx Dawson could’ve told you that decades ago, but delving into their dusty catalogs would require a few moments’ effort. If we’re left with anything after the dust clears and a shiny new bandwagon has left the dealership, though, please, let it be Blood Ceremony, Jex Thoth, and English newcomers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31258-purson/"" target=""_blank"">Purson</a>.</p>
<p>Rosalie Cunningham’s warm, expressive voice entreats the listener to rise and shine on the dreamy album opener, “Wake Up Sleepyhead”, a slip of a song whose eerie organ runs and backwards vocal effects hint at what lies ahead. The muted, moody “The Contract” offers an immediate contrast; here, Cunningham sounds world-weary, far older than her 21 years. Her voice dips and trills, starting off smoky and burning bright; it's a formidable talent, and one that will undoubtedly improve with age. As it stands, her pipes are the driving force behind Purson’s 70s psychedelia-laced, 60s pop-inflected prog rock tunes, and her whimsical, eldritch lyrics add an otherwordly <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that other bands of their ilk fail to summon.</p>
<p>There’s no Satanic gobbledegook or limp spellcraft scrawled across the pages of Purson’s songbook. Their interests lie closer to home-- over the river and through the woods, on haunted moors and buried deep within English folklore and cautionary tales. “Spiderwood Farm” is a trippy ghost story told in sympathetic tones, theatrical and strangely appealing, while “Leaning on a Bear” is a up-beat and unapologetic, a vaudevillian romp delivered with a wink and a curled lip. It’s not all fairytales and funhouse mirrors, though; the album has its laments, too. “Sailor’s Wife’s Lament” is awash in blues and grey, and “Tempest and the Tide” coos forbidding murmurs of the devil and the deep blue sea. Carnivalesque chunks of Wurlitzer and mellotron feature prominently in the majority of the 11 tracks that make up <i>The Circle and the Blue Door</i>, forming an integral part of Purson’s unique sound.</p>
<p>“Sapphire Ward” is tricky, coming off as the album’s most straightforward 70s rock song despite its mid-song guitar freakout and Cunningham’s wicked, throaty croon, and closer “Tragic Catastrophe” is a gorgeously realized blues-pop confection, livened up by those ever-present proggy tendencies and a spare, trembling riff. Each song boasts its own character, though some have more to offer than others.</p>
<p>In the spirit of 70s excess, one or two of these could stand a trip to the chopping block, but their inclusion doesn’t hurt <i>The Circle and the Blue Door</i>. The album may sag a bit in the middle, but there’s always some new trick or folly around the corner to perk up a weary pair of ears. Purson openly revel in their eccentricity and quirky image, which might be a bit much for the more somber or prog-shy listener. But, contrived or not, whatever this band of witchy wild children is doing feels far more authentic than anything a certain bunch of dildo-wielding Swedes in Halloween costumes could ever hope to achieve.</p></div>"|18016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18016-purson-the-circle-and-the-blue-door/|7.2|Kim Kelly

A recording of a performance by an arena-level dance act is a tough sell, especially, you might think, since Deadmau5 <a href=""http://deadmau5.tumblr.com/post/25690507284/we-all-hit-play"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">came clean on his Tumblr</a> about the extent to which such “performances” often consist of little more than pressing play on a pre-sequenced audio track. But that's never been Justice's style: <span>Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay disavow any categorization as dance music performers, and take their live shows very seriously, basing their performances around the manipulation of up to 16 simultaneous audio tracks while adding live flourishes on a bank of synths and MIDI controllers, making them one of the few existing electronic acts where the impulse for the crowd to arrange itself facing the stage actually seems justified.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a dance act that have always carried themselves more like an arena rock band than an arena dance act, embracing the excess-inclined live album makes total sense alongside their crucifix iconography, Marshall stacks, and leather-jacketed image. Their 2008 tour DVD (with accompanying concert CD) was a highly watchable, totally seedy rampage through every substance abusing, tour-manager-carrying-a-handgun cliche in the debauched rock star book. And adding a certain amount of chaos and opening up opportunities for human error gives Justice’s live shows an organic energy that dance music doesn’t often have. On <i>Access All Arenas</i>, recorded on July 19, 2012, at les Arènes de Nimes, microfractional deviations from the beat and the occasional slightly rough transitions are steady reminders that there are actually two guys working with the sounds in real time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It also helps that like most good performers, Justice aren't afraid to radically alter their songs for a live setting. Their setup encourages revisions to the material, and the duo seems to relish the opportunity to tear their songs apart and rebuild them in sometimes radically different shapes. Here, on their signature cut “D.A.N.C.E.” the pair move its acapella breakdown from near the end of the song to the beginning, then add in theatrically melodramatic strings, piano, and what sounds like a synthesizer tweaked to sound like a big, crunchy distorted electric guitar. Then they dial things back down for some call-and-response with the crowd, before finally easing into something like the version we’re used to. The bass doesn’t even kick in until almost four minutes into it. Towards the end they replicate the loop around which Swizz Beatz built “On to the Next One”, then break into a cover of it briefly, just for fun. Later they do a little more fan service by dropping a few snippets of Simian's ""Never Be Alone"" into the tail end of “Stress”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The newer material from their underappreciated 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/"" target=""_blank""><i>Audio, Video, Disco</i></a> (this recording is taken from the year-long world tour they took in support of it) isn’t exempt from the pair’s deconstructionist tendencies. <i>Audio</i> displayed a stronger influence from prog and krautrock than their earlier material ever did, and it could easily have worked if they had played it completely straight. It’s lucky that they didn’t. One of the most successful revisions here is “On’N’On”; the original studio version was a serviceable but not especially noteworthy piece of synthy prog pop with a catchy vocal by Diamond Nights’ Morgan Phalen. On <i>Access All Arenas</i>, it appears as the first song of their encore, with an extended, stripped-down introduction consisting of Phalen’s part over a four-on-the-floor kick drum and a heavy bass line, before noodling off into prog for a minute, then exploding into celestial synths and a monster arena rock beat that reignites the massively energetic crowd. Their decision to bring back the “We Are Your Friends” hook one more time at the end may strike some as cheesy, but the sound of so many people simultaneously losing their shit when that occurs would suggest that the audience didn’t think so.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Crowd noise is a constant presence on <i>Access All Arenas</i>. The 2,000 or so people who filled the nearly two millennia-old Roman-built arena on the night of the recording were an enthusiastic group, and their cheering gives Justice’s radical shifts in dynamics some extra lift. Recording the crowd noise was obviously intentional, since all of the audio signals the pair are manipulating run direct, meaning no microphones are required to pick up ambient sound. If they’d recorded directly from of the signal running to the soundboard the results would have sounded like a studio album of extreme self-remixes, which would probably have been extremely interesting. But Justice are all about the spectacle; even if you weren't there to appreciate the show in person, they'll make damn sure you know that 2,000 others did.</p></div>"|17999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17999-justice-access-all-arenas/|7.8|Miles Raymer

And even if Cudi rarely lines it all up, his ability's evident: The music's production, which is for the most part self-generated, is usually interesting, and his fuck-the-world posturing resonates with a certain angsty personality type. When he finds the right balance-- <i>Man on the Moon II</i>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNlWbSUEOE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Ghost!”</a> is the best example-- it can add up to an effective cocktail of blurred anguish. Three years after the overstuffed <i>Man on the Moon II</i> and several outside dalliances-- the rock/rap sideproject WZRD, a small role in HBO’s cancelled ""Entourage""<i> </i>spin-off ""<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1299365/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How to Make it in America</a>""-- Cudi’s back with <i>Indicud</i>, which aims for a little bit of everything: It's an 18-song collection that features guests from the indie rock world (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">HAIM</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/"" target=""_blank"">Father John Misty</a>) as well as new-school demigods <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>. And Michael Bolton.</p>
<p>Factoring in all of that, <i>Indicud </i>has the sheen of a cinematic blockbuster. At 70 minutes, it certainly has cinematic length, too: ""<span class=""st"">Guess I'm just a star of my movie</span>,"" Cudi thinks aloud on ""Mad Solar"". Unfortunately, it also has no substance. From the first notes of the melodramatic opening instrumental ""The Resurrection of Scott Mescudi"", it's pretty easy to size up where Cudi's head is at these days, thanks to serrated, booming production underscored by a heartbeat-like drum lurch. It's ominous but hollow stuff. Ever prone to grandiose proclamations, Cudi wastes no time on <i>Indicud</i>; ""You know I'm unfuckwittable!"" he belts, his chest fully puffed. He's certainly putting his money where his mouth is, but to ill effect; though A$AP Rocky and Kendrick drop by, they do just enough to collect the paycheck and hit the door. Old heads RZA and Too $hort roll through and check in and out just as unremarkably. Nothing sticks. From the outset, he's more concerned with the soundscape shrapnel left over from WZRD than he is with synthesizers, a tool with which he's more effective.</p>
<p>For someone who's attained such a following, Cudi is remarkably unlikeable. Confessions like ""Just What I Am""'s  ""In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand/ I know that shit sound super cray, but if you had my life you’d understand"" come off as humblebrags about just how tough it is to be famous. He seethes about being G.O.O.D. Music's ""black sheep"" and calls haters ""pussies."" Outside of the occasional nugget of calm-- the HAIM and Hit-Boy collab ""Red Eye"", maybe-- <i>Indicud </i>is one long, increasingly grating vent.<span id=""exegize_button""> And if rage isn't your thing, don't worry about sifting through <i>Indicud</i>'s softer side, capped by the nine-minute slog ""Afterwards (Bring Yo' Friends)"". Fashioned as a late-night dance-party jam, it's built around sensationally off-putting come-hithers by soft rock titan Michael Bolton as well as Cudi's woozy synths kicking up dirt in the name of ""atmosphere.""<br/></span></p>
<p>Long gone are the days of the spongy ""Pursuit of Happiness"" as well as the Trojan Horse that initially brought Kid Cudi through our gates, ""Day 'n' Nite"". ""I look for peace, but see, I don't attain,"" he chanted on that song. Now, he's officially off Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint-- it's amicable, Cudi insists, and he'll carry on with his own label, Wicked Awesome. Still, he looks for war in <i>Indicud</i>; he can't find anyone to fight, but he rages anyway.</p></div>"|17925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17925-kid-cudi-indicud/|4.0|Corban Goble

Beaches was born out of casual jam sessions between friends who were between bands and never really thought they’d get any attention with the project. Their songs are simultaneously dense and amorphous, and often named for opaquely vast signifiers-- their 2008 debut included cryptic monoliths “Horizon”, “Eternal Sphere”, and “Vikings”-- and the music follows suit. Occasional flashes of saccharine girl-group melodies and the Ramones' glue-sniffing simplicity are usually warped and distorted into sprawling, phantasmagoric psych rock suites, almost always built atop a metronomic krautrock drive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It makes sense that for <i>She Beats </i>(released on the esteemed Australian Guy Blackman-run label Chapter Music) they've enlisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8798-michael-rother/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Rother</a> of Neu!, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>, Harmonia, and Cluster (who became smitten with Beaches after crossing paths at the 2009 Melbourne iteration of All Tomorrow’s Parties) to record two tracks, lending the whole project his krautrock seal of approval. The result is a dusty, sun-bleached collection of loose-fitting psychedelic noise/prog that pulses with unnerving Teutonic precision. The hazy, 60s pop still makes disaffected appearances (the band members switch vocal duties but their uniformly slurred intonation leaves their identities fluid), but there appears to be a larger focus on corralling their distortion-drenched, loopy guitar work into something approaching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Thurston Moore</a>’s barely contained squall.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">First track “Out of Mind” pretty much sets every influence Beaches has out on the table for a deceptively complex guitar epic. Between Allison Bolger and Ali McCann on dueling rhythm guitar, and Antonia Sellbach on lead, there are enough memorable riffs for four songs here, exploring garage rock, psych, and solos half-nabbed from “Teen Age Riot”. It’s arguably the best composed song on the album, stitched together with an eye for build and release that belies the meandering jam sessions that birthed this band. Though the lesser tracks-- like the Quicksilver-cribbing “Keep on Breaking Through” and the Eastern-influenced “Veda”-- are marred by indecsision, coming off as extended interludes rather than <i>song</i>-songs<i>.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Rother-featured pairing of “Distance” and “Granite Snake”, however, expertly display the group's strengths in a way that feels loose, exciting, and dynamic; “Distance” in particular is mesmerizing in the way it melds the group’s shoegazing tendencies, soloing abilities, and ambient pop vocals, with the lockstep of drummer Karla Way driving a song that comes off focused rather than repetitive; each guitar riff and subsequent key change seems like a revelation. “Granite Snake” is a masterclass facsimile of the sound Rother has become known for, with bassist Gill Tucker’s grimey riff used to build a rich tapestry of zooming guitars.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>She Beats </i>ebbs and flows in strangely sinister formations, sustaining a woozy unease that's hard to pin down. The record's most thrilling moments occur <span class=""s1"">w</span>hen Beaches force the demarcation between the diamond sharp rhythm section and the improvisational flourishes of the guitar work to slowly dissolve with measured control, revealing weird hypnotic depths forged from the group's established, and seemingly limitless, chemistry.</p></div>"|18025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18025-beaches-she-beats/|7.2|Patrick Bowman

Sure, more than a decade into their existence, the group led by saxophonist Sam Hillmer have issued a half-dozen albums, a horde of singles and, last year, an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17104-score-the-complete-sextet-works-2002-2007/"" target=""_blank"">immersive box set</a> that gathered the complete works of the foundational Zs sextet onto four discs. But Zs operates from a stable core of instability. To wit, they’ve undergone massive lineup changes throughout their lifespan, swapping members among their two drummer/two guitarist/two saxophonist ranks before condensing into a quartet and, most recently, a series of trios. But more important, they’ve always kept their focus fluid, spiraling between roles as a new music ensemble, improvisational welterweights, sheet-music rippers, sing-along weirdos, and post-punk aggressors. As their name unwittingly suggests, Zs has always pushed ideas to their endpoints and began again, begetting a cycle of acute renewal. “The one action that might be totally futile,” wrote Trevor Hunter of Zs’ trajectory in the liner notes to last year’s<i> </i>obelisk of variety, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17104-score-the-complete-sextet-works-2002-2007/"" target=""_blank""><i>Score: The Complete Works</i></a>, “is trying to follow the same course.”</p>
<p>And so, <i>Grain</i> is the first release by the latest Zs lineup-- saxophonist Hillmer, classically trained-and-aimed guitarist Patrick Higgins and incredibly active drummer Greg Fox. Rather than set expectations and parameters for this phase of the band by initially releasing original compositions, the trio opted instead to create a cannibalistic mixtape that feeds on the carcass of the last Zs iteration. Hillmer and Higgins used the last-gasp recordings of the previous trio to create a 21-minute continual rupture of sound, where any one layer or melody or rhythm generally lasts long enough only to reveal something else pushing through it. Fox took the same material and bent it into a strange span of beats, whirrs and drones, populating his side of this quixotic and intriguing LP with both a warped sense of time and a disobedient attention span. Those qualities, of course, trace a through line from the earliest incarnations of Zs to this rather uproarious one.</p>
<p>Zs has forever been a liminal act, living on (and occasionally dying by) any number of thresholds-- to tour or not to tour, to finish a piece or to rip it up every time it’s played, to transgress in the classical world or to befuddle in the indie rock realm. That trait holds for the personnel decision here; rather than make a clean break with the preceding unit, Hillmer built a portal between them by letting the upstart band pilfer the ruins of the past. And sonically, <i>Grain</i> again refuses to land on any one style or direction. Fox is a bombastic drummer, perhaps best known for the way he shifted from steady wallop to sudden bursts in both the black metal act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a> and his own astral freak-show <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"" target=""_blank"">Guardian Alien</a>. His focus during “Grain Part Two” certainly hinges on beats, but he trades any expected force for a mercurial finesse. He lights between blissful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> murmurs and cerebral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"" target=""_blank"">Matmos</a> crunch, between puritanical Ryoji Ikeda cuts and twilit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a> drones. The rhythm is never still or settled, and the tone is never simple enough to be pretty <i>or</i> punishing; again, Fox-- and, by extension, Zs-- spend these 22 minutes on multiple edges.</p>
<p>Hillmer and Higgins are even more restless, unspooling a barrage of forever-alternating scraps and samples. They hopscotch from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow</a>-sized tumult to funky guitar, from dying-machine industrial music to sweetly mesmerizing rhythmic patter. At one point, they land upon a pulse that’s so grimy and buoyant that you might expect rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29764-cities-aviv/"" target=""_blank"">Cities Aviv</a> to jump into it; at other points, they burrow so deep into sonic detritus and damage that you can’t imagine anyone even approaching the mess. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that <i>Grain</i> is only an introduction, a lark that Hillmer conjured for introducing this emergent ensemble. The trio of Hillmer, Higgins and Fox have been touring, building their own manifestation of Zs. <i>Grain</i> makes it clear that they’re unencumbered when it comes to novel approaches but that they remain bound to exactly what Zs has been for so long-- great testers of boundaries and binaries, an act so reluctant to pick one option versus another that they’ve refused to choose between the old and the new. </p></div>"|17988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17988-zs-grain/|7.3|Grayson Currin

It’s now impossible for any band of Gauls with even the wispiest shred of experimental ambition to escape a comparison to everyone’s favorite metaphysical Satanists. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23037-blut-aus-nord/"" target=""_blank"">Blut Aus Nord</a> are seldom mentioned outside of the same breath. Do the band in question favor slightly cockeyed guitar melodies? DsO reference. Is there a whiff of pretension, maybe, or earnest philosophical leanings in the lyrics? DsO reference. Could the word “hypnotic” or “angular” be thrown in there without much effort? Definite DsO reference ahead. It’s with this brush that their slightly younger countrymen in<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/31234-aosoth/"" target=""_blank""> Aosoth</a> will undoubtedly be slathered, and while they may share a disjointed chord or two, there’s a lot more concealed beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Aosoth started as a side project for several members of the long-established <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5882-antaeus/"" target=""_blank"">Antaeus</a>, when enterprising (and prolific) vocalist MkM decided he necessitated yet another mouthpiece for his harsh proclamations. Whereas Antaeus’ more traditional method of black metal is dissonant, ritualistic, and overtly hostile, this new project dabbled in thrashier, more melodic fare before abandoning such frivolities in favor of their current off-kilter, progressive bent. Aosoth have grown in leaps and bounds since that first 2002 release (fittingly, a split album with Antaeus), and <i>IV: Arrow In Heart</i> is their most mature album to date. While their brother band invariably head straight for the soft spot, Aosoth prefer to take the long way round, stopping at the rack, the thumbscrew, and the cat o’nine along the way.</p>
<p>The album demands attention from the first note and the ensuing head nodding groove seals the deal. “An Arrow In Heart” serves as a perfect statement of intent, showcasing each elemental piece-- MkM’s wretchedly on-point vocal scrapings, the tightly controlled drumming, the surprisingly prominent bass, the unexpected scraps of understated melody, and above all, the weird, menacing riffs, which wax deliberate, rhythmical, and cerebral in turn. The slow, churning interlude halfway through cuts the lights, and the ice-cold blasting finish seals the tomb. If you’re looking for another <i>Transilvanian Hunger</i>, this ain’t it.</p>
<p>But it’s no <i>Si Monvmentvm Reqvires, Circvmspice</i> either. Aosoth are careful to balance their avant-garde leanings with brutish intensity, refusing to let the listener forget for even a moment that this is still black fucking metal. The obtuse, cyclical quality of the guitar work is captivating (see the second half of “Under Nails &amp; Fingertips” or the entirety of mammoth album closer, “Ritual Marks of Penitence”) and MkM’s tormented howls, growls, croaks, and moans animate and enliven droning, drawn-out passages that often veer dangerously close to collapsing in onto themselves. Though MkM’s vocal prowess is a given and the guitar work is the album’s selling point, the real heavy lifting is handled by the rhythm section, most notably the bass. Unlike black metal’s usual penchant for thin, trebly mixes, Aosoth are all about the low end, and bassist IRNVI does a stellar job. His acrobatic, expressive strings lend crucial heft and body to tracks like “One With the Prince With a Thousand Enemies” and “Temple of Knowledge”, single-handedly propelling the album’s Satanic swing. Once again, Aosoth defy convention without bothering to publicize it. Their style is understated and focused, and it works.</p></div>"|17971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17971-aosoth-iv-an-arrow-in-heart/|7.0|Kim Kelly

In the wake of the fatal car crash that claimed the former Princess of Wales, concerts across a grieving U.K. were cancelled en masse-- including a handful of Primal Scream dates in London, the promoter of which claimed the band were kiboshing “out of a mark of respect for Diana.” This came as news to the band, who issued a reactionary retort claiming, “We wanted to play... We have no respect whatsoever for Diana Spencer or any member of the English Royal Family. We are totally opposed to the monarchy.” Accordingly, the band’s next album, 2000’s <i>XTRMNTR</i>, was Primal Scream's most angry, aggressive work to date, a brutalizing assault on ruling-class privilege and right-wing ruthlessness fought with industrial-strength, big-beat ballast and nuclear-grade distortion. (The latter came courtesy of auxiliary member Kevin Shields, whose earwax-melting mixes of “Accelerator” and “MBV Arkestra (If They Move Kill ‘Em)” made the decades-long wait for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17726-mbv/"" target=""_blank""><i>mbv</i></a> a little easier to endure.)</p>
<p>But rather than signal a change in the band’s consciousness, <i>XTRMNTR</i>’s politicized fervor proved to be as much of a passing phase as the <i>Sticky Fingers</i>-licking of 1994’s <i>Give Out But Don’t Give Up</i>. While <i>XTRMNTR</i>’s primary concerns (war, greed, inequality) would dominate newstickers over the ensuing decade, Primal Scream’s albums over that stretch found them aesthetically adrift, shirking topicality for white-lined electro decadence (2002’s <i>Evil Heat</i>), refried roots-rock (2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9082-riot-city-blues/"" target=""_blank""><i>Riot City Blues</i></a>), and day-glo pop gloss (2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12024-beautiful-future/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beautiful Future</i></a>). And where the band had heralded each of the previous two decades with a game-changing <i>tour de force</i>, they spent the turn of the 2010s restaging 1991’s rave-rock masterwork <i>Screamadelica</i> to sold-out crowds across the U.K. So when Gillespie sings, “What happened to the voices of dissent/ Getting rich, I guess?” on <i>More Light</i>’s epic opener “2013”, he could very well be singing to himself.</p>
<p>Coincidentally enough, Primal Scream’s political reawakening immediately follows the death of another notorious British figurehead, Margaret Thatcher. But while the Iron Lady is derisively name-dropped a handful of times on <i>More Light</i>, her passing didn’t exactly inspire Gillespie <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/12128-primal-scream-bobby-gillespie-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to lead a chorus of “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead”</a> through the streets of Glasgow. Notwithstanding the shameless rehash of “Movin’ On Up” that is current single “It’s Alright, It’s OK”, it appears the most tangible effect that the recent <i>Screamadelica</i> remount had on <i>More Light</i> was in reinforcing the dispiriting sense of how little the political landscape has changed since the former was first released.</p>
<p>The result is Primal Scream’s most impassioned, holistic, and ambitious album since <i>XTRMNTR</i>, though this time they’re not so much interested in toppling oppressive institutions as devising the psychic survival strategies required to withstand them. Tapping the heady, cinematic sensibility of producer David Holmes, and compensating for the exodus of long-time bassist Mani back to the Stone Roses, <i>More Light</i> presents Primal Scream at their most lustrous and expansive, foregrounding acoustic elements-- unplugged guitars, saxophone, string-section flourishes-- but shaping them into swirls of sound every bit as dense and disorienting as their more electronically focused, dubwise efforts.</p>
<p>“2013” may import its dystopian “21st-century slave” mindset and Kevin Shields-supplied screech from the <i>XTRMNTR</i> playbook, but it forsakes camouflage gear for kaftans and keffiyehs, with a snake-charmer horn refrain and a sand-swept, acoustic-guitar groove that alternately surges and dissolves over the course of its nine mesmerizing minutes. Holmes’ wide-screened influence is most perceptible on the album’s long tracks, over which the Scream carefully set the scene before deviously destabilizing it: “River of Pain” is a hushed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/339-the-beta-band/"" target=""_blank"">Beta Band</a>-style psych folk workout that gradually drifts into the path of an orchestral free jazz tornado; “Relativity” is a raging-raga attack on complacency (“You’re fucking next!/ Condemned to repeat!”) that gets detoured into a moonlit <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> sway. And to the producer’s great credit, even the songs that most flagrantly dip into the blues-- always a danger zone for this band-- retain an absorbing atmosphere and gritty edge, like the empty-bottle-kicking, back-alley strut of “Tenement Kid” and the grey-scaled gospel of “Elimination Blues”, the latter coloured by some lemon-squeezing “uh huhs” from guest Robert Plant.</p>
<p>If these subdued songs channel <i>XTRMNTR</i>'s agitated spirit in more oblique ways, other tracks make the connection more explicit: The spectacular, sax-scrambled “Hit Void” is the sequel to ""Shoot Speed Kill Light” we’ve been waiting 13 years for, inheriting the latter’s Autobahn-bound rhythm but stomping on the accelerator and scraping the guard rail until the sparks fly; the hypnotic stomp of ""Sideman"", meanwhile, chisels a proper song out of the jazz funk haze of ""Bloody Money"". However, “Culturecide” would be a more credible civil-disobedient counterpart to “Exterminator” if it didn’t have a title and hysterical chorus cry (courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"" target=""_blank"">the Pop Group</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4130-mark-stewart/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Stewart</a>) that sounded like it was cribbed from an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/156-atari-teenage-riot/"" target=""_blank"">Atari Teenage Riot</a> record. And the upbeat 80s-Stones glitz of “Invisible City” sounds as out of place here as the band’s rollicking cover of Hawkwind’s “Motorhead” did on <i>Vanishing Point</i>, ranking it a distant second in the pantheon of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9biEGp1cl_g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">city-themed Gillespie/Holmes collaborations</a>. But <i>More Light</i>’s sprawl is ultimately its greatest virtue, its fusion of dreamy acoustic psychedelia and white-knuckled krautrock propulsion serving as the connective tissue between the blissed-out and bludgeoning extremes of this band’s unwieldy discography. With the <i>Screamadelica</i> nostalgia out of their systems, <i>More Light</i> primes the Scream for their fourth decade in the best possible way, serving as a summary of everything they’ve done before, yet sounding nothing like it.</p></div>"|17989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17989-primal-scream-more-light/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13209-hands/"" target=""_blank"">her 2009 debut</a>: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26824-little-boots/"" target=""_blank"">Little Boots</a> had the fortune, it seemed at the time, to emerge solo alongside about six other new electropop acts, all varying combinations of blonde, British, and boshing, with dossiers full of tie-ins, dollops of irony, and a tendency to deliver <a href=""http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/55304/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">suspiciously similar talking points</a> about how <i>their </i>dance music differed from the <i>other</i> dance music conquering the Top 40 in their stead. Of those, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a> went supernova, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">La Roux</a> has spent three years writing the follow-up to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13181-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">its debut</a>, the ""is-it-pop-or-is-it-not?"" debate was foisted onto a new group of singers, and all went quiet for Little Boots. Yet her shiny pop debut was ahead of the curve in a way, helmed in part by Greg Kurstin, four years before he became the go-to producer for shiny pop albums. If it’s instinct, it’s the same instinct that steered her ever closer since toward 90s-inspired house, two early singles of which (“Shake” and “Every Night I Say a Prayer”) heralded her second album, <i>Nocturnes</i>-- an album that’s come out just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>, Rudimental, and seemingly one-third of the British commonwealth have emerged and begun to score uninterrupted No. 1 hits with that very sound.</p>
<p>The major difference, obviously, is that the hype around Little Boots has now completely dissipated-- as have at least some of Little Boots’ industry ties; <i>Nocturnes </i>is out under her own On Repeat label. It’s not a bad thing, exactly; where before Hesketh was all but set up for failure even if she <i>did </i>manage the crossover, she’s now able to settle into a more attainable level of expectations. <i>Hands’ </i>catalog of pop sub-styles is gone, and where that record forced her to sing like about six separate divas, <i>Nocturnes </i>finds her settling on one that aspires to the distance of Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell or Sophie Ellis-Bextor. She’s not quite there, and when her approach doesn’t work, it <i>really </i>doesn’t-- as on “Confusion”, which juggles lasers, cowbell, house piano, vocal percussion, and a small packet of stock sounds until its outro, “never lie to me again” is banally repeated, like a petulant lover’s spat. “Every Night” has a cavernous chorus that Hesketh isn’t enough of a belter to fill.</p>
<p><i>Nocturnes</i> is a big improvement over <i>Hands</i>, though, where even the biggest singles' hooks were made of saccharine, not sugar. Hesketh credits the change to her time spent DJing, but while she’s bound to have been immersed in the U.K. dance scene’s burgeoning 90s revival, her collaborators are of a different stripe. DFA’s Tim Goldsworthy takes over for Kurstin, but most of Hesketh’s<i> </i>writers on <i>Nocturnes</i> (Hercules and Love Affair’s Andy Butler, Bomb the Bass’ Pascal Gabriel, Simian Mobile Disco’s James Ford) are studio veterans.</p>
<p>Little Boots’ subject matter hasn't changed at all, however. Hesketh is still fond of overly pat metaphor, usually involving her own music; standing in for <i>Hands</i>’ “Tune Into My Heart” and “Stuck on Repeat” are “Crescendo”, which builds appropriately enough until you realize it’s supposed to be about a fight somehow, and “Broken Record”, sinuous like a fever dream until you realize lines like “thought you were out of mind, instead you’re stuck on repeat” are probably also about Little Boots’ career. (Or, for that matter, “Stuck on Repeat”, which is either horribly lazy or horribly meta and plausibly deniable either way.)</p>
<p>When the metaphors don’t falter, other things do: “Strangers” comes off as an offcut from Kylie Minogue’s<i> Aphrodite</i>, too tired even for a victory lap album. “All for You” is sleepier still. But a good deal of these tracks work just fine: the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lrVymj9xHY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dido</a>-at-dusk escape fantasy “Motorway”; “Satellite”, which whirls and sparkles as undeniably as anything in producer Ariel Rechtshaid's back catalogue; or the Ford-penned former lead single “Shake”, which throbs, throbs some more, and needs do nothing else. It all adds up to a sort of twisted proof of <i>Hands</i>’ big talking point: maybe you’re a better hitmaker when you’re not so self-conscious about it.</p></div>"|17978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17978-little-boots-nocturnes/|6.0|Katherine St. Asaph

A stiffening breeze ran through his music, and his works assumed the spare urgency of a life form forced to reorder its priorities to survive. His Pulitzer Prize-winning 2008 masterwork, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13775-the-little-match-girl-passion/""><i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i></a>, scored for just four voices and some hand bells, huddled around a handful of close-together pitches like a body trapping heat; the highlight, ""Have Mercy My God,"" wound slowly around just five notes, all within one octave, sending the same questioning note into the air repeatedly. Something profound had spooked Lang into a consideration of primal questions.  </p>
<p>On his new album, <i>Death Speaks</i>, Lang stops dancing around the subject and invites the implied muse behind his late-period transformation to center stage. As its title makes plain, the five love songs on <i>Speaks</i> are in the voice of Death; the words put in Death's mouth, meanwhile, are Schubert's. ""Something that has always attracted me to the songs of Franz Schubert is how present death is,"" Lang writes in the liner notes. ""It isn't a state of being or a place or a metaphor, but a person, a character in a drama who can tell us in our own language what to expect in the World to Come.""  The second the music starts playing, though, this framework disappears. When Shara Worden of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">My Brightest Diamond</a>, who performs the title role, opens her mouth, you are not thinking about Schubert. You are thinking about death.</p>
<p>Like <i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i>, the instrumental forces are simple: Bryce Dessner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a> on guitar, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a> on piano, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"" target=""_blank"">Owen Pallett</a> on violin and occasional backup vocals. <i>If The Little Match Girl Passion</i> resembled a frozen, minimalist recasting of the English madrigal, <i>Death Speaks</i> sounds like the stem cells of Schubert songs, attempting repeatedly to assemble themselves into form. ""you will return"" is set for a piano and electric guitar, played in a high register, blending together to fool the ear into hearing one harp. At the song's edges, however, the piano throws in compelling ""off"" notes, pricking the surface with the sound of modern, anxious thought. ""I am your pale companion,"" Worden sings haltingly, longing palpable in her voice, on ""you will return,"" while the music hesitates its way forward, one tangled figure at a time.  </p>
<p>This probing reiteration of a single phrase, one that restates itself in a thousand different ways, is a trademark touch of Lang's. There is a philosophical tenor to this technique, as if the ""correct"" phrasing of this figure is just one more try away, and the changes, when they happen, ripple across the music more than they announce themselves. ""I am walking"" consists of a two-note guitar figure, with small throat-clearing interjections from the piano, while Worden and guest vocalist Pallett's vocal lines cross over each other. The final piece on the album, ""Depart"", a piece for cello and wordless vocals, hangs like smoke, darkening by imperceptible shades. In the pervading unease of Lang's new world, only the smallest tendrils of harmonic motion are allowed to advance the music forward.</p>
<p>This frozen wood is the place from which Lang's music reaches us now, and Worden's voice has maybe been never better used than as its human embodiment. Her rounded, glowing tone remains creamy even as it ascends into its highest register, and she brings an overwhelming sadness to Worden's Death, whose loneliness as she vainly pursues her charges, or even, in ""mist is rising"", begs them to escape-- ""I love you/I love you/I love all of you/Your face/I love your face/Your form/I love your form ... Please don't make me make you follow me""-- is heartbreaking. Her Death is not just human, but humane, burdened by her task and full of compassion for those she visits. She is beautiful, but troubled, and her voice, like these pieces, rings out into a stillness, harmonic and spiritual, that feels both haunted and becalmed.</p></div>"|18023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18023-david-lang-death-speaks/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Harlem-based producer/drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31026-gobby/"" target=""_blank"">Gobby</a>, who’s created beats for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30309-mykki-blanco/"" target=""_blank"">Mykki Blanco</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>, is the latter type. From the four-to-the-floor kick drum that opens his debut full-length, <i>Fashion Lady</i>, to the stroboscopically pulsing funk samples that close the album, there’s not much here that a competent DJ would have much trouble blending into a set of uptempo dance music. The album's subtitle is “Techno Ass Album,” so most of the songs hew to the steady 4/4 structure that powers techno and house music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Whether or not a DJ would be willing to throw these tracks into a mix-- well, that depends on how adventurous they are.<i> Fashion Lady </i>draws from a wide range of fringey electronic noise freaks, a dense, knotty palette that you'd find in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"" target=""_blank"">Squarepusher</a>'s more cerebral material. Elsewhere, there's an absolute mayhem of smeary, lo-fi sounds that sound like they could have been recorded at an aggro DIY art loft show.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fashion Lady</i> succeeds where the straight techno and noisy sides find an equilibrium. “Cops” matches a steady, uncluttered beat with one synthesizer playing a short sketch of a bass riff and another holding a higher tone, evolving through changes in modulation rather than pitch. On paper that might seem boringly repetitive, but it possesses the same hypnotic power of a classic acid house track, a reminder of, exactly, how sonically strange a lot of classic dance music really was.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fashion Lady</i>’s center of gravity is located within those moments, which also prove to be the jumping-off point for Gobby's wilder experiments. “Lect Hom” is one of the record's more rhythmically tweaked songs, with a skittering beat that flickers between drum n' bass, Miami electro, and Chicago footwork, topped with a woozy, wobbly bass line and horror movie organ stabs. “VB News” is a murky, overdriven blend of polyrhythmic drumming and dubby synth fantasia. If <i>Blade Runner</i> had a scene involving a cyber-Third-World ayahuasca ceremony, it would be the perfect soundtrack.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fashion Lady</i> is a fairly bipolar record, and Gobby seems like a fairly bipolar artist-- at least, in creative terms. He constantly tugs back and forth between a dance producer’s desire to bring a crowd together and the noise crowd's opposing infatuation with audience alienation. But the album's most interesting facet is that it never fully succumbs to either impulse. Whether <i>Fashion Lady</i> is a dance record with a noise-minded heart or the other way around, Gobby's propensity to create tension through these competing motivations is compelling, its central ambiguity providing plenty of fascination.</p></div>"|18071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18071-gobby-fashion-lady/|7.0|Miles Raymer

The London foursome's second LP-- third, if you count their sturdy early singles collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13921-tidings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tidings</i></a>-- harkens back to the days when fife-toting beardos decamped to hillsides to write 18-minute songs about wizards. Indeed, <i>Fain</i>, much like 2010's <i>Steeple</i>, is a progressive rock record of the most British kind: heady, overcast, rooted in English psych-folk, streaked with lightning-flash guitars, thunderous rhythms, and the occasional woodwind. More than anything, music like this is meant to be transportive; surely that's why so much of it came tucked in a triple-gatefold sleeves done up in dragons or dudes in pointy hats. And the shimmering chords of <i>Fain</i> opener ""Empty Vessels"" seem to draw the curtain back on another, promisingly strange little world. But <i>Fain</i>, for all its craggy hillsides and cameos from wizened sages, seems all too content to travel the very same paths of its predecessors without risking the same ridiculousness.</p>
<p>With its amped-up Brit-folk melodies, its pastoral bent, and its occasional flute, <i>Fain</i>, like <i>Steeple</i> before it, owes more than a little something to prog-blues progenitors/expert-level dungeonmasters Jethro Tull. A few softer moments recall less booming Tull contemporaries like Trees; on the heavier end, <i>Fain</i> crashes and bangs like Page and Bonham or Baker and Clapton. Where the fitfully satisfying, decidedly scatterbrained <i>Tidings</i> drew as much from boggy UK psych as it did San Francisco and swinging London, <i>Fain</i> holds onto those few strains of turn-of-the-70s UK rock awfully tight, narrowing its influences in an attempt to expand its scope. <i>Fain</i> does a good job of conjuring atmosphere: the production's crisp, the rhythms punchy, the tension in the air lending everything a certain queasiness. But once you've spent a little time traversing these pathways, you start to feel like you're going in circles.</p>
<p>Most of these songs begin with an explosion, guitar and drums pounding out a carefully calibrated assault. Soon after, frontman Jack Sharp's flickering candle of a voice takes the torch, intoning some far-away wisdom or recalling some long-ago scene. Then the guitars resume their upward climb, clawing their way to a peak of sorts before toppling into the next song. Taken on their own, <i>Fain</i>'s constant guitar wig-outs can be electrifying, their blunt force untempered by their jagged complexity. But continually upending Sharp's verses with these fretboard detours leaves <i>Fain</i> feeling disjointed and sapped of its fluidity. Between these corkscrewing guitars, you'll catch glimpses of the world Sharp and company mean to conjure. But <i>Fain</i> thrashes about too much to ever quite come together the way an album like this is supposed to; as distraction-laden as most prog-rock is, <i>Fain</i> seems incapable of holding any one thought for very long without finding it necessary to solo all over it. The instrumental interplay is several clicks past competent, but after a few spins, you find yourself waiting not for particular songs, but individual moments: the way ""Hesperus"" seems to rise a few inches off the ground not quite halfway through, or that trippy little delay-click behind the main riff on ""All Returns"". The rest starts to feel a bit extraneous, interchangeable even, the riffs forced onto these tracks rather than built seamlessly into them.</p>
<p>The spiraling hook of ""When the Fire is Dead in the Grate"" provides <i>Fain</i> with its crowning moment. Over a crashing sea, Sharp recounts a horrific scene: a stormy night, a fire, and footprints in the ash. Yet Sharp-- or whoever he's giving voice to at the moment-- claims to have slept through the whole thing. True, <i>Fain</i> could certainly stand to lose a few of its momentum-sapping guitar blowouts. But what it really needs is more drama, something to elevate it beyond a few half-told tales of yore and a mess of guitars and drums chasing each other around a hillside. <i>Fain</i> clocks in just shy of 45 minutes, with no single track stretching out much past seven minutes, so even all the carefully choreographed guitar whizzbang is kept on a fairly short leash. Sharp's voice is lovely, but he's quite a mannered singer, rarely allowing himself to just go for it. So <i>Fain</i>, for all its geeky underpinnings, never quite seems at ease underneath that wizard cap. The blocky compositions and instrumental rigor certainly make Wolf People a prog band, but progressive? Not particularly. Between its out-of-town origins, its fusty linguistics, and its towering guitar throwbacks, <i>Fain</i> seems to want so desperately to be immersive, world-conjuring, the kind of record you break your weed up on. But by drawing this deeply on both the physical and sonic landscapes of their forebears, and with too many go-nowhere solos blotting out its songs, <i>Fain</i> winds up feeling stuck in time.</p></div>"|18101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18101-wolf-people-fain/|5.9|Paul Thompson

You can visualize a rap game Ferris Bueller: arms outstretched to snare a foul ball, staring stoned at Seurat, ducking fascist educators, and oblivious parents with cinematic ease. You can hear his impression of Abe Froman, sausage king of Chicago, and it’s pitch-perfect.</p>
<p>Barely out of his teens, Chancelor Bennett has already transformed himself from a suspended high school student to the young Chicago rapper universally adored <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHa1zTLrXO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">among</a> ""sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, dweebies, and dickheads."" The release of last week’s <i>Acid Rap</i> triggered such intense demand that it crashed both hosting site Audiomack and Windy City rap agora Fake Shore Drive. Cops recently fanned Chance from two separate high school parking lots after mobs formed once kids discovered he was on campus.  </p>
<p>But life rarely parallels a John Hughes script. Unlike Bueller, Chance actually got caught skipping school, a 10-day sabbatical that inspired his first mixtape, last year’s <i>#10Day. </i>His neighborhood of West Chatham might not be the worst in a city whose alias is Chiraq, but it’s still South Side and far removed from baronial Highland Park. The drugs are high-velocity, the slang is crisper, and in this scenario, Cameron dies. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The victim was Rodney Kyles Jr., a close friend who Chance saw get stabbed to death one gruesome night. His memory haunts <i>Acid Rap</i>. On “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14871-juice/"" target=""_blank"">Juice</a>”, Chance mourns his inability to “be the same since Rod passed.” On “Acid Rain”, he still hears screams and sees “his demons in empty hallways.” The circumstances aren’t necessarily unique. Last year, Chicago murders outnumbered American casualties in Afghanistan. Drill stars, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"" target=""_blank"">King Louie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Durk</a> have given the violence a public face with videos so dark they practically resemble a first-person shooter PS3 game set in Section 8.</p>
<p><i>Acid Rap</i> isn’t trying to be an alternative; it’s an attempt to encompass everything. There are shout outs, musical or lyrical, to practically every important Chicago tradition short of Thrill Jockey. It invites elements of classic soul, juke, gospel, blues-rock, drill, acid jazz, house, ragtime scat, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"" target=""_blank"">Twista</a>, and a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> to the same open mic poetry night, where the kid on-stage is declaiming about what’s going unreported. Its genius is that he somehow makes this work.  </p>
<p>The structure is as expansive and freewheeling as any strange trip. <i>Acid Rap</i> is a less about the attempt to break on through than a way of describing the hallucinatory shades, transitory revelations, and cigarette burns of the journey. You can get off or on the bus at any juncture. There is no ideology or orthodoxy. No arbitrary binaries between conscious or gangster, apostle or agnostic. Freaks and free thinkers are accepted. Chance understands that those who are frightening are often frightened, too. He comes off as a guy who could find something in common with anyone but a high school principal. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Chance mixes nostalgia with a nasal tone as effectively as almost anyone since the Pharcyde. He’s only 20, but “Cocoa Butter Kisses” laments the days of bright-orange<i> Rugrats</i> cassettes and Chuck E. Cheese pizza. It could come off like sentimental back-in-the-day cliché, but there’s a street-smart edge that holds the cheesiness in check. He puts Visine in his eyes so his grandmother won’t know he’s high, acknowledges his addictions, and invites Twista to play the smoked-out, speed-rap, O.G. Jedi. </p>
<p>The guest spots mirror the funhouse characters you’d expect to meet on a memorable acid excursion. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> offers instant quotables on “NaNa”, sticking out his tongue, slicking back his hair like Rick Pitino, and peeling out in an El Camino with three Japanese lesbians. Ab-Soul plays the shadowy street pharmacist in the liquor store parking lot, opening up the trunk of his Dodge to offer grass, acid, and offside soccer metaphors. Chance’s Save Money crew partner, Vic Mensa and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Childish Gambino</a> act as effective co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Some ears won’t settle to Chance’s voice. It occasionally recalls an Animaniac playing the harmonica, a scat singer with a mean soft shoe routine, and/or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>. The latter is his most obvious immediate predecessor and clearly, Chance owes him a stylistic and conceptual debt down to the parental voicemail of “Everything’s Good (Good Ass Outro)”.</p>
<p>But Chance’s vocals are mostly modulated for effect not eccentricity. The cartoon squawk of first single “Juice” bears no resemblance to the mournful Caribbean Kaddish of “Acid Rain”. He leans on his hip-hop inspirations as homage. The intro and outro flip a Baptist hymn from an early Kanye mixtape track. The beat from A Tribe Called Quest’s “Sucka Nigga” is repurposed for “NaNa”. Slum Village’s “Fall in Love” serves as the base for “Everybody’s Something”. 2Pac gets rightful daps on “Juice”. While “Favorite Song” artfully nicks <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-2_kdVcyA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the sample</a> from Mary J. Blige and Biggie’s “Real Love” (Remix). </p>
<p>Even if the voice leaves you cold, you could be sold by the sheer sense of playfulness and love of language. Despite the weighty subtext, it’s often fun and life affirming. Chance stretches syllables to ToonTown lengths. He caroms them off each other like a pool hustler sinking trick shots. He’s a “tobacco-packing acrobat/packin’ bags back and forth with fifths of Jack.” You tend to get swept up in the youthful adrenaline rush like Lamar, mixtape Wayne, early Eminem, or Jay-Z in the ”22 Twos” era. To make sure he has his own spin, Chance stashes his own psychedelics and local slang (“thot,” “dino,” “hitters”).</p>
<p>If Lamar’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>good kid m.A.A.d city</i></a> stoked tension through plot cliffhangers, home invasions, and ominous minor chords, Chance’s <i>Acid Rap</i> is a triumph of meditative moments, open-ended quests, and brass flares. The hooks are more jabs than uppercuts. None will probably bang in a club, but most will make sense live, as chanted back by a thousand fans. </p>
<p>“<i>Everybody dies in the summer, wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it’s spring,” </i> </p>
<p>Chance sings this with funereal drone on the second half of “Pusha Man”. It’s the line that keeps sticking in my head when I play the record on loop. It’s a requiem for those already dead and a warning about the imminent carnage coming soon. It’s this fleeting spring afternoon where <i>Acid Rap</i> seems to take place-- the last day off before adulthood-- after you’ve realized your mortality, but before your fate has been sealed. When you aren’t sure if you’re supposed to say hello or goodbye. </p></div>"|18105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/|8.4|Jeff Weiss

His music is heady but always rooted in the body. Stetson uses circular breathing to produce an endless stream of notes in mode of classical minimalism, music that lulls the brain into a sort of reverie. But the unusual production for his solo records, placing microphones close to capture every nuance of sound (the clattering treble of keys, the bassy thump of the pads over the holes, the whoosh of breath, the moan of Stetson’s vocals through the horn), keeps the hypnotic repetition grounded in an intensely physical now. 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15166-new-history-of-warfare-vol-2-judges/"" target=""_blank""><i>New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges</i></a> was his breakthrough, an album that appealed to people who had very little time for experimental music that also managed to sound like nothing else. He’s been characteristically busy in the year since, playing solo shows and also touring as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>, whose leader Justin Vernon is featured prominently on the third part of this solo trilogy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though guest vocals on Stetson’s music add a welcome textural wrinkle, it seems like a challenge to figure out exactly how to integrate them. For one, when clear vocals are present, it tends to ground Stetson’s music in genre when it otherwise seems to float somewhere on its own, free of classification. On <i>Judges</i>, that meant the sound of theatrical classical with the calming cerebral articulation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Anderson</a>, cut with a studied take on blues from Shara Worden of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">My Brightest Diamond</a>. Vernon’s distinctive presence puts this record in a different light, driven home by the fact that opener “And in Truth” starts with a huge spread of his angelic harmonies. For a moment, you feel like you’ve wandered into the next Bon Iver record, and it's slightly disorienting. But the easily identifiable voice is used on four tracks to different ends, affirming Vernon’s ability to adapt his style to the project at hand.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most striking bit of shapeshifting comes on “Brute”, where Vernon assumes the Cookie Monster bark of a death metal frontman and turns out to be very good at it. Giving Stetson’s skill at conveying menace and the darkly churning low end of his work on the bigger horns, a metal lean to the music makes perfect sense and maybe even seems inevitable. “Brute” feels like the soundtrack to a child’s nightmare, and the fact that it sits so easily next to the subsequent “Among the Sef”, which feels like a triumphant, tightly appreciated fanfare celebrating everything that is good in the world, is a testament to all that Stetson can render from his instrument.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Indeed, <i>To See More Light</i> shows impressive range. In some respects, Stetson seems to have gravitated toward the extremes while leaving the minimalist tapestries in the background. At some points, like on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14864-high-above-a-grey-green-sea/"" target=""_blank"">High Above a Grey Green Sea</a>”, and “Part of Me Apart From You”, his tone is especially gnarled and biting and feels connected spiritually to the dark forces of heavy metal. But “And in Truth” and the multi-tracked Vernon guest vocal on the cover of the spiritual “What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?” are warm and human, more earthy folk than heady art music. The centerpiece that binds it all together is the 15-minute title track, which moans and swoons and moves between sections like a work of romantic classical music. It is perhaps Stetson’s most powerful single track, though it takes some serious focus to absorb in one sitting.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Heard as the closing chapter in Stetson’s trilogy, <i>To See More Ligh</i>t feels essentially like more: it’s more intense, more sprawling, both darker and lighter simultaneously. And in one sense, the record’s marked ambition can make it a harder listen as a whole, as it moves through moods and modes and seems constantly on the verge of burning itself out. But the album’s sequencing and the essential facts of its live, in-the-moment construction keep it flowing like a singular statement, at times just barely. None of which takes away from Stetson’s hugely impressive achievement: We’re here in 2013 and and he’s spinning out pieces in real-time using common instruments and the result is a sound that could come only from one person on earth.</p></div>"|17950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17950-colin-stetson-new-history-warfare-vol-3/|8.1|Mark Richardson

It's a lovely line, and its boastful, confident tone runs counter to Co La's practiced docility. This type of fake exotica-- the desire to displace yourself, but only gently so-- is Co La's M.O.. On <i>Moody Coup</i> he idles more purposefully than on his debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16080-co-la-weekend-repeater/"" target=""_blank"">Daydream Repeater</a>, </i>kneading his many samples into frothy, dubwise vignettes that tickle with recognition.</p>
<p>Co La burdened his debut with a lackadaisical approach to sampling, leaving recognizable snippets (the Supremes!) relatively untreated and then doubling down by looping them ad nauseum. <i>Moody Coup</i> represents a compositional step up, with Co La smoothing many of the seams that showed on <i>Repeater</i>. His samples are better hidden and the tracks, while plenty rhythmic, are no longer quite so stubborn. An infusion of sub-bass turns unassuming moments into a surprise rattle. Vocals from ex-Dirty Projector <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27671-deradoorian/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Deradoorian</a> mean that this album's melodies aren't entirely outsourced. The result is like a baby-shampoo version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>: lots of rustle and friction but nothing that would hurt your eyes.</p>
<p>This explains why <i>Moody Coup</i>, despite a wide range of sounds (reggae, barbershop, ambient, techno), spins so easily. Tracks such as ""Remarkable Features"" and ""Head in Hole in Space"" are summer storms: They come together quickly, make a little noise, and move on. This will sound like a backhanded compliment, but <i>Moody Coup</i> is an album that doesn't necessarily reward close listening, because <i>Moody Coup</i> is an album where the details don't necessarily matter that much. ""Baby's Breath"" stirs bongos, childrens' laughter, and what sounds like dripping water, but sussing out the ingredients isn't nearly as gratifying as letting the song's carbonation hiss and fizzle. On ""Make It Slay (Barbershop Solo)"" and ""Un"", Co La approaches the snap-and-crackle noir of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a> but filters out the dance DNA, leaving amiable puddles of sound.</p>

In this environment, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/830-the-coral/"" target=""_blank"">the Coral</a>’s slapdash retread of 60s freakbeat and organ-driven psych rock garnered an enthusiastic reception from critics and festival-goers alike, with sloppy but catchy singles like “Dreaming of You” and “In the Morning” bottling just enough youthful exuberance from the six Liverpudlians to cover up their limited musicianship. But while more interesting bands from the period have fallen by the wayside over the years, the Coral trundle on, releasing dulled retreads of the same record every couple of years that chart reasonably well but show little motivation on the band's part to break out of their narrow, retro frame of reference.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29833-bill-ryder-jones/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Ryder-Jones</a> became the first member to exit the group in 2008, the guitarist made an about turn from their sound, scoring a couple of low budget short films before cutting an accomplished solo debut. Pitched as a musical adaptation of Italian writer Italo Calvino’s 1979 novel <i>If on a Winters Night a Traveler</i>, 2011's <i>If... </i>was predominantly an instrumental effort, incorporating immense string sections courtesy of the Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra and complimented with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/574-jon-brion/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Brion</a>-like sonic flourishes. On centerpiece ""Enlace"", there was even a sizzling prog rock workout. As it turned out, the man credited as being key to sculpting the Coral’s slack orchestrations actually had ample creativity when left to his own devices.</p>
<p>Stripping away much of what made his previous record a gripping listen, Ryder-Jones takes a quieter approach on follow-up <i>A Bad Wind Blows in My Heart</i>, a set of pensive singer-songwriter ballads and hushed pop songs in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29463-alex-turner/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Turner</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15224-submarine-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Submarine</i></a> soundtrack, an EP on which Ryder-Jones played guitar. Taking his lead from director Richard Ayoade’s charming depiction of awkward adolescent angst, Turner’s wistful melodies and vibrant tales of a burgeoning teen romance were a dead-on accompaniment to the film’s quirky presentation. But despite recording in his boyhood bedroom and recruiting <i>Submarine</i> producer, Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford, to polish the set, Ryder-Jones' autobiographical anecdotes fail to bottle the same sentiment. His narratives wilt beneath tired imagery and stock similes like “There was something in the air that night,” (“Hanging Song”) and “It’s not over ‘til I say it’s over” (“Wild Swans”). If you think <i>A Bad Wind Blows in My Hear</i>t is a clumsy title, be prepared to sit through two whole tracks of the lyric being repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>What’s most disappointing about the album is how Ryder-Jones has almost completely abandoned taking any sonic risks. His vocal is dulled and rasping throughout, and the songs never blossom like those on <i>If</i>..., seemingly hamstrung by his limited range. It’s not an entire bust though. The acoustic plucks and clean melody of “By Morning I” recall early Belle and Sebastian, while the tender ode to childhood friendship “Anthony &amp; Owen” recalls <i>If..</i>.’s more sweeping arrangements, playing to Ryder-Jones’s strengths, which are not insignificant, if sadly underused here.</p></div>"|18073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18073-bill-ryder-jones-a-bad-wind-blows-in-my-heart/|5.2|Dean Van Nguyen

And now <i>Bloodlines</i> offers a verifiable general store of evil-- a heart spurting blood fashioned into flower blossoms, a vacant-eyed wolf snarling up at a naked woman with bleeding eyes, a skeleton wielding a spear against a background of oblivion. And in a catalog of less than two dozen total tunes, Howl have landed memorably frightening handles such as “And the Gnawing…”, “Gods in Broken Men”, “The Scorpion’s Last Sting”, and “Your Hell Begins”. You’re shuddering, right?</p>
<p><i>Bloodlines</i> is the band’s second LP for Relapse Records, and actually works hard not to repel with fright, despite its image, titles, and lyrics rife with dismemberment, boiled blood, and sin. In fact, its mix of stoner doom, mid-level thrash, and shout-along hooks wants desperately to be loved, for its bulging choruses about “kill[ing] the light” and being torn “limb from limb” to be recited with grim glee. But <i>Bloodlines</i>’ attempt to be liked comes across as the desperate pandering of a band that’s not really certain of what it wants to do anymore. At the start of their career, HOWL was a righteous doom band propelled by hardcore momentum; by the time they recorded <i>Full of Hell</i>, they’d galvanized that mixture into a savage, head-down bluster that suggested <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire </a>and was intoxicated with promise. <i>Bloodlines</i> shows traces of that, but the band’s roots are largely crowded out by the need to do a little bit of everything, to connect <i>en</i> <i>masse</i> in only 40 minutes. But the gambit doesn’t work, because, from end to end, HOWL now sounds like a band that’s just trying too hard.</p>
<p>Chris Harris, better known as Zeuss, produced <i>Bloodlines</i>. You might recognize his mononym from albums by God Forbid, Shadows Fall, Hatebreed, and Terror-- that is, slicker, faster stuff than that of HOWL’s past. It’s a harbinger of the trouble on <i>Bloodlines</i>, too, a technically accomplished album where you kind of wish the band would make a mistake. That, at least, would make them feel somewhat as dangerous as their image suggests. Instead, HOWL delivers songs with big, dumb refrains that feel rushed (“Midnight Eyes”), magpie messes that volley awkwardly between death metal and stoner rock (“With a Blade”), and flashy solos that propel the players and not the songs themselves (“Attrition”, whose intro reads like a statement of nascent professionalism). Frontman Vince Hausman screams the words to ""Demonic"" in his most malevolent brogue, but this is really just a middling, mid-tempo, metalcore slog. If this is intense as HOWL intended <i>Bloodlines</i> to get, they should have run the cover <a href=""http://www.lisafrank.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">through a Lisa Frank filter.</a></p>
<p>There are, of course, moments of genuine excitement during <i>Bloodlines</i>: The amplified blues riff at the start of “With a Blade” is a swiveling delight, and the rhythm section pounding from one end of “Demonic” to the other delivers an enthusiastic bruising. Many of the individual performances are excellent; drummer Timmy St. Amour, for instance, sounds inexhaustible. But the album’s only complete keeper, “Down So Low”, epitomizes the flaw of <i>Bloodlines</i> as a whole. Whirs of noise introduce the tune, which ultimately arrives at a half-time stomp where the drums are restless and the vocals (split here between Hausman and bassist Robert Icaza) are menacing. It manages to give HOWL’s low-slung doom progenitors an invigorating jolt, and the band hammers hard enough to sound like they’re truly enjoying themselves in the coda-- a rarity on a record that seems too measured and deliberate to allow for much real delight.</p></div>"|17892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17892-howl-bloodlines/|6.3|Grayson Currin

This could be seen as a part of a growing trend of bands pointing out how sick they are of looking out into a sea of smartphones rather than human faces (the Yeah Yeah Yeahs posted a similar missive at their recent New York homecoming show), but it felt more like an extension of Savages’ overall manifesto. And no, “manifesto” is not too dramatic a word; especially in contrast with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ sign, which tempered its message with chatty humor (“PUT THAT SHIT AWAY!...MUCH LOVE AND MANY THANKS!”), Savages’ fiery imperative read like something hammered onto a door. ""OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER BETTER WAYS OF LIVING AND EXPERIENCING MUSIC,” they wrote (caps theirs). “WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF PHONES DURING A GIG PREVENTS ALL OF US FROM TOTALLY IMMERSING OURSELVES."" Ironically, their ability to see the value of silence in a world of noise might make Savages the most web-savvy band of the year. People have been tweeting and tumbling about their live shows the way that people <i>used</i> to talk about live shows: something you just have to see for yourself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you've paid even the slightest attention to Savages in the year leading up to their debut<i> Silence Yourself</i>, you know that this is how they do things-- in fact, it's very likely you knew something about <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/savages/savages/542426782456690"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their philosophy</a> before you heard a note of their music. Whether you find it profoundly refreshing or a little tedious that Savages draw lines in the sand, none of this would be worth mentioning if the music didn’t live up to the force of the message. <i>Silence Yourself</i> proves that Savages are more than just talk. It's one of rock’s most commanding and ferociously poised debuts in recent years, the work of a band whose outsized confidence and sharp clarity of vision doesn’t correlate with the short amount of time it’s been together.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Savages' music feels out of step with current trends-- which I'm sure they'd take as a compliment. With its tumbling, tom-heavy percussion, singer <span> Jehnny Beth's</span> Siouxsie-summoning battle cries, and the compositional emphasis placed on Ayse Hassan’s bass (in the moments when Beth is silent, the bass feels like Savages’ lead singer), post-punk is <i>Silence Yourself</i>’s most obvious sonic reference point. And it doesn’t matter that they missed the post-punk revival by about a decade. While the bands that dominated indie rock in the early aughts looked to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"" target=""_blank"">Gang of Four</a> for reasons that had mostly to do with rhythm, Savages’ music finds kinship with post-punk’s oppositional politics, thematic darkness, and anxiety about the dehumanizing effects of technology-- the spirit is the same, but it’s been adjusted to reflect the times. Savages’ distaste for experiencing life through a screen comes from the same place as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>’s sardonic take on viewers whose idea of adventure was living vicariously through “the Lone Ranger”; after all, if <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nE8DFaxd94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Ex Lion Tamer”</span></a> were written today, it’d probably go, “Stay glued to your iPhone.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Which is not to say that Savages are writing scathing songs about shitty service providers; their lyrics are boldly stark, elemental, and timeless. (The titles alone hit with a blunt force: “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15140-savages-she-will/"" target=""_blank"">She Will</a>”, “Hit Me”, “No Face”, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15317-shut-up/"" target=""_blank"">Shut Up</a>.”) Beth has said that the band’s writing process is less about addition than subtraction, paring each song down to its most essential shape. All of the best songs on <i>Silence Yourself</i> derive their power from this kind of focused intensity, from the driving, dissonant “City’s Full” to the creeping, percussive lurch of “I Am Here”. The chorus of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13631-husbands/"" target=""_blank"">Husbands</a>”, a phenomenal single first released last year, sharpens that focus down to a single word. “I woke up and saw the face of a guy/ I don’t know who he is,” Beth sings in the song’s paranoia-inducing opening moments. A Savages song is about challenging the ideas, words and desires we consider “normal”, and they’ve found that repetition is an effective way to get that point across. “Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands,” Beth chants in a manic whisper; with each intonation, the meaning erodes from a word that’s ostensibly meant to evoke comfort, protection and familiarity until it feels faceless. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Savages really show promise and range on the slow-burners. The moody dirge ""Waiting for a Sign"" and goth-cabaret closer ""Marshall Dear"" aren't the most immediate songs on the record, but over repeated listens, they bloom. If Hassan and Faye Milton's punishing rhythm section takes the helm on the more frantic numbers, Savages' downtempo moments allow Gemma Thompson and her scuzzy Fender to shine. On the excellent ""Strife,"" she holds back as often as she strikes, underscoring Beth's most brutal lines with perfectly timed jolts and filling the song's winding corriders with thick plumes of distortion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The mix allows each band member’s contribution to smolder with equal intensity and lends a palpable physicality to Savages’ sound. Milton handles her toms and bass drum like a boxer going at a punching bag; Hassan’s bass strings pulsate like a throbbing tendons; Thompson’s guitar cuts with a goosebump-inducing tone that recalls a chainsaw, and Beth shrieks like she’s resetting her own bones. Combining in a constant pendulum swing between tension and release, it all provides the perfect atmosphere for the darkly sensual themes that </span><i>Silence Yourself </i><span>explores. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As a lyricist, Beth says she’s inspired by the “awkward places” from which “twisted, original desires” spring. “Hit Me”, a sub-two-minute tornado of squalling noise, isn’t about domestic abuse, as some people assume, but is instead about a consensual encounter described by the porn star Belladonna. (Beth: “I hate it when women are turned into victims.”) Savages might make political pronouncements in interviews and on album covers, but their songs come from a lived-in perspective as Beth inhabits her different characters’ states of mind-- and forces the listener to do the same.</span></p>
<p>""How old are you, really?"" a voice asks in the opening seconds of the album; it hovers in the air without an answer. It might be a knowing sneer at critics who think Savages are just recycling post-punk’s signature sound, but ostensibly it’s also a salute to an artistic kindred spirit. The line is from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079672/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Opening Night</i></a>, a 1977 movie by John Cassavetes-- a filmmaker who also saw a kind of beauty in emotional brutality and was prone to spouting off humanist manifestos. “My films are expressive of a culture that has had the possibility of attaining material fulfillment while at the same time finding itself unable to accomplish the simple business of conducting human lives,” he said. “What is needed is reassurance in human emotions; a re-evaluation of our emotional capacities.” Substitute “films” for “songs” and those words could almost be lifted off the cover of <i>Silence Yourself</i>. The album cuts through a world of chatter and distraction because it practices what it preaches, transmitting its message directly through the primal, bone-rattling force of its songs.</p></div>"|17977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17977-savages-silence-yourself/|8.7|Lindsay Zoladz

<p class=""p1"">His first high-profile job was as an arranger from songs from Disney's <i>The Jungle Book</i>, and almost nothing about his essential style has changed since. A Van Dyke Parks song is fussy, dense, and well-mannered but has a flair for mischief. It is simple in rhythm but complex in harmony. It is preferential to funny noises. It is deeply American-- like banjos on the porch American-- and yet like all good American things is preoccupied by what it finds exotic, whether it's Trinidadian Calypso or mid-period French Romanticism. It can be broken down into a million pieces and subjected to intense ethnomusicological analysis. The best of them also happen to be easy and satisfying to whistle.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Songs Cycled</i> collects six 7"" singles he has released over the past few years through his own label, Bananastan. ""Bananastan"" is a very Parksian construction: A fictional foreign country named after something people eat for breakfast. (It's out now on Bella Union in the UK and in July in the US.) Like all his albums, it's cheerful and maddeningly detailed. At times it can feel like musical theater minus the stage, or like a tiny jewelry box, beautiful to behold but too small to actually put anything in. Its songs reflect dryly on corporate greed and joyfully on a woman named Sassafras, whose kisses are so hot she turns swimming holes to steam. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A lot of what's here has appeared before, elsewhere and in different forms. ""The All Golden"" was on his 1968 debut <i>Song Cycle</i>; ""Hold Back Time"" was on his 1995 collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a>, <i>Orange Crate Art</i>. ""Aquarium"" is actually a 1971 recording of the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, performing Parks's arrangement of a section from Camille Saint-Saëns's <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And then there’s the traditional music that belongs to nobody. ""Amazing Grace"" appears briefly, as does the indestructible hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"". ""The Parting Hand"" is a song traditionally sung in Sacred Harp meetings, a type of unaccompanied choral music known for its clear, bellowing sound. When they appear they appear more as quotes than centerpieces; small towns seen from trains. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It makes sense that Parks retreads older material: He is one of those rare artists who seems to have come out fully formed, with a clear, narrow and diamond-hard vision of what he wanted his music to be. Listening to his discography can be like listening to a manic, brilliant person try and explain the same idea to you over and over again from slightly different perspectives, flapping their hands excitedly, sulking when you confess you still don't quite get it, then waving it all away with yet another joke you won't understand until three hours later. </p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the ironies of Parks's music is that there's so much going on that it can be hard to figure out what to pay attention to. He rarely sticks to a single theme or emotion. (""Busy"" is not an emotion.) He is fluent in simple folksy languages but has a compulsion about speaking in any fewer than five of them at once. Rich, dense moments worthy of human attention fly by one after the other, like a wall where pictures are hung frame-to-frame. </p>
<p class=""p1"">At best <i>Songs Cycled</i> deals in quick-pivot moments: the stark, unified sound of the choir on ""The Parting Hand"" giving way to a misty string section, or Parks's wiry voice snapping out of the confusion of ""Wall Street"" with a line like ""There is just nothing but ash in the air/ Confetti all colored with blood."" What these moments do-- especially in the context of music so dense and restless-- is frame Parks's range. In an instant, he reminds you of the extremes he's capable of: Cynicism and tenderness; clear lyricism and manic density; buttoned-up orchestras and dressed-down steel bands. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I often think I would like his music more if it were simpler and more direct. Clearly he's capable of it. (I've always liked 1972's <i>Discover America </i>best partially beacuse it allows me to imagine Parks as a cruise-ship entertainment director, but more because it just isn't as cluttered as some of his other albums.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">But his stubbornness is part of who he is. ""I guess I am like that rusty nail that sticks out, just waiting to be hammered down by an intolerant bastard,"" he wrote this year. In 1968, at the hight of blues-derived psychedelic rock, he released <i>Song Cycle,</i> an album essentially rejecting all music made after 1940. Under his suspenders and little straw hats, Van Dyke Parks is often crafting some highly refined iteration of the sentiment <i>fuck y'all. </i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Ultimately, he's an artist whose shortcomings are all products of his ambition. There are worse places to be. Some artists run out of ideas; Parks seems to constantly have three more than the typical cognitive load of the human brain allows.</p>
<p class=""p1"">His albums don't capture lightning in a bottle, they exist as documents of all the effort he put into them. In the end it's that effort-- that joyful, obssessive effort of the solitary man tinkering in his study from sunup to sundown again-- that makes him sympathetic. ""Lest I get ahead of you,"" he wrote in 2011. ""My heart will be in the work."" Not ""art,"" not ""expression,"" but work: that thing we all have to do but only at our best seem to enjoy doing. ""Work"" is-- and has always been-- Parks's forte. If he misses the forest for the trees it's only because he's having too much fun sculpting the ridges on each beautiful inch of bark.</p>

But unlike Hollywood biopics, which strike Oscar gold almost annually, bio-albums are few and far between.</p>
<p>If anyone can popularize the bio-album concept, it should be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3657-gruff-rhys/"" target=""_blank"">Gruff Rhys</a> and Bryan Hollon. Whether solo or as frontman for long-running Welsh psych-pop anarchists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3993-super-furry-animals/"" target=""_blank"">Super Furry Animals</a>, Rhys has always had a knack for communicating lofty ideas with sly wit, warm feeling, and memorably inventive settings.

<p>Though that Mercury Music Prize-nominated full-length was inspired by the life of automaker John DeLorean, in a sense Neon Neon's second effort represents their first true bio-album. The silvery, retro-futurist excess of the greed-is-good decade pervaded <i>Stainless Style</i>, and lyrical references to the engineer playboy's life were certainly present, but the record was stuffed with great songs that humanized 80s-retro clichés whether or not you knew there was a story attached. <i>Praxis Makes Perfect</i>'s songs never quite hit the highs of its predecessor's best tracks, but it's a more coherent album, and still strangely rewarding in its own way. It's just impossible to separate from its subject.</p>
<p>That subject is Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, a wealthy Italian scion turned left-wing political activist and publisher. He smuggled Boris Pasternak's <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> out of Soviet Russia, published books banned as obscene in Italy-- including Henry Miller's <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>-- and played basketball with Fidel Castro in 1960s Cuba. You know that famous image of Che Guevara? Feltrinelli acquired and popularized it. He died, under disputed circumstances, near Milan in 1972, where authorities said he accidentally blew himself up in an act of leftism terrorism against the capitalist structure.</p>
<p>Feltrinelli's story, in other words, is as weird and fascinating in its own way as DeLorean's, full of unlikely contradictions that make it ripe for dramatization. What's all the more intriguing is that Neon Neon choose to tell the story not with the musical styles of Feltrinelli's own lifetime, but with much the same deceptively plasticized synth pop as on <i>Stainless Style</i>. It's as if we're experiencing Feltrinelli's life through the lens of his ultimate failure-- from the perspective of a world where revolutionary idealism had given way to the start of corporate consumer capitalism as we now know it. Imagine if ""Mad Men"" had Debbie Gibson on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>The anachronism is delicious, and when Neon Neon succeed in wedding their high-minded tale to wryly tacky throwback pop, the juxtapositions can be similarly satisfying. ""Dr. Zhivago"" has a chorus so soaring it should get the name Pasternak stuck your head even if you can't pronounce it. ""Mid Century Modern Nightmare"" is another highlight, making rhyming ""bourgeoisie"" with ""tea"" sound not only natural but desirable amid its peppy new-wave clatter. Shuffling first <a href=""http://vimeo.com/65062965"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video selection</a> ""Hammer &amp; Sickle"" offers one more unshakable refrain, this time about ""the winner, the loser, and the middle man.""</p>
<p>Sometimes the audacious lengths to which Neon Neon carry their outlandish conceit lifts up songs that might otherwise fall flat. Those unfamiliar with the full details of Feltrinelli's life story might not fully understand how consumerist ode ""Shopping (I Like To)""-- frosty synth-pop that melodically hints at Hall and Oates' ""Maneater""-- fits in. But the fact that Rhys and Hollon have roped in a husky guest vocal from Italian model-singer Sabrina Salerno, who scored a campy 80s Europop hit with ""Boys (Summertime Love)"", is a master stroke of grinning cheekiness. Elsewhere, the actress Asia Argento, daughter of Italian horror director Dario Argento, gives voice to quotes from Feltrinelli himself, ensuring for better or worse that unlike on <i>Stainless Style</i>, here our hero is rarely far from mind.</p>
<p>It's telling, though, that Neon Neon, along with National Theatre Wales, have put together an ""immersive theatrical experience"" based on the album. The record alone makes for the latest solid effort from these two outsize talents, but the stage show ought to be the ideal way to enjoy it. When the songs drag, as they do here toward the end, on tracks like horn-bleating ""Listen to the Rainbow"", they should still be effective as a soundtrack to a visual performance. Rhys, in particular, has a way with high-concept gigs: He billed his off-the-wall 2010 solo tour as a quest to follow in the footsteps of an 18th-century Welsh explorer who searched America for a mythical tribe of Welsh-speaking Native Americans. And after all, if the Marxist notion of ""praxis"" had to do with turning philosophy into action, then a live show based on <i>Praxis</i> should make its cheerful Reagonomics-chic radicalism truly-- sorry, but Rhys does loves his puns-- perfect. The bio-album, sadly, might still be an idea whose time has not yet come.</p></div>"|17932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17932-neon-neon-praxis-makes-perfect/|7.0|Marc Hogan

That allows us to engage with it more, too, because it’s so repetitive,” Kelly said, explaining the oblong and unordinary structures of the four massive songs on <i>Mammal</i>, the band’s second LP. “We just let it grow.” Kelly also called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bitches Brew</i></a> the most inspirational music he’d ever heard, compared Arvo Pärt to Emperor, mentioned his excellent muted dance productions under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30767-wife/"" target=""_blank"">Wife</a>, and called jazz “fire from the soul.”</p>
<p>Kelly’s references and enthusiasms did not adhere at all to any metal-dude stereotypes, and to an extent, that’s long been the fount of intrigue at the center of Altar of Plague’s music. Their post-metal, if one must call it that, took unexpected turns, with moments of ruthless industrial slink or minimal improvisations that turned suddenly to mournful throat signing embedded within more standard forms of aggression. They could roar, too, working themselves into sustained roils that gave any accusations of hipster or dilettante metal a direct and devastating gut punch.</p>
<p><i>Teethed Glory and Injury</i>, the third LP from Altar of Plagues, is again intended to do exactly that but in a much different way than before. “I just found that the type of black metal we were being associated with was not exciting to me anymore,” Kelly <a href=""http://www.terrorizer.com/2013/01/09/altar-of-plagues-studio-report/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>Terrorizer</i></a> in an in-studio interview earlier this year. “What a few years ago was a very exciting and promising template for a genre … has also just been watered down.” Both <i>Mammal</i> and 2009’s <i>White Tomb</i> comprised just four tracks each, with the shortest pushing past the eight-minute mark. But Altar of Plagues pushes the action back toward the center of the song on <i>Teethed Glory</i>, a nine-piece set that favors a more immediate four-to-five minute range. This is a dense and demanding record, where fragments of black metal slam into shards of industrial throb, where sheets of noise work alongside diaphanous electronics. Moments suggest the heyday of Touch and Go Records and, alternately, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> in Trent Reznor’s commanding prime or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> at their vitriolic apex. Several electronic impasses are as dense as those of Altar of Plague cohorts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"" target=""_blank"">the Haxan Cloak</a>, while others could pass as tinted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> fragments.  </p>
<p>If that matrix of touchstones sounds intriguing, it often is; indeed, with <i>Teethed Glory and Injury</i>, Kelly’s reputation as an avid and eclectic listener feels fully represented by the music his band makes. However, the other alluring aspect of Altar of Plague’s music-- the jazz-like ease with which it was made and, consequently, unfolded-- has almost altogether disappeared. Every moment of <i>Teethed Glory</i> feels like a deliberate plot point, built to fly squarely in the face of any expectations for this brand of aggrandized heaviness. The omission of that free-and-easy mentality isn’t a problem because of the songs’ relative brevity; rather, the pieces within <i>Teethed Glory</i> often feel forced together, coerced into collisions that don’t meld the components so much as stack them side by side.</p>
<p>Altar of Plagues overthinks and overstuffs here, creating a gauntlet that defaces its own delight. “Burnt Year”, for instance, opens with an almost phosphorescent surge of distorted guitar and bass thrum, funneling into a belligerent, howl-along march that suggests the work of Ministry. By song’s end, Altar of Plagues has ripped through an atavistic black metal sprint, dipped into dreamy moments of rest and ultimately arrived at an instrumental surge that suggests the rocky peaks of Pelican. On “A Body Shrouded”, Altar of Plagues' seesaw between post-punk simmer and doom-like pounce adulterates both aspects. Individually, they’re interesting, but taken together, they simply feel claustrophobic. It’s a problem that hounds most of <i>Teethed Glory</i>, a string of compelling parts that does not compel as a whole</p>
<p>The album’s most successful songs are also its most fully synthesized: “Twelve was Ruin”, for instance, pairs Kelly’s blossoming electronic touch to Altar of Plagues' previous sense of sprawl and current sense of attack. It builds through icy keyboards and scythe-shaped guitars, culminating in a coda that’s urgent and intricate, two qualities that often combat one another throughout <i>Teethed Glory</i>. And the record’s first single, “God Alone”, is written so well that its most brutal stretches dovetail perfectly with its more delicate moments. It all cascades into a chorus that sounds as soft as Alcest but as savage as Immortal.</p>
<p>Though <i>Teethed Glory and Injury</i> doesn’t deliver the systemic and singular rupture Kelly and his band might have intended, it should not diminish the excitement for Altar of Plagues’ revolutionary compulsion. If anything, the trio have proven here that they’re driven only by the need to subvert and shock, to weld rather traditional ideas into strange new hybrids. The possibilities that <i>Teethed Glory and Injury</i> present are more interesting than the album itself--and, really, more interesting than the possibilities presented by any Altar of Plagues music to date. Maybe next time, they’ll write themselves into reality.</p></div>"|17854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17854-altar-of-plagues-teethed-glory-and-injury/|6.8|Grayson Currin

There's a reason for the enigmatic Detroit producer's tough love: to keep us sharp, to beat into our heads that we're a bunch of namby-pambies falling for the same old soulless bullshit. Omar's testy, industry-averse persona has always been at odds with his genre's M.O., which is basically to play nice with others both musically and otherwise-- call him a pioneer in the harumph-house movement. His fourth proper album, <i>Thank You for Letting Me Be Myself</i> is a love letter to a few things Omar pretends not to care about: his fans, his hometown, and house music.</p>
<p>On 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15821-it-can-be-done-but-only-i-can-do-it/"" target=""_blank""><i>It Can Be Done But Only I Can Do It</i></a>, Omar unleashed the biggest hit of his career in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMEy4IFzsFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Here's Your Trance Now Dance""</a>, 10 minutes of find-your-core, light-bright synthesizers more anthemic-- or maybe just happier-- than anything else in Omar's catalog. It wasn't all love, though, as <i>It Can Be Done</i> also featured a track of continuously sampled hardcore pornography that is not to be spun if you share a wall with neighbors. <i>Thank You</i> learns from ""Trance""'s success, berating us with kindness, offering wistful, major-key tracks out of step with Omar's reputation for hissy lo-fi concoctions.</p>
<p>It feels like a change in direction for an artist whose blocky, proto-house compositions resembled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> as often as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22184-derrick-carter/"" target=""_blank"">Derrick Carter</a>, and parts of <i>Thank You</i> feel like homages to classic house tropes. ""The Shit Baby"" features a deft, familiar piano solo. ""Rewind"" is salty, low-overhead R&amp;B. ""Air of the Day"" unfurls slowly, spreading slowly evolving pads over a hearty bassline and ratcheting up a level with staccato synth blasts in its final minute. The album's title rings true because Omar is an artist for whom fans <i>do</i> suffer inconvenience-- namely poor distribution and limited runs.</p>
<p>Instances of Omar's crankiness come off as mere window dressing or, better yet, good-natured fun. Omar peppers the album with snippets of chiding dialogue; upon the announcement of <i>Thank You</i> when asked about cover art, he <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=19078"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">replied</a> ""Only a momma's boy cares about artwork!!"" The resulting art-- of Omar nonchalantly kneeling (above), then <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=4402935"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">standing next to a Corvette</a>-- does not rule out the possibility that he'd simply forgotten he needed album art. If you still need proof of Omar's softening, though, look no further than closer ""Its Money in the D"" [sic] (""The D"" being local slang for Detroit), eight minutes of sun-spackled funk and stoned electric piano that drift aimlessly upward. For a few minutes the fact that it is certainly not ""money in the D"" matters little, and the track cements <i>Thank You</i> as an enjoyable, begrudging concession: feel-good music from a feel-bad guy.</p></div>"|17987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17987-omar-s-thank-you-for-letting-me-be-myself/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

""Have you ever read Morrissey's description of the Ramones?,"" he <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/deerhunter-really-really-dislike-morrissey-and-the-smiths"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked</a> Buzzfeed. ""<span>I will always be on Team Joey, and Team Dee Dee. </span>I come from America, where Bo Diddley was born!"" While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>'s always had a thing for indie rock advocacy, Cox's pointed patriotism was a new kind of stump speech, and in light of <i>Monomania, </i>his typically hilarious candor doubled as media savvy. On Deerhunter’s fifth album, they almost completely jettison the dreamy ambience that tempered even their noisiest work for straight-up raw, bleeding garage rock and populate these songs with junkyards, leather jackets, and motorcycles. The message from Deerhunter: We’re an American band.</p>
<p>So adjust your expectations accordingly, and if this sounds like the protracted playacting usually associated with Cox's work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Atlas Sound</a>, you’re on the right track. The stable democracy of the past few Deerhunter albums has been upended; Josh Fauver left the band, and besides writing most of “Nothing Ever Happened”, his basslines kept Deerhunter rooted in proper rock. Meanwhile, after increasingly proving himself to be a top-notch songwriter in his own right, Lockett Pundt took advantage of a rare year in which Cox released no new music by dropping the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16432-lotus-plaza-spooky-action-at-a-distance/"" target=""_blank""><i>Spooky Action At A Distance </i></a>as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22753-lotus-plaza/"" target=""_blank"">Lotus Plaza</a> in 2012. His sole contribution on <i>Monomania </i>is “The Missing”, a fine piece of wistful, ringing indie pop that gets placed between “Leather Jacket II” and “Pensacola”, the album’s raunchiest songs. It could easily be seen as Cox defending his turf, if not for a hazy, meditative stretch during the middle of <i>Monomania </i>that sounds like his take on Lotus Plaza.</p>
<p>But while the songwriting power has become centralized, <i>Monomania </i>as a whole represents Deerhunter’s attempt to get outside themselves. This is particularly true of Cox; whereas on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9824-cryptograms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cryptograms</i></a>’ “Hazel St.”, he imagined what it might be like to fit in with the normal kids during his childhood in Georgia, years later, this dynamic is fully inverted and he’s found a group of outcasts that’s emboldened in their idiosyncratic embrace of a Dixie upbringing. You can hear the influence of neighbors/collaborators <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Black Lips</a> in dirtbag storytelling like “Pensacola”, or just in the plain fact that <i>Monomania </i>is the first Deerhunter album that would be welcomed in a dive bar. Their previous physicality was defined by coiled intensity and quick strikes, whereas here they swagger and flex beer muscles. The perverted classic rawk riffs of “Neon Junkyard” and “Leather Jacket II” twist and yowl while “Back to the Middle” and “Dream Captain” are so immediately accessible, they could somehow come off as beneath Deerhunter.</p>
<p>The more prevalent inspiration comes from fellow Athenian and mentor Michael Stipe; you can hear echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>’s <i>Monster </i>in both the obscene distortion and the decision to follow up their richest, most rococo record with a defiant squall. Cox similarly plays against his reputation given the opportunity, using winks and irony to deviate from the impression that his band’s music is somewhat humorless and sexless. It’s every bit as confrontational as Deerhunter in their dress-wearing, blog-attacking days, only more fun. This can manifest in the glammy stream-of-consciousness from <i>Monomania’</i>s opening duo (“I am the Queen of Bass,” he announces on “Leather Jacket II”), or any of the first-person narratives that make good on his purported Hank Williams and Bo Diddley listening. Taking as many liberties with “Werewolves of London” as Kid Rock, “Dream Captain” might come off as puerile southern comfort if it wasn’t such an obvious defilement of it-- bratty boasts like “I’m a boy, man/ And you’re a man, man” are tough to hear as anything other than comedy. Likewise, on “Pensacola”, an unfaithful woman leaves a Greyhound-riding somebody who is clearly not Bradford Cox with “a bald head and trouble.” Is it unfair that Deerhunter can get away with these because they’re Deerhunter, whereas it’s pure shlock from any number of southern rock revivalists? Perhaps, but having a laugh at one's own expense is hardly the most egregious form of an earned indulgence.</p>
<p>But while <i>Monomania </i>as a whole is an unpredictable fulfillment of an unforeseen whim, it’s Deerhunter’s least revelatory and surprising album on a song-by-song basis. There isn’t a clear showstopper along the lines of “Helicopter” or “Nothing Ever Happened”, though the title track makes an admirable effort. They’ve always had a knack for mantras, and after a verse of plaintive gospel shouts (“Come on God, hear my sick prayer/ If you can’t, send me an angel!”), the nagging phonetics of “mono, monomania” get repeated ad infinitum before dissolving into white noise, motorcycle revving, and a soap opera device that Deerhunter makes frequent use of: after all this time, Cox unexpectedly wakes up.</p>
<p>“I was a dream of myself,” Cox admits during “Nitebike”, a startling confessional of nothing more than his reverbed vocals and acoustic guitar. Perhaps taking another step back towards the medical maladies that pervaded both his youth and early Deerhunter, he imagines himself on his Big Wheels, “On the cusp of a breakthrough/ When they took me out/ And stuck it in/ It went <i>so deep, man.</i>” Another line gets repeated in greater detail on the Baudelaire-referencing closer “Punk (La Vie Antérieure)”, where Cox muses, “For a year, I was queer/ I had conquered all my fears/ Not alone anymore/ But I found it such a bore.” It feels something like Cox’s “All Apologies”, a litany of wearied, bemused dissatisfaction with everything that he presumed might save him-- getting drunk, being punk, friends, lovers. The plainspoken finality of “Punk” suggests it’s not just a closure on <i>Monomania</i>, but of everything that preceded it.</p>
<p>And that could be disappointing for a lot of people since <i>Monomania </i>is the first Deerhunter record that isn’t a quantifiable leap from what came before; the narrative and artistic arc that ran from <i>Cryptograms<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9824-cryptograms/"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Halcyon Digest </i></a>was clear and upward, their diametrically opposed centrist indie songwriting and diffuse, noisy ambience eventually converging into a brilliant horizon point. While a knocked-out, “back to basics” approach makes a lot sense as the follow-up to <i>Halcyon Digest, </i>it adheres to someone else’s idea of “basics” and follows the longest break between Deerhunter albums. But <i>Monomania </i>is certainly a strong effort on its own merits, and more importantly, they’ve avoided making their deflating “diminishing returns” record-- their <i>King of Limbs, Centipede Hz, Transference, Sky Blue Sky, </i>etc.-- that casts doubts about whether they’ve gone too far down the same path. They’ve pulled off something admirable in making an illogical left turn feel like the logical next step where one didn’t exist. For the first time since <i>Cryptograms, </i>Deerhunter’s next move will be harder to predict than Cox’s.</p></div>"|17966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17966-deerhunter-monomania/|8.3|Ian Cohen

""I guess he doesn't have a gun,"" a tiny voice chirps giddily on what sounds like a cassette player recording. ""Do you think he has a gun? Yes! He shot himself! We're listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> and, as you know, Kurt Cobain... POW!"" The voice belongs to Alex Levine, bassist for New York punk omnivores the So So Glos, kicking off their heart-racingly enjoyable new album <i>Blowout</i>. The snippet was recorded when Levine was seven, at the start of an abrupt and confusing changing of the guard in rock. In the wake of Cobain's suicide, alternative music started looking much different than it had before, as punk got poppier and alt-rock proper got angrier. For twentysomethings making music today, this once maligned schism now feels whole, with likeminded bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a> subtly paying their dues to the Hollands, Hoppuses, and Armstrongs (Tim and Billie Joe) of their youths. The So So Glos are also a proud result of this divide, where disaffection still lingers but never interferes with having fun.</p>
<p>The So So Glos have zero interest in being sedated. On ""Xanax"", with its festive sha-la-las, sleigh bells, and cowpunk flourishes, frontman Alex Levine warns that ""they just wanna dumb you down like I did."" (Rounding the band out are Alex and Ryan's step-brother Zach Staggers on drums and childhood friend Matt Elkin on guitar.) The So So Glos are clever without being cheeky, sincere without being preachy, self-aware but never too in on their own joke. Still, their most endearing trait is a simple one: They make murderously catchy, endorphin-boosting, shout-along guitar music with vigor and zeal, breaking in their Doc Martens with a mid-song skank on the title track and goofing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Strokes</a>-y cool on ""Speakeasy"". Thanks to their DIY background, the 12 songs on <i>Blowout</i> foster an immediate sense of community, with love and enthusiasm pumping fiercely at the heart of these songs. If you've spent any time over the past few years at NYC venues like Shea Stadium or the Market Hotel (both of which the band helped co-found), there's a good chance you've not only caught a So So Glos set, but felt that same energy.</p>
<p><i>Blowout</i> isn't trying to break any molds, but distinguishes itself with thoughtful genre cherry-picking and a more inclusive spin on their contemporaries' established efforts. You can find hat-tips to forebears like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gun_Club"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Gun Club</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">the Replacements</a> (and note the Joe Strummer vocal inflections on the bittersweet ""Island Ridin'"") as well as bands that most pre-pubescent punks would have idolized when the Glos were coming up (""Wrecking Ball"" sounds like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancid_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rancid</a> all juiced up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">the Beastie Boys</a>). But as far as the current landscape is concerned, the So So Glos have a broader focus. Poking fun at American privilege is pretty standard for a band in their sphere (""Son of an American""), but the Glos come off less fussy and indignant than their friends <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a> (they even do a spot-on TA imitation with ""All of the Time""). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Parquet Courts</a> feel like spiritual cousins, though SSGs are considerably less stoned and way more caffeinated. Almost every song has some sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>-styled oh-oh-oh! chant-along, often more pop-conscious but equally as satisfying.</p>
<p>Full of great hooks, anthemic energy and personality to spare, the Glos are able to etch out their own space thanks to these adventurous songs (the one-two gut-punch of the melancholy-laced ""Lost Weekend"" and ""Xanax"" are both easy highlights). ""I’ll be a buzz bin fly just living to die,"" Alex Levine sings on the aptly titled ""Everything Revival"", ""and I don't wanna be the guy to sat whatever, never mind."" So the So Glos know where they came from, but have the confidence to continue to do things their own way. Turns out it's been a nearly lifelong way of thinking for the band: Hang around after the record's over for a hidden track called ""Let's Rock 'Til We Die"", written and performed by the same seven-year olds we met earlier trying to unpack <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabnZ9-ex7o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Come As You Are""</a>. The song is loud, it's to the point, and it's charming as all hell. Not a lot has changed.</p></div>"|17953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17953-blowout/|7.6|Zach Kelly

We're now a little more than three years removed from Waka's infamous <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632570/waka-flocka-flame-im-not-into-being-lyrical.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm not into being lyrical"" comments</a>, and about two and a half on from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"">Flockaveli</a></i>, a willfully boneheaded album approaching classic status these days. Talib Kweli, then, isn't cut out for these times. Songs like 1998's ""Definition"" and 2002's ""Get By"" still deserve all the adulation they inspire, but there's a reason the 37-year-old founding father of conscious-rap is now acknowledging his own antiquity. So when third song “Turnt Up” shows up on Kweli’s fifth solo album, it's probably right to perceive it as an allegorical jailbreak.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And, unfortunately if predictably, “Turnt Up” marks the beginning of <i>Prisoner</i>’s issues. The song knows what it wants to be but doesn’t have the wherewithal to be it. Its piano-lined, uppercutting pop aims for the radio, but, not even factoring in the club-unfriendliness of Kweli’s nose-pinched delivery, I just can’t imagine it fitting in next to “Fuckin’ Problems” or “Bugatti”. The track might be the only flail at relevancy here, but when guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a> show up-- the former laying down one of his best guest verses of late on “Push Thru”, the latter as seductive as ever with his suitably come-hither-y hook for “Come Here”-- their appearances scan as misguided attempts at lending the album a vaguely populist hue. For a record that doesn’t have a binding identity in the first place, that’s a regrettably fragmenting problem.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As great as the jutting, soul-sampling production of 2002’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4549-quality/"" target=""_blank""><i>Quality</i></a> was, Kweli’s saving grace has always been his well-intentioned lyricism, not his taste in beats. But <i>Prisoner</i> is marred by weak analogies (“colder than Minnesota,” “buzz like <a href=""http://hoopniks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GeorgiaTech.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Georgia Tech</a>) and Kweli’s bumpy writerliness (“ornithology” and “onomatopoeia” are just two less-than-melodious words used here), leading this to be his most underwhelming record yet word-for-word. And for every few lines that actually do stand up to some of Kweli’s smarter work (“Black Moses when the mic is on/ That’s why these rappers scatter like roaches when the light is on”), there’s a half-cocked concept, like this one from “Hamster Wheel”: “How she runnin’ the streets but still standin’ still/ She needa get up off the hamster wheel.” </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Listening to <i>Prisoner</i> next to something like the new Chance the Rapper tape reveals the record’s biggest, most pervasive dilemma. Where <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Chance-The-Rapper-Acid-Rap-mixtape.483826.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Acid Rap</a></i> is a seamless convergence of local  and post-regional sounds, <i>Prisoner</i> takes on a bunch of things one by one without squeezing the most from any of them. Kweli’s absolutely owned his lane when he’s been committed to it but now he's jumping around from style to style with no destination in sight. </p></div>"|17943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17943-talib-kweli-prisoner-of-conscious/|6.1|Mike Madden

They’ve issued a steady stream of splits and collaborations, singles and short-run discs, but their most prominent public moment arrived in 2010 with the masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i></a>. With an all-female choir and sinister samples, the Body applied a seasick sense of motion to truly corrupted misanthropy, with impenetrable distortion piled onto the band’s lurching and jerking spans. In the interim, <span>they’ve paired with post-metal troupe Braveyoung</span> on the stage and in the studio, grown into a trio and occasionally a quartet, pared back to duo form, and moved from Providence, RI, to their current base of Portland, OR. The time spent in flux seems to have only galvanized the Body’s central focus-- that is, to sound completely terrifying, in an Armageddon-with-a-view, end-of-everything manner.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Master, We Perish</i>­ is the new three-song, 18-minute EP from the Body. It lashes at perceived and much-debated divisions between metal and noise so hard and so fast that its tremendous squall and anthemic structures might actually be the sound of those fortified seams splintering. <i>Master, We Perish</i> not only finds the Body at its most punishing and paralyzing but also at its most diverse, a marvel considering the length. Opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15216-the-body-ebb-and-flow-of-tides-in-a-sea-of-ash/"" target=""_blank"">The Ebb and Flow of Tides in a Sea of Ash</a>” does its monumental damage in less than three minutes, with air raid sirens invoking a tide of guitar static and cymbal smashes that make you consider finding shelter, even if you’re only wearing headphones.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the song’s back half, King’s six-string upheaval shifts into piercing, sustained tones, while Buford now rumbles through the rest the kit, favoring body blows to eardrum lashes. But the Body somehow embeds a hook into all of this, meaning that you might want to throw up your fists and shout along with King about collapsing structures and forms. Be prepared to be blindsided by a wave of pain, though, like a quarterback being sacked from the back in one of those NFL Films slow-motion frames. It’s every bit as exhilarating and intimidating as you might hope, and shows the Body joining acts like WOLD, Sutekh Hexen, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"" target=""_blank"">Locrian</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> in the masterful art of merging blackened noise and damaged metal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That’s not even the first three minutes. For “The Blessed Lay Down and Writhe in Agony”, the Body bleeds tension, with soprano vocals spiraling over cross-talking samples. A simple, slow riff and an indirect drum patter gather slowly, supporting King’s falsetto screech. The sound of a pump-action shotgun being slid into firing position serves as the valve’s release, opening a torrent of drone and rumble that funnels into a disastrous coda. King, Buford, the samples and, basically the whole world sound as though they’re being swallowed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The finale, “Worship”, lacks the immediacy of its companion pieces, but its slow rise through martial drums and a scramble of found voices and manipulated notes suggests the Body’s developing ability to bait its audience with control and nuance. They micromanage the implied chaos until there is no more sonic space, no more spare slivers for sound. When the barrier finally breaks, the Body emerges with all of the atavistic doom force that initially made the band so compelling. Here, the sound is caked in static, a great grey noise worn like a badge of courage and a come-at-me middle finger. Feel free to tell these two they don’t belong in your clique, but I’m willing to admit I’m not that brave.</span></p></div>"|17970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17970-the-body-master-we-perish/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Whether that’s the manifestation of something rattling around pop’s mass subconscious, or just an indicator that right now is a good time in the retro cycle to revive the few years before and after goth’s initial emergence from the first wave of UK punk remains to be seen.</p>
<p><i>Silence Yourself</i> has been attracting more attention, but <i>Discipline &amp; Desire</i> should also be essential listening for anyone in a gothic mood. It’s the poppier of the two, which makes sense if you’re familiar with Wax Idols’ first LP, <i>No Future</i>, a collection that sounded a bit more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> than the typical album emanating from bubblegum-heavy San Francisco garage scene, though it fit right in otherwise.</p>
<p>In the two years since <i>No Future</i> was released, frontwoman Hether Fortune has switched over from playing with a pickup band to recruiting a solid lineup; it's given the project a new sound that’s sleeker, darker, and more distinctive. Where the first album bristled with edgy but outgoing hooks, <i>Discipline &amp; Desire</i> plays it cool to the point of ice, holding the listener at arm’s length and dangling its melodic payoffs tantalizingly just out of reach. The catchiest parts of the album are surrounded by anxious chromatic harmonies and submerged in a cloud of frigid reverb, as if to underline its overall theme that you can’t enjoy pleasure without also enduring pain.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a sado-masochistic approach to making music, it probably is. Fortune has a day job as a dominatrix, and it seems that Wax Idols’ stylistic evolution was the result of taking lessons she learned in the dungeon and finding ways to express them aesthetically. <i>Discipline &amp; Desire</i>-- the title’s a tip-off-- is aloof and commanding, with an expertly honed sense of how far to take the tension it builds before offering relief.</p>
<p>Listeners generally don’t enjoy being messed with in such an aggressive fashion, and it says a lot about where Fortune’s songwriting talents are at this point that she can pull off such a feat. The opening song, “Stare Back”, is not only one of the strongest on the album, but the one that best embodies the forcible arm’s-length thing, with the band riding an anxious two-note groove and Fortune giving her vocals a particularly assertive, clipped edge. The song eventually builds to a bridge that’s as close to a resolution as the band’s willing to give it (there’s still a dissonant guitar line keeping us from getting too comfortable), but it’s not the release at the bridge that keeps bringing me back to the song, it’s the creepy groove that I can feel crawling up and down my back in a strangely satisfying way.</p>
<p>About halfway through the album, Fortune and company take a break from the power play to deliver three and a half minutes of unalloyed pop compelling enough to stop chatter in a crowded room. “Dethrone” sounds like the Pretenders trying to sound like Siouxsie, and it’s exactly as amazing as you would imagine that scenario to be. It seems like the goth fashion trend of the past few years is also inspiring a new goth music revival. If so, they should consider using “Dethrone” as its anthem.</p></div>"|18072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18072-wax-idols-discipline-desire/|6.8|Miles Raymer

Throughout<i> MCII</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a> gets in these ruts. His lyrics are delivered as someone who's never fully sure of his next move and who's completely unclear about his ambitions. He's sure that he's in love, but he keeps letting it slip away. Somehow, he keeps mucking up his day-to-day communication. It never used to be like this. He keeps talking about how time is getting away from him, which might be his way of acknowledging a crisis about getting older, though it's just as likely that he's accidentally spending hours clicking on YouTube videos. He wonders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12862-am-i-wrong/"">if he's wrong</a>. (He doesn't <i>think </i>so.) He consistently has good intentions, but he's inadvertently prone to choking on the follow-through. He sums up his turmoil pretty well in ""See It My Way"": ""I hear the song-- I wanna sing along with you/ But when I try I’m out of tune/ I turn and walk away."" It's a sweet and snappy sentiment from someone who's ultimately out of sync. This is Cronin's pop poetry for the aloof.</p>
<p>So it's somewhat ironic that <i>MCII</i> is also his most fully realized, beautifully arranged, and well-crafted work to date. Since he's spent the past year shredding for the masses in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30374-ty-segall-band/"">Ty Segall Band</a>, it's easy to forget that he recently earned his B.F.A. in Music and learned how to compose for different instruments. He rightly <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/mikal-cronin-interview-mcii-merge-ty-segall-band/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">noted</a> that his education came in handy for<i> </i>his <a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge</a> debut, which subs out some of the psych freakouts from his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15844-mikal-cronin/"">first album</a> for string arrangements. K. Dylan Edrich, who recently contributed strings to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>' most recent two albums, lends her talents to a handful of songs, from the plaintive violin solo on ""Peace of Mind"" to the frantic viola on ""Change"". </p>
<p>One of the most impressive things about <i>MCII</i> is how Cronin balances ""power"" and ""pop"". He makes the ""pop"" part of the equation look effortless-- in 10 songs, he offers 10 solid, catchy melodies. When it comes to ""power,"" he's much more conservative than he's ever been before-- especially when you consider <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>. There are entirely acoustic songs here that pretty well prove that he doesn't need to rely on punk rock sludge. So when the tender stuff is over and he steps on the fuzz pedal, the effects are extremely satisfying.</p>
<p>Album closer ""Piano Mantra"", for example, begins with a particularly fragile-sounding Cronin singing ""I’m tired, I’m sick, I’m broke up."" Edrich's strings are quietly introduced, then an acoustic guitar and some drums, and finally at the end, a feedback screech ushers in a distorted electric guitar. It doesn't even take center stage or threaten to become the main attraction-- it just adds a sturdy, noisy spine to Cronin's formerly delicate ballad. Everything-- strings, fuzz, slide guitar, etc.-- is purposefully and carefully implemented. He uses the more muscular sounds to offset his bubblegum jangle, and while he did ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> to lend a hand on the album, he only brought him on board for two guitar solos. Neither are very flashy-- they're well-placed bursts of power that complement the melody.</p>
<p>There's one moment in particular that puts to rest any notion that Cronin is just a glorified garage sideman: ""Don't Let Me Go"", the only track Cronin recorded entirely by himself at home. It's just him, his acoustic guitar, and his voice singing both the melody and harmony. With that skeletal structure, he loses the ""I'm not sure what's next or why I act like this"" tone and gets straight to the point. He pleads for the person he loves to give him another shot. ""You're all I know,"" he sings in his falsetto. It's the most direct, vulnerable statement he's ever made, and in an album otherwise packed with uncertainty, it's powerful.</p>
<p>Cronin <a href=""http://www.bowlegsmusic.com/features/call-back/mikal-cronin-call-back-14072"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> that his first favorite album was Nirvana's <i>In Utero</i>-- a record noisily recorded with Steve Albini before the band went to R.E.M./Katrina and the Waves producer Scott Litt to soften a couple of the album's songs. There's a loose analogy at play here-- Cronin recorded <i>MCII</i> with Eric ""King Riff"" Bauer at his Bay Area shred factory, Bauer Mansion. Later, he had the album mixed and mastered at Berkeley's hallowed <a href=""http://www.fantasystudios.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fantasy Studios</a>. (Cronin <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/mikal-cronin-new-album-merge-ty-segall-band/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has admitted</a> that he got the idea from Segall, who worked in those same two studios for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17133-twins/""><i>Twins</i></a>.) The outcome is a great sounding album that sits nicely between the poles of ""fuzz war"" and ""cooing balladeer."" Cronin has proved with this album that, like Cobain before him, he's so much more than a longhair with a fuzz pedal. He's an excellent pop craftsman who knows how to turn the power up for maximum effect.</p></div>"|17959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17959-mikal-cronin-mcii/|8.4|Evan Minsker

From the Ramones to Rod Stewart, the act of recording other people’s songs is usually an acknowledgment that you no longer have anything to say. This is not necessarily the case for the two-ton iron chest of blackened sludge known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">the Melvins</a> and their new covers record, <i>Everybody Loves Sausages. </i>In recent years, the Melvins have not slowed their pace of releasing original music, or tempered their adventurous (some might say perverse) musical explorations. Unlike most musicians their age, Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover remain eternally open to new experiences, whether it’s teaming up with Big Business for several records or morphing into Melvins Lite with Mr. Bungle’s Trevor Dunn on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16685-freak-puke/"" target=""_blank"">Freak Puke</a>. </i>If the Melvins are doing a covers record, it must be because they want (rather than <i>need</i>) to do a covers record.</p>
<p>But why would they want to make <i>Everybody Loves Sausages</i>? Could it be that the Melvins-- underneath all those layers of hair, sweat, and impenetrable volume-- are sentimentalists at heart? <i>Everybody Loves Sausages </i>is essentially a tour through the band’s most beloved songs from their formative years, covering most of the expected bases (Venom, Throbbing Gristle, the 80s Sacramento hardcore band Tales of Terror) and a few surprises (Queen, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>). The nostalgic drive of <i>Sausages </i>corresponds with this summer’s 30th anniversary tour, which celebrates the legacy of a band that predated, influenced, and finally transcended grunge. In a way, by encompassing the breadth of the group’s punk, pop, noise, and classic rock influences, listening to <i>Everybody Loves Sausages </i>helps to explain how the Melvins got here.</p>
<p>Not that <i>Everybody Loves Sausages </i>is always representative of the Melvins’ iconic punk-metal sound. Because most of the tracks feature guest vocalists, the Melvins are able to try out different, very non-Melvins-like guises. The most radical departure is the cover of Queen’s “You’re My Best Friend” (known here simply as “Best Friend”) with Tweak Bird’s Caleb Benjamin, which emulates Brian May’s bright-plastic guitar sound but otherwise bounces on a low-tech synth-pop pulse like a hopelessly chirpy musical birthday card. For their take on Ram Jam’s “Black Betty” the Melvins credibly remake themselves as a southern-rock boogie band, while the Mark Arm-assisted cover of the Scientists’ “Set It on Fire” manages to out-Mudhoney <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"" target=""_blank"">Mudhoney</a>.</p>
<p>The goofball virtuosity of these tracks is fun if not especially memorable. Where <i>Everybody Loves Sausages </i>hits hardest is when the Melvins assert their personality on the material, rather than vice versa. The epic nine-minute version of Roxy Music’s “In Every Dream Home a Heartache” is an excellent meltdown of arty prog-rock psychodrama, featuring a truly creepy Bryan Ferry impersonation by Jello Biafra. The 11-minute rendition of David Bowie's ""Station to Station"" is another scarifying sprawl, twisting recklessly between dissonant noise and full-bodied guitar blasts. Even better is “Female Trouble,” where Osborne subs for John Waters’ regular Divine over a sullen caveman stomp that bleeds into prehistoric noir. It’s a reminder that the Melvins aren’t just paying homage to rock history on <i>Everybody Loves Sausages</i>, they’re now also part of the tradition.</p></div>"|17947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17947-melvins-everybody-loves-sausages/|6.5|Steven Hyden

But with the release of <a href=""http://westernvinyl.com/catalog/WV106.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghosts Go Blind</i></a>, an abruptly extroverted and thoroughly satisfying third album, the Green connection need be mentioned only to dispense with it. While Wingo's songs have an emotional and musical clarity that hint at his filmic background, Ola Podrida has really come into its own. Rather than recording with friends on the fly, Wingo booked into a studio with a resourceful band (guitarist Colin Swietek, bassist Matt Clark, and drummer David Hobizal) that handles lustrous pop Americana and classically proportioned indie rock with expressive professionalism. It keeps Wingo's gifts as a songwriter and lyricist right at the forefront, which are more than ample to maintain interest.</p>
<p><i>Ghosts Go Blind</i> is simply a great-sounding album. On the surprisingly danceable indie rock numbers like ""Not Ready to Stop"" and ""Staying In"", the understated and crisply shifting rhythm section drives clear, heart-stirring electric guitar melodies, continuously varying the weight and temperature of the song. (Wingo worked with another Texas-based band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>, on the <i>Prince Avalanche</i> score, and a bit of their starry conflagration may have rubbed off.) If the up-tempo songs are notably sheer and propulsive, the laidback ones are equally deep and lush: Check out the electric guitar etching soft gold cursive on the ridged acoustic canvas of ""Fumbling for the Light"" and the sumptuously wide, ascending sway of ""Washing Away"". There's no electronic apparatus or laden pedal boards to hide guitars and drums executing scrupulous designs, which gives the album a great clarity.</p>
<p>The side effect of this quirk-free lucidity is that Wingo's songs can sound quite “in the style of,” with the redeeming factor being that he always nails it. ""Blind to the Blues"", for instance, immediately calls to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"">the Clientele</a> with the elegant slump of its silvery guitars and brushed percussion. The title track, with a sweetly drifting vocal melody darkened by resonator guitar, sounds like a flatteringly rusticated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>. The fleet post-punk of ""Speed of Light"" is a dead-ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4116-antics/"" target=""_blank""><i>Antics</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a>, down to the necrotic nasal quality Wingo lets into his voice. And a strong resemblance to the underrated band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2916-maritime/"">Maritime</a>-- the post-Promise Ring project of Davey von Bohlen-- is palpable whenever a matured emo-punk chug steals through the record's changing tones.   </p>
<p><i>Ghosts Go Blind</i> thrives on the vigorous execution of generic gestures, but finds its own personality in Wingo's appealing singing and smart, consistent lyrics. His voice has a plain finish but is strong and on pitch-- he can switch from a steely near-snarl to a high, vulnerable lament with ease. He's very adroit at decorating his melodies without muddying their memorable twists, an infectious example can be found between the verses and choruses of ""Not Ready to Stop"". ""I've been spending all my money like a fool tonight and I'm not quite ready to stop,"" Wingo sings, then contradicts himself as the arrangement shifts up a gear. This kind of tightly compressed conflict between emotions characterizes the lyrics overall, which portray a distinctly adult perspective on heartbreak-- desperate but self-aware, wary of melodrama-- with nuanced, but broadly resonant images that artfully couch distinctly relatable emotions. The record distinguishes Wingo not only as a noteworthy musical voice, but as a storyteller in his own right, rather than just a colorist for the stories of others.</p></div>"|17957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17957-ola-podrida-ghosts-go-blind/|7.7|Brian Howe

Perhaps best viewed as a younger, brasher cousin of Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings, the label emerged in 2009 and has since functioned as a bridge between the increasingly fragmented identity of London's dancefloors and global currents in contemporary soul. After an initial flurry of activity, Rogers and Shepherd have been quieter of late, putting out only two records in 2012. <i>Eglo Records Volume I</i>, though, is their largest project to date, and functions as a consolidation of the successes of those early years.</p>
<p>Of the label’s founders, Shepherd is amply represented here-- Rogers doesn't produce-- and justly so, given his status as Eglo’s most successful export. The compilation opens with ""Radiality"", a gauzy hip-hop instrumental that graced the label’s debut release. But before long we’re presented with the style that Shepherd is better known for: namely warm, jazz-inflected deep house, awash with hand-played synth work and subtly hummable melodies. The effervescent ""Vacuum Boogie"" is a particular highlight, and became something of an anthem on its 2009 release. The producer’s more recent output, meanwhile, reflects a growing distillation of approach-- sometimes to brilliant effect (""Marylin""), but occasionally at the expense of excitement (particularly in the coffee-table-smooth ""Myrtle Avenue"").</p>
<p>Floating Points also shoulders production duties for Eglo’s other bona fide star, Swedish singer <a href=""http://eglorecords.com/author/fatima/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fatima</a>, on the beatless ""Innervisions"", where his thoughtful chord progressions prove an apt frame for the singer’s broad, smoky vibrato. Elsewhere, though, Fatima is far less refined, and all the better for it: a pair of queasy, Funkineven-produced digital boogie numbers, ""Soul Glo"" and ""Kleer"", fall somewhere between Sa-Ra and early Ikonika. Funkineven is an Eglo stalwart too, but his solo inclusions here aren’t quite his best work, leaning towards the acid house retro-revivalism of his 2010/11 output.</p>
<p>The compilation closes with a handful of previously unheard tracks, suggesting Eglo’s future is to be as technicolour as its past. New material from Shepherd comes under the aegis of the 16-piece Floating Points Ensemble, replete with strings, brass and percussion. ""Wires"" is a mellifluous, long-form composition similar to the ensemble’s 2010 Ninja Tune single, though it’s a little unremarkable in its unending niceness. Fatima’s ""Visit You"", meanwhile, is far more intriguing, a lush but ever so slightly off-colour ballad that bodes well for the singer’s forthcoming debut album. <i>Eglo Volume I</i> is dominated by these three charismatic figures-- Floating Points, Fatima, and Funkineven-- and the cross-talk between them. And it’s true that, for the most part, the co-ordinates of the Eglo aesthetic are inscribed within their output. But that’s not to say that the label’s outliers don’t have worthy contributions to make too: particularly fine is Shuanise’s slight but seductive ‘Catch’, and a pair of tracks from Mizz Beats that explore an appealingly aqueous, G-funk-inflected take on dubstep. </p>
<p>With over two hours of music here spread across 23 tracks, <i>Eglo Records Vol I</i> is a pretty comprehensive document of the label’s finest moments (the only glaring omission, arguably, being Fatima and Funkineven’s skewed electro anthem ""Phone Line""). But, even presented in chronological order as they are here, it’s difficult to discern a coherent sense of growth or progression to these tracks, a fact not helped by the label’s recent faltering of momentum. There’s no denying that Eglo’s polyglot soul schtick feels a little out of step with current concerns in 2013, but then the label has has always seemed more interested in timelessness than bleeding-edge relevance. First and foremost, this compilation showcases a musical community of rare diversity and originality, one whose resources are far from exhausted. If this compilation presages a fresh wave of activity from the label, then so much the better. </p></div>"|18024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18024-eglo-records-vol-1/|7.8|Angus Finlayson

It’s not just that the song’s opening chords project a similar arena-rock-on-basement-resources mindset; it’s also the execution of the melodies, the one-minute run time, and the slight affectation of a British accent.</p>
<p>Connections is a group of Columbus, Ohio underground rock lifers. Singer Kevin Elliott and guitarist Andy Hampel’s high school band, 84 Nash, was the first non-GBV-affiliated act to see release on Rockathon Records. Elliott’s brother, Adam, played drums and sang in the now-dormant noise-pop trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5176-times-new-viking/"" target=""_blank"">Times New Viking</a> and guitarist Dave Capaldi played in the post-punk band El Jesus de Magico.</p>
<p><i>Private Airplane</i> is about as good a pass at 90s-style guitar rock as you’re liable to get anywhere outside of that decade. Jetting through 15 songs in just under 30 minutes, the record is undiluted by stinkers, throwaways, or noodly psychedelic interludes. It’s all hooks all the way through. A few songs even compete with themselves to deliver cathartic, sing-along-able moments. If you can only pick one part to shout out in the car during ""1980 Called"", is it the chorus, the pre-chorus, or the part where Elliott just lists the album titles <i>Pink Flag </i>and <i>Scarecrow</i>? All three are simple melodies, delivered with sufficient conviction.</p>
<p>The vintage GBV comparisons only extend so far. Connections are also well versed in the work of 80s Cleveland power-pop band the Mice, and they slot in well fellow alongside contemporary Midwestern skronk purveyors, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6917-tyvek/"" target=""_blank"">Tyvek</a>. The production on <i>Private Airplane</i> is gritty, but not to the extent that the noise value becomes a defining characteristic of the band’s sound. It’s blown out enough to add an extra layer of urgency, but not so much that your ears bleed trying to hear the words. And as a lyricist, Elliott favors concrete narratives over surrealist word games. He writes the cool kind of love songs-- the kind that deal with unrequited crushes on somebody that's bad news, or even just a bad fit. On “Mall Lights”, he longs to connect with the downstairs neighbor. “In time, I sleep under bridges in your mind,” he sings. “At least I’m socializing with your kind.”</p>
<p>Elliott regularly namedrops Ohio cities and landmarks in song, but the specific place names don’t matter much. It's more that they help to set the scene outside of mainstream locales. “When we hit Enon, we’ll pack a bowl in your Pontiac, Pontiac Armstrong,” he sings on “Totally Carpool”. “Why go back if it only brings you down?” It’s a song about Ohio, but once the dingy power chords drop in, it could be transposed onto the suburb, middle tier city, or highway stop of your choosing.</p></div>"|18038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18038-connections-private-airplane/|7.6|Aaron Leitko

Two years into their reunion, and the news that the lo-fi titans' 1993-1996 lineup would be returning hardly even qualifies as news anymore. <i>English Little League</i>, their latest, is GBV's fourth LP since their comeback, making as many post-hiatus LPs as they managed during that fabled ""classic era."" Sixteen months back, when they cut the ribbon on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let's Go Eat the Factory</i>,</a> a narrative seemed to emerge: beloved band's finest-ever incarnation returns with a spotty but satisfying LP. Three fitfully gratifying LPs later, however, and the story's much the same.</p>
<p><i>English Little League</i>, like so many GBV albums before it, gathers a couple all-timers and a few respectably jagged pop-rockers together with several total trainwrecks and calls it an LP. First, the good: the exceedingly generous lead single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15330-flunky-minnows/"" target=""_blank"">Flunky Minnows</a>"" is brimming with so many hooks, it spends its two minutes and change running around in circles, begging you to take them off its hands. Opener ""Xeno Pariah"" is the best first-shot of GBV's second act, a sharp, clear-eyed rocker with a head-lodge hook all its own. Highlights are everywhere, from the sway-and-spill chorus of ""Send to Celeste (And the Cosmic Athletes)"", to the goofball rumble and Zero Mostel gags of ""Crybaby 4-Star Hotel"" and the gnarly heft of bruiser ""Know Me As Heavy"". The playing's shrewd, the recording's warm, and frontman Robert Pollard's vocals are rousing, even brash; with the right songs in front of them, these guys are as good as they've ever been.</p>
<p><i>English Little League</i> marks the first appearance of recordings from Pollard's new home-studio. Which is not to suggest that he's somehow gone slick; even amidst <i>Little League</i>'s booming arena-rockers, swift power-pop, proggy bluster, and wads of bubblegum, it's on these late-night home-recordings that you can hear the figurative scrape of the tattered Tascam the loudest. Most of the home-brewed stuff takes the form of drunken 3 AM ballads, howls-at-the-moon likely inspired by those nights when the beer's all gone and every liquor store in 20 miles is closed until the morning. In the right mood, these ballads'll knock the wind out of you. But <i>English Little League</i>'s got four of them-- ""Sir Garlic Breath,"" ""Biographer Seahorse,"" ""Reflections in a Metal Whistle"" and ""A Burning Glass""-- and with every passing weeper, the album sags a tad more.</p>
<p>Still, I'll take a glut of ballads over something like ""Noble Insect"", the dismal co-write from Pollard and Tobin Sprout that leaves neither side off the hook. Over a lunkhead riff, Pollard bleats ""Japan, Japan"" semi-tunelessly for a while before sliding into chorus so good-- and so effortless-- you'll wonder why they'd ever think to burn it on a song that dopey. Really, it might be best if GBV stay out of Japan for the time being: the record's other lowlight, the jaunty, underwritten ""Reflections in a Metal Whistle,"" also shoehorns in a incongruous (albeit less annoying) mention of the country. Tobin Sprout spends <i>Little League</i> with his head in the clouds; whether he's harping on Jesus on the far-too-sweet ""The Sudden Death of Epstein's Ways"" or talking about a girl who chats with refracted light on ""Islands (She Talks in Rainbows)"", his ageless voice and crisp melodies are typically a smart counterpoint to Bob's ragged glories. But these songs he brings to <i>English Little League</i> are pure cotton candy, sticker and more saccharine than they are satisfying.</p>
<p>Guided by Voices weren't even this prolific back when they made their rep for being prolific. So, after unloading so much music in such a short time, finding a moment to step back and consider each album on its own takes some doing. It's clear now that <i>Let's Go Eat the Factory</i> was the weird one, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16740-class-clown-spots-a-ufo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Class Clown Spots a UFO</i></a> the one with the most range, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17321-the-bears-for-lunch/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bears for Lunch</i></a> the flat-out catchiest. <i>Little League</i>'s harder to draw a line around; even with all the ballads, there's not a prevailing mood or a dominant sound. So, while it's perfectly pleasant from moment to moment, the whole never congeals. With 17 songs in just under 46 minutes, a good number of them ballads, <i>English Little League</i> seems to unfold at an unusually relaxed pace; songs that would've been 75 seconds long now get two verses and a repeat airing of the chorus, not always deservedly. Tobin's songs have that gloopy faux-chestra thing going for them, and Pollard howler ""A Burning Glass"" is almost crowded out by echo, but for the most part, the production's spare enough, it doesn't especially feel like production.</p>
<p>Song for song, <i>League</i>'s about par with the three LPs that preceded it: <i>The Bears for Lunch</i> is a bit more consistent, but its highs certainly weren't any higher. Still, as with the three LPs it follows, something's holding the very good <i>League</i> back from greatness; in this case, its lax pacing, its over-reliance on balladry, and whatever the heck ""Noble Insect"" is supposed to be. Great as it is that GBV are still knocking sounds like ""Flunky Minnows"" into the stands, it's a shame they're not popping off 20 such songs a year the way they did way back when. The hits still connect, but the batting average is a little lower these days. In many ways, GBV's revamp is still one of the indie-rock comebacks to beat: they didn't return for a quick cash-grab, but as a fully functioning band, willing to risk whatever legend they'd built up in their absence by flooding fans with new material. But, triumphant as the return itself has been, the records themselves have really only skirted triumph. <i>English Little League</i> is no different.</p></div>"|17944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17944-guided-by-voices-english-little-league/|6.8|Paul Thompson

Unlike mid-decade peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>, they haven't abandoned their urban hippie aura, nor have they moved on to the larger amphitheatres. But they've picked up a few tricks, chief among them a fondness for big, riff-driven rock songs. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia,serif;""><i>Sub Verses</i> is their <i>seventh</i> album, not including a cluster of live releases and solo projects, one in which their one-time label boss and collaborator Michael Gira says he hears ""grizzled Beach Boys"". Gira also tells us to watch our egos ""unfold like a purple meat-flower,"" so he seems to understand Akron/Family's quest to meld their folk-rock skills with sounds more abstract and unknowable.</span></p>
<p>The resurgence of Gira's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> hangs over this collection, though Akron/Family don't have a thimbleful of that band's menace. These songs are anthemic, like courtside music for weekend warriors of off-the-grid living, though they reveal Akron/Family as a surprisingly typical rock troupe, rallying around cutting guitar figures and frenzied drum work. That approach doesn't necessarily work for them-- ""Sand Talk"" and ""Holy Boredom"" collapse into themselves like failed cake, too dense to enjoy, smothering Seth Olinsky's way with goodly, simple messages. Even with a small choir to assist him, Olinksy's reedy voice can't stand up to these percussive assaults, but time has revealed him to be a versatile, friendly frontman. He and his band are better and more compelling when they don't swarm their sound-- when they free up their slight, pretty melodies from the maelstrom. They've never written a sweeter, simpler pop song than ""Until the Morning"", where Miles Seaton's voice breaks as he asks to spend the night. It's as straightforward as the Avett Brothers, but more textured and vivid.</p>
<p>Likewise, the tipsy horns and dubby waltz of ""When I Was Young"" give the band a strong, familiar melody to chew on. There's some more apologizing, and a few ""whoa oh oh oh ohs"". So much of <i>Sub Verses</i> longs for companionship, giving lie to the title of the band's best album, 2007's <i>Love is Simple</i>. ""When I Was Young"" also reminds us that Akron/Family has been around, now, for eight or so years. Their career resembles that of Japan's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1710-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">Ghost</a>, another rogue crew with a devoted cult who continued to churn their sound. <i>Sub Verses</i> proves we shouldn't take Akron/Family for granted; their restlessness is rare.</p></div>"|18046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18046-akronfamily-sub-verses/|7.0|Andrew Gaerig

In strict terms, the sound of shuffling hi-hats, warm but impacting basslines, sharply percussive organ and piano riffs, and sighing divas has been “back” for European audiences since about 2006, when DJs started dropping old Kerri Chandler tunes with a sudden and unexpected fervor. But it’s undeniable that in the past year this particular brand of house-- organic but glossy, skipping but not too syncopated, feminized but rarely effeminate, flirting with populism while mostly rejecting obviousness-- has turned into something of a revivalist <i>lingua franca</i>, embraced by audiences from a variety of vantage points (post-minimal, post-dubstep, post-bassline) as the good times flavour of the moment. </p>
<p>It’s easy to hear how garage attained this status. On today’s dancefloors, these rounded, sensuous, grooves, asking little but offering plenty, perform best as uncomplicated throwback diversions from the main event, whether emerging out of a more rigorous set of stripped down house and techno like the sun from behind the clouds, or plunging deeper from the more bubbly delights of pop-garage. It’s tempting to posit early garage revivalism as the necessary corollary of the coalitional pastiches that typify so much of dance music’s respectable mainstream, its bumping, pleasure-centered congeniality staking out a past crossroad that ultimately led to nearly every currently popular (post-)house dance style. And there’s something about this music that seems to turn its face to catch whatever light is in the room, throwing up intriguing resemblances and contrasts with whatever company it happens to be keeping. </p>
<p>But this all-purpose charisma is also what makes a compilation like the Needwant label’s <i>Traxx: The House That Garage Built</i> such a mixed proposition. Rounding up 17 examples of contemporary producers trying their hand at the feted sound, <i>Traxx </i>asks us to see garage revivalism by only the light it generates on its own and to evaluate its stylistic tics only in their self-relation. Under these auspices, garage revivalism can seem, if not cloying, then at least less than the sum of its parts. There’s no denying that Needwant have done a decent job of rounding up a representative collection of bona fide anthems. There’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31171-dusky/"" target=""_blank"">Dusky</a>'s ""Flo Jam"", incarcerating Aaliyah’s disembodied vocals from “Rock The Boat”<i> </i>with only an eerie, downbeat bassline and the remorseless swing of the rhythm track for company; or there’s Medlar’s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>’s “Boiling”, its floating synth pads, open hi-hats and bewitching diva vocal capturing perfectly that sense of plush refinement that garage so frequently perfected-- music for dancing in your very best outfit. Best of the anthems is Ejeca’s “Horizon”, which comes closest to meriting the term “shameless,” its emphatic organ bassline and dense web of diva shrieks and invocations offering up the compilation’s most hedonistic moment.</p>
<p>But too many of these tunes can simply lapse into a mode of pleasant gregariousness, ticking all the right boxes but with only a modicum of flair. This is particularly a problem on the DJ mix version, where the endless success of discombobulated diva moans and bouncy silicon synth implants can begin to blur; frequently, tracks that seem merely functional in that context come to life on their own, such as Harry Wolfman’s excellent garage remix of Ben Pearce’s bluesy “What I Might Do”. But the easily ignorable nature of such charms raises larger questions about the purpose of garage revivalism per se: ultimately, the positive influence this style has on today’s dancefloors is its capacity to be misremembered, to be just yet another influence in the melting pot of today’s house music. By contrast, much of <i>Traxx </i>is too successful at stripping out any hint of an extraneous influence, until what is left is a perfect, but redundant, replica of past glories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly then, the hidden treasures of the compilation are its most idiosyncratic, least authentic inclusions. On Real Connoisseur’s “Faux De Baux”, a brooding, metallic bassline and a ruthlessly cut-up diva vocal play tongue hockey with one another, darting in and out with a kind of rhythmic exuberance that most of <i>Traxx </i>is too reverential to attempt. A world away, Breach’s “You Won’t Find Love Again” moves from ominous bass-driven moodiness into an astonishing white-light breakdown of layered synth arpeggio climaxes, before bringing it all back home with a rousing, punchy send-off that takes its cues from 1993 <i>and </i>every year of dancing since. It’s proof, if more is needed, that while there may be value in learning from the past, most of the time there’s greater benefit in cramming the essentials and making up the rest as you go along. </p></div>"|17917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17917-traxx-the-house-that-garage-built/|6.4|Tim Finney

Their label refers to it as their ""debut 12"","" but falls short of calling it an LP. (Are they considering it a full-length, like the hyper-stimulated grindcore band Gridlink did with their 12-minute classics <i>Orphan</i> and <i>Amber Grey</i>?) The EP vs. LP distinction is not so much about length as it is intention: EPs are about transitions and treading water, LPs are definitive statements of where a band creatively stands at that moment. In that sense, regardless of where they file it in their discography, <i>Grave</i> certainly sees Bone Sickness distinguishing themselves strongly in the crowded death metal landscape.</p>
<p>A common thread in this sort of NWOSDM-- New Wave of Old School Death Metal-- is a rejection of technicality, pretension, gloss, drum triggers, oversized backprints, and needless complexity. It's more punk, though this unfortunately often just means unoriginality minus technical skill, which is even worse because Incantation's cavernous murk is a lot easier to emulate than Gorguts' atonal slashing rhythms. Bone Sickness, though, know their history and how to build on it. They may take quite a bit from classic Calif., death metal crusts Autopsy, but they've got the energy to distinguish themselves that many more lethargic acts simply don't possess-- they're not nearly as doomy as Autopsy, emphasizing velocity above all.</p>
<p>Bone Sickness hardly stop for a groove break, but leave an impression that lasts much longer than the album's run time. <i>Grave</i>'s punky air is in part responsible for its diminutive length-- and those 18 minutes are frantic, as if they had to play under some severe duress, not just because it's all the material they wrote.</p>
<p>Even the cover art, done by Hand of Beaver, known for his work with <i>Chips and Beer</i> magazine, strikes a balance between death metal tradition and modern abstraction. Most covers have recognizable terrors like decomposing bodies or medical mishaps; this one is a hallucinatory nightmare fueled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29976-disma/"" target=""_blank"">Disma</a>, Blue Dream, and a Xerox machine. There appear to be webs, graves, tree roots, but who knows what is going on? (<i>Alone In the Grave</i>, indeed, tripping your balls off.)</p>
<p>Their Pacific Northwest home is better known for birthing firmaments like Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, and K Records than death metal. My first exposure to them was at Chaos in Tejas in 2011, where they played with Acephalix, a death metal group with origins in crust punk. The band notes powerviolence bands Crossed Out and Despise You as influences, but more telling is their mention of Repulsion. The Flint, MI grindcore pioneers made a racket that was too metal for the punks, but too fast and raw for most metalheads.

During the collective's decade-long run, its releases often siphoned key elements and moods from other genres-- dub techno's hollowed-out sprawl, post-punk's stark seriousness, the grim purposefulness of industrial-- to develop its own identity separate from the minimal overload that swept techno in the 2000s. There are a few flashes of gray-toned color to be found in SD's catalog, but ultimately darkness reigns supreme, as uncredited releases and stark as the DIY packaging that drove home the music's ominousness and severity. The proliferation of similarly-minded labels such as London's Blackest Ever Black imprint, as well as recent flirtations with harsh dance music coming from noise artists like Pete Swanson and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14133-dominick-fernow/"" target=""_blank"">Dominick Fernow</a>, have suggested that Sandwell District's influence looms large in 2013.</p>
<p>The rise in stature is somewhat bittersweet, since the label ceased operations at the top of 2012, just under two years after the release of <i>Feed-Forward</i>, a collaborative LP from core collective members Regis, Function, and Silent Servant (the first two of which have also spent the last year keeping SD's name visible by playing gigs under its guise). While the label's <a href=""http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/fabric-69.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official statement</a> concerning the dissolution sounded cryptically robotic (""There is a possibility of future, albeit irregular, print communications with audio accompaniment""), Silent Servant mastermind Juan Mendez's explanation was more brutally poetic: ""It's what anyone with a passion or half a brain would have done. It will never get old. No one will be able to impose their clean values on it...It was a glorious death, not a mercy killing.""</p>
<p>The cloaked drama of Mendez's statement was a hat-tip to Sandwell District's occasional flair for extra-musical aspects that took on a threatening shape-- the liner notes for the label's second proper release, 2002's remix 12"" of Vandross' ""Hurt Me I'm Waiting"", claim that the original song was stolen from ""a guy who is in jail"" that sent his tune to Regis' previous endeavor, '90s techno hub Downwards. So when SD's Tumblr was updated this February with an image that declared ""Sandwell District Is Dead"", the somewhat unnecessary proclamation suggested that <i>something</i> was afoot.</p>
<p>The big reveal followed a few weeks later: <i>Fabric 69</i>, the first release in two years to bear the Sandwell District name. Compiled by Regis and Function, the latest installment in Fabric's esteemed mix series isn't meant to signal a new beginning for the collective as it is a summation, as Function's Dave Sumner has described its intent as ""encapsulating an era and putting it to rest"". In a press release, Regis knob-twiddler Karl O'Connor is both more oblique and more direct regarding what's ahead for Sandwell District: ""If you want to give the Gods a laugh, talk about future plans.""</p>
<p>Whereas Sandwell District's live sets lean heavily on the type of tunnel-vision techno that gets bodies moving, <i>Fabric 69</i> is more of a mood piece, a home-listening experience that possesses a clear narrative shape. Patches of clattering ambience give way to endless-sounding, floor-centric passages, with moments of relative placidness acting as sonic bookends. The mix is a collection of things that go ""thump"" in the night that makes few concessions and demands your full attention; its sense of menace is entirely immersive.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Fabric 69</i>'s most impressive quality-- especially given the tough stuff involved in its composition-- is how luxuriously listenable it is. Regis and Function went back-and-forth on putting the mix together, with the latter handling the final mixdown after fine-tuning it ""hundreds of times"" while working on his recent Ostgut Ton debut <i>Incubation</i>. The pair's stitch work here is impressive, as they weave 30 tracks from the SD family and elsewhere into a 75-minute mix that sounds seamless to the extent that it's unclear where some cuts end and others begin. Obviously, the Fabric series' reputation makes it a given that there would be an amount of attention spent on putting something together that rises above the quality of your garden-variety RSS-baiting mix, but even so, the sprawl and lavish detail included on <i>Fabric 69</i> stands out as an achievement.</p>
<p>Some mixes can function as an accessible bridge-gap for those dipping their feet into dance music; I'm not sure <i>Fabric 69</i> is one of those mixes. The sound that Sandwell District made their name on was singular both in focus and form, so 75 minutes of this stuff could prove a bit taxing-- if not headache-inducing-- for the uninitiated. For first-timers, it's better to approach <i>Fabric 69</i> as a way of reconciling the past and present. Since its origins lie as a label, Sandwell District is less an artist-heavy project than it is a name, one that stands for something specific; conversely, a few of the non-Sandwell-affiliated artists included in <i>Fabric 69</i> have received a level of increased exposure that's taken place after the label's shuttering. So despite Sumner's stated aim to close the books on the past, <i>Fabric 69</i> actually finds itself looking to the present and beyond, strengthening Sandwell District's aesthetic brand simply by pointing out that, if you know where to look, it's more omnipresent than ever.</p></div>"|18048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18048-sandwell-district-fabric-69/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Jackson 5! Soul clap, Jackson 5!"" It turned out to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a> and Nic Offer, who helped light the fuse of the millennial dance-punk craze and have managed to stick around long after it burned out. Many of their peers favored a more cramped and anxious sound, but !!! stood out as freewheeling party monsters that radiated sunny vibes. Thirteen years and five LPs later, the mostly well-turned but low-impact <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/87-thriller/"" target=""_blank""><i>Thr!!!er</i></a> has all the hallmarks of !!!, minus a crucial one: abandon.</p>
<p>At first, the band suggested that their name could be pronounced as any number of percussive onomatopoeias, but the marketplace quickly settled on ""Chk Chk Chk,"" a fair approximation of the scratchy funk guitars that are their lifeblood. From their self-titled 2001 debut to 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1764-louden-up-now/""><i>Louden Up Now</i></a>, !!! stretched their wooly punk-funk into sleeker realms of disco both leftfield and pop, blending the influences of Arthur Russell and the Bee Gees with Talking Heads and Liquid Liquid-inspired rave-ups. The band's stylistic expansion peaked in the influential indie-house single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1766-me-and-giuliani-down-by-the-school-yard-a-true-story-ep/"">""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)""</a> before they pivoted away from exfoliating odysseys on 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9956-myth-takes/"">Myth Takes</a></i>, where meaty rock and soulful deep house tropes came to the forefront of radio-formatted songs with thunderous live drums.</p>
<p>2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14570-strange-weather-isnt-it/""><i>Strange Weather, Isn't It?</i></a> was a back-to-basics album that kept the shorter track lengths of <i>Myth Takes</i> but inserted icy grooves where most of the sticky hooks and cathartic dynamics had been. A palate-cleansing minimal dance album was a timely idea, but at four or five minutes apiece, the songs just didn't have time to simmer like the epic ""Giuliani"", often petering out before they could boil over. The same proportional issues cap off the impact of <i>Thr!!!er</i>, with one lean, mannered workout after another fading to silence just when it really starts cooking. ""Even When the Water’s Cold"" is a lively example of the general problem: It has a funk part, a wah-wah part, a dubby interlude, a mild coda. But the dynamic line running through them is flat and unsurprising, never exploding us through the top or plunging us through the bottom of the song.  </p>
<p>Though <i>Thr!!!er</i> continues in the same vein as <i>Strange Weather</i>, it's differentiated by a warmer sound palette. !!! melt the ice crystals that rimed their last record with mystic vocal harmonies on ""Fine Fine Fine"", reverbed flute loops on the percolating ""Careful"", and an overall tilting of emphasis from electronic tootles toward tidy, curlicued funk musicianship. The record is taut with the usual wiry, kinked guitars, ropy bass lines, popping handclaps, chanting choruses, and falsetto outbursts, all working efficiently for dancers but evading big moments for listeners. This thinness at the level of content is glaring only on ""Get That Rhythm Right"", where unflattering vocal processing fails to conceal a nebulous vocal melody while flotsam of dubious taste-- goofy sound effects, fleeting filters, a timorous smooth sax interlude-- spins aimlessly on a whirlpool of bass and drums.</p>
<p>As retro-house vamping goes, the svelte and slippery ""Slyd"" fares much better, especially mixed with vocals cuts from Molly Schnick of !!!'s now-dead but arguably superior sister band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3184-out-hud/"">Out Hud</a>. ""Californiyeah"" and ""One Girl/One Boy"" have some of the cracking pop panache that elevated <i>Myth Takes</i>, but the tracks that aim for transcendence through recombinative repetition are just too brief and buttoned-down to get there. For all of <i>Thr!!!er</i>’s reliable pleasures, the requisite cover-image riff on the triple-bang logo is the boldest idea here, which makes for an awfully modest record to hold up against the pop-canon cornerstone for which it was named.</p></div>"|17954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17954-chk-chk-chk-thriller/|6.0|Brian Howe

As a churchly organ repeats an insistently ascending phrase, Kozelek describes the stack of mail that awaited him after a tour, including “a wedding invitation from a new young relative I never even knew of.” The card sets his mind reeling around his family tree, until it alights on memories of his sister. She’s just suffered through a bad divorce and is raising two daughters, age four and seven; he wants to live a long life just so he can see how they grow up. It’s a quietly poignant song, one that subtly lays out the distance between Kozelek and his loved ones even as it tries to connect them in song. “Can’t stop my mind from racing,” he concludes. “It’s not good or bad, it’s just how God made me.”</p>
<p>Few songwriters can sketch a scene with Kozelek’s eye for detail or his economy of language, and fewer still can match the insight with which he can draw a character. In recent years, however, the sheer volume of work Kozelek has released through his Caldo Verde Records has tended to dilute the impact of his songs. Not even the most avid fan could keep up with the deluge of bonus discs and live albums, and musically he has narrowed his palette to a single instrument: that nylon-string guitar he introduced on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/"">Admiral Fell Promises</a>. </i>It makes more financial than aesthetic sense, as it allows him to keep touring expenses to a bare minimum, but those nylon strings have comes to define his sound both on stage and in the studio, collapsing his songs into one another.</p>
<p>That makes <i>Perils from the Sea</i> unique in Kozelek’s recent catalog. He mostly turns over all the non-vocal responsibilities to Lavalle, so instead of plucks and strums, we hear forlorn beeps and bloops-- somewhat more hushed than on the Album Leaf output, yet distinctively textured and tailored to Kozelek’s signature phrasings. Lavalle favors a subtle pulse and thrum that gently reinforces the concreteness of the details. On “Caroline”, the stuttering beat gooses the tempo a bit and gets Kozelek singing faster than usual. It’s another song that contrasts the securities of home (waking up next to his love and her rat terrier pup, hanging around familiar coffeeshops) with the lure of the road, yet the music lends the emotions a new and more urgent desperation. It may be Kozelek’s finest moment since anything off <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9958-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/"">Ghosts of the Great Highway</a>.</i></p>
<p>Kozelek writes songs by simply letting his mind wander, then spends years retracing his steps on stage. That his songs move by tangent and discursion can frustrate a listener since it means he tends to eschew choruses, bridges, hooks, and other structural embellishments. Instead, his songs are built almost exclusively from verses, and they often worry over a single, simple melody. When it works, as it does on “Ceiling Gazing”, that approach can locate immense symbolic power in even the most seemingly banal items: a scratched copy of Heart’s <i>Dreamboat Annie</i> that he and his sister played countless times, for example, or the lonely house in Ohio where she lives now.</p>
<p>Lavalle understands this, and he crafts beats to represent the mechanisms of memory. Only occasionally do they sound at cross-purposes. The psychedelic synths on “1936” sound too ominous and otherworldly for what is a pretty thin story centered around a special dime, and on “You Missed My Heart”, the burble of background noise cannot redeem a strained account of a murderer who kills-- and eventually dies-- for love. The sentiment is too clever to ring particularly true, which is on Kozelek’s shoulders, but Lavalle’s beats are too noncommittal to add much gravity or levity. Still, the effort is appreciated, if only because the song shows both men readily moving out of their comfort zones. <i>Perils from the Sea</i> may not be a seamless collaboration, but neither artist has sounded so purposeful in his reverie in years.</p></div>"|17960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17960-the-album-leaf-sun-kil-moon-perils-from-the-sea/|7.3|Stephen M.

Following a lawsuit against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a> for an unapproved Lord Finesse sample, rappers became more conscious of what they were sampling on mixtapes. Fearing copycat lawsuits, Khalifa and Curren$y held onto the sample-heavy <i>Live in Concert</i>, waiting for the legal dust to settle, and now they've released it as an EP, one that costs money.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These rappers have some history. Back in 2009, Khalifa and Curren$y released a collaborative mixtape, <i>How Fly</i>, just at the point where both were carving out their respective niches. Khalifa found mainstream success with his single ""Black and Yellow"" and Curren$y found critical and underground appreciation by releasing a constant stream of quality music. Both make long records that grow more enticing with repeated listens, after one has tuned in to their respective off-color jokes and personal ticks. Though Khalifa has never been able to match Curren$y’s sheer rapping skill, his nasally voice has a more welcoming tone next to Curren$y's weary snarl.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Imagery is where Curren$y excels (“Motion sensors all over my house/ For investigative-ass hoes/ That’s waiting on me to pass out/ So they can tip-toe all over my home”, from ""Landing""), and Khalifa will never be able to equal him there. Instead, his verses feel weightless, as he raps  about much money he’s made and many places he has been. Where Curren$y’s attention to detail takes you to those places, Khalifa’s never achieves that kind of tangibility.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The duo share a penchant for jazzy and relaxed funk production (see: Curren$y’s <i>Pilot Talk</i> series) and production is the EP's strength. The excellent flute work from Bobbi Humphrey’s <i>Fancy Dancer</i> is heard all over this EP-- Curren$y and Khalifa can write strong hooks on their own but here they're content to let Humphrey take over. Take “Revenge and Cake”, which lifts its lovely refrain of “Sweeter than sugar/ Sweeter than love” from <i>Fancy Dancer</i>. The samples aren't really mixed or chopped, and since with every track gets an extended intro or outro, it almost feels like the two rappers were in the studio with Humphrey.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, <i>Live in Concert</i> is not a mixtape and it isn't free. In a post-Datpiff world, it's reasonable to wonder if anyone will pay for it. But  even free mixtapes require studio space, someone to do mixing, cover art and especially here properly cleared samples, all of which cost money. So while <i>Live in Concert</i> might not justify the money a listener might spend, you can understand why they would try to recoup. </p></div>"|18067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18067-wiz-khalifa-curreny-live-in-concert/|6.8|David Turner

Drummer Tim Bryon and bassist Kenneth Vanhoutte throw the full weight of their instruments behind the guitar’s simple, repetitive riff; it’s deliberately blackened hardcore, thickened by a rhythm section that doesn’t want to stand back in the mix. A little less than a minute into the record’s closer, though, a second guitar steps out of sync, baiting the melee with a sustained shriek of feedback, as though the last-resort breaks have been thrown on a runaway train. Indeed, the rest of the track feels like a headlong race down a very steep hill, with that single piercing tone trying to prevent a tumble toward a reckless mess. And it works: By the end of these three minutes, Hessian has slowed to a mid-tempo plod, with spectral background chants and guitars that slowly back off the volume.</p>
<p>That balance between inexorable tumult and controlled chaos largely defines <i>Mánégarmr</i>, a record that zigs and zags in the most surprising ways while always returning to an assured stylistic center. Guitarist and second vocalist Levy Seynaeve also plays bass in prolific Belgian doom benders Amenra, who treat their records like laboratories for pushing their chosen milieu a little further. The same holds for Bryon’s other band, the Black Heart Rebellion, a strange crew that suggests Akron/Family casting its characteristically wide net from a post-punk epicenter. Hessian benefits from those pan-everything pedigrees by making music as if they’re about to lose control and run off the rails while never actually doing it.</p>
<p>They volley between black metal wails and head-down hardcore wallop, between narcotic instrumental drift and dense full-band efficiency. The agility and uncertainty are intoxicating, but so is the sense that Hessian is in complete control of all this. The guitar solo at the center of “Plague Monger”, for instance, offers a psychedelic caterwaul that threatens to stall the momentum of the two-minute ripper, but Hessian manage not only to make the unlikely sound work within the track but work <i>for</i> the track, too, adding an italicized gusto to the already-intense tune. The centerpiece of <i>Mánégarmr </i>is a three-piece suite that shows the span and strength of their versatility: “Father of Greed” galvanizes its down-tuned doom with grim pugnacity and tweaks it with off-kilter textures and beats. The smoldering exit serves as an apt transition into “Vãmãcarã”, a mix of field recordings, elliptical guitar tones, and occasional chords that suggests spell-casters Cultus Sabbati or the slighter moments of Sunn O)))’s <i>Black One</i>. It swells toward the end, foreshadowing the no-quarter, all-fury approach of the record’s back half. From the anthemic “Swallowing Nails” to the ending “Mother of Light”, Hessian spends the last four songs proving just how hard and heavy they can be for an extended and truly exhausting coda.</p>
<p>None of the constituent parts of <i>Mánégarmr</i> will shock you: At its core, Hessian plays brutal but basic metal, strong but emblematic hardcore and, occasionally, good but familiar drone. The record was mixed, after all, by Tomas Skogsberg in Sweden’s Sunlight Studios, a legendary place that bands simply trying to rupture some hegemony wouldn’t send their music. But these parts stream forward in constantly surprising scrambles, affording <i>Mánégarmr</i> the simultaneous feelings of familiarity and reverence, reinvention and insurgence. It’s a rush, from one end to the other.  </p></div>"|17929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17929-hessian-manegarmr/|7.7|Grayson Currin

In late 2008, the Boston trio released its second full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12563-get-young/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i>Get Young</i></a>, a tightly-crafted burst of energy that fully embodied the reckless abandon of youth, on Sub Pop imprint Hardly Art. By SXSW the following March, they were playing Sub Pop’s party opposite Handsome Furs, in addition to a slew of other gigs. Their brand of infectious dance-punk felt original, with members channeling the raw energy of their debut into impressive new wave elasticity for the second LP. And then, the momentum just sort of disappeared.</p>
<p>A few years later, and Hardly Art is out of the picture. Pretty &amp; Nice have released EPs and 7-inches on various tiny labels, but no full-length since <i>Get Young</i>. But the band is resurfacing now, as strong as ever. On <i>Golden Rules for Golden People</i>, Pretty &amp; Nice preserve the fizz of youth while finding a way to grow up a little. Rather than slow down, they've incorporated a wider range of sounds. The band’s previous efforts excelled by working within a very specific framework, which fell somewhere between the new wave of Elvis Costello’s first few albums and of Montreal’s least soulful songs. Here, however, they mine vintage surf-rock, orchestral pop, and power-pop. The results are occasionally illogical (funky yet math-y, with eight-bit flourishes) and make for some unusual comparisons (Devo with an ELO-ish vibe). The spazz remains, but it’s accompanied by the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Take the song “Yonkers”, one of the album’s best: In less than four minutes, the track goes through at least five different phases. It segues from a throttle of riffs to a cutesy surf chorus and bridge, from wonky angles into blazing brass, from a heavenly choir of human voices to manufactured bleeps and bloops. It’s disorienting in a joyful way. There are other songs that more fully commit to one or two ideas, such as “New Czar” and “Gold Fools.” The former gives off a feeling that can only be described as “giddy up”; it’s a drum beat that demands one rides on, matched by a throwback pop melody. The latter, one of the album’s more produced tracks, has a dark electronic beat lording over it. Though brief at just a minute and a half, “Gold Fools” is something worth paying attention to, both for the eerie club vibe and singer Holden Lewis’ falsetto crooning.</p>
<p>Lewis’ precise diction serves as an anchor amidst the musical chaos, helping the album’s seemingly nonsensical lyrics to stand out. Presenting what seems to be a series of metaphors, he sings about animals, zombies, Malibu, Rockefeller money, unsinkable ships, and shallow beautiful people. He also often repeats the line, “we are all instruments,” the first words heard on the album. With song titles like “Money Music” and “Gold Fools”, the “golden people” of <i>Golden Rules for Golden People</i> appear to be the ones the band rails against. This is a band comprising people who've worked menial day jobs and who came up through a DIY scene, so it's no real surprise they’re criticizing the upper class. In that sense, fans of unrelenting genres like punk may find Pretty &amp; Nice's politics and pace appealing.

And, ironically, with that, the Stooges finally achieved their elusive American Stones status-- in that, as with the Stones, expressing one’s enthusiasm for the Stooges now requires a qualifying remark along the lines of, “Well, I like their older stuff.”</p>
<p>But where the allergic reaction to <i>The Weirdness</i> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34300-stooges-guitarist-ron-asheton-rip/"" target=""_blank"">untimely 2009 passing of Ron Asheton</a> would seemingly discourage surviving Stooges <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a> and Ron’s drummer-brother Scott Asheton from extending their discography, this band has survived bad reviews and the loss of a founding member before. Conveniently enough, their post-reunion narrative can simply mimic that of their first phase: after the group fell apart following the commercial failure of 1970’s <i>Funhouse</i>, Iggy shrewdly reassembled the Stooges for 1973’s <i>Raw Power</i>, by recruiting James Williamson and demoting Ron Asheton to the bassist position. This is the iteration of the Stooges that has been touring steadily since 2010, with Mike Watt replacing Asheton on bass (as he did for the late Dave Alexander in 2007) and honorary fifth Stooge Steve Mackay on sax. And the band's name reassumes its ""Iggy &amp;"" prefix, signaling another change in direction: Where the evil alchemy of the band's first two albums proved impossible to recapture on <i>The Weirdness</i>, <i>Raw Power</i>'s more playful, darkly humorous trash-canned rock 'n' rolla provides the Stooges v4.0 with a more easily pliable template to work from.</p>
<div>That's not to say <i>Ready to Die</i> matches the live-wire abandon of its 1973 antecedent-- not even close. And the tame, contained nature of even its most petulant tracks is all the more disappointing given that this band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49910-sxsw-iggy-and-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">can still absolutely slay onstage</a><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia,serif;"">. </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfFOmMra0Sg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">All those years working in Silicon Valley</a> haven't diminished Williamson's fiery fretwork (see: the “Gimme Danger”-styled grind of “Burn”), but Iggy's delivery is too wry to exude rage, the songs rarely rise above a mid-tempo chug, and Mackay's jovial sax blurts are way more roadhouse than <i>Funhouse</i>. But, unlike <i>The Weirdness</i>, the palpable lack of menace feels intentional, and more true to a band that, in the wake of Asheton’s death and their own advancing ages, has good reason to question its own mortality. Over the shake-appealing shimmy of “Gun” (essentially, a prettied-up “Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell”), Iggy sings, “If I had a fucking gun/ I could shoot at everyone,” a seemingly throwaway, suddenly topical line that recycles one of the more odious lyrics from <i>The Weirdness</i> (“my idea of fun/ is killing everyone”). But where the latter reeked of forced misanthropy, there’s a cheeky nonchalance to his voice here that acknowledges the absurdity of such idle threats coming from a reasonably content 66 year old. Forty years removed from the kamikaze death-trip fantasies of <i>Raw Power</i>, <i>Ready to Die</i> is the sound of Iggy admitting, “I’m too old for this shit.” And he’s come armed with not one, but three acoustic ballads to prove it. </div>
<p>Of course, we’re used to hearing Iggy mellow out at this point-- his last two solo efforts were a record of jazzy chansons and a low-key covers album featuring songs by the Beatles, Serge Gainsbourg, and Cole Porter. But it’s telling that he’s now exposing that sensitive side in the Stooges, as if he’s trying to defuse the band’s formidable mythos from within. The Stooges made Iggy a punk-rock legend, however, that status has exacted a considerable physical toll, one that, to this day, requires him to be the shirtless, stage-diving psycho onstage even as his recent work suggests his interests now lie elsewhere. It’s hard to hear this album as anything but his attempt to punch out, torn as it is between his desire to bow out with dignity and his duty to play the dirty old man for the fans. But where Iggy once made an effort to obscure his pervy provocations in coded language-- “T.V. Eye” had nothing to do with watching television-- <i>Ready to Die</i> yields unfortunate evidence of how he just can’t be arsed anymore, resulting in the lazy-lothario lechery of  “DD's” (“I’m on my knees for those double-Ds”) and “Sex and Money” (“nipples come, and nipples go”).  </p>
<p>In light of these numbskull regressions, <i>Ready to Die</i>’s most raucous song, “Job” seems less like a blue-collar working-man complaint (chorus: “I got a job/ but it don’t pay shit/ I got a job/ and I’m sick of it”) than a comment on the slog of being a Stooge. (After all, for all their influence and infamy, the band’s commercial prospects in 2013 are no better than they were in 1969.) So it comes as a great relief when Iggy starts waving the white flag on “Beat That Guy”, a surprisingly radiant, Petty-esque elegy that sounds less like an Iggy Pop song than a James Osterberg one, as he tries to lay his wild-child persona to rest by ruefully admitting, “I’m running out of space/ I’ve run out of time.” The knockout blow is delivered by “The Departed”, a hushed acoustic lullaby that effectively serves as a requiem for both Asheton and the Stooges as an entity: Williamson bookends the track with understated quotes of “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” while, in between, Iggy repackages old lyrics into fortune-cookie bursts of reflective, Yoda-like wisdom. (“Serious talk’s no fun … this nightlife is just a death trip.”) The song shares its name with Martin Scorsese’s recent Oscar winner, but it’s more reminiscent of that final shot in Goodfellas where Ray Liotta’s reformed gangster retrieves the morning paper from his doorstep: it's the sound of a notorious bad-ass leaving his unsavoury past behind, resigned to living the rest of his life as a schnook. </p></div>"|17903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17903-iggy-and-the-stooges-ready-to-die/|5.6|Stuart Berman

The dominance of rap-metal, as defined by Limp Bizkit and Korn, was starting to wane ever so slightly, and that had to be a good thing, right? But at its best, rap-metal at least offered something <i>new</i>. Soon, playlists would be flooded with the ironically coined <i>nu-</i>metal, which manifested in the likes of Nickelback, Staind, Godsmack, and Puddle of Mudd, old fashioned grunge bands who imported rap-metal's misogyny, regrettable facial hair, and nothing else. When the pendulum has swung so far in one direction, a correction is likely already underway and this can be exciting for people who see the big picture; but we were still about a year away from the Strokes, White Stripes, <i>Bleed American, Songs for the Deaf, I Get Wet</i>, or anything that offered a reprieve<i>. </i>This gap in time proved perfect for At the Drive-In-- if you caught the video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NYbojdoAQE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“One Armed Scissor”</a>, the vocals kinda sounded like Rage Against the Machine, the band sliced and diced like Fugazi, and rocked like hell, but seriously, THOSE AFROS…<i>who the fuck are these guys and where did they come from and how many times is he gonna throw that microphone in the air?</i></p>
<p>In image, sound, and presentation, At the Drive-In were a fully-formed <i>real deal</i>, a Next Big Thing to most, even though their arrival on rock radio was six years in the making; by the release of <i>Relationship of Command</i>, they'd already accumulated an impressive discography and a live reputation. But the typical music consumer was still relying on MTV, Clear Channel, and Sam Goody as prime conveyers, so El Paso might as well have been the actual middle of nowhere. Less than a year after the release of <i>Relationship</i>, they broke up in a way that resembled a broken bone more than a torn ligament-- nasty and fast, but so clean and unmistakable that you could imagine they might patch things up. Who knows what was expected of ATDI as a commercial entity, but they stuck around long enough to have an unequivocal impact, burned out before they could wear out their welcome, and left a whole lot to explore and a whole to the imagination. And so a year removed from their big Coachella reunion and without much fanfare, At the Drive-In are reissuing their 1996 debut <i>Acrobatic Tenement </i>and their swan song <i>Relationship of Command,</i> the two ends of a compelling arc that foretold both their explosive music and implosive interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>It stands to reason many ATDI fans discovered their discography in reverse order, and if you take the headfirst dive into <i>Acrobatic Tenement, </i>you’re shocked at how the same people responsible for “One Armed Scissor” sound every bit as naïve and scrawny as you’d expect of a band <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBsFntczDoM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who named themselves after a Poison lyric</a>. It’s not exactly their <i>Pablo Honey</i>: many early adapters still will vouch for it as their best and most honest record and they sound like a <i>younger </i>version of themselves more than a completely different version.</p>
<p>They more or less had an idea of what they wanted to sound like. Whether it’s the murky, almost clean guitar tone, the dual-frontman vocal interaction or just a tendency to get as strident as possible on the chorus, much of <i>Acrobatic Tenement</i> was on loan from Fugazi and their ilk. Bixler-Zavala’s vocals are likewise fully formed and while his lyrics tend to be a lot more grounded in tangible goods than they were later on, there’s still a lot of decoder-ring jabberwocky; “Initiation” is rumored to be about ATDI groupies, “Ebroglio” documents a friend’s suicide, but even the hardworking commenters at songmeanings.net think most of these tracks are about breakups, a sure sign that they’re out of ideas.</p>
<p>But the most startling aspect of <i>Acrobatic Tenement </i>is its anemic sound<i>, </i>which allows you to visualize At the Drive-In at the “Bandcamp with local gigs” phase of their career. It’s meant as a souvenir and possible replacement for their “you had to be there” live show; I use that term in the most literal sense, since even if their exhausting touring regimen is still spoken of in hushed tones, it rarely got them out of the Southwest. And <i>Acrobatic Tenement </i>struggles with the same quandary that faces bands whose live performance far outstrips their songwriting and recording skills: considering that the budget was taken from couch cushions (a rumored $600), why not just, you know, record a live show? I couldn’t imagine <i>Acrobatic Tenement </i>sounding any less slick-- even compared to the brickwalled <i>Relationship of Command, </i>the intended dynamics of “Skips On The Record” and “Schaffino” are rendered theoretical at best, the guitars mostly sound like someone forgot to hit a distortion pedal, and there are several times during the otherwise excellent “Ticklish” where it <i>actually</i> sounds like someone<i> </i>forgot to hit their distortion pedal until midway through a riff. </p>
<p>There are still good songs on <i>Acrobatic Tenement-- </i>“Initiation” and “Star Slight” in particular stand out as strong examples of where post-hardcore was at the time and where At the Drive-In could’ve taken it. But really, the reissue of <i>Acrobatic Tenement</i> is better used as a means of scaling At the Drive-In’s subsequent leaps and bounds-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49333-at-the-drive-in-to-reissue-acrobatic-tenement-and-relationship-of-command/"">guitarist/vocalist Jim Ward praised it for its “earnest and pure excitement,” </a>relative to <i>Relationship’s </i>“craftsmanship.” In other words, both artist and listener alike can appreciate <i>Acrobatic Tenement </i>as the record At the Drive-In made because they really didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about <i>Relationship of Command </i>in retrospect is just how much of it remains etched in 2000. For one thing, it was released on Grand Royal, the Beastie Boys’ boutique label which served as a late-90s booster for cosmopolitan, kitschy, and quirky acts like Bis, Atari Teenage Riot, and Luscious Jackson that mostly strayed far away from alt-rock’s mainstream. <i>Relationship</i>, along with the pre-9/11 vinyl pressing of Jimmy Eat World's <i>Bleed American</i>, was one of Grand Royal’s final releases before it shuttered in 2001 and also one of its most successful, selling over 1 million copies. And most crucially, there was the duo responsible for capturing ATDI’s sound. <i>Relationship of Command </i>was produced by Ross Robinson, nu-metal standard bearer, five-star general in the Loudness Wars, and the very person responsible for many of the records that made <i>Relationship of Command </i>sound so bold by comparison. And much to the band’s eventual regret, Andy Wallace mixed the LP, ensuring it was as juiced-up and steroidal as any number of sluggers restoring the nation’s faith in Major League Baseball at the time.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/the_class_of_2000_omar_rodriguez-lopez_on_at_the_drive-ins_relationshi/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">While guitarist and eventual Mars Volta member Omar Rodriguez-Lopez discredited the mixing of <i>Relationship of Command</i></a>, it’s hard to argue with Wallace’s decisions because it totally fucking worked. That At the Drive-In could go moonshot for moonshot with the heavy hitters without drastically altering the content of <i>Relationship </i>was its biggest success-- here was a band smuggling in post-hardcore, emo-punk, and math-rock in between whatever <i>MACHINA/Machines of God </i>or <i>Californication </i>single was poppin’ at the time. But if you liked omnidirectional anger, big choruses, and <i>loud </i>guitars<i>, Relationship of Command </i>was an album that could easily be taken at face value before the subversive aspects came to the fore.</p>
<p>From the very first seconds of “Arcarsenal”-- the kind of hardcore <i>Pornography­­</i> that even the Cure couldn’t replicate on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1693-the-cure/""><i>their </i>Ross Robinson album</a>-- <i>Relationship of Command </i>grabs you by the collar and <i>does not stop. </i>A lot of the advances they'd made on <i>In/Casino/Out </i>and <i>Vaya--</i> electronics, Latin percussion, more ambitious song structure-- were simply blown up to scale. Meanwhile, Bixler-Zavala’s cloak and dagger lyricism went even deeper into garbled SpyTech communiqué while becoming unintentionally anthemic or resonant-- “have you ever tasted skin?,” “hypodermic people poking fun at the living,” and of course, “this station is non-operational.”</p>
<p>Make no mistake, <i>Relationship of Command </i>is also ATDI’s best album on account of having its sharpest songwriting, most explosive hooks, and catchiest guitars. Sure, there’s a piano somewhere in the mix, but the windup leading to “I must’ve read a thousand faaaaaaaaces!” on “Arcarsenal” is about the only reprieve you get within the first 15 minutes. The chorus riff of “One Armed Scissor” would’ve been a major hit on Beavis &amp; Butthead’s couch years prior. Bixler-Zavala’s eventual shift towards prog-metal operatics aren’t as much of a surprise in retrospect listening to the belted chorus of “Sleepwalk Capsules.”</p>
<p>But while <i>Relationship of Command </i>is a juggernaut, it’s not invincible. For one thing, you can sense the fissures forming in ATDI’s songwriting team-- the undeniable chorus of “Invalid Litter Dept.” (you know, the “dancing on the corpses’ ashes” song) is necessary to make up for its stilted interjections and even if “Enfilade” is about half as long as a standard Mars Volta song, it packs in every bit as many chintzy production tricks. Iggy Pop shows up to whisper a ransom note at the beginning of ""Enfilade"" and shows up somewhere indeterminate on ""Rolodex Propaganda"", because he was available and this was a major label rock album in 2000. Meanwhile, <i>Relationship</i>’s second half anticipates the utilitarian modern rock of Ward’s Sparta; Wallace and ATDI are equally complicit in turning “Quarantined” into a leaden slog and “Cosmonaut” into an undifferentiated flurry of pugilistic guitar.</p>
<p>ATDI’s recorded output appears to have been a parallel to their internal dynamic-- <i>Relationship of Command </i>represented the culmination of everything they’ve done to date, their passions and ambitions given a healthy infusion of money. Their implosion appears to have been the result of the same ol’ rock‘n’roll bullshit often abetted by a healthy infusion of money and subsequent hype, i.e., rumored drug abuse, van accidents, cancelled tours at the <i>worst possible times</i>, “creative differences,” and ultimately the sort of long-standing resentments that inevitably fester when you spend nearly every waking moment of an entire decade with the same five people.</p>
<p>At the Drive-In never made a perfect record, though the bigger questions here have more to do with the actual reissuing than the records themselves. Bearing only a single track of bonus material, it’s tough to imagine what the public gets out of increased availability of what are, by far, the weakest and the most popular At the Drive-In releases. Moreover, the timing just feels unnecessarily cruel. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45517-no-new-at-the-drive-in-music-sorry/"">ATDI were so frank about their motivations for a reunion tour in 2012</a> that you had to take them at their word when they said had no plans to make another album. But that was before the dissolution of Mars Volta, a band that allowed Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez to achieve greater commercial success while simultaneously driving up the nostalgia and cred value of At the Drive-In. What’s stopping them now, other than Omar’s 12-dozen side projects?</p>
<p>And if you do feel invested in rock radio, it’s easy to mope about, thinking, “we sure could use another At the Drive-In.” This is a complaint that rings true on multiple levels: while I have plenty of anecdotal evidence of artists claiming to have been blown away by <i>Relationship of Command </i>as a teen, now that Thursday’s called it quits, the only bands that strike me as bearing any ATDI influence are dudes like Biffy Clyro or Alexisonfire, who are probably even further from the “indie” purview than Mars Volta. Or, maybe the cold administration of At the Drive-In’s legacy is its own sort of command, i.e., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45036-at-the-drive-in-reunite/"">“this station is non-operational unless we say so.”</a> They may have once been emo, but no ever said they were romantic.</p></div>"|17973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17973-at-the-drive-in-acrobatic-tenement-relationship-of-command/|6.5|Ian Cohen

<p>But while <i>Relationship of Command </i>is a juggernaut, it’s not invincible. For one thing, you can sense the fissures forming in ATDI’s songwriting team-- the undeniable chorus of “Invalid Litter Dept.” (you know, the “dancing on the corpses’ ashes” song) is necessary to make up for its stilted interjections and even if “Enfilade” is about half as long as a standard Mars Volta song, it packs in every bit as many chintzy production tricks. Iggy Pop shows up to whisper a ransom note at the beginning of ""Enfilade"" and shows up somewhere indeterminate on ""Rolodex Propaganda"", because he was available and this was a major label rock album in 2000. Meanwhile, <i>Relationship</i>’s second half anticipates the utilitarian modern rock of Ward’s Sparta; Wallace and ATDI are equally complicit in turning “Quarantined” into a leaden slog and “Cosmonaut” into an undifferentiated flurry of pugilistic guitar.</p>
<p>ATDI’s recorded output appears to have been a parallel to their internal dynamic-- <i>Relationship of Command </i>represented the culmination of everything they’ve done to date, their passions and ambitions given a healthy infusion of money. Their implosion appears to have been the result of the same ol’ rock‘n’roll bullshit often abetted by a healthy infusion of money and subsequent hype, i.e., rumored drug abuse, van accidents, cancelled tours at the <i>worst possible times</i>, “creative differences,” and ultimately the sort of long-standing resentments that inevitably fester when you spend nearly every waking moment of an entire decade with the same five people.</p>
<p>At the Drive-In never made a perfect record, though the bigger questions here have more to do with the actual reissuing than the records themselves. Bearing only a single track of bonus material, it’s tough to imagine what the public gets out of increased availability of what are, by far, the weakest and the most popular At the Drive-In releases. Moreover, the timing just feels unnecessarily cruel. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45517-no-new-at-the-drive-in-music-sorry/"">ATDI were so frank about their motivations for a reunion tour in 2012</a> that you had to take them at their word when they said had no plans to make another album. But that was before the dissolution of Mars Volta, a band that allowed Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez to achieve greater commercial success while simultaneously driving up the nostalgia and cred value of At the Drive-In. What’s stopping them now, other than Omar’s 12-dozen side projects?</p>
<p>And if you do feel invested in rock radio, it’s easy to mope about, thinking, “we sure could use another At the Drive-In.” This is a complaint that rings true on multiple levels: while I have plenty of anecdotal evidence of artists claiming to have been blown away by <i>Relationship of Command </i>as a teen, now that Thursday’s called it quits, the only bands that strike me as bearing any ATDI influence are dudes like Biffy Clyro or Alexisonfire, who are probably even further from the “indie” purview than Mars Volta. Or, maybe the cold administration of At the Drive-In’s legacy is its own sort of command, i.e., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45036-at-the-drive-in-reunite/"">“this station is non-operational unless we say so.”</a> They may have once been emo, but no ever said they were romantic.</p></div>"|17973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17973-at-the-drive-in-acrobatic-tenement-relationship-of-command/|8.3|Ian Cohen

It's been four years since the last one, the ambient leaning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12750-white-bird-release/""><i>White Bird Release</i></a>. If that record was all long, wintery shadows, this one brings in a touch of warmth from earlier Pan American recordings. The slight shift in tone is mirrored by a change in personnel, with Nelson bringing past collaborator Steven Hess on board as a full-time member of the band. Labradford's Bobby Donne contributes bass on certain songs, helping underpin the harsher sounds by providing a soft bedrock for the players to lean into. <i>Cloud Room, Glass Room</i> was designed to be played live, suggesting a few frayed edges might have cut into the sound. In fact, the opposite is true, with Nelson's fondness for clear-eyed production values still firmly intact.</p>
<p>Those subtle adjustments from the last Pan American record to this one haven't stopped Nelson from tooling around with customary fascinations. An undercurrent of dub sometimes swells up, the influence of <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>-style minimal techno can be felt. The way Nelson can beautifully guide a song via the peaks and troughs of his guitar playing must surely come easy to him at this point, although there's never a sense of him lapsing into auto-pilot. As such, anyone looking for a way in to Pan American would be wise to start at this relatively accessible point and work backward. Still, part of the charm of this project is the way it's staged in isolation, with little apparent concern for who is listening or where this music might sit with their peers. That sense of being loosely unanchored from the world gives <i>Cloud Room</i> its alien appeal, making its instrumental drift ripe for personal interpretation.</p>
<p>The ""live band"" approach taken on this album makes it feel a little more human than some of the heavily processed material that's come out under the Pan American name, such as 2000's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11798-360-business360-bypass/""><i>360 Business/360 Bypass</i></a>. It's especially apparent when Hess's percussion is given space to breathe, either as a root to the sound on the tender ""Relays"" or as a guiding force for the extended flashes of guitar squall on ""Virginia Waveform"". If that's disconcerting to longtime listeners, it shouldn't be; there's plenty of material that takes the ""guys in a room"" method and figures out how to make it sound like it couldn't have been made that way. ""Fifth Avenue 1960"" is a highlight, full of electronics treated with cavernous echo that fill out an undercurrent of menace that sporadically surfaces elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like most of the material Nelson has released over the years, the primary takeaway from <i>Cloud Room</i> is a notion of the control he exercises over his work no matter where it takes him. He can work around the white-light loops that flicker through understated pieces like ""Glass Room at the Airport"", or he can amass a towering stack of splintery discordance on ""Laurel South"". But there's always a sense of an assured hand guiding it all, bringing each part together to serve the greater whole. Even his wilder guitar pieces never reach the point where it feels like he's letting go and there's a sense of order being maintained, of advances being carefully spun through a strict framework. It feels good to be back here again, in a place that's become increasingly rare, but one flushed with a warm feeling of familiarity.</p></div>"|17945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17945-pan-american-cloud-room-glass-room/|7.1|Nick Neyland

The precious, old-timey piano waltz of “Beets United” found her intoning, in her sweet vinegar voice, “I need to stop singing in code/ To start ringing true because true rings only.” But it’s taken her until her third LP-- the second for <a href=""http://dongiovannirecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Giovanni</a>-- to feel she’s reached that point. She’s also dropped …and the Cans from her stage name (though they remain her backing band) and decided to deal with her demons: the realization that death is inevitable, and the ensuing battle between succumbing to futility, self-destruction, or balancing somewhere between the two. “There comes a time when you decide if you fight it off or learn to die,” she sings on “Triangle”, her snarl slight over her band’s crunching, good-timey wallop. It’s heavy stuff, but you wouldn’t immediately know it just by listening to <i>Wheel</i>, which spins a line in folk-rock bonhomie so sincere that a few gnarled sticks thrown in its spokes wouldn’t go amiss.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Long Islander isn’t exactly an open book on <i>Wheel</i>, but sticks to a neat scheme of metaphors to dress up her existential anguish. The characters in her songs are either trapped, cowed within disintegrating bodies (Stevenson is a big <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2659-jeff-mangum/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Mangum</a> fan, and it shows), hiding away from the world, still living within damaging, inescapable situations; or they’re trying to run, though beyond the general idea of escape, towards what and why is never that obvious. (Though the record’s most quotable line doesn’t fit either foot: “You’ll be a home for ungrateful drones who will churn your bones to butter,” she rails on “Swim Swim”, where California gets swallowed up by an earthquake and bees set down roots.)</p>
<p>Problem is, if Stevenson's lyrics are desperate and raw, her and her band's music bowls along blithely, neutering her newly on-show, distinct personal anguish: The sugary gait of “Renee” and “The Move”’s simpering softness fall halfway between <i>I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Bright Eyes</a> and the slightly self-satisfied cadence of popular, modern British folk. Standout single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14836-runner/"" target=""_blank"">“Runner”</a> is a weird, twangy anthem with a pop-punkish chorus (“This summer hurts! This summer hurts!”) that nods to Stevenson’s teenage obsession with Green Day and Operation Ivy. “Bells and Whistles” has similarly overflowing verses and indignant, punchy choruses to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31052-lady-lamb-the-beekeeper/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Lamb the Beekeeper</a>’s recent album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17723-lady-lamb-the-beekeeper-ripely-pine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ripely Pine</i></a>, but lacks Aly Spaltro’s taste for blood; “Every Tense” is strings-swollen and grave, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a> making Americana, “Telluride” the flagging third hour of a Bruce Springsteen outdoor show. You get the picture: Stevenson and band cover the full spectrum of 21<sup>st</sup> century populist folk, from hushed intimacy to torrid crescendo and dusk-lit festival stage rousing, a touch like latter-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"" target=""_blank"">Rilo Kiley</a>.</p>
<p><i>Wheel</i> is Stevenson’s first record with an outside producer: Kevin McMahon has previously worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>, so he should be a dab hand at managing vim and dread, but the thick arrangements and too-poignant string interludes often make Stevenson’s lyrics difficult to hear properly, and their tendency toward generic twang and climax gets old quickly. <i>Wheel</i> is accomplished, but does next to nothing you haven’t heard before and offers no original thrills.</p>
<p>It's no means an unpleasant record, however, and Stevenson is a winsome presence with a wild voice, and an occasional knack for compellingly weird hybrids; “Runner” and the Fiona Apple-does-Built to Spill vibe of “Eleonora” put a halfway idiosyncratic spin on theatrical, muscular folk rock. But it’s Laura Stevenson’s third album, and the third that leaves you feeling warmly disposed but unconvinced, gamely professing your interest to see what she does next time around. The rub is that the notion of potential unfulfilled is in part responsible for crushing her songs on this record, aspiring to templates and rafters that definitely don’t ring as true as Stevenson’s vividly impressionistic, twisted lyrics and psyche.</p></div>"|18037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18037-laura-stevenson-wheel/|6.2|Laura Snapes

To clarify a bit, this Santa Monica tropical-pop act does not strike me as transcendental or life-changing, though they could play a role in some really chill BBQs in the coming months. Rather, spend any amount of time with <i>Bigfoot</i> or, more pointedly, their video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io8PqddrRIs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""High School Lover""</a>, and something becomes very, very clear: There is almost no doubt that things just haven’t been the same for Zach Yudin since he heard the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11058-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">LP</a>. And rightfully so: It’s a phenomenal record and Vampire Weekend deserve to be a primary influence by this point. But while Yudin may have patterned his vocal inflection, choice of guitar, taste in graphic design and footwear selection after Ezra Koenig, <i>Bigfoot </i>is a record that could've taken a more important lesson to heart: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">why would you tape my conversations?</a></p>
<p>Maybe Yudin's just not a contra, but rather a young man who defines himself through a preoccupation with his latest crushes in both music and girls. That’s not a bad thing either, those are two concerns that can take up a lot of real estate in anyone's mind. It gives a measure of relatability to <i>Bigfoot</i>, which is very much a small-stakes record of serotonin-stoking songs about beaches, parties and girls, albeit from the wry, collegiate perspective that’s more post-grad Beach Week than beach bum. And as a vocalist, Yudin has an easy charm, writes elongated melodies that stick and has the good sense to repeat them just in case they don’t the first time around.</p>
<p>Sure, a lot of them are tracework: even without its jerky, stop-motion video, the “ay!”s punctuating “High School Lover” would immediately recal “A-Punk”; “Deep Sea” strolls the same quad as “Campus”; ""East Coast Girl""'s got the same new face that Blake did, and “Ayawa 'kya” sports the kind of onomatopoetic fake patois that people who hate Vampire Weekend assume they use in all of their songs. But falling shy of Koenig’s standards is hardly a crime and besides, Cayucas crib just as much from the first round of bands who caught the VW bug-- the parts of the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/"" target=""_blank"">Surfer Blood</a> album that actually sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a> on an island in the sun, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29187-lord-huron/"" target=""_blank"">Lord Huron</a>’s odd rocksteady moments, to name a few. Richard Swift unifies it all with a peculiar production touch that disengages Cayucas from these first-person story-songs; Yudin is distanced by bouncing reverb, the low-end is laced with static and scuffs, and samples of dialogue are disconnected from the lyrics. With all that in mind, Cayucas might just be a version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a> restricted to the past four years of indie rock rather than the past four decades of all rock music.</p>
<p>Which would be fine if Cayucas really were satisfied with hitting us off with California English and not much else, but Yudin's unmet lyrical ambitions cut against <i>Bigfoot</i>’s simple pleasures. Whereas the mere mention in Koenig’s lyrics of Tom’s toothpaste, a taxi driver’s white glove, or oxford commas can spark spirited debate about privilege, identity and image, well, who gives a fuck about a rugby sweater if all Yudin can share is that it’s got ""yellow and maroon stripes""? Despite peppering his lyrics with mentions of bicycles, old school BMWs, postcards and other simple pleasures of the West Coast well-off, they merely fill space; the girl who should’ve been his high school lover, the “Summer Thing”, and the “East Coast Girl” are pretty much interchangeable. On the latter, he mentions she’s majoring in “English literature,” but it signifies little, other than that it fit more easily into the melody than, say, “economics” or “general studies.”</p>
<p>Beyond Yudin’s massive artistic debt, Cayucas’ main flaw is failing to recognize the difference between leaving something to the imagination and making the listener do all the hard work. He’s observant, but lacks insight, descriptive without offering any commentary, nostalgic without feeling the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105057/trivia?tab=qt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pain from an old wound</a>.</p></div>"|17946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17946-cayucas-bigfoot/|4.9|Ian Cohen

A full orchestra and expensive synthetic tones provided the requisite sweep and height; the expected bombast and wonder. But it was hardly recognizable as music by Daft Punk, which was odd because their usual aesthetic would have been such a dynamic fit for the movie's neon world. The dance music auteurs all but vanished behind a deluxe sheen, into the idioms of <a href=""http://www.hans-zimmer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hans Zimmer</a> and <a href=""http://www.johnwilliams.org/reference/biography.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Williams</a>. Three years later, the scenario is playing out again with eerie accuracy: Ryan Dombal's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/"">review of the <i>Tron: Legacy</i> OST</a> would perfectly fit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>'s <i>Oblivion </i>OST with the replacement of a couple proper nouns.  </p>
<p>Like <i>Tron: Legacy</i>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Oblivion</i></a> is a sci-fi extravaganza, directed by Joseph Kosinski, where awesome visual spectacles are staged around a wispy emotional core. Once again, an acclaimed French electronic act pairs with Trapanese and forsakes its artistic identity to satisfy the generic musical conventions of summer blockbusters. Trapanese's orchestration and M83's poppy electronic shoegaze blended well on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/""><i>Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming</i></a>, the breakthrough album that opened the door for Anthony Gonzalez to make literally rather than figuratively ""cinematic"" music in the mainstream. The tradeoff is that Gonzalez by necessity adapts to Trapanese, the professional here, so thoroughly that it was startling to see M83 in the credits. That churning electronic fingerprint, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9110-anthony-gonzalez/"">reportedly deemed ""too indie""</a> for a Tom Cruise vehicle, is smeared out to an absurd degree. Why hire Gonzalez at all if you don't want raw indie eagerness?</p>
<p>Gonzalez is a masterful stylist, but an average composer at best, which makes the subtraction of his style rather fatal for the <i>Oblivion</i> OST as a standalone experience. The music is more unmemorable than bad, though occasionally Gonzalez's inexperience, which seems to limit what Trapanese can do as well, shows: ""Tech 49"" cheats its way from tense pulse to driving resolution with desultory orchestral passages, while ""Odyssey Rescue"" spatters an erratic path through ambiguously related parts, making us keenly aware of the missing onscreen action that would make sense of it. There are brighter spots: If you took ""Waking Up"" and changed the pounding timpani to synthetic toms, the string section to keyboards and arpeggiators, then you would have a generic but recognizable M83 song on your hands. And Gonzalez's signature arc, where arrangements seem to accelerate through space and then burst into flames upon atmospheric reentry, is evident in ""StarWaves"". But you have to listen pretty hard to hear the ghostly remains of his hand in these backdrops for chase scenes and dream sequences.   </p>
<p>Gonzalez does get one pure M83 moment on the title track, which is taut and effervescent with heartfelt vocals from Susanne Sundfør. More like it would have made for a better album that clashed terribly with the cold, inhuman film to which it was attached. It would be foolish to conflate one instance of creative compromise with M83 being compromised in principle. Artists needn't be slaves to their own visions all the time, and there's nothing wrong with working a job for pay. The only real problem with the <i>Oblivion</i> OST is that it was released as M83, which isn't a neutral funnel for Gonzalez's musical craftsmanship. It's a very specific set of promises that go badly unfulfilled. Gonzalez knows this, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9110-anthony-gonzalez/"">telling <i>Pitchfork</i></a> that he would have preferred to release it as ""Anthony Gonzalez and Joe Trapanese."" Universal, more interested in the brand than the man, disagreed. The people who buy action-movie OSTs-- whomever they are-- should be satisfied. But to M83 fans, this will just be a cautionary tale about an indie auteur turning his back on little machines he can control and getting mauled by a huge one-- Hollywood focus groups-- which he can't.</p></div>"|18022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18022-m83-oblivion-ost/|4.5|Brian Howe

But it would be wrong to assume that they <i>couldn’t</i> learn. Read David again: “If you <i>ignore </i>the chords…” Half Japanese made a choice. They weren’t clueless outsiders or deluded novices. Primitiveness was their calling, not their fate.</p>
<p>It was also their path to freedom. As David says, lack of knowledge can mean infinite options, and he and Jad explore a lot of them on <i>½ Gentleman / Not Beasts, </i>often touted as the first (and only) triple-LP debut in rock history. That may or may not be true, but it certainly was the least likely. Before it came out, the Fair brothers had made just a few 7-inches and cassettes, recorded at home (where they lived with their parents) and released on their own label, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Skidillion_Watts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">50 Skidillion Watts</a>. (One of those early tapes was called <i>½ Gentlemen / ½ Beasts</i>, but the Fairs changed it to <i>Not Beasts </i>for the box since, according to David, “we’re nice guys.”) British label Armageddon’s offer to put out a box set was so unusual that, when interviewed in the Half Japanese documentary <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107071/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Band That Would Be King</a></i>, the Fairs’ parents could only compare it to a then-new box set by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p>Musically, though, giving Half Japanese six album sides to fill with their spilling ideas made a lot of sense. In no less than 50 songs (now 86 on Fire’s 4LP reissue), the Fair brothers injected their caveman racket-- usually crafted solely on cardboard-sounding drums and strangled guitar-- into loud punk blasts, shapeless rants, heartfelt confessions, minimal experiments, audio collages, and twisted covers of their heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3572-jonathan-richman/"">Jonathan Richman</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15153-buddy-holly/"">Buddy Holly</a>. Some songs sound like a suburban parallel to the concurrent, atonal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6764-no-the-origins-of-no-wave/"">no wave</a> movement in New York (David’s chord-avoiding guitar is often a dead ringer for the dissonant shrieks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1222-dna/"">DNA</a>’s Arto Lindsay). But Half Japanese replaced no wave’s burned-out nihilism with sleeve-worn, open-wound emotion.</p>
<p>Much of that emotion comes from Jad’s adolesecent voice and love-letter lyrics. On bracingly honest cuts like “Shy Around Girls”, “Dream Date”, and “School of Love”, he brings the sentimentality of a lovelorn teenager to the musical equivalent of primal scream therapy. (It’s telling that, according to later member <a href=""file://localhost/ttp/::en.wikipedia.org:wiki:Don_Fleming_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Fleming</a>, David claimed that Half Japanese had two kinds of songs: “Monster songs and love songs.”) With these proto-emo bombs, the Fairs predicted a lot of future lo-fi rock, especially the home-taped ballads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a> and the nursery-rhyme swing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a>.</p>
<p>But don’t mistake Half Japanese’s naked emotion for naïveté-- Jad and David knew exactly what they were doing. That’s especially clear in <i>½ Gentlemen</i>’s audio experiments, which can be surprisingly formal. The bass cycling through “Du Du Du / Du Du Du” evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>-style minimalism; the repeated notes and found sounds on “T / T / T / T / T” would fit on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a> LP; the slashing guitar and wordless babble of “Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr” suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/280-derek-bailey/"">Derek Bailey</a> backing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a>; and “Jad Interview”, one of Fire’s bonus tracks, is a word-jazz-like vocal-collage. These aren’t random noodlings that hit on something by chance. There’s clear thought behind each construction, ironic considering how loose the more traditional “songs” are.</p>
<p>Another sign that Half Japanese were more clever than they looked is <i>½ Gentlemen</i>’s sly sense of humor. You can hear Jad and David winking through the fake-protest chant “No More Beatle Mania” (“once was enough!” Jad screams), the drooling whine of “I Don’t Want to Have Mono No More”, and the rock-fantasy-camp scenario of “Battle of the Bands”, wherein “backup singers” Mick Jagger and Johnny Rotten are too busy watching David to actually sing. Even funnier are the prankster-ish cover versions, wherein the band rambles through classics as if blindfolded. Jad never alters his singing style throughout “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a> Medley” (another Fire bonus track), the musical equivalent of Andy Kaufman <a href=""http://youtu.be/r59AWfhwpPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doing impressions</a> by merely reciting lines without changing his “Foreign Man” voice. If anyone thought Half Japanese was a hoax, David and Jad were clearly happy to feed that rumor. Yet their brazen refusal to conform to the originals captures the Stooges’ spirit more than any faithful cover could.</p>
<p>All this fearless amateurism can make <i>½ Gentlemen </i>a brutal listen. As their career went on, Half Japanese gradually turned their monster love songs into more listenable tunes that influenced a generation of indie rockers (most famously, Kurt Cobain brought them along on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>’s <i>In Utero </i>tour and was wearing their t-shirt when he died). But <i>½ Gentlemen</i>, in its near-giddy willingness to push sound past the limits of amps and tape recorders, is more a precursor to noisy rock experiments like the kiddie nightmares of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Flowers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Happy Flowers</a>, the trash-can blues of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9569-pussy-galore/"">Pussy Galore</a>, or the early splatter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a>.</p>
<p>Still, even at its most grating, there’s always a loudly-beating heart inside <i>1/2 Gentlemen</i>. It’s earnest, eager, and takes a wry view of the world that makes it endearing. And it’s so hard to predict what’s going to happen at any given point that the music never feels dated. Because it was based mostly on their own hermetic ideas, the Fair brothers’ primitivism blasts through the years, too hot for any time period to hold onto. Maybe that’s the best thing about <i>½ Gentlemen / Not Beasts</i>: even today, over three decades later, you can picture Jad and David banging it out in their parents’ house, thrilled at what they’re discovering.</p></div>"|17841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17841-half-japanese-12-gentlemen-not-beasts/|9.2|Marc Masters

They called their new personal best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15228-coliseum-fuzzbang/"">""Fuzzbang""</a>, the title alone obviously a dare to mindlessly hit the play button. Far lesser songs have had titles like ""Fuzzbang""-- tracks that are all power and no substance. This song actually says something substantial, addressing ignorance in certain sects of Christianity and the neverending, painful churn of everyday life. With, yes, a fuzzed out guitar, frontman Ryan Patterson sells the message with a killer opening guitar solo, which is the core of the track. He sings about the ""end of days"" in the chorus, but Patterson, bassist Kayhan Vaziri, and drummer Carter Wilson let their instruments soar with the kind of hopeful, anthemic melody that's more aesthetically fitting of a Bruce Springsteen song. In less than four minutes, with a couple of false endings thrown in for good measure, they pair lyrics that plead for change with an unstoppable hook. It's a ridiculously fun-sounding song, albeit one with a bruised spirit.</p>
<p>It's also the final track on <i>Sister Faith</i>, the band's fourth album in a decade. It's a ridiculously solid way to end an album, and it's also the bow that wraps up the LP's thematic territory. Sometimes, the material is more commonplace than it may suggest on its hard rock surface. ""Used Blood"" is about the phenomenon of people talking without really listening or saying anything of substance. When Patterson sings ""we'll disappear from sight"" in the album's opening track, he's actually stressing the importance of holding on to happy memories. Hell, ""Everything in Glass"" is a <i>love song</i>. He's tempted by the world's evils, but when <i>she</i> comes around, everything is clearer. And when he sings about her, the music sounds a little brighter. </p>
<p>But this is an album called <i>Sister Faith</i>; it's packaged with graphics (by Patterson) featuring skulls and religious symbols. Naturally, they cover substantially heavier and more existential themes, too. Most prominently: the inevitability of death, the absurdity of faith, and what it means to be alive when everything will eventually come to an end. ""Save Everything"" refuses to acknowledge the validity behind the idiom ""you can't take it with you."" ""I can take it all with me,"" he refutes. ""I can save everything."" One of <i>Sister Faith</i>'s weightiest track is also its most sonically subtle. While every other song on the album ramps up both feedback and power, ""Love Under Will"" smolders. Patterson's growl is tempered, there's more room between each drum hit, and everything is marked by more echo and empty space. Although it could easily be a metaphor for a crumbling relationship, it outlines the terrifying prospect of what love means when you believe in eternity.</p>
<p>Again, though, this is the same band who recorded that unstoppable riff in ""Fuzzbang""-- not everything here is a grim rumination on life and death. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14775-black-magic-punks/"">""Black Magic Punks""</a>, for example, is sort of goofy when you stack it next to the rest of these songs. It's about witchcraft-wielding punk rockers ""with the black jeans and the black t-shirts"" whose power somehow derives from ""decades of sweat from punks unheard."" It's certainly not as deep as several other tracks here, but with another great hook and some complementary vocals from Boris' Wata, it sounds awesome.</p>
<p>In terms of chugging rock'n'roll, the album sits comfortably next to Torche and Baroness, not to mention the work of their producer J. Robbins. It was recorded in Robbins' Magpie Cage studio in Baltimore, and the album smacks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"">Jawbox</a>' knack for pairing guitars-- a distorted low end with a crisp upper register. Patterson's guitar often teeters between the atmosphere of <i>Dead Man</i>-era Neil Young and the sludge of <i>Paranoid</i>-era Tony Iommi. It's a sound they do really well, almost to a fault. At times, these songs go on for a bit too long. A bigger obstacle is their lack of variety-- ""Love Under Will"" is the only significant gear shift in the LP's 13 tracks. But ultimately, these complaints are for an album packed with huge hooks, which all sound great when you play them really loud. Just listen to the monstrous way Patterson belts the word ""O-CU-LAR"" on ""Under the Blood of the Moon"". You don't want this band to slow down.</p></div>"|17940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17940-coliseum-sister-faith/|7.5|Evan Minsker

After all, the first 13 minutes of <i>Withdrawal</i>, the excellent new album by Brooklyn-via-Philadelphia black metal quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4617-woe/"" target=""_blank"">Woe</a>, are a torrent of animosity and unrest, with little relief intended or available. Opener “This is the End of the Story” is a six-minute span of negativity, every bit as dense as its title suggests. Its chaser, “Carried by Waves to Remorseless Shores of the Truth”, might be a stronger swill still, especially with frontman Chris Grigg groaning at the beginning as though he’s actually been washed to the wrong side of the Styx. This is battering and unfettered stuff, so it would seem logical for Woe to reveal a rest area. They do, but it lasts only as long as those 25 seconds of gentle, dulcet picking. Rather than indulge in atmosphere like many of their more ornate USBM peers, Woe simply counts off the beat and rips into a blitz once again. Call it a feint, a bait-and-switch or a tease if you must; just try and avoid whiplash if you can.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Withdrawal</i> flashes by with that same sense of determination, as though Woe are incapable of slowing down, of letting their fury smolder just long enough to glimpse it from above. Neither Grigg nor second guitarist Ben Brand take excessive solos, while the rhythm section of drummer Ruston Grosse and bassist Grzesiek Czapla stays decidedly on task, embedding their intricacies deep within these seven surges rather than apart from them. Perhaps that marked urgency is due to the feeling that Woe has to make up some time.</p>
<p>To wit, Grigg has written and recorded as Woe for six years now, first as a one-man-metal band and, on 2010’s Candlelight Records debut <i>Quietly, Undramatically</i>, with a quartet. The transition wasn’t a good one. Though <i>Quietly, Undramatically</i> had spans of promise, it also felt undecided, as though Grigg was trying to figure out how to use a full band now that he actually had one. Various lulls and tangents made it seem that Grigg was intimidated by the addition of this outfit, as though he were trying to push his music outward simply because now he could.</p>
<p>Consider the lost time salvaged, then: <i>Withdrawal</i> is an unforgiving record with an unbroken focus. These seven songs mostly stop only when they’re over. As a lyricist, Grigg erects a bleak, withering kingdom, where cities flood with poison, nihilism is a sharable confection, and, romantically, “the sum of virtue is rot.” Woe take these words as roadmaps, using them as the impetus for music that races ahead as though the end of the world is not only preordained but imminent. “Ceaseless Jaws”, for instance, concerns the fall of pride and, namely, the end of a relationship; the band plays like there’s little left to lose, waves of interwoven guitar cresting and slinking and wrapping through drums that move from heavy to heavier, with bass filling any open air with an intentionally muddy tone. The band pauses for 16 seconds at the song’s center, but that brief guitar miniature mostly underlines the heaviness of the entire trek.</p>
<p>This directness shouldn’t be mistaken as simplicity or, worse, historical facsimile. (We’d hate to disappoint <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323550604578413220695424606.html)%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our metallectual friends</a>, you know.) It’s just that the intricacy of Woe’s music-- and there’s plenty of it-- doesn’t interfere with its immediacy. The brilliant “Song of My Undoing” begins with the sort of big, ebullient crossover blast that you might expect on recent Darkthrone albums. During these seven minutes, though, Czapla, who sings quite a bit here, counters the surge with a hook so soft it sounds like Alcest. Both parts serve as twin springboards into the song’s back half, when the thickness of those vocals and the wallop of the punk'n'roll funnel into a crucible of hardcore, black metal, and thrash. During “Carried by Waves”, Grigg races forward from the record’s most acrobatic solo with a rant-sized verse delivered with such gusto that it feels like a chorus-- something you memorized and wait for when you listen back. It’s an ingenious way to drop a hook into a song where the tide seems much too troubled for such.</p>
<p>Within the United States black metal scene, Woe has peers that are certainly fancier-- ones with longer, grander compositions that twist and stretch and spiral, and those that reach far outside of traditional guitars-drums-bass configurations to make their cases. But on <i>Withdrawal</i>, one of the young year’s most irrepressible and energized metal records, Woe plays with an urgency that suggests they have a chip on their collective shoulder and a point to prove. After <i>Quietly, Undramatically</i>, after all, Grigg recruited an almost entirely new lineup for Woe. Perhaps that’s why this quartet plays with such tenacity and economy. It’s hard to fire people doing their jobs this unabashedly well. </p></div>"|17678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17678-woe-withdrawal/|8.0|Grayson Currin

Evoking eras without highlighting their most obvious reference points-- all in the process of concocting internationally minded jazz-funk without definitively pointing towards specific geographical sources-- drummer Malcolm Catto assembled a group that only loosely hinted at nostalgic exotica. Instead, they became a live-band culmination of every obsessive hip-hop-era producer's drive to fall deeper into a rabbit hole of the previously unheard. That they were able to translate that experience into collaborative albums with Middle Eastern music scholar Lloyd Miller and Ethio-jazz cornerstone Mulatu Astatke was not only a big honor, but a fitting one.</p>
<p>And yet with all their previous works' engagement with this hazy '70s-via-'90s-via-now sample-source sound, <i>13 Degrees of Reality </i>finds another angle. The catch is that this their new common thread is a nervous, conspiracy-minded anxiety, the kind that burbles up during points in recent history when the horrible seems feasible. There's not really anything inherently dread-inducing about the Heliocentrics' music itself, which ranges anywhere from delicate beauty to sweaty-palmed intensity. But it can be convincingly heard as a soundtrack to justified paranoia when the first voices on the album are George H.W. Bush's invocation of the “New World Order” segueing into Malcolm X revealing the American dream as an “American nightmare.”</p>
<p>A front-to-back listen hints at barely-controlled chaos simmering for a bit before fading into a wide, dusty horizon. Second track “Ethnicity” reveals a twitchy energy, built off twanging strings, mountainous hard rock breaks, and wandering melodic chimes so distorted by reverb they could be anything from marimbas to thumb pianos. “Mysterious Ways” folds the rhythm section from Can's “Vitamin C” into origami, flips the speed to 45, and jabs at it with analog-electronic stings that have all the interrogatory jabber of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Ra</a>'s more chaotic pieces. And “Descarga Electronica” hammers out tendon-snapping MPB rhythms drenched in a glaze of bristly guitar feedback. But everything eventually flattens out into an almost meditative reverie once “Wrecking Ball” and its 7-and-change minutes of gauzy, slow-motion acid-funk emerges. By the time the twangy desert soul of “Mr. Owusu, I Presume?” and the rain-drenched, humid glimmer of the kalimba-spattered “Black Sky” seep through the speakers, it feels like snapping out of a jarring but invigorating low orbit into something a bit more free-floating and warm.</p>
<p>Brief interludes call up the defiant croak of William S. Burroughs (“No, we will <i>not </i>listen to you, we have had enough of your common bullshit”) and distant-sounding transmissions from creepy-sounding entities who claim to have access to peoples' dreams and minds. But the album, even as it strings these clips together, isn't some kitschy freak-out montage. It's got the breadth of a comprehensively adventurous band, able to balance a steady <i>motorik </i>churn midway between Kraut and deep soul while letting the pull of improvisational tangents and dub distortion shift the picture. If that style can pull off the tense resistance that the distorted voice clips hint at, it also works as its own thing-- an unnerving album composed of alluring pieces.</p></div>"|17962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17962-heliocentrics-13-degrees-of-reality/|7.9|Nate Patrin

In 2006, when Charlotte Aitchison turned 14, she started recording a later-shelved album she has more recently disowned as ""fucking terrible MySpace music."" Now, almost seven years later, her proper debut album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> can hardly avoid comparisons to Tumblr, from fans and detractors alike. </p>
<p>A simple misreading of the UK singer and songwriter's biggest hit might explain this focus on technology-based shorthand. Swedish electro-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30420-icona-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Icona Pop</a>'s 2012 global smash <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9015-the-top-100-tracks-of-2012/6/"">""I Love It""</a>, co-written by Charli XCX but not on <i>True Romance</i>, emphasizes a generational divide: ""You're from the 70s/ And I'm a 90s bitch."" Sure, Aitchison was born in 1992, but her use of social-media formats also long frequented by droves of people born in the 1970s isn't exactly remarkable in 2013. As that catchy kiss-off's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgffRW1fKDk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Republica</a>-on-EDM wattage illuminates, Charli XCX is a would-be 90s <i>pop star</i>, too. And in only the best sense.</p>
<p><i>True Romance</i> shares its title with an unbelievably well-cast 1993 movie written by Quentin Tarantino, who was reassembling cultural detritus way before mash-ups and microblogging. Charli XCX's approach to pop is similarly postmodern (how 90s does <i>that</i> sound?), pulling from moody 80s synth-pop, sassy turn-of-the-millennium girl groups, and state-of-the-art contemporary producers to create something distinctive and immediately memorable. She clearly understands the internet, having shared two original mixtapes and two influences mixtapes before her official full-length, but this carefully pruned set is no data dump. And there you'll see a glimmer of <i>True Romance</i>'s most throwback aspect: its evident pop ambition, an overriding sense of an imagined mass audience for music that's radio-ready yet outsider-friendly. It's almost like Napster-- and the filler-crammed album sales model that preceded it-- never happened.</p>
<p>In fact, by the time Charli XCX was a teenage electro-house devotee, illegal file-sharing's early free-for-all had already given way to iTunes and other legal download services. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a> had already released her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6949-robyn/"">self-titled comeback album</a>. So it might be only natural that Charli XCX would keep the pre-bubble faith that people will pay for emotionally direct, bubblegum-catchy, yet stubbornly left-of-center songs about falling in and out of love. But the generous hooks on the previously released singles here, such as the gospel-kissed prechorus of the yearning ""Stay Away"" or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a>-savvy lilt of love-and-the-bomb brooder ""Nuclear Seasons"", are extraordinarily welcome just the same. Even better are newer singles such as the gorgeously bitter ""You (Ha Ha Ha)"", which inhabits its cloud-rappy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a> sample like they were made for each other, and the almost-as-gorgeously blissful ""What I Like"", which recounts a still-young relationship with the cheeky frankness of Lily Allen or the Streets, and the sing-songy near-rapping of the Spice Girls.</p>
<p>The several songs on <i>True Romance</i> that hadn't previously surfaced in videos or other releases aren't quite as strong, but they're effective enough to suggest Charli XCX's best work might still be ahead of her. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Rundgren</a>-sampling ""So Far Away"", with the sun-dappled lushness of the Avalanches, is a clear highlight; Charli XCX's vocals are usually plain-spoken, but the anguished break-up plea ""Set Me Free"" proves she can reach for <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a>-like dramatics when appropriate. The pitch-shifting ""no one is forever"" intro added at the start of opener ""Nuclear Seasons"" probably should've been given its own track-- and later on the album it is, when the same backing vocal forms the base of the cloudy, broken-hearted ""Grins"". Elsewhere, the haunted confession ""How Can I"", while solid enough, is a reminder that Charli XCX's lyrics so far tend to fall relatively flat; when, on swooning finale ""Lock You Up"", she sings, ""It hits me like a ton of bricks,"" she leaves the cliché untweaked.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Cloud Aura"", a lovelorn, engagingly laid-back bit of groove that lets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/directors-cut/8929-grimes/"">""Genesis"" video</a> co-star Brooke Candy rap horribly about Chris Brown. Candy's guest verse previously appeared on 2012's uneven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17457-super-ultra/""><i>Super Ultra</i> mixtape</a>, and it was near-universally panned. It isn't any better now. But in an era when too many up-and-comers are all too eager to please, this stubborn refusal to back down displays another quality in short supply: genuine irreverence. The songwriting and production credits on <i>True Romance</i> include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">Usher</a>'s ""Climax"" co-conspirator Ariel Rechtshaid and ""I Love It"" collaborator Patrick Berger, among others, who also share some credit (and blame). But like 90s pop stars turned 10s pop sophisticates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>, Charli XCX stamps her personality across the entire project, and <i>True Romance</i> suggests she'll be worth following for a while. On Tumblr, Instagram, and whatever comes next, sure, but musically most of all.</p></div>"|17880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17880-charli-xcx-true-romance/|8.3|Marc Hogan

But the arrival of spring isn't a guilty pleasure, nor is it high art; which makes <i>Ultramarine</i>'s timing extremely fortuitous, at it's every bit as enjoyable <i>because</i> of its satisfying, innocent immediacy, not in spite of it.</p>
<p>Young Galaxy’s starburst electro-pop can seem awfully naïve: After tapping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"" target=""_blank"">Studio</a>’s Dan Lissvik to produce their third album, a major transition from the wan, post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a> electrogaze of their debut to slick sophisti-pop, they actually called the results <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15075-shapeshifting/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shapeshifting</i></a>. At its best, <i>Ultramarine'</i>s intentions are just as overtly pop and candid, most powerfully demonstrated by the astonishing “Pretty Boy”, a song which hits its mark with such truth and utter lack of guile, it’s hard to believe it hasn’t been around for decades. From McCandless’ first lyric (“When we were lost/ We found each other/ And headed sightless for the city”), you’re picturing a classic us-vs.-them romantic archetype, something most bands would to be too self-conscious to even consider. Yet while McCandless’ words remain economical throughout, they hint at an underlying reality in the verses that feels devastating (“I felt no pain when you changed your name/ We were each other’s only family”) until it’s overpowered by the reassurance of the chorus (“I know you feel isolated/ And I feel what you won’t say”).</p>
<p>It’s a song powered by emotional dynamism as decimating as any soft-loud chorus explosion, breaking your heart before melting it back into something solid and functioning. The music complies, as its star-crossed narrators are either protected or quarantined from anyone besides each other. Lissvik’s production is clean without being clinical, detailed without clutter-- a pinging <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> arpeggio cycles along while shakers, assorted blips, and harmonies wheel upward, giving the sonic field of “Pretty Boy” a three-dimensional, all-encompassing immersion.</p>
<p>You can’t blame Young Galaxy for leading off with such a monumental song, yet putting it first might feel like a misstep; surely, they’d want to <i>build </i>to this kind of emotional peak. Fortunately, the next two are strong enough to withstand the impact of “Pretty Boy”, and for about 12 minutes, <i>Ultramarine </i>is astounding in its execution. Both “Fall For You” and “New Summer” offer different moods than “Pretty Boy”-- the former is Bo Diddley-beat reframed as irrepressibly sunny Swedish reggae, while the latter slowly aspires to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>’s interstellar overdrive. Like ""Pretty Boy"", they introduce the stakes in urgent, Springsteen-ian terms (“I work the mines ‘til the break of dawn,” “Meet me by the river, let’s go for a ride with the windows down and the stereo loud”) and use the hooks to offer escapism that feels redemptive even if it isn’t the least bit believable. Hurry up, we’re dreaming, you know?</p>
<p>It’s no slight to say nothing on <i>Ultramarine </i>matches its opening triad-- not much does. The remainder of it is solid, though it shows a band still using established pop framework in lieu of a personality. To that end, it makes sense that Stephen Ramsay would cede full control of lead vocals to McCandless, solidifying their identity and giving Young Galaxy a true frontperson on their breakthrough album. But while McCandless is a capable vocalist, she’s not a commanding one and it leaves Young Galaxy unable to truly deliver the goods on dancefloor diva-oriented material. McCandless is confident enough to smolder on “In Fire” and “Fever”, though attitude or grit would set them ablaze. When she tries to infuse boldness through her lyrics, it only stresses her brittle tone-- “I don’t need authenticity/ To make me more like me” sounds like a self-help recitation rather than a firm belief during the generic glam shuffle “What We Want”, while “Hard To Tell” spends its entire four minutes recovering from McCandless declaring “for you, I am a gangster,” one of the points where you wish Young Galaxy had some kind of ironic capacity.</p>
<p>But those are ultimately quibbles that prevent <i>Ultramarine</i> from being<i> </i>a truly great record rather than one of 2013’s stronger pop albums. The back half still hits squarely, if not as hard as the beginning: the gooey gumdrop “Sleepwalk With Me” is a strong closing argument for ""synth-pop sweethearts"" as Young Galaxy’s best incarnation, and while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9109-coachella-2013/"">the kids at Coachella weren’t feeling the Stone Roses</a>, “Out the Gate Backwards” utilizes the powerfully nostalgic sound of bar room piano loops, glassy guitar delay, and plasticine bongos to prove Madchester can still twist melons. That a burgeoning remix community has sprung up around “Pretty Boy” and “New Summer” without drastically changing the underlying material can just serve as further proof that <i>Ultramarine</i> is strong enough to withstand whatever way you choose to enjoy it, whether it’s shuffling the top-heavy sequencing or just playing “Pretty Boy” on repeat to your heart’s content. It’s generous like that.</p></div>"|17924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17924-young-galaxy-ultramarine/|7.8|Ian Cohen

Ray grew weary of the melodramatic band name, apparently, and all it implied, so Teen Suicide perished, and the hushed and lovely indie pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31228-julia-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Brown</a> was born. Ray introduced his new band to his fans with a defensive flourish: ""If you liked Teen Suicide 'cause of pop songwriting you'll probably like the new band but if you just liked the really over-dramatic drug addict depression catharsis stuff you'll be disappointed and I'll be glad,"" he <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/teensuicideisbad/posts/395259860561335"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> on the Teen Suicide Facebook page. He probably didn't need to issue such a ringing pronouncement; Julia Brown, while softer, explore similar darkness with a sweet sadness that does, in fact, feel grown-up.</p>
<p><i>To Be Close to You</i> is their first official release. It was recorded straight to tape, an act of aesthetic devotion that ensures singular focus on things like incidental sounds: In between songs, you hear doodly guitar moments, muffled coughs, the muttering and teasing of his band mates. Tape hiss isn't a background element here, it's an instrument: on some songs, it's practically the lead singer. ""Recorded at various places over a long period of time,"" the liner notes indicate, and you can hear, in the busy shuffling of the players and the constantly changing room-space, the tape player being plopped in a series of bedrooms.</p>
<p>For lo-fi or home-taping pop aficionados, this kind of sound world is a reward in itself, and for hardcore fans, <i>To Be Close to You</i> will be instantly inviting. The sound has the blotted, bleedy edges you associate with the tape medium; every sharp edge smoothed out, every sound muffled and half-swallowed. <i>To Be Close to You</i> streams by in a soothing murmur that registers as intimate above all.</p>
<p>The sound is so warm and reassuring that you initially miss the complexity and craft of the music. But on repeated listens, you hear a serious songwriter's mind at work. The glimmering riff on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15198-library/"" target=""_blank"">""Library""</a> is based on a simple chord progression, but Ray's dense, arpeggiated playing locates a hypnotically cyclical tune in it that is almost as catchy as his unassuming vocal lead. When the song launches into double time, a sawing viola traces the arc of Ray's melody before he sings it. There are surprising corners to stumble on in the arrangements: the brooding ""i will do this for the rest of my life"" ends with some skirling backwards guitars, while ""i was my own favorite tv show the summer my tv broke"" ends in a little pink-blue sunset of viola, cello, glockenspiel, and harmonium. ""Virginia"" is built on a rickety saloon piano in 3/4 time. A few of the songs repeat themselves in acoustic demo form, just in case you like them better that way, and to give you a better sense of how they were built.</p>
<p>It's also a pleasure to eventually discover Sam Ray's dark, sometimes-mordant lyrics, which are also lying just beneath the cottony yawn of the tape. The bleak ""how I spent my summer"" opens with a brief recorded clip of someone muttering ""I was doing heroin in my car and listening to 'Genius of Love',"" the word ""heroin"" scrambled slightly. The lyrics depict someone reeling from a loss they cannot process: ""I will move your clothes from one side of the bed to the other/ I will stay in your bed all day/ Whatever it takes/ Taking Valium."" ""i will do this for the rest of my life"" turns on the shrugging refrain, ""I guess you mean more to me than nothing,"" sung in an upward lilt that sounds like the sentiment from a construction-paper Valentine. In the song's coda, Ryan Wilson mutters ""I'm trying not/ To feel anything"" repeatedly.</p>
<p>The sweetly unassuming kind of home-made pop music that Julia Brown make is easily overlooked when it is untethered from its home base; so much of indie-pop's magic resides in its locality, and in the connections forged by flyers, 7-inches, and shows. In their Baltimore stomping grounds, Julia Brown seem like they're a big deal. In the great sea of the internet, where one small bauble after another can be plucked and cast back just as quickly, this stuff can have a harder time standing apart. But <i>To Be Close to You</i> rewards any undivided attention you are willing to give it. Ray's gift is as substantial as his touch is light, and at its best <i>To Be Close to You</i> hearkens back to the spirit of some of the broken-hearted, scrofulous sweeties of the Pacific Northwest during the 90s: Elliott Smith, for instance, or Modest Mouse during their K Records years. Ray <a href=""http://www.portalsmusic.com/2013/01/features/introducing-julia-brown/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indicated</a> recently that he had hit the limits of lo-fi recording techniques, and was looking to expand outward: His vision seems big enough to accomodate whatever canvas he works on next.</p></div>"|18017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18017-julia-brown-to-be-close-to-you/|7.9|Jayson Greene

In his review of the band's second album, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12787-the-law-of-the-playground/"">The Law of the Playground</a></i>, Marc Hogan spent a considerable amount of time grappling with the album's outmoded feel, ultimately concluding that the record was ""especially out of step in 2009."" Four years later, that statement still rings true: while the reigning hip sound has shifted from Hogan's descriptions of harsh tones and flawless Auto-Tune to a sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8981-a-small-pop/"">omnivorous polyglot pop</a>, the thoroughly twee vibe and simple songcraft of The Boy Least Likely To remains surprisingly anachronistic. Divorced from the context of the larger pop landscape, the band's new album <i>The Great Perhaps</i> finds Jof Owen and Pete Hobbs progressing at their own pace, exploring new sounds and becoming decreasingly reliant on the juxtaposition of child-like sonics and mature lyrical themes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The finest moments on The Great Perhaps typically revolve around the band's deployment of a previously unheard influence or instrument. Early single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15225-climbing-out-of-love/"">""Climbing Out of Love""</a> is constructed around an indelible, bubbly synth hook and a basic, cycling acoustic guitar riff: the result is a touching electro-acoustic pop curio that's reminiscent of the brightest cuts from Bright Eyes' 2005 oddity <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"">Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</a></i>. Another highlight is the gentle ballad ""Michael Collins,"" which flashes a second or two of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a>-like drum machine haze before taking a right turn into tasteful string orchestration and harmonies that could've been ripped from a late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"">Band of Horses</a> B-side. It's apparent that Hobbs and Owen have been digesting the work of several of their contemporaries, and the deployment of those influences is consistently strong on <i>The Great Perhaps</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's other great successes find Owen focusing on specific narratives and fleshing out songs with certain lyrical details, rather than sticking to basic rhymes and big-picture concepts. ""Michael Collins"" uses the imagined experience of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an early American astronaut</a> to set up a consideration of our lack of perspective, and the combination of that big lyrical reveal with aforementioned vocal harmony is strikingly touching. Elsewhere, on the slow-paced lament ""The Dreamer Song,"" Owen's mention of small items like flimsy spring blossoms and gin-lemonade cocktails greatly flesh out an otherwise standard tale of hopeless romanticism.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, a few songs over the course of <i>The Great Perhaps</i>' could use a lot more of this sort of detail. The album's weakest songs lean too heavily on the crutch of pairing sonic whimsy with adult rumination on love and loneliness, and the result is a handful of maudlin cuts couched in cliché. In this vein, the album's nadir is the blessedly quick ""Even Jesus Couldn't Mend My Broken Heart"", which marries a sparkly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiggles-worthy</a> synth melody to the hopeless titular claim. The shock of this combination transcends surprise and quickly zooms into the realm of questionable taste; it feels like a cheap trick, especially given the mature construction of the album's second half.</p>
<p>There's a certain comfort found in following a band whose slow, subtle growth seems entirely separated from the rapidly changing indie pop landscape. <i>The Great Perhaps</i> is another modestly successful step for The Boy Least Likely To, reassurance that the band is still cranking out thoughtful, gentle work.</p></div>"|17986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17986-the-boy-least-likely-to-the-great-perhaps/|7.1|Jamieson Cox

This doesn’t necessarily mean she’s evil-- in some stories, she’s a benign or even helpful figure-- but she’s certainly mythical and definitely mysterious. For starry-eyed cosmic country-rock band <a href=""http://www.futurebirdsmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Futurebirds</a>, Baba Yaga is also a metaphor, for the rigors the Athens-based outfit endured while trying to locate a label to put out its stunning second record, and for the ambiguous darkness that peers inside the lush sprawl of their beautiful, foreboding songs.</p>
<p>Futurebirds have been honing this sound-- a loose-limbed tangle of reverbed guitars, hollered harmonies, and driving yet contemplative Southern rock rhythms-- over the course of two EPs, 2010’s full-length debut <i>Hampton’s Lullaby</i>, and countless gigs in support of kindred spirits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"" target=""_blank"">the Drive-By Truckers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4885-heartless-bastards/"" target=""_blank"">Heartless Bastards</a>. For <i>Baba Yaga, </i>they spent seven months sneaking in and out of recording sessions between tours, eventually amassing 30 songs. (Since there are currently five songwriters in the band, material tends to pile up over time.) Eventually the record was pared-down to 13 tracks, but after languishing for months without a label, Futurebirds began to worry whether its new record would ever be heard. The band decided to keep on touring, and share the songs with live audiences, in the hope that someone would notice. (Fat Possum later agreed to put out <i>Baba Yaga</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Baba Yaga</i> is very much an “on tour” record; the controlled chaos of Futurebirds’ live shows translates on record like never before. You feel the energy, forgive any flubbed notes, and soak in the past-midnight revelry. Many tracks extend past the five-minute mark, with the excess padding coming from guitar solos stacked upon guitar solos, and boisterous sing-alongs allowed to go on for several extra beats. <i>Baba Yaga </i>nails the melancholy of trying to chase and pin down something that’s special and fleeting, because Futurebirds were clearly doing the same when recording these songs. This “something” might be best described as relief; Futurebirds’ twin obsessions on <i>Baba Yaga </i>are dysfunctional relationships and death, with the music acting as a communal salve against the private anguish documented in the lyrics.</p>
<p>Guitarist Thomas Johnson has said “the songs on this album seem to all come from a similar place,"" which explains the consistent voice on <i>Baba Yaga </i>in spite of the number of different writers. The group’s most prolific composer, Carter King, has the best knack for narrative details, outlining the “coffee beans and Ritalins” that keep the troubled couple at the center of “Virginia Slims” standing upright. In “Serial Bowls”, an infectious <i>Reckoning-</i>era R.E.M. bounce obscures a discomforting portrait of spiritual bankruptcy: “When the nurse saw me drop/ She said mama should’ve used that birth control/ because where my heart was supposed to be/ was like nothing they'd ever seen/ there was nothing/ but a smoking hole.” King tries to side-step the encroaching blackness that surrounds him on “Death Awaits” by going surfing, and finds Zen-like calm in the face of the inevitable: “Get rolled up in the wave, cuz death awaits/ and it’s a mean death, but it’s a clean death.”</p>
<p>King’s songs might shine the brightest, but Futurebirds is unmistakably a band. Each member makes valuable contributions: Johnson’s stormy guitar meltdown “Dig”, Daniel Womack’s beatific campfire ballad “Heavy Weights”, Payton Bradford’s heart-tugging “Keith and Donna” (who might be the only happy couple on <i>Baba Yaga</i>), and Brannen Miles’ jaunty folk strummer “The Light”. The only Futurebird who doesn’t write, Dennis Love, is the group’s most essential instrumentalist; his striking pedal-steel guitar lines cut through the din on<i> Baba Yaga </i>with the invigorating precision of Ralph Mooney soaring above Waylon Jennings and the Waylors. Take any member out of the equation and the captivating mess of <i>Baba Yaga </i>wouldn’t be splayed in precisely the right places. Perhaps <i>Baba Yaga </i>might’ve been more digestible if it had lost two or three songs. But for Futurebirds, the rough spots are kind of the whole point.</p></div>"|18034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18034-futurebirds-baba-yaga/|7.5|Steven Hyden

So when he announced his metamorphosis into the reggae singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30583-snoop-lion/"" target=""_blank"">Snoop Lion</a> last year while casually referred to himself as the reincarnation of Bob Marley, it was hard not to have a chuckle. The transformation seemed likely to blow over the same way Snoop’s stints as talk show host, sketch comedy actor and porn director did-- another half-remembered bit of listless bond diversification from a rap luminary grown bored of rapping. But Snoop really seemed <i>invested</i> in this Lion thing: his plan to hang out in Jamaica to record a reggae album quickly became a full-fledged Rastafarian spirit journey with guidance from Marley bandmate and roots reggae legend Bunny Wailer and the Rastafari Millennium Council. All of which was ultimately documented in the film <i>Reincarnated </i>and consummated in the album of the same name. Upon release, though, the film immediately infuriated Bunny, who issued a withering polemic castigating Snoop for what he felt was a cavalier and opportunistic misappropriation of Rastafarian culture.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Many of the complaints about the film could be made against the album: <i>Reincarnated </i>is constantly on the hunt for a sense of communion with a world just out of its reach. Snoop’s hardly a natural as a reggae singer, and his performances here are riddled with leaden vocalizing, fortune cookie-grade lyrical mundanities (“Take care of Mother Earth cause-ah she be the planet”) and dreadful fake patois. He wisely buttresses himself with a coalition of singers and actual reggae artists tasked with lending this project the hooks and credibility that he can’t muster. The result is something akin to his short-lived career hosting and directing adult film: you sense Snoop milling around in the background while professionals do the heavy lifting. Singer-songwriter Angela Hunte’s extensive co-writing and backing vocals provide the understated beating heart of the record, and guests like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5410-mavado/"" target=""_blank"">Mavado</a> and Popcaan shine for knowing their way around a reggae fusion record. But the guests can’t always carry the weight: dancehall stalwart Mr. Vegas can’t save “Fruit Juice” from its clunky concept, and the Akon cover “Tired of Running” aims for profundity but lands on karaoke, even with vocals from the man himself to guide the way.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Reincarnated</i>’s strong suit is its production, which was handled in large part by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a> braintrust with help from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12970-vybz-kartel/"" target=""_blank"">Vybz Kartel</a> collaborator Dre Skull and producer/songwriter Ariel Rechtshaid. The album’s sonic architects ease off their trademark futuristic dance floor bedlam here, opting instead for what sounds like a lovingly cultivated genre-bending mixtape. <i>Reincarnated </i>flits from the rock-reggae fusion of “Rebel Way” to the old school dancehall of “Here Comes the King” to the lumbering boom bap of “Lighters Up” early on. And then it makes stops at roots reggae for “So Long” and spectral dub on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15158-snoop-lion-no-guns-allowed-ft-drake-and-cori-b/"" target=""_blank"">No Guns Allowed</a>”, which cleverly lays a mellotron line reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"" target=""_blank"">Gorillaz</a>’ “Clint Eastwood” over a loop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>’s “Nantes”. Things get hairy with “Get Away”, which rehashes elements of “Pon de Floor” in spots, and “The Good Good”, a drab acoustic jingle better suited to pad out the back end of a Matisyahu album, but missteps on the production front are mercifully scant.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Snoop Lion’s sage choice of collaborators saves <i>Reincarnated</i> from his limited vision of reggae songwriting and Rasta culture, and the album gets its biggest payoff from its most unlikely contributor. Album closer “Ashtrays &amp; Heartbreaks” parlays Snoop’s partying in memory of lost loved ones into a devastating bridge from Miley Cyrus about pulling it together when your buzz wears off and a chorus both wracked with grief and brimming with determination. “Ashtrays &amp; Heartbreaks” flips Snoop’s pat Hallmark musings and crutch-like over-reliance on more nimble singers into assets to deliver the album’s one true stunner. <i>Reincarnated </i>is spotted with little moments like these, where you begin to see how a batshit late career gear shift might make just a dash of sense executed correctly. <i>Reincarnated </i>doesn't make a case for Snoop as a singer of any stripe. He should honestly stick to rap. And it doesn’t offer much evidence that this Rastafarian conversion isn’t the marketing ploy Bunny Wailer is convinced it is. Too much of it is an ill-advised cultural safari that’s too weird to fly but too monied to fail. But where it succeeds, <i>Reincarnated </i>forces you to forget the principal ridiculousness of the enterprise, and that is no small feat.</p></div>"|17920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17920-snoop-lion-reincarnated/|5.0|Craig Jenkins

And it’s as welcoming to musicians as it is to listeners, as volume, reverb and distortion can be used to minimize mistakes while bands that stay within the established boundaries are often rewarded by its intense loyalists. Case in point, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29270-no-joy/"" target=""_blank"">No Joy</a>; if you like shoegaze, you liked No Joy’s 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14929-ghost-blonde/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost Blonde</i></a>, as it was a solid, satisfying entry into the genre that didn’t take many chances. But it was hard to feel invested in the Montreal group. As anyone who owns more than one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/216-asobi-seksu/"" target=""_blank"">Asobi Seksu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5018-the-brother-kite/"" target=""_blank"">Brother Kite</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5424-a-place-to-bury-strangers/"" target=""_blank"">A Place to Bury Stangers</a> record can tell you, bands who successfully learned how to synthesize fuzz and pop fizz from <i>Loveless </i>or <i>Psychocandy</i> keel over fast once the training wheels come off. Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16792-negaverse/"" target=""_blank""><i>Negaverse EP </i></a>did at least acknowledge a need for a new direction, even if it ventured further into murk. However, the clarity and concision of <i>Wait to Pleasure </i>throws everything into reverse, and while their second LP puts No Joy in a position to make mistakes, with risk comes reward, and they also show far more growth and confidence than they previously had to this point.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the difference between <i>Wait to Pleasure </i>and its predecessor is to think about the tactile difference between heat and humidity. Whereas the latter was sticky, immersive and overwhelming, <i>Wait to Pleasure </i>offers 11 distinct, tactile sensations that are often diametrically opposed yet placed consecutively; opener “E” slowly boils over after five minutes of glam rock stomp, while the slo-mo pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15222-hare-tarot-lies/"" target=""_blank"">“Hare Tarot Lies”</a> calmly lazes in unseasonal warmth. The breakneck pace of “Lizard Kids” leaves the scent of burnt rubber on desert highway after the white hot sensuality of “Blue Neck Riviera”’s dirty electroclash. “Ignored Pets” sizzles, “Pleasure” soothes. It’s a cohesion based on interaction rather than similarity, maintaining a flow that displays No Joy’s subtly expansive range and adds a cumulative, positive effect to already strong individual components.</p>
<p>It’s all the more impressive that they’re able to do so while maintaining the raw elements of <i>Ghost Blonde. </i>While adept at diaphanous cooing, Jasamine White-Gluz and Laura Lloyd<i>’</i>s vocals take on far more of a lead role with piercing, major-key hooks. The guitars are still singed by redlining distortion, but within the context of <i>Wait to Pleasure’s </i>sweeter production, they tend to caramelize rather than corrode. And between “Lizard Kids” and “Ignored Pets”, they’ve established a stylistic template that distinguishes a <i>No Joy</i> song from those of their peers-- combining the pummeling, barely contained pace of a punk rhythm section with shoegaze’s distended high end, rushing through a light net of harmonized vocals that are reverbed to the point of being mere phonetics.</p>
<p>It can be tough to make out the intentionally wordless lyrics from the expressive ones, so the incorporation of synthetic elements tends to bring out their humanity. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14963-no-joy-lunar-phobia/"" target=""_blank"">“Lunar Phobia”</a> follows a continuum of bands whose names served as adjectives for their own sound (Lush, Curve), beat-driven without crossing over to dance music, and tricked out with a wealth of intriguing effects and layers: bird call vocal samples placed against wafting harmonies, juddering kick drums swapping with backmasked snares, tremolo guitars and raw feedback. “Blue Neck Riviera” goes even further into rhythmic clangor, the blackened, deadpan vocals and clacking drum machines recasting Ladytron as lo-fi nightcrawlers before it revisits the <i>Negaverse </i>album cover, taking off toward the rainbow horizon in its second half.</p>
<p>While improving on the sheer sound of <i>Ghost Blonde </i>on nearly every level, No Joy are still more suggestive than declarative. Allusive titles such as “Night Slug”, “Blue Neck Riviera”, and “Wrack Attack” come off as evidence of an inherent playfulness as well as a wide range of interests, even if No Joy’s lyrics are too deep in the mix to tell if they actually do refer in any way to the techno label, Florida’s Emerald Coast, or ""Saved By the Bell""<i>. </i>A certain kind of impersonality might seem like a cost of doing business in this genre, but within the context of <i>Wait to Pleasure, </i>there’s compensation in hearing No Joy express themselves as a band rather than as people. If you like shoegaze, you’ll probably still like No Joy, but <i>Wait to Pleasure’</i>s triumph is making it far less of a requirement.</p></div>"|17916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17916-no-joy-wait-to-pleasure/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Note the single “n” in her stage name; she once <a href=""thequietus.com/articles/05561-anika-interview"" target=""_blank"">described</a> the difference as offering “part of me, not all of me,” stating, “You’re indestructible if you split yourself into little bits.” She’s succeeded in so much as it still seems hard to get an idea of the real Henderson. Sure, she was once a Berlin-based journalist reporting on education reform, and lived in Bristol before that, but the majority of her releases have comprised fantastically dank, intimidating dub covers of pop and folk songs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28220-beak/"" target=""_blank"">BEAK&gt;</a> as her backing band, which haven't immediately conveyed a great deal about her.</p>
<p>It’d be unfair to imply that there’s any lack of personality in Anika’s music, though. On the <i>Anika</i> EP, which features one original, there’s a divide between covers to which she brings a certain bloodlust, and those from which she strips it away completely. Her vocal on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1279-ray-davies/"" target=""_blank"">Ray Davies</a>’ plangent, eerie midnight votive “I Go to Sleep” has a Weimar-like swoop that takes languid, elegant steps around the staccato waltz of the organ and the raw snaps that punctuate each line. The unusual lope in her brusque singing style makes it seem tragic, passionate even. She barks commandingly on a brilliant cover of “In the City”, one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a>’ less impassioned songs, which becomes beefier and funkier in Henderson’s hands. She and her band evoke a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"" target=""_blank"">Chic</a> shimmy, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"" target=""_blank"">Pop Group</a> tremulousness, and add nervy grit to the song that makes it relatable to anyone who doesn’t live in Chromatics’ pastel L.A. fantasy.</p>
<p>On a cover of the Crystals’ “He Hit Me”, Henderson's medicated, dispassionate vocal plays like a coping mechanism to recount the grisly details of an assault to a police officer’s notebook. The band match the surprisingly proto-dubby feel of Spector's original arrangement, but trade the Crystals’ sweet female chorus for a warped, lurching, seasick siren coven, and underpin the whole song with a buzzsaw drone. She maintains the slightest presence on Shocking Blue’s “Love Buzz”, singing in a taunting, distant tone, this time from the perspective of the emotional abuser, dissolving into the chorus as BEAK&gt; push the original’s no-wave minimalism into an almost Eastern palette.</p>
<p>The final two songs on the <i>Anika</i> EP are adapted from the <i>Anika </i>LP, which may make this collection seem like an unnecessary purchase, but they help to solidify Henderson's creative political stance. A redux of her take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"" target=""_blank"">Yoko Ono</a>’s “Yang Yang”, a song about the dehumanization of the sexes, is curdled and blurred, though her call to “join the revolution” leaps out from behind the lurching Doppler guitar. A dub version of her own “No-One’s There” isn’t quite as striking as the original, but on the chorus-- “Stop looking over your shoulder/ No-one’s there”-- Geoff Barrow’s production on her voice adds a spatial dimension that warns against her command. Suddenly, she’s cut off mid-line, as if she's been yanked by the throat by an undetected assailant.</p>
<p>Henderson has <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/10/anika-comes-to-the-echoplex-premieres-terry-video.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that she never wants her music “to shy away from articulating what I believe in,” yet her original decision to release mostly covers was because she <a href=""http://www.fordmodelsblog.com/music/anika-interview-special-2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thought</a> releasing an album of her political material “would have been far too heavy for anyone that wasn’t familiar with it.” It’s an intriguing juxtaposition, either indicating a lack of confidence-- and awkwardness is crucial to both her live show and her decision to make music in the first place-- or a stealthier attempt to grease listeners’ ears for an even more jarring collection next time around.</p>
<p>If there’s a political stance to be inferred from the distinctly unsentimental, aloof interpretations she places on songs, it recalls what Ellen Willis once wrote about “aesthete-punk” and “self-conscious formalist” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>, whose music she <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YhvBfNXvoQoC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Can+attempt+to+purify+rock-and-roll,+to+purge+it+of+all+those+associations+with+material+goodies+and+erotic+good+times.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EQA5HXuKF6&amp;sig=WrwBgaMxg_Ed4ubl98iBLQaX0js&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gZV2UaTYB7DY0QXZhoG4BA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Can%20attempt%20to%20purify%20rock-and-roll%2C%20to%20purge%20it%20of%20all%20those%20associations%20with%20material%20goodies%20and%20erotic%20good%20times.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">saw</a> as “an attempt to purify rock-and-roll, to purge it of all those associations with material goodies and erotic good times.” (Though the <i>Anika</i> LP proved influential to a band who definitely do not do minimalism; <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> called it a huge influence on the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17868-yeah-yeah-yeahs-mosquito/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mosquito</i></a>, with Nick Zinner <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/yeah-yeah-yeahs-mosquito-karen-o-cover-story-march-2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">describing</a> it as “totally fucking outsider, left-of-the-box music.”)</p>
<p>Henderson's few original songs rail against power-tripping cops and capitalism; as far as “authority sucks and everything’s fucked” sentiments go, she's concise, if not as challenging as she might think, especially in comparison to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50398-watch-savages-intense-video-for-shut-up/"" target=""_blank"">intense political statements</a> made by potential peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30435-savages/"" target=""_blank"">Savages</a>. What’s more radical is Henderson’s ascetic approach, which divests music about emotionally and physically abusive behavior of emotion, and sets songs by acts like Chromatics on the same level as those she covers by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Dylan</a>. Releasing dub versions of her previous material is also a traditionally economical move that fits with her rant about excess in ""No-One's There"". There are several layers of ego-removal at work here, and although both of Henderson’s records to date are essentially named after her, it’s worth remembering that she originally responded to Geoff Barrow’s call for a weird female singer to do BEAK&gt;'s bidding, though she seems to lead the direction more now.</p>
<p>Stones Throw have said that the ending of the video for “I Go to Sleep” “invites speculation about this phase in Anika’s career.” Okay, then: the clip is blurry and refracted, Henderson walking through a Brandenburg forest, and winding up ostensibly dead, buried beneath a pile of leaves. The most obvious impression is of some sort of rebirth; no more covers, no more keeping one “n” in reserve, reuniting the “little bits” to present a brittle, human whole. She's also intimated that her performances for the next album won't be as rooted in awkward stage presence. As the <i>Anika</i> EP shows, Henderson has a rare ability to convey a political stance without being overly hamfisted or explicit about it; how she brings that approach to music where she's the creative focal point is going to be seriously interesting to behold.</p></div>"|17874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17874-anika-anika-ep/|7.4|Laura Snapes

Psychedelic warriors <a href=""http://follakzoid.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Föllakzoid</a> hail from Santiago, Chile, but-- with their rigid rhythms, their chemtrail synths, their afterburner guitars-- their sound is pure Düsseldorf, circa 1971. But this krautrock-worshiping quartet's fascination with all things kosmische isn't merely musical: their primary concern seems to be untethering themselves from the earth. Their debut leaned toward desert rock, but the interplanetarily minded <i>II</i> is a bold shift in perspective from their earthbound origins, an all-out swing into a very different sound that follows its own alien logic. For Föllakzoid, though, space seems to be the place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Vocalist Juan Pablo Rodrigues, with his unbudging deadpan, spends much of <i>II</i> playing the ghost in the machine. So when he starts muttering ""is it getting lonely?"" as ""9"" intensifies, you wind up feel in positively marooned, all alone while the track's latticework tightens. And even as the song lengths skirt double-digits, Föllakzoid's commands your attention. Just as you start to admire the music's weightless beauty of the synths and guitars, they seem to close in on you. While ""Trees"" throbs, guitarist Domingo Garcia-Huidobro provides the scenery, his massive, ever-expanding riff drawing up the topography of the cosmos. Keeping the rhythm section lean and the synths fairly sleek and steely might seem to put a lot of pressure on Garcia-Huidobro's guitar. But he, too, knows when to step up, and more importantly, when to hold back. This keen sense of drama means every time ""Trees"" brings that riff around again, it's not just a reprise, it's an event. ""99"" plays like a Dali painting, every surface ripples like a pond, every instrument double-helixing around itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I've seen a 12-minute version of ""Pulsar"" floating around; mine's 15. Either way, ""Pulsar"" takes a little too long to get going, and doesn't do quite enough when it does. Once its initial pulsations melt away, a Deodato-style mecha-disco groove floats to the surface, one too troubled to ever quite lock into. <i>II</i>'s vastness is impressive, but between Rodrigues' inhuman mumble and the way every note seems to echo off some faraway mountain, certain stretches feel a bit barren. And all the sci-fi I've ever watched has me conditioned to expect a third-act payoff greater than the one <i>II</i> provides; Föllakzoid would like you think some atom-smasher's just around the next turn, but there's no such blowout here, just a few smaller skirmishes. Still, this is strange new terrain for Föllakzoid, and they go after it boldly, conjuring worlds in the process.</p></div>"|18015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18015-follkazoid-ii/|6.9|Paul Thompson

If you’ve not met Yellowman before, with this new collection VP Records provides a 40-song introduction. It also presents a case-- “nuff arguments”, as Yellow would say-- for the relevance of 1980s dancehall and the importance of one of Jamaica’s most well-known and well-loved deejays. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Yellow’s accomplishments are significant because he was anything but sexy and successful early on in his life. In fact, his mother tried to throw him away in a dumpster for being a <i>dundus</i>—albino in Jamaican <i>patwa</i>. Winston Foster, the <i>bwoy,</i> was born in 1957 and came of age at Alpha Boys School, a Catholic-run institution for what used to be called “wayward children.” Alpha produced piles of musicians, providing a foundation for the development of ska and reggae-- and, through Yellowman, dancehall. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As Bob Marley famously reminds us, “the stone that the builder refused shall become the head corner stone.” Foster provides snapshots of what it is like to be refused as an albino in Jamaican society in a number of songs featured on <i>YG&amp;Y</i>; in “Bunn the Kutchie” he mentions that “when me did born me mother disown me.” Abandoned by his mother and ostracized as a <i>dundus</i>, Yellowman grew up to become the corner stone of dancehall in Jamaica and the world. He got what Jamaicans would call his <i>bus</i> in the late 1970s with St Thomas-based sound system <a href=""http://www.whocorkthedance.com/aces.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aces Disco</a> with whom the deejay perfected songs like “Soldier Take Over”, “Them a Fight I”, and others included on the VP compilation. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In the heyday of the soundsystem, artists not only had the to produce hits in the studio, but also had to work a crowd in the dance, hopping on the mic and riding riddims. The early dancehall era required performers to perform and Yellowman was a master-- danceable tracks like “Body Move” and “Strong Mi Strong” are but two examples. His style is characterized by sharp humor, clever wordplay, and experiments with different voices-- always with a smooth delivery that rocks back and forth, seamlessly shifting from chant into song. It’s the kind of talent and confidence that led to the first major-label signing of a dancehall artist by Columbia, which was looking for the next big thing out of post-Marley Jamaica in 1981. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>YG&amp;Y </i>shows that Yellow wasn’t all about the hype. Sure, there’s self-aggrandizement on display in “Who Can Make the Dance Ram”, but tunes like “Eventide Fire”and “Jah Mek Us Fi a Purpose” provide evidence of Yellowman’s social conscience. However, if there’s one thing that he is known for, it’s for what Jamaicans term “slack”, meaning sexually explicit, lyrics. The hugging and squeezing Yellow chats and sings about in tunes like “Morning Ride” and “Rub and Go Down” may be downright tame in comparison to some contemporary tunes running the dance, but it certainly pushed the limits of 1980s Jamaica. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Yellow’s slackness helped him to turn the tables on those who might wish to ostracize him due to the color of his skin. Researcher and Yellowman-biographer <a href=""http://www.zunguzung.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brent Hagerman</a> suggests that “slackness essentially allowed him to alter the representation of the <i>dundus</i> in society from that of an outcast to a sex symbol.” In doing so, King Yellow challenged and continues to challenge social mores in Jamaica-- confroting stereotypes and forcing his audiences to consider their own assumptions and preconceived notions. It’s no surprise he’s come out <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20050722082808/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/070705/cover_music.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">strongly against homophobia</a> in the dance: ""I don’t do songs against gay people…If you don’t like a person or you don’t like a thing, you don’t talk about it. You don’t come on stage and say kill them or burn them because everybody have a right to live.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jamaican dancehall is often discussed in terms of disconnect from the rocksteady, reggae, and dub era. It’s seen as a dangerous, and degenerative deviation from the golden 1970s. The range of songs represented on <i>YG&amp;Y</i>, however, dispel any notions of Yellowman as a one-dimensional artist or of 1980s dancehall as a morass of slackness. He also demonstrates that dancehall is an integral part of the whole story of Jamaican music’s worldwide success. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Take the song “Zungguzungguguzungguzeng”. After spitting this mouthful, Yellowman asks the listener to “catch it”, but following the thread of the song is actually tough to do. Scholar <a href=""http://wayneandwax.com/?p=7340"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wayne Marshall has tracked the memorable melody </a>from 1982 to 2013, from Jamaica to NYC to Puerto Rico to Japan to the UK and back to Jamaica-- the nonsensical lyric plays an important role in rough and tough ragga, conscious hip-hop and party reggaeton. His ability to produce hooks that stick is matched by his ability to play with bits and pieces of tunes throughout his work: “Leaving on a Jet Plane” in “Night Flight”, “Three Blind Mice” in “Who Can Make the Dance Ram”, and “Bring it On Home” in “Yellowman Getting Married”, among many others.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Winning multiple bouts with cancer left Yellow with a disfigured jaw in 1986, but he was and still remains able to control a crowd. He still actively tours, gracing stageshows in Jamaica and around the world, often one of the most well-received acts at reggae festivals. Alongside the two CDs, <i>YG&amp;Y </i>offers a DVD of Yellowman at Reggae Sunsplash in 1988. This footage provides yet further evidence of his significance as a performer: with reams of hits up his sleeves, he’s got stage presence to spare. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>YG&amp;Y </i>is not an exhaustive collection spanning this artist’s nearly four-decade long career, but enough to provide a portrait of one of Jamaica’s most important artists. Given his major-label signing and related licensing issues, it’d be impossible to provide a comprehensive picture. Listening to the collection from beginning to end, however, proves that Yellowman is, and will always be, King of the Dancehall. </p></div>"|17985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17985-yellowman-young-gifted-yellow/|7.8|Erin MacLeod

The Swede started <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28804-junip/"">Junip</a> in the early 2000s with drummer Elias Araya and synth player Tobias Winterkorn, but the trio released only one EP before Gonzalez hit paydirt with his solo minimalist motorik bossa nova folk. That signature style, which emphasized rhythm and melody equally, produced two LPs, although it may have been his transformative covers of songs by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">Knife</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a> that got Gonzalez the most notice. Just when it sounded like he could either break through or fade away, up jumped Junip again to add some muscle to his music. The basic elements of Gonzalez’s solo material remained, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11899-rope-and-summit/"">“Rope and Summit”</a>, their first single as a reconstituted group, remains one of the best things Gonzalez has ever done: a pithy statement of intent but also the standard against which all subsequent songs will be measured.</p>
<p>There’s nothing quite so streamlined or quite so dramatic on <i>Junip,</i> the band’s follow-up to their 2010 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14668-fields/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fields</i></a>, although there’s also nothing to suggest the band is flailing. Mainly they simply keep on chugging. What worked on <i>Fields</i> works just as well here; what didn’t still doesn’t; and constancy may be the band’s greatest weakness. “Nice” and “easy” have been common descriptors, only somewhat derisive in their application, suggesting that many people think of Gonzalez’s music as aural wallpaper: music for making dinner or babies. While that’s not necessarily untrue, Junip at least try to dispel that perception on their self-titled album, which is ambitious in its details. A Spanish guitar snakes in between the mushrooming synths and bobbing bass of “Suddenly”, barely coalescing into the melody. The short “Villain” pushes Araya to the forefront, turning his pounding drums into the lead instrument. Junip is no solo project; instead, it comes across as a collaboration among equals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Winterkorn is especially crucial on <i>Junip</i>, perhaps even more so than Gonzalez himself. His synths and keyboards not only define the atmosphere of the album but usually determine the structure of the songs. He creates the maelstrom into which the rhythm and melody sail. With its pleading lyrics and desperate melody, opener “Line of Fire” builds carefully and patiently as Gonzalez and Araya trace bold straight lines into Winterkorn’s pattern of scribbles, as though stepping intrepidly into some crisis. It’s a tack they use repeatedly, but it proves effective throughout the album, especially on the tense standout “So Clear”.</p>
<p>Gonzalez’s voice, which has sounded limited in the past (especially on his solo albums), takes on a new tranquility in this context. He’ll never be criticized for emoting or overstating, and the fact that nothing flusters him surely gives his songs a certain chill, as if he can forget to be human. Nevertheless, that coolness is crucial to <i>Junip</i>, whose songs are all about crisis and commitment. The band eschew anything resembling experience or autobiography in order to focus on the hard-won lesson or the encouraging observation. “Step back from the line of fire,” Gonzalez advises on “Line of Fire”. “It’s your life, it's your call,” he sings on “Your Life Your Call”, which would come across as coldly dismissive if it didn’t sound so much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>. After a while, the album begins to resemble a motivational speech set to music, exhorting its listener while revealing so little about its creators. Ultimately, Junip keep their distance, offering a comforting hand on your shoulder rather than a full and unreserved embrace. </p></div>"|17930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17930-junip-junip/|7.0|Stephen M.

<p>As the beats go, the tape is one of the boldest of the year, with samples ranging from Blake’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12069-the-wilhelm-scream/"" target=""_blank"">“The Wilhelm Scream”</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/739-cody-chesnutt/"" target=""_blank"">Cody ChesnuTT</a>’s “Serve This Royalty” and enough instrumentation (live or otherwise) to embarrass a Musician’s Friend catalog. But what distinguishes <i>King</i> from other K.R.I.T. releases is that there’s nothing quite as earth-splitting as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7F1DzkYBcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Country Shit”</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhlAkJSBGl8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Money on the Floor”</a> here; half the tracks hardly even have drums, and the ones that knock at all aren't about to devastate anybody’s trunk. “Talkin Bout Nothing” is a variation on the lingering California ratchet sound, the piano that runs through “REM” goes great with Blake’s haunted croon, and the drips of horns and guitars on tracks like “Banana Clip Theory” and “Meditate” are perfectly sensual. Point is, K.R.I.T. is searching for ways to write hooky, immediately gratifying music without having to concoct something so aggressive as a sheer banger. Which is admirable, but <i>King</i> proves that he hasn’t quite figured it all out yet.</p>
<p>If there’s been one knock on K.R.I.T., it’s that he’s goofy as a rapper, a guy who might have grown up agreeing with the East Coast’s collective reservations of Southern rappers but could never argue with the latter party’s commercial success. His humble-hedonist persona is an appealing one, but no new folds to the temperament are presented here, which ultimately implies that K.R.I.T.’s abilities as an MC might be lagging even further behind his production abilities than they have been in other cases. If he’s able to even out his skillset-- which is still, as the dude Robin Van Der Zee <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G07pSbHLXgg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">might put it</a>, very unique-- his still-immense potential could be fully realized. For the time being, K.R.I.T. has some catching up to do if he doesn’t want to go down as a guy who peaked too early.</p></div>"|18021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18021-big-krit-king-remembered-in-time/|6.8|Mike Madden

It says as much about the elasticity of the genre as it does about how Chris Crisci's mercurial band hasn't allowed anything else to define them since. Over the past decade and a half, they haven't made two consecutive recordings without shuffling their lineup, their sonic focus, and often both: In the late 90s, the Lawrence, Kansas, band were peers of Mineral and Planes Mistaken For Stars, earnest Midwesterners expanding on the template set by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>. By the time they dropped their critically acclaimed, two-volume series <i>Low Level Owl</i> in 2001, they were receiving Radiohead comparisons, but then again, so was anyone who laid plaintive vocals over electronics and guitars treated with more than two effects pedals. As the 2000s progressed, they moved towards a centrist indie-rock sound before going off the grid into full-on, post-rock moodiness on 2009’s <i>Sagarmatha</i>. By 2011’s <i>Middle States EP</i>, you could sense them circling back towards their original sound, and <i>Illumination Ritual</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/78-illumination-ritual/"" target=""_blank""><i> </i></a>sticks the landing. Whether or not it’s Appleseed Cast’s best record feels irrelevant, though it’s certainly in contention. At this point, it offers a definitive Appleseed Cast, something that can serve as an entryway to their sprawling discography as well as a culmination of it.</p>
<p><i>Illumination Ritual </i>can certainly be a potent nostalgia trip: the clean, interlocking guitars, Crisci’s rounded vocals and nervous percussion rhythms are pure Deep Elm and Jade Tree throwbacks that thankfully avoid a similar tendency towards unwieldy verbiage or grating affectation. Even if there aren’t too many singalong moments, Crisci’s vocals remain warm and melodic throughout and the production is crisp without being brittle. The concision carries over to the instrumentals; “Branches on the Arrow Peak Revelation” and “Simple Forms” recall <i>Peregrine </i>or <i>Sagarmatha </i>with their fluttery guitar delay, subtle electronic manipulation, and floating ambience.</p>
<p>Crisci kept unusual hours writing much of <i>Illumination Ritual</i>-- as indicated by centerpiece “30 Degrees 3 AM”, the liminal feeling expressed in many of his lyrics are a result of walking the razor-thin line between “up too late” and “up too early.” There’s an unmistakably nocturnal mood to it all and it’s not the kind of wakefulness that’s a result of panic or some other insatiable mania: Crisci’s halting, elliptical lines evoke a moment where you can’t quite decide whether to take your waking state as a sign that you should start that novel or just try one more time to drift back to sleep.</p>
<p>This might not sound all that exciting and for the most part, Appleseed Cast <i>don’t </i>excite so much as they comfort; <i>Illumination Ritual </i>is more a soundtrack for thinking about feelings rather than being in the thrall of emotion. ""Adriatic To Black Sea"", “Great Lake Derelict”, and “Cathedral Ring” provide <i>Illumination </i>Ritual’s most forceful moments out of insistent builds rather than sudden movement-- it’s unclear what Crisci’s getting at besides a certain sense of yearning (lines like ""I feel so akin to rain,"" “the only girl is shooting for gold,” “a new cathedral, burn it down” are typical) that’s abetted by the satisfying effect the trio achieves by pushing the tempo and lunging forward musically.</p>
<p>It all makes for a consistent listen, as the longer instrumental passages and more melodic material draw from the same tones and structures. But it can lead to <i>Illumination Ritual </i>washing over you rather than creating immersion. While they’re capable of calming ambience, the Appleseed Cast lack the sort of striking dynamics that can serve as a substitute for its lack of immediacy. Nor are they particularly innovative in creating texture; Nathan Wilder is an active and pugilistic drummer who often serves as the “lead” when Crisci steps away from the mic, but too often they resort to the kind of clean, ringing peals of delayed guitar that’s going to sound like <i>something t</i>he Edge has already done more memorably.</p>
<p>None of this should be surprising or even disappointing for listeners holding the torch for the Appleseed Cast eight albums and several EPs in. But for the curious listener, the definitive nature of <i>Illumination Ritual </i>can cut both ways, as Appleseed Cast demonstrate their capabilities without having too many definitive strengths come to the fore,<i> </i>consolidating a decade and a half of intriguing, and occasionally compelling experimentation into a manageable 45 minutes.</p></div>"|17919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17919-the-appleseed-cast-illumination-ritual/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Still, <i>Enemy Mine</i> wasn't a competition, and at best it highlighted what its members shared-- not a sound but a sensibility. Mercer, Bejar, and Krug are less like contemporary songwriters and more like the ghosts of old poets, at once devoted to and tortured by the idea of creating, revising, and creating some more. ""The stupid house you made fell away like paper lace,"" Krug sang (most likely to himself) on one of <i>Enemy Mine</i>'s best songs, a reworked version of which would later appear on his Sunset Rubdown album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13232-dragonslayer/""><i>Dragonslayer</i></a>. The very idea to re-record ""Paper Lace"" echoed the message of its lyrics. Such is the condition of most creative people: they could probably revise even their best material endlessly and still feel that it was as shoddy and ineffectual as a kindergartener's paper snowflake.</p>
<p>In 2011, Blackout Beach released a record that is so far on the shortlist for album title of the century, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16029-blackout-beach-fuck-death/""><i>Fuck Death</i></a><span>, though the music itself wasn't as immediate or bludgeoning as its name. </span><i>Fuck Death</i><span> was instead a hypnotic, slow-burning meditation on themes of war, desertion, and love; unlike some of his more pummeling earlier material, Mercer’s epic, occasionally shrieked lines landed soft on a bed of luminous, monophonic synths. At its best, it was as story-driven and evocative as an avant-garde radio play-- but one that airs in the middle of the night so as not to permanently scar young children’s psyches, because there is a ominous, 12-minute ditty called “Drowning Pigs”.</span></p>
<p><span>Mercer’s latest release as Blackout Beach reimagines seven of </span><i>Fuck Death</i><span>’s eight songs, this time with more traditional rock instrumentation (an old Jazzmaster; ancient, busted-up amps). Those looking for an easy demarcation of where Blackout Beach begins and Frog Eyes ends will only be more confused; in sound and in line-up (Mercer’s “blues trio,” as he’s calling it, includes his wife/Frog Eyes drummer Melanie Campbell), </span><i>Blues Trip</i><span> has the distinct flavor of his more well-known band. But like his songs on </span><i>Enemy Mine</i><span>, </span><i>Blues Trip</i><span> draws you in with fervent immediacy. As a vocalist, Mercer’s at his most mesmerizing when he sounds like a possessed preacher, and there are plenty of moments on </span><i>Blues Trip</i><span>-- his muttered litany of “no, no, no, no...” on the opener “Hornet’s Fury into the Bandit’s Mouth"" comes to mind-- when he sounds like he’s about to start speaking in tongues. Recorded quickly over one sweltering summer weekend in the barn/studio owned by former Wolf Parade member Dante Decaro (he rounds out the trio; Dan Bejar later added some overdubbed backing vocals), </span><i>Blues Trip</i><span> often sounds like a live album with no audience-- a pretty fitting conceit for a record about loneliness, death and spiritual isolation.</span></p>
<p>And yet, <i>Blues Trip</i> never really makes a compelling case for why this material needed to be revisited in the first place. What made <i>Fuck Death</i> stand out in Mercer’s sprawling catalog was the atmosphere created by the synthesizers-- on no other record had he experimented with those particular tones or instruments. Swapping the synths for guitars give these arrangements a brisk, pummeling energy, but they also make them blend in with pretty much everything else Mercer has ever released. Superfans might find satisfaction in poring over these versions’ small variations, but overall his excavation of this material fails, unlike <i>Fuck Death</i>, to tread any ground Mercer hasn’t before. The decision to rework to these songs-- like Krug’s “Paper Lace”-- makes sense within Mercer’s mythology. But ask most poets who took a red pen to a decent manuscript long after the ink has dried, and they’ll probably tell you what Mercer finds out here: Sometimes your best bet is to trust the first draft.</p></div>"|17881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17881-blackout-beach-blues-trip/|6.1|Lindsay Zoladz

It’s easy to imagine what initially lured the diverse label to the band: The tracks on Anciients' nine-song entrance<i>, Heart of Oak</i>, are hyperkinetic but heavily anchored. They surround the hooks you might expect from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a> anthem with tangential and technical playing that trends toward prog rock but stops short of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5048-opeth/"" target=""_blank"">Opeth</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6873-enslaved/"" target=""_blank"">Enslaved</a>’s maze of redirections. Anciients excel at muscular and agile guitar solos, while the guitarists, Kenny Cook and Chris Dyck, also volley the vocal duties, jumping from death metal bellow to pop-metal lift. It’s exciting stuff, really-- often complicated without seeming excessive, skillful but soulful, approachable but not pedestrian. At its best, <i>Heart of Oak</i> is immediate and electrifying, an album that suggests Anciients’ half-prog, half-pop metal is bound for big stages.</p>
<p>By this point, though, you’ve probably wondered what’s up with the band’s name: Why, after all, add an extraneous vowel to a perfectly good handle? That excess is emblematic of Anciients' chief musical foible-- time and again, they add unnecessary sidecars to songs that would have been more effective left alone. Of these nine tracks, only one doesn’t break the six-minute mark. The exception is a tender but predictable instrumental, a mid-album interlude meant as a tribute to some late friends and family members. But the rest of these things are hyperbolic monsters that speak to a rookie act attempting to get through all of their influences at once, even though three of the members have been playing together in other groups for a decade. They are trying to make a very big point all the time, and the weight collapses in on itself. “The Longest River”, a nine-minute cut with a woefully apropos handle, swivels from acoustic foreboding to contract-and-expand thrash, from distended solos to dense stomp, from sweet-singing verses to growled impasses. None of it’s bad, but none of it is astounding enough to pardon the way it obviates an excellent refrain.</p>
<p>That’s a consistent problem for <i>Heart of Oak</i>, a record that adulterates many incredibly exciting moments with consistent excess. “Flood and Fire”, a late-album highlight, seems more like a string of song pieces than a proper song, with a righteous solo swiping momentum from a great chorus that, in turn, stymies several great and grim hardcore shout-alongs. As Cook <a href=""http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90490"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Metal Underground</a>, album opener “Raise the Sun” initially keys on Fleet Foxes before leaping into a verse so sticky and warm that ASG or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a> might like to have it back. Elsewhere, the song convincingly invokes metalcore and psychedelic rock, hangman riffs and fleeting blast beats. The parts are exhilarating, but strung together with more enthusiasm than wisdom so they’re mostly exhausting. Taken a track or two at a time, <i>Heart of Oak</i> is manageable; make it from end to end, though, and it’s difficult not to feel frustrated by the fatigue. </p>
<p>These complaints aren’t meant as some preclusive warning against <i>Heart of Oak</i>; rather, they’re only an honest assessment of a band that, in years to come, is <i>probably</i> going to be great. If Anciients choose to venture further deeper into labyrinthine prog, they’ve got the riffs and rhythms to make it compelling over the long haul. They seem as steeped in the suffocation of black metal from Scandinavia as they do in the sweetness of Allman licks from Georgia, as capable of thrash sprints as they are stoner lulls. And as the pealing organ and rumbling field recordings of the gorgeous (but, again, incredibly excessive) closer “For Lisa” suggest, they bring a wide-eyed approach to their music. <i>Heart of Oak</i> doesn’t have a compelling, cohesive narrative thrust, but there’s always time to buy a book of folklore, right? Alternately, Anciients could choose the route of bands such as Baroness or even Mastodon, embedding that sharp technicality within songs that make their points with concision that doesn’t forsake intricacy. The kernels of these songs are strong enough to suggest that they’re not very far off-- that is, their biggest problem as a band isn’t a dearth of ideas but, rather, discretion with those ideas. Anciients are exciting new prospects, with or without that cumbersome vowel chaiin.</p></div>"|17879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17879-anciients-heart-of-oak/|6.8|Grayson Currin

But if their trajectory feels old-fashioned, the French foursome are so perfectly emblematic of our present. Sure, you could chalk up the surprise, runaway success of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13052-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i></a> as some fortuitously timed, crossover-appealing fusion of big-tent indie anthems and glossy synth sheen; but then, this band has embraced huge hooks and smooth moves <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvamJU_coUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">since day one</a>. Really, Phoenix started making the big dollars once they stopped making sense: By intensifying the jiterry energy introduced on 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9030-its-never-been-like-that/"" target=""_blank""><i>It’s Never Been Like That</i></a>, with <i>Wolfgang</i>, they perfected an ADD-via-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ESL</a> approach to pop that matched the pace of our hyperactive, distracted, smartphone-sucking lives.</p>
<p>And through that process, Thomas Mars’ lyrics became Phoenix’s most frivolous yet essential quality. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JRzvNXtSg4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Once a heart-on-sleeve romantic</a>, the frontman now revels in jabbering out seemingly intelligible, ultimately inscrutable streams of words, starting one sentence only to finish another, as if he writes songs by making random copy-and-paste errors. Phoenix songs are that party conversation you weren't really paying attention to or didn't fully understand, but to which you nod in agreement anyway; you don't so much sing along as tentatively mouth along, like when you're doing karaoke and realize you don't know the words to your favorite song. Part way through the band’s fifth album<i>, Bankrupt!</i>, Mars even drops a kooky chorus line that doubles as an advertisement for the band’s addictively tuneful disarray: “It’s a jingle jungle/ Jingle junkie-junkie jumble.”</p>
<p>But on <i>Bankrupt!</i>, that sense of confusion is so pervasive it practically coheres into concept-album formalism. Even with Mars’ whimsical wordplay in full effect, the band’s fifth album scans very much as a post-success commentary, the sound of a band who, just two albums ago, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Ky2d0PZU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was making dates for protest rallies</a>, but now finds itself hobnobbing with the 1%. Lead single “Entertainment” shares its name with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"" target=""_blank"">Gang of Four</a>’s debut album and also a similar self-awareness of commodifying their art. In the wake of a deliriously ascendant, laser-beamed chorus that’ll give the band’s lighting guy a perfect excuse to shine the house high beams on some festival crowd, the music cuts out and Mars blithely admits, “I’d rather be alone.”</p>
<p>Mars is too amiable a vocalist to express pure disillusionment, but he’s great at communicating discomfort. <i>Bankrupt!</i> doesn’t so much ruefully reflect upon Phoenix’s whirlwind, globe-trotting lifestyle as drop you right in the middle of it. Its K-pop synth melodies and snapshots of Californian glamor and Scandinavian leather give you that sensation of seeing the world but only as a blur from the backseat of your chaffeured car, as you’re whisked from after-party to after-party for just enough time to make bullshit small talk and exchange contact info with people you have no intention of ever contacting. On the album’s heart-racing standout “S.O.S. in Bel Air”, Mars agitatedly shouts out the title as if summoning some sort of Bat signal escape from high-society banality; on the belt-it-out power ballad “Bourgeois”, he tosses a life-saver to a girl stuck bartending for fat cats on a cruise ship. And tellingly, a song named for d-bag cologne-of-choice “Drakkar Noir” is paired with one titled “Chloroform”, the implication being that they’re both just as toxic: the former equates its titular fragrance with sleazy seduction, the latter is a devastating slow jam that chronicles the inevitable morning-after kick to the curb, with Mars delivering the album’s most lucid and frank line: “I don’t like it if you miss me/ Why would I long for you?”</p>
<p>But if <i>Bankrupt!</i> catalogues a set of circumstances Phoenix never expected to find themselves in, they’ve at least grown accustomed to their surroundings. After all, the album rarely deviates from <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>’s winning formula; befitting the band’s ascendant status, everything’s just that much more shiny, jacked-up, and frantic. But the more-is-more approach fails them on the now-customary moody mid-album odyssey: Compared to previous downtempo turns like <i>It's Never </i><i>Been Like That</i>'s “North” and <i>Wolfgang</i>'s two-part “Love Like a Sunset”, <i>Bankrupt!</i>’s seven-minute title track is less a cool comedown than a colossal brick that threatens to sink the whole record. The typical Phoenix song is already overstuffed with melodic change-ups, quirky instrumental flourishes, and fragementary logic; this concerted effort to go prog proper-- with its awkward hodge-podge of space-age bachelor-pad synth doodle, Vangelisian sci-fi soundscape, and forlorn folk ballad-- can’t help but sound forced and undercooked by contrast. </p>
<p>It's not the only moment on <i>Bankrupt!</i> where you wish Phoenix would stop overthinking and let their songs accrue a more natural momentum. Although “Don’t” begins as another fine addition to the band’s repertoire of snappy, post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">Strokes</a> skip-along jaunts, it’s derailed by a plaintive, saggy chorus that makes the song feel a lot longer than it is. <i>Bankrupt!</i> is most effective when blurring the line between celebrating decadence and reeling from it, as on the deceptively exuberant closer “Oblique City”, whose title presumably serves as a stand-in for any random stop on the band’s tour itinerary. It’s a song that seemingly celebrates the freedom of not knowing what city you’re waking up in, capturing the momentary rush you get from all the busy streets and massive neon-lit Coca-Cola ads. But couched within its boisterous bustle is a cry for help ringing out of the executive suite at 3 a.m.: “Am I gonna do this alone?,” Mars sings, a contradictory bookend to his anti-social “Entertainment” salvo, but one that encapsulates <i>Bankrupt!</i>’s conflicted, unsettled essence. The song’s synth-buzzed whirr eventually dissolves into gentle acoustic picking, but you know it’s just a brief moment of calm before Mars must brace himself to face another jingle-jungle morning. </p></div>"|17913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17913-phoenix-bankrupt/|7.5|Stuart Berman

It’s yet another bold left turn in a career already filled with them, and the least consequential record he’s made yet.</p>
<p>Unlike the Bruce Hornsby piano licks that adorned “Beth/Rest”, or the irony-skirting sax solos of the Vernon-starring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a> album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relayted</i></a>, the rumbly power-trio posturing of <i>Grownass Man </i>doesn’t have a confrontational edge to it. Vernon isn’t out to challenge elitist sensibilities; this is him in “cracked-open beer” mode, goofing off in a low-stakes environment with trusted musical confidants he’s known for years. Vernon first played with Cook and Moen as the Shouting Matches for a one-time-only show seven years ago. (The group has been around long-enough to have an infrequently updated <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theshoutingmatches/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace page</a>.) The Shouting Matches saga might’ve ended there if Vernon hadn’t reconnected with Cook and Moen last year; that these good-natured jam sessions turned into an album speaks to the way Vernon’s fame automatically makes any project he’s involved in a commercial proposition, no matter how casual.</p>
<p>Anyone approaching <i>Grownass Man</i> as a serious artistic statement on par with <i>Bon Iver </i>is bound to be disappointed; to the contrary, the album’s loose, lay-about approach offers an appealing contrast to Vernon’s fussed-over output with his primary band. <i>Grownass Man </i>projects familiarity and comfort; the hominess of the warmed-over classic-rock riffs (check out the brief <i>Back in Black </i>shout-out at the start of opening track “Avery Hill”) a product of Vernon’s Eau Claire roots<i>. </i>Growing up in the Chippewa Valley, Vernon and his bandmates likely encountered dozens of bands that sounded exactly like <i>Grownass Man </i>at places like the Stone’s Throw downtown, and heard stories about the venerable bluesmen and jazz artists who years ago played the legendary Joynt bar on Water Street. If <i>Grownass Man </i>veers dangerously close to full-on Blues Brothers territory on amiable shuffles like “Mother, When?” and “New Theme,” it’s probably because that <i>was </i>the blues for these guys when they first started playing music.</p>
<p>The most obvious departure point on <i>Grownass Man </i>from Bon Iver is Vernon's voice. Bon Iver fans might wonder where all the falsetto went; except for quick flashes in the heartsick ballad “I Need a Change”, Vernon sticks to his lower register. In the overall arc of Vernon’s career, though, this has been his “regular” voice, going back to his time with DeYarmond Edison. <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/articles/justin-vernon-of-bon-iver,14201/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">When I interviewed him in 2008</a>, Vernon admitted that he was “insecure” about his natural singing voice. “For the most part, I've been influenced by black singers and singers I couldn't sound like,” he said. “Whenever I tried to do a dark note or a bent note, I would just sound like Hootie and The Blowfish.” Thankfully, Vernon sounds more like Bobby Charles than Hootie on <i>Grownass Man</i>, applying a meaty growl to the screaming stomp “Heaven Knows” and toning down to a tender whisper on the lilting “I’ll Be True”. While it may not fit with Bon Iver’s present sound, <i>Grownass Man </i>suggests that Vernon’s baritone is a rich weapon in his vocal arsenal that is currently being underutilized.</p>
<p>Perhaps Vernon feels comfortable singing this way on <i>Grownass Man </i>because it is an inherently minor effort that will interest only his most hardcore supporters. Only the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>-like “Gallup, NM”-- the latest in a long line of travelogues from indie’s ultimate townie-- sticks out as a song with any potential shelf-life. But, again, looking for enduring music here misses the point. Like any beer-soaked hang with your best bros, <i>Grownass Man </i>isn’t so much about what’s remembered afterward as it is about having a blast in the moment.</p></div>"|18010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18010-the-shouting-matches-grownass-man/|6.3|Steven Hyden

Between September 2009 and September 2011, multi-instrumental conjurers Evan Caminiti and Jon Porras released four full-length albums, each burrowing deeper into a mirage of droning desert blues. During that time, they also issued a brazen, roaring collaborative LP with Ellen Fullman, a composer who suspends wires in rooms to elicit extreme dynamics and radiating overtones. Porras and Caminiti stayed busy separately, too, pogoing between various boutique labels for solo records that pushed their group aesthetic to distinct extremes. Last year, they kept abreast of those individual paces, both releasing two fine LPs under their own names. But in 2012, there was no new Barn Owl material.</p>
<p>The pause began after <i>Lost in the Glare</i>, a move that, in retrospect, seems like an optimal place for a Barn Owl semicolon. On those eight tracks, Caminiti and Porras’ intertwined guitars reached ideal levels of intensity and intimacy. On “Turiya”, featuring copacetic drummer Jacob Felix Heule, they let the tones bleed, playing their arid riffs with a force they’d never before managed. On “Light Echoes”, one of the prettiest pieces in the wide Barn Owl catalog, they repeated a trickling guitar line until it stretched into prismatic shimmer. Barn Owl had gotten very good at being itself.</p>
<p>With <i>Lost in the Glare</i>,<i> </i>they also suggested they wanted to be something else. Aside from Heule, Barn Owl added bass clarinet, more percussion and, most presciently, an array of subtle synthesizer textures. So on <i>V</i>, Barn Owl’s proper fifth album, Caminiti and Porras return to the duo format to somewhat reinvent themselves, at least sonically. Though they both still list guitar as their primary instruments in the liner notes, the pair spend the bulk of <i>V</i>’s six tracks exploring keyboard drones, wide-set digital rhythms, kaleidoscopic synth hues, and barely there scrims of noise. The sustained electronics of “Blood Echo” reverberate as if from the mouth of a cave, with concussive thuds and streaks of sound suggesting the nascent work of European peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"" target=""_blank"">the Haxan Cloak</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30862-raime/"" target=""_blank"">Raime</a>. “Void Redux” seems like the hypothetical rendering of a session shared by Vangelis, Conrad Schnitzler, and Ennio Morricone; alternately, its dub inflections and colorful sprawl recall the more outer-atmosphere moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16513-icon-give-thank/"" target=""_blank""><i>Icon Give Thank</i></a>, last year’s collaboration between the Congos, Sun Araw, and M. Geddes Gengras. “Against the Night” blooms like the best work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a>, with sounds that float just past obvious perception suddenly rupturing into a euphoric rush.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is still Barn Owl. Like the rest of the band’s<i> </i>impressive oeuvre, <i>V</i> works to create expansive spaces of meditative delight-- drones to get lost in, melodies to slide through, layers to drift among. They’ve simply shifted the order of their compositional tools, pushing the guitars into supporting roles while using new devices to build more deliberate and controllable compositions. For instance, it’s easy to imagine “The Opulent Decline”, the 18-minute electronic rumination that closes the record, being played largely on guitar, with its gently daubed melodies picked from six strings rather than routed through keys and circuits. <i>V</i> is neither less deep space nor more varied than its predecessors.</p>
<p><i>V</i> does, however, feel both transitional and incubatory. Barn Owl’s guitar-oriented records were fascinating from the start, but that series only got better toward the finish-- again, see <i>Lost in the Glare</i>. <i>V</i> isn’t a sudden restart, but its approaches and techniques aren’t as varied or surprising as those of Barn Owl, the almost-guitar duo. But Barn Owl’s first round of success came because Porras and Caminiti worked well and often. They then had the uncommon sense to realize they’d perhaps found at least one of their peaks. <i>V</i> isn’t a low at all, but here’s hoping it is the beginning of another great trip.</p></div>"|17911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17911-barn-owl-v/|6.8|Grayson Currin

On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16829-exo/""><i>Exo</i></a>, the album he released last year as one half of electronic duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28180-gatekeeper/"">Gatekeeper</a>, the peaks were something akin to Meatloaf producer Jim Steinman getting behind the mixing desk for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">the Chemical Brothers</a>. Ross doesn't shy away from <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/artists/adr/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">listing</a> big beat among his influences-- it's a genre he returns to on <i>Chunky Monkey</i>, the second solo album under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31038-adr/"">ADR</a> alias, released by <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hippos in Tanks</a>. But while <i>Exo</i> was concerned with creating a great glut of noise, <i>Chunky Monkey</i> finds strength in the kind of loopy frivolity practiced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"">Fatboy Slim</a> or <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bentley+Rhythm+Ace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bentley Rhythm Ace</a>. Despite wearing those influences hard on its sleeve, it's not an entirely backward looking pursuit; this is a record just as inspired by the blinding colors of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>'s maniacal techno as it is by the <a href=""http://www.skintentertainment.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skint Records</a> roster.</p>
<p>The central difference between ADR and Gatekeeper comes from how relaxed Ross sounds here. There's a palpable sense of excitement to each track, a feeling of someone thinking about everything they've ever been influenced by and trying to cram it all into a four-minute dash to the finish line. So we get smoky '80s cocktail jazz butting up against jungle drums and loping reggae basslines, sometimes executed to great success, sometimes sounding like a mess that Ross couldn't quite untangle. Either way, it's clear that he had a wail of a time getting there, even if it's not always as fun to listen to as it was to make. At times it even feels like you're there with him, watching his thought process at work: When ""Social Studies"" leaps from sax solo to acid bleeps there's a great dip in the track, a moment of hesitation that makes it sound like Ross is scratching his head, lost for an idea of where to go next.</p>
<p>However, that lack of purposeful forward momentum is <i>Chunky Monkey</i>’s biggest flaw. With Rustie, you always feel like he's built his domain and mastered it, allowing him to operate with a very precise idea of where to go next and why. Here, Ross goes back and forth between carefully refined material and loose strands of thought that don't lead anywhere particularly inspiring. Sometimes it even happens within the space of a single track-- ""Big Daddy"" meanders into directionless electronic ambience before gaining a greater sense of design through finely clipped jungle drums, cut-up vocal passages, and a series of spaced-out loops set to delicately dance around one another. The warped country-reggae hybrid ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15233-adr-stray-dog-strut/"">Stray Dog Strut</a>"" is the highlight, offering a demonstration of Ross's skill for sounding like warring musicians finding unlikely common ground. <br/><br/>The entire purpose of ADR seems to come from deriving harmony from ostensibly jarring parts, another nod back to the kind of how-deep-is-your-record-bag approach that really took hold in the '90s. It owes a decent amount to the Dust Brothers' production on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11104-odelay-deluxe-edition/""><i>Odelay</i></a>, although nothing here stands out in the same way that, say, the low-key funk of ""The New Pollution"" from that record does. Instead, <i>Chunky Monkey</i>’s charm comes from the childlike glee induced by herky-jerky pop tracks such as the bright ""Whiz Kids"" or the nods to acid jazz and drum and bass that burn through at a furious pace on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14843-slush-fund/"">""Slush Fund""</a>. It only loosely holds together as an album, never really finding the kind of cohesion to make it pass in a pleasingly blinding flash. Proof, if more were needed, that taking a mind-bending gallop through music history and leaving a recognizable imprint on it is clearly a tough art to master.</p></div>"|17871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17871-adr-chunky-monkey/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Nebulous genre categorizations aside, if you're playing a guitar and you're kind of successful-- but not Mumford &amp; Sons successful-- you're going to get lumped under one massive umbrella. It's alright though. It allows for nuance and pathos and explorations of ideas and lifestyles that we all generally thought were pretty well tapped. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a> made getting bored and smoking weed into a melancholy, weirdly pessimistic headspace, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> found contentment in the suburbs, and then made songs about how being content can sometimes be stifling. And for Melbourne, Australia's Fergus Miller aka Bored Nothing? Well, hopefully he doesn't get lumped in with the other nothings-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a>, nothing to do, nothing to see, nothing to achieve.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Get past the name-- an unfortunate circumstantial thing and nothing else-- and the great parts of Bored Nothing's self-titled record make themselves clear. Miller wrote these songs while bumming semi-homeless around Australia for a few years, and as a result, they occupy a similar mindset: Miller and the characters in his songs are perpetually stoned, bored, or existentially lost. Sometimes all of the above. It's territory that's been covered before, but he has a way with words and a clear-eyed honesty that's incredibly refreshing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's probably not an accident of sequencing that the album opens with ""Shit For Brains"", a song which includes lyrics-slash-album-mission-statements like ""What's wrong with sleep?/ Oh compared to weed it's cheap/ But my dreams are always keeping me awake"" over a laconic guitar line that is as lazy as it is pretty. Right away, Miller's set the stage for what he's about, which seems to pretty much be hanging out alone, stoned out of his mind, silently freaking out about the world around him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Miller is so adept at digging his fingers into this sort of life, that, over the course of the album-- which is really a collection of singles, each its own screwed-up world-- you start to get fatigued. You've heard the soft guitar fuzz of ""Darcy"" before, but that doesn't mean it's not still great, the riff on ""Popcorn"" could be a lo-fi <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17781-blink-182/"" target=""_blank"">Blink-182</a> demo, but it doesn't mean you can't relive your best worst teenage moments inside of it with glee. Miller's songs are loose and fluid and vital, even when they're familiar, it's just that there's a whole lot of them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Miller's a modest songwriter, though. He isn't trying to reinvent rock, and besides, music mutates too quickly to even make an attempt, but based on the gems here, if he really wanted to go transcendent for a whole album down the line, he could. ""Darcy"" is a close to perfect piece of brief power pop-- it features Miller playing with the classic quiet/loud rock mode, his lyrics gumming to sugary guitar fizz. It's a sweet, ambiently angry couple of minutes. Then he's on to ""I Wish You Were Dead"", which, title alone, probably says a few things.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The flaw here is that all these songs together are too much to absorb, but Miller probes deeply without ever coming off as sappy, skillfully weaving through breakups, self-loathing, skipping school, and poor decisions without sticking to his own sadsack introspection. On ""Charlie's Creek"", the album's quietest track, he sings ""I would forget to be sad all the time/ And you would forget how you fucked up your life/ And how your husband's not home half the time/ And you never take time out to write"" with brutal economy-- this feeling of wasted life is as universal as it is specific. He never attempts to provide answers, he just lets us know that he doesn't have them, and that's perfectly alright.</p></div>"|18018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18018-bored-nothing-bored-nothing/|7.0|Sam Hockley-Smith

Following the short, breezy instrumental coda of “Sundown (Back in the Briars)”, with its soft eddies of violin, “Winter Prayers” features only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7207-sam-beam/"">Sam Beam’s</a> voice and guitar, with a sympathetic piano gently reinforcing the song’s delicate melody. What makes the moment so notable is how closely it resembles the Iron &amp; Wine of yore, when Beam was recording albums in his living room and smuggling dark thoughts via comfort-food folk. Is the song just a means of offsetting some of the fuller and louder passages that make up the bulk of <i>Ghost on Ghost</i>? Or is it something slyer and more self-aware, a wink and a nod to the old self he’s left behind? Is Beam trying to remind us just how far he’s come since he calculated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4127-our-endless-numbered-days/"">Our Endless, Numbered Days</a>?</i></p>
<p>He has, in fact, come very far. In an effort not to play the sad strummer covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">the Postal Service</a> for the rest of his life, Beam has spent the last decade engaged in an arms race with himself. With each album he has seriously and self-consciously expanded his range, indulging new musical modes while locating finer grains of emotion. When he’s at his best, it can be bracing to watch a man whose repertoire once seemed so limited perform new tricks: In 2005 the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4128-woman-king-ep/""><i>Woman King </i></a>EP slyly fitted his low-key folk with rustic percussion and sharp country-blues riffs, and two years later <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10691-the-shepherds-dog/""><i>The Shepherd’s Dog</i></a> (still his finest effort) revealed new full-band ambitions and arrangements as unruly as cowlicks. That pair of releases argued persuasively that Iron &amp; Wine was more than just a guy, a guitar, and a beard. </p>
<p>What was truly remarkable about <i>The Shepherd’s Dog</i> was how quickly, confidently, and gracefully Beam shifted from folk minimalist to roots maximalist. However, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15033-kiss-each-other-clean/""><i>Kiss Each Other Clean</i></a> sounded like a step backwards, toggling between the seemingly effortless (the affectionately nostalgic “Tree by the River”) to the turgidly effortful (the strained Dylanisms of “Walking Far form Home”). It plays like the transitional album that should have preceded, not followed <i>Dog</i>. Unfortunately, <i>Ghost on Ghost</i> is haunted by that same sense of in-between-ness: Beam is obviously excited about playing with new sounds and ideas, but he seems as yet unsure how to piece them together.</p>
<p>“Winter Prayers” is one of the quietest moments on the album, but it’s also one of the least fussy songs. Working again with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4356-tin-hat-trio/"">Tin Hat Trio’s</a> Rob Burger, who provides horn and string arrangements, Beam has recorded an album dense with ideas and busy with musical flourishes that distract as often than they cohere. Opener “Caught in the Briars” catches you off guard with its low thrum of horns and reed instruments bolstering one of Beam’s sunniest melodies. Soon the rattletrap percussion comes in, a little stodgy in this context. Then comes piano, adding nothing. The backing vocals insert persistent oohs and aahs, and the whole thing takes on a sequiny sparkle before the song falls down a flight of stairs on the coda. </p>
<p>Of course it’s admirable that Beam wants to push himself, to constantly redefine himself, to continually redraw the boundaries of his art. The fact that he’s willing to include some blues riffs and jazz combos on <i>Ghost on Ghost­</i>-- hell, just the fact that he’s interested in rhythm at all-- suggests that he has a broadminded view of Americana that transcends folk and country. But Beam doesn’t do all those styles equally well. His nods to 1970s lite rock on “The Desert Babbler” and the Carpenters-slick “Grass Windows” more than pay off, but “Joy” is sickly sweet, and Iron &amp; Wine-as-jazz-combo is disastrous: “Lovers’ Revolution” is a hot mess of overwrought druggy lyrics and underthought Beat rhythms, and when the song breaks for its instrumental interlude-- too gentle to evoke the havoc of a bad high, too rhythmless to be a New Orleans funeral parade-- it accommodates one of the most awkward musical passages of the year.</p>
<p>The inconsistency frustrates: One minute the arrangements sound crowded with sonic bric-a-brac, the next minute Beam turns on his inner editor, settles into an easy melody, or drops an imaginative turn of phrase. He’s an inventive songwriter with an idiosyncratic lyrical style, and most of the songs on <i>Ghost on Ghost</i> convey a sense of travel and transience with their place names and concrete details. The American Southwest figures prominently in his lyrics, as Beam evokes that specific quality of California light on “The Desert Babbler” and “New Mexico’s No Breeze”. His postcard impressionism gives the album its own distinct personality within his catalog, which comes through despite the cluttered production. In other words, <i>Ghost on Ghost</i> is best when it’s most straightforward and worst when the experimentalism becomes desperate rather than bold. Too often it sounds as though Beam is less interested in defining a new sound and more concerned with distancing himself from an old one.</p></div>"|17875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17875-iron-wine-ghost-on-ghost/|6.1|Stephen M.

It was a set of three album-length-plus mixtapes of music by pop-R&amp;B singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10905-cassie/"" target=""_blank"">Cassie</a>, whose self-titled 2006 Bad Boy debut underperformed commercially but inspired a cultish following among R&amp;B obsessives, and who had yet to release its proper follow-up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Curated by a person or persons calling themselves the Cassie Collective, <i>The </i><i>Cassie Trilogy</i> collects the various singles and guest appearances that she’d released sporadically over the past few years, sorted under the categories “minimalist R&amp;B,” “dark electro,” and “pure pop.” This rubrick not only lent some much-needed organization to what could have been a sprawling mess of a project and helped show off the singer’s range, but also underlined how far she’s consistently been ahead of trends like the wave of atmospheric R&amp;B that followed the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">Weeknd</a>’s appearance on the scene and the avant garde-leaning artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> who’ve come to embrace bubblegum synth pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The trilogy also served as a reminder that we’re still waiting on that second LP. It’s supposedly still in the works, which is what Cassie and her team have been saying since last decade. But even if it never comes, </span><i>RockaByeBaby</i><span>, the mixtape she’s released to hold us over until then, would more than suffice.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s clear from the first song, “Paradise”, that the Cassie of 2013 is a whole different creature from the singer we were introduced to in 2006. For one, those different facets that were highlighted on </span><i>The Cassie Trilogy </i><span>have been unified into a whole that’s much more than the sum of its parts. There’s no gap between her pop star side and her nocturnal-minimalist-R&amp;B sex kitten side anymore--now they slink up against each other salaciously on tracks like “Addiction” that deliver hooks and bedroom atmospherics in equal measure.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Cassie’s also begun blurring the line between her and the rappers she’s been collaborating with throughout her career. The snippet of dialogue from </span><i>New Jack City </i><span>that opens </span><i>RockaByeBaby</i><span> and the cover art of her posing with pistol in hand are the most obvious indicators of a more gangstafied image overhaul, but they’re just skin deep.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The more important thing is that the years of work she’s put in since her debut have given Cassie an on-mic presence that’s the equal to any of the rappers she’s recruited for features here. She’s not just a singer anymore; she’s actually got flow. It’s an impressive cast of mixtape heavyweights she’s working with, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"" target=""_blank"">Fabolous</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/FrencHMonTanA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>, and none of them manage to run away with their respective tracks the way that rapper cameos on other R&amp;B albums tend to. Sometimes she even gets the best of her guests, like “Take Care of Me Baby”, where her nimble, syncopated vocals exploit the best parts of the trap-inflected beat (produced by Mike Will Made It) so thoroughly that by the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a> jumps on it his verse there’s not much left for him to do with the song, and his verse seems almost like a distraction.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cassie’s willingness to tangle with hard, dark mixtape-rap beats (including one by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/"" target=""_blank"">Young Chop</a> that’s as menacing as anything he’s produced for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>) gives <i>RockaByeBaby</i> a heft that most female-fronted R&amp;B projects lack. Even the songs that lean more towards straight R&amp;B, like “Numb” and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih</a>-assisted standout cut “Sound of Love”--which boasts one of the nastiest synth leads in recent memory--have an aggressive edge that suits her newfound swagger.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What’s clear now is that Cassie’s no longer just competing in the R&amp;B game anymore. While </span><i>RockaByeBaby</i><span> has aspects that invite comparisons to risk-taking singers like Jeremih and the Weeknd, its really deserves to be held up against the output of melody-intensive rappers like Drake and Future, and it stands up against either. There’s not only not a bad song on the record, but not even any that start becoming skippable after repeat back-to-back listens, a habit that its seamless transitions and remarkable consistency encourages. </span>Cassie fans have spent a long, long time waiting for the rest of the world to start paying attention to her. After <i>RockaByeBaby</i> I can’t imagine they’ll be able to ignore her for much longer.</p></div>"|17902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17902-cassie-rockabyebaby/|7.8|Miles Raymer

So when Cris, fresh off a few particularly rocky years, rejoined brother Curt Kirkwood in 2006, once-bitten fans didn't know what to expect, save a certain amount of mania. What they got was anything but: starting with 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10440-rise-to-your-knees/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rise to Your Knees</i></a>, the Meat Puppets got good and mellow, trading in their frenzied pacing and Spirograph guitars for a surprisingly even-keeled, weirdness-averse, country-tinged amble.</p>
<p><i>Rat Farm</i>, the Puppets' 14th studio LP, finds the brothers Kirkwood continuing to take things easy. Curt's been calling <i>Rat Farm</i> ""real blown-out folk music,"" playing up its compositional simplicity and explaining away its lack of fretboard melée. <i>Rat Farm</i>'s pop jangles and crisp country workouts don't feel all that much straighter than the band's other post-reunion LPs, and there are still hints (however fleeting) of the Meat Puppets of old in <i>Rat Farm</i>'s ragged harmonies, permafried geniality, and Curt's wide-eyed fascination with the natural world. But all that remarkable stuff that's been lost to the Puppets' gradual mellowing-- the hardcore furor, the Deadhead twinkle, the sunburnt boogie-- hasn't been replaced by, well, much of anything. Which leaves the perfectly pleasant <i>Rat Farm</i> feeling strangely wanting.</p>
<p>""Everything's cool, and everything's fine,"" Kirkwood sings at the top of ""Waiting"", quickly adding ""and everything drives me out of my mind."" That's kind of the trouble with Rat Farm: everything's fine, but that's about the long and short of it. Whether it's the Byrdsy stroll of ""You Don't Know"", a post-grunge chopper ""Leave Your Head Alone"", or a countrypolitan swoon like ""Waiting"", everything here unfolds as you'd expect it to, amicably enough, but with a distinct lack of adventure. The mood's convivial, the tempos are easygoing, and the solos—when they happen at all—are clipped. Sure, some things'll never change: Curt still sings like he's holding in a lungful, and there's a certain wobbliness to the arrangements that never lets you forget who you're listening to. But culling the chaos from their sound doesn't exactly flatter what remains, and with every layer of weirdness they shed, some personality follows.</p>
<p>Still, the smile stretched across <i>Rat Farm</i>'s face does wonders for the hints of blankness behind its eyes. Curt's mind remains bent, even as his songs have straightened themselves out; <i>Rat Farm</i>'s world is populated by a mechanical money, a yard full of cats and rabbits, and the titular Kirkwood-owned home for rodents. Dual highlights ""Down"" and ""Time and Money"" allude to adult concerns-- parenthood and cash-flow, respectively-- but even they never seem too far from a shrug and the crack of a beer. At its best, <i>Rat Farm</i> is warm, well-executed, and slightly goofy; that won't be enough for everybody, but for the Kirkwoods circa 2013, it seems to be plenty. </p></div>"|17882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17882-meat-puppets-rat-farm/|5.5|Paul Thompson

The album’s blackened hardcore is generally restless and relentless; VHÖL colors the smallest of spaces with extra guitar lines and orotund bass parts, giving the italicized shriek a sense of unordinary saturation. But five minutes into “Set”, the record’s finale, the quartet slows suddenly, tempering their once-irascible sound into an atmospheric haze. The guitar and bass drift toward eternity, while the drums lazily march ahead toward anything, a kid kicking a stone down the street at sunset.  </p>
<p>Initially, that slow fade from sustained bustle might have been an apt metaphor for VHÖL itself, a band originally assembled to record only one album. For more than a decade, guitarist John Cobbett and drummer Aesop Dekker played together in Ludicra, an intricate black metal quintet that announced their end in 2011. But Dekker and Cobbett wanted to make one more album together, so they recruited a pair of incredible equals-- Yob vocalist and guitarist Mike Scheidt, who only sings here, and Cobbett’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26562-hammers-of-misfortune/"" target=""_blank"">Hammers of Misfortune</a> multi-instrumental bandmate Sigrid Sheie, VHÖL’s bassist. But when the four entered the studio late last year, they had enough fun and found enough chemistry that, <a href=""http://www.ssgmusic.com/a-voice-from-the-west-an-interview-with-aesop-dekker/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as Dekker admitted earlier this month</a>, they’ve already started writing new material.</p>
<p>That connection feels so obvious on <i>VHÖL</i>, a wonderfully weird intersection of black metal and hardcore impulse and attitude, evocatively laced with bits of prog, thrash and gloriously old-school rock ’n’roll. These songs put immediacy and intrigue shoulder to shoulder, so that genuinely oddball arrangements bolster songs that make you want to join the melee. You’ll likely remember the hangman riff of “Plastic Shaman” and its barked invocation-- “The wage of sin is death,” snaps Scheidt from his bully pulpit-- the first time you’ll hear it. But this isn’t some simplistic maul; VHÖL reconfigures time and expectation, shifting the tempo and tone so much that the song feels like a rollercoaster inspired by a rodeo. The great “Arising” first rumbles like Motörhead down the straightaway, an approach that likely won’t prepare you for the hyperkinetic, 90-second guitar solo that Cobbett takes during the song’s back half. Against most odds, the parts coalesce, and that’s how it works with VHÖL: Together or separately, these four musicians have been at it long enough to be discontent or uninterested in playing anything too straight, but they’ve also been at it long enough to know that it’s possible to embed strange tendencies within a framework that still sports a visceral magnetism. <i>VHÖL</i> hits on first listen; it captivates on the fifth.         </p>
<p>That VHÖL is already at work on new material is good news for these players, because they sound not only reinvigorated in this setting but also somewhat emancipated. Cobbett and Dekker will long be linked with their work in Ludicra, and there are traces of that here, for sure. But <i>VHÖL</i> is a spotlight of their versatility that finds them not only comfortable but also rather exhilarated by such an open-ended platform. By limiting her role to bass alone, Sheie, perhaps known best as a keyboardist, delivers her lines with focus and force. She overruns the rhythm and steps out for sidewinding variations, injecting a position sometimes thought to be a bit big and dumb with a jazz enthusiast’s musicality.</p>
<p>Most of all, though, it’s Scheidt that’s the wonder here. He puts down the guitar and pushes away the typecast set by his work in Yob to treat these songs like very few vocalists could. He’s a chameleon, not only able to move quickly between hardcore berating and classic metal hook-setting but also capable of blending the two. “Insane with Faith”, for instance, is a bug-eyed roar, with the band racing headlong into a circle pit; from the tone of his voice, you expect Scheidt to be in the thick of it, barking while crowdsurfing, doing his best to pull the microphone cord along for the adventure. On the other side of Scheidt’s ostensible range, he delivers long arches of falsetto as the slow exit of “Set to Await Forever” approaches. He’s like a hirsute, heavy-metal soul singer, staring out at a mix of lit lighters and thrown horns. But some of the most intriguing moments on <i>VHÖL</i> come when he’s able to do both. During the chorus of “Insane with Faith”, he crests into a low-level cry, suggesting Iron Maiden reborn in a small rock club. During “The Wall”, his serrated bark comes backed real-time by his more operatic air. That’s the kind of multiplicity upon which VHOL depends, a quality that makes them less of a supergroup and more of a generative force with an unpredictable will of their own.</p></div>"|17806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17806-vhol-vhol/|7.7|Grayson Currin

<p>If they held on through 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15772-simulat/"" target=""_blank"">Simulat</a>,</i> a spare but spaced-out journey into tech house, they might be in for a letdown. With <i>Gordian</i>, Nicolae's gone from evolution to refinement, a paring down that feels like it's wringing every last idea out of the musical concepts he set into motion on his previous album. But what we get here is something more like dilution-- sacrificing its predecessor's stargazing character for the sake of being a sort of ambiguous, fill-in-the-picture take on techno. Granted, that's at least part of what Nicolae intended for <i>Gordian</i>. He's claimed that it's a low-key concept record about mythology, the differentiation between the genuine and the manufactured, perception versus truth, and all that existential good stuff. You'll have to trust him on that-- The titles hint at grand ideas (“New Structures for Loving”; “Desire is Sovereign”; “To Touch Is To Divert”) which evoke more than the attached songs actually do.</p>
<p>As four-on-the-floor pulses go, they're hard to deny, and it's satisfying enough that the man knows how to make a kick drum sound pop your earbuds out. The title track's the best example of how he can build a lot with a little, kicks doubling as a de facto bassline that alternates between letting the beat ride and making it bubble. Giving in to the texture of the drum sounds on the whole is where most of the appeal comes from-- snares and hats distorted into reverberations that pull apart their structure and send flaked-off shards floating up into the air. And if you want a straightforward <i>thump-thump-thump </i> to work its way into your spine, there's some immediate pleasure here, especially when it gets into chord-driven buildups and breakdowns like the bell-shattering “Vertigo” or the heat glow of “Desire Is Sovereign”.</p>
<p>But the emotional appeals, individualistic quirks and unexpected shifts that mark Nicolae's best work is unsettlingly scarce here. In a discography that's regularly brought more to the table than just a good groove, <i>Gordian </i>has an intermittent blankness about it that only occasionally recalls the warm retrofuturism of <i>Simulat</i>, even as it gingerly tries to retrace a lot of that album's steps. It can be attention-getting when a bassline drops out or a new melodic refrain works its way into the track, and there's a fine sense of timing to most of the songs. But it's not often that it registers as anything more than a new patch being cued up, especially in an inexpressive middle stretch that runs through the factory-floor churn of “Semipresent” or the drippy, burbling deadpan minimalism of “Noise Code”. <i>Gordian </i>is never boring, and none of the songs drag on past the point of entropy. That every listener might bring their own meaning to each song is an provocative approach on Nicolae's part-- but it'd be better if the songs made their own purpose just as clear.</p></div>"|17918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17918-cosmin-trg-gordian/|6.0|Nate Patrin

Younge's band would launch into thrilling versions of classics like ""Buck 50"", then lurch to a halt while Younge demanded we pay our respects. Ghostface stood by, looking bewildered and clearly just wanting to rap. After several false starts, Younge asked Ghostface if he wanted to rap over vinyl; ""I'll do anything you want,"" Ghostface said, somewhat plaintively. Nonetheless, the team-up between the two soul-steeped musicians seemed sound on paper, and I remained optimistic that they would eventually lock into a groove.</p>
<p> They might yet still-- judging from their <a href=""http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/ghostface-adrian-younge-masta-killa-killah-priest-and-the-roots-i-declare-war-on-fallon/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance on Fallon recently</a>, they've already hit a new plateau<i>.</i> And <i>Twelve</i><i> Reasons to Die</i>, their collaborative album, has a crazy-promising conceptual framework; playing off of Ghostface's well-worn persona, it tells the story of Tony Starks, an enforcer for the DeLuca crime family, who is murdered by his former employers after striking out on his own. His remains are melted in vinyl and pressed into a dozen LPs that, when played, resurrect him as the Ghostface Killah, a force for revenge incarnate. Ghostface has unparalleled storytelling instincts; he might be the best, most colorful storyteller rap has ever seen. The prospect of him letting his imagination pour itself into the album's four-color-panel universe is enticing. Adrian Younge's band is incredible, rifling through psychedelic soul, Stax, spaghetti western, and more.</p>
<p>And yet <i>Twelve Reasons</i> feels, frustratingly, like a really good idea from extremely talented people that needed more time. Ghostface's lyrics, for one, are uncharacteristically flat and literal, narrating the story's turns in clunky exposition like ""I declare war/ War on the DeLucas"" and ""I want mothers and sons/ I want to murder they daughters/ Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes/ Like the rise of your worst nightmare, come alive."" There are livewire lines scattered here and there, but Ghost sounded more alive, and packed more Tony Starks mojo, into the low-stakes pre-holiday-rush<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17446-wu-block/"" target=""_blank""> Wu-Block</a> project and his verse for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16994-cruel-summer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cruel Summer</i></a>'s ""New God Flow"" than he does into most of <i>Twelve Reasons</i>. And even for a project specifically intended to lovingly burnish Ghost's mythology, there are so many bald <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang</a> references -- ""Too many enemies is out there, son, trying to bring the ruckus,"" he says on (""Enemies All Around Me""),"" making ""swarm of killer bees"" references on ""Rise of the Ghostface Killah"" and <i>the very next song</i>-- that it grows distracting.</p>
<p>Still, Ghostface sounds incredible over Adrian Younge's band, which fits him like a custom-designed Starksmobile. ""Revenge Is Sweet"" opens with high voices singing wheezily over a murky, gutted snare tick and piano, channeling the enervated atmosphere of  Sly Stone's <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i> before Ghost rips into the track. ""Rise of the Black Suits"" and ""Beware of the Stare"" both expertly mimic the texture of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> loops while warming up the music's edges with cinematic touches: The howling backup singers are the aural equivalent of slow-mo widescreen. On ""The Sure Shot, Pts. 1 &amp; 2"", the drummer tosses off tight, showy fills without pushing against Ghost's voice, while dirty transistor-amp guitars honk nastily in the background. Sometimes live bands can swallow a rapper with over-enthusiasm, but Younge and his crew stay restrained.</p>
<p>Their chemistry is so apparent that it's a shame the final product isn't better. It reminds me of Freeway's <i>The Stimulus Package</i>, another seemingly can't-miss proposition from two phenomenal talents that fell just short. Like a lot of what Ghost has done in the past few years--<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14942-apollo-kids/"" target=""_blank""><i> Apollo Kids</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13537-ghostdini-the-wizard-of-poetry-in-emerald-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14112-wu-massacre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wu-Massacre</i></a>-- <i>Twelve Reasons to Die</i> basically feels like a victim of haste. Ghostface has kept up a fiendish pace even this late into his career, but at this stage, his dogged clip is hurting his output. Now that he and Younge have had some rehearsal time, at least the live show for this record is almost certain to be phenomenal. And there are more than enough positive moments here to make the pairing feel worth that effort. In the end, <i>Twelve Reasons</i> is generous comfort food for Ghost's fanbase, a group slowly being whittled away by time and creeping indifference.</p></div>"|17872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17872-ghostface-killah-adrian-younge-twelve-reasons-to-die/|7.4|Jayson Greene

Their leader is a papal parody named Papa Emeritus II, who comes cloaked in inverted crosses and a sinister skeletal mask. He's flanked by five Nameless Ghouls dressed in matching black uniforms that suggest Darth Vader using the force to infiltrate and overrun the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Despite mounds of speculation and the exposure risk the band’s touring schedules involves, the identities of the musicians remain unknown (or, at least unconfirmed), furthering the allure of their at-large intrigue. Ghost have risen to popularity in relatively antiquated order, too, parlaying the buzz behind a single issued via social media (a move now more democratic than issuing a 7”) into a record deal and a licensing contract for the exciting <i>Opus Eponymous</i>, a debut that upended many 2010 and 2011 year-end lists. The old-fashioned label bidding war that followed led to a contract rumored to be as high as $750,000 with new Universal Records imprint, Loma Vista. To recap: A major label funds a band that poses as the Anti-Christ and his henchmen and plays old-school heavy metal with hooks as addictive as sin while also covering <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyGTyPo444"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles</a> and <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/dave-grohl-ghost-abba-im-a-marionette-cover-drums-producer-swedish-metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ABBA</a>: Why<i> wouldn’t </i>you pull for Ghost B.C.? </p>
<p>One compelling reason to forego the Ghost B.C. fanfare is <i>Infestissumam</i>, the band’s mostly laughable second album. The ballyhoo for Ghost’s follow-up has been so strong that it landed them on <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/magazine/ghost-100-february-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 100th cover of <i>Decibel</i></a> two months before it was issued. A name <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/ghost-change-name-ghost-bc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">change</a>, an <a href=""http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/ghost-album-delayed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">album cover so controversial</a> some manufacturers allegedly refused to print it, and the fortuitous timing of the actual <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/11/world/europe/pope-resignation-q-and-a"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pope’s early departure</a> have only ratcheted anticipation. And though these 10 songs seem to be a logical progression from <i>Opus Eponymous</i>, <i>Infestissumam</i> all but abandons the twin senses of danger and discovery upon which Ghost once depended. This is a pop-rock record underwritten with childlike Anti-Christian sentiment; the tension between those underdeveloped directions-- surface-level darkness and near-translucent accessibility-- creates little but an insufferable stiffness.</p>
<p>Sure, <i>Infestissumam</i> delivers a handful of hooks you won’t escape and a few zingers that’ll make you smile, but that’s about it. “Ghuleh/Zombie Queen”, for instance, is the record’s eight-minute centerpiece. Above forlorn piano and Coldplay-earnest guitar, Papa uses his best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Gibbard</a> croon to mix Latin and empty Satanic jingoism. The song eventually sidesteps into surf-rock, black metal, and a “Paradise by the Dashboard Light” sing-along; it is one of the most awkward things you will ever hear. At its best, <i>Opus Eponymous</i> capably laced Ghost’s pop ambition with heavy metal’s sense of danger, as with the bracing crunch of “Ritual” or the hangman guitar tone of the simultaneously clever and goofy “Satan Prayer”. At its best, however, <i>Infestissumam</i> is only a reminder of that earlier record’s now-apocryphal promise.</p>
<p>With their label’s largesse secured, Ghost B.C. surprisingly headed to Nashville, Tenn., to record with Nick Raskulinecz, a regular Foo Fighters producer who’s also worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones/"" target=""_blank"">the Deftones</a>, Alice in Chains, and Velvet Revolver. If Ghost B.C. were going to be a major-label metal act, they needed to <i>sound</i> like a major-label metal act, right? To that end, <i>Infestissumam</i> is at least a crisp and full production, from the grand theatrical choir that invokes the black mass at the start to the pitch-shifting synthesizer that goads along album closer “Monstrance Clock”. But Raskulinecz brightens the band until the mystery and suspense disappear, turning these evil thoughts into baubles that sound safe enough for big money and rock radio.</p>
<p>The record’s back half, for instance, is a half-marathon of bad stylistic decisions that put Ghost B.C. in settings that they just can’t make convincing. “Body and Blood” is <i>about</i> necrotic cannibalism, but it sounds like something Sloan might have left on the floor of the editing room. Its affable jangle and eventual surge wilt under Raskulinecz’s spotlight. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4208-they-might-be-giants/"" target=""_blank"">They Might Be Giants</a> decided to cut a funny little metal record (and why haven’t they?), “Idolatrine” and its jaunting organ might form the fourth single. And “Depth of Satan’s Eyes” offers neutered quips about flatulence and feces above a vaguely doom metal clip; it’s the sort of flimsy, silly, and safe pap that suggests Ghost B.C. might be a side-project for another band in costume, the motherfucking Doodlebops. <i>Infestissumam</i> is a great critique of how self-serious yet puerile heavy metal can get, but that’s probably not the point of a lucrative record deal.</p>
<p>In the heavy metal community, Ghost B.C.’s defenders often talk about the band as a gateway for young metal fans, a new chance to expand the musty dark legions. In his <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/08/why-ghost-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">smart 2011 piece</a> for <i>Invisible Oranges</i> titled “Why Ghost Matters,” Justin M. Norton argued that metal needs new converts, and that Ghost was the band to do just that. “I could play [<i>Opus Eponymous</i>] for my mother, a Carly Simon devotee, and she’d find something to like. … I see The Undead Pope becoming an effective recruiter, much like Eddie or Anton LaVey. He is metal’s own Uncle Sam.”</p>
<p>But, in 2013, to what exactly is Ghost B.C. a gateway? Back to old notions of rock’n’roll, where Jim Morrison is still a poet waxing above organs and major-label polish is a requisite of important music? To an excuse for a lack of substance in the presence of great style and pristine surface? To a worldview in which darkness and anger and frustration serve only to become a punchline and where the Anti-Christ “comes into the daughters of men” and creates silly portmanteaus like “Idolatrine”? Is that even a gateway anyone wants to offer anymore?</p></div>"|17807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17807-ghost-bc-infestissumam/|5.8|Grayson Currin

His gleeful reveal was that the live performance of EDM was not about talent; he and his contemporaries in the EDM world were simply “button pushers”. So what if his off-the-peg, risk-free “live” shows were a pantomime? The real magic, as he saw it, happened in the studio and that’s what drew his fans to the show. There’s an interesting point in there somewhere about the tension between the creation and presentation of electronic music, which was picked up and eloquently dissected by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"">Elite Gymnastics</a>’ James Brooks on <a href=""http://deadgirlfriends.tumblr.com/post/33723428275/what-are-your-thoughts-on-deadmau5s-we-all-hit-play"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his own Tumblr</a>; noting: “</span><span class=""s2"">all of the really interesting things about my creative process are happening inside my head, there’s no way for me to show you that the way that a rock musician can.</span><span class=""s1"">” </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">While Brooks identified the escapist value in occasionally being “bullshitted” by mainstream music, Deadmau5’s post was ultimately born of a frustration with deception: “But to stand up and say youre doing something special outside of a studio environment, when youre not, just plain fuckin annoys me.” Again, it’s a fair point and one that brings semantics into play: what does “live” electronic music mean today? Is it simply the act of being present and hitting that button? Is it a straight recreation of the album in a public arena? Is it a translation of computer compositions for a live context? Or is it an <i>extension</i> of the music, seeing the tracks as a loose framework within which to experiment and give birth to new versions?</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It’s a question that, while perhaps not intentionally, long-serving UK techno duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5317-simian-mobile-disco/"">Simian Mobile Disco</a> provide their own answer to with their new album. <i>Live</i> is a one-take, unedited recording of their gig on the Philadelphia leg of their summer 2012 US tour. SMD are big gear heads-- they perform with a series of analogue synths, 909 drum machine, and effects pedals-- and see their live process as a route to freedom: “On this tour, the setlist was pretty much the same each night, but the way we played the tracks varied. Because of the way we have everything set up, we can easily jam out individual tracks depending on how the we and the crowd are feeling,” <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/simian-mobile-disco-live-album-stream-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they recently explained</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The result, as with any live album, is not one you can really dip into at random, admittedly a tall order for today’s skip-attuned instincts. But commit to the flux and flow of this 68-minute journey and the reward of riding it is great. Featuring select tracks from across their back catalogue of studio albums-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10345-attack-decay-sustain-release/""><i>Attack Decay Sustain Release</i></a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13420-temporary-pleasure/"">Temporary Pleasure</a>,</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14896-delicacies/""><i>Delicacies</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16654-unpatterns/""><i>Unpatterns</i></a>-- <i>Live</i> is a deft exhibition of SMD’s deep understanding of tension and release. They build and stoke steadily throughout the first 15 or so minutes of tough techno rhythms, an immersion that serves to tease impassioned response to the delicate, soaring melody of “Cerulean”. There are audible crowd cheers at the decaying close of their Beastie Boys-evoking number “It’s The Beat” and the bleepy-bloopy beginning of “Skin Cracker” that provide their own joyful reminder of the album’s context. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">“Wooden” has some gorgeous cascading keys that evoke the spirit of the UK’s second summer of love and the birth of rave culture a quarter of a century ago. But it’s the segueing of “Seraphim” into “Cruel Intentions” that provides the seductive heart of the record, a sensual reminder of ecstatic possibilities of a half-time beat and a pure house vocal. As with any live set there are points in which you fully inhabit the music and others where your body is so caught up in its motion that your mind wanders. That’s no bad thing. It’s all about context with <i>Live</i>: each moment is a build to and release from the next. However electronic music continues to evolve and grow, for Simian Mobile Disco the clue’s in their name: the studio might be the starting point but their music is most alive on the road and in the live moment.</span></p></div>"|17877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17877-simian-mobile-disco-live/|7.5|Ruth Saxelby

The duo recorded <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>in their Los Angeles home as well as the Sonic Ranch studio perviously occupied by indie A-listers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>. The production upgrade from their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14815-all-night/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> is significant, but you spot the real difference even before you push play. 2010’s <i>All Night </i>washed up during chillwave’s low tide with an appropriate backstory: Dexter Tortoriello and Megan Messina camped out in Hawaii to get away from the troubles of modernity for three months, lived off the land and made an album about it.</p>
<p>In contrast, <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>earned the honor of ""this month's craziest concept album"" in the April 2013 issue of <i>GQ</i>: It’s the story of a couple separated by a nuclear holocaust and attempting to reunite along California’s Highway 10. This will be repeated in every single mention of <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>for good reason: it’s a nice hook that's much more interesting than the album's hour's worth of inert synth-pop ambience.</p>
<p>The problem here is that <i>A Quiet Darkness</i> comprises mostly dirges, and dirges that don’t do a hell of a lot to distinguish themselves from each other. A typical song introduces itself with a four-bar pattern of reverberant piano chords; after the gaps in between are filled in by starlit synth twinkling, that pattern may alter slightly. Tortoriello’s wearied voice draws out a soporific melody which will occasionally be abetted by Messina’s sympathetic harmonies. The songs become increasingly spacious without ever achieving a crescendo and they fall into a rumpled heap after about five minutes of prodding from an unyielding kick drum thud. And then they do it all over again. That <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>doesn’t offer much in the way of immediate pleasure shouldn’t be entirely to its detriment, but this album doesn’t grow on you; it <i>wears </i>on you.</p>
<p>A lot of the blame lies with Tortoriello and Messina’s vocals, which “fit” within the somnambulant tempos and sobering reverb by adding another layer of downy comfort. Tortoriello ranges from a resigned David Gray to a hungover Chris Martin, and he certainly takes pains to let you know this is <i>sad </i>music; note the occasional repeated lyric concerning the white wings of god and birds falling into the hands of decay. He’s an emotive singer, but not an expressive one, and so you never get a sense of desperation, of passion, or any indication that the characters in this story ever burned hotter than a vanilla-scented votive for each other, let alone enough to survive a nuclear winter.</p>
<p>At times, this can actually work to Houses’ advantage, the low-dosage melancholy accumulating to the point where the overall effect becomes incapacitating. They get to this sweet spot by borrowing sugar from their neighbors in the arena-synth game. In the context of <i>A Quiet Darkness</i>’ indulgent tempos and song lengths, the thunderous rolls of booming orchestral percussion and distorted, descending chords towards the end of “Beginnings” are at least welcome for their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>-style grandiosity. By adding piccolo snare rolls and a silvery, slow-moving guitar figure to its drum machine and acoustic pitter-patter, “Peasants” situates itself as a triangulation point between <i>White Ladder </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank""><i>xx</i></a>; it’s not an isolated incident as Tortoriello appropriates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a>’s riffs the way Jimmy Page appropriated Willie Dixon<i>.</i> Penultimate instrumental “The Bloom” is five minutes of slo-mo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"" target=""_blank"">Stars of the Lid</a>-style drone, ostensibly meant as a pregnant pause before the inevitable death of the main characters. Yet the only real revelation is how little it differs from the equally torpid title track, one of the many on <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>that imagines <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hospice </i></a>consisting only of its ambient interludes.</p>
<p>In the context of a concept album, cohesion should be a good thing-- but it doesn't work in a situation where its creators are trying to form a narrative arc intimating that the characters concerned were married and endured a nuclear disaster. What <i>A Quiet Darkness </i>needs is contrast. That its mournful tones<i> </i>could pass for any old breakup album isn’t evidence of its universality, but lack of focus.</p></div>"|17937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17937-houses-a-quiet-darkness/|5.6|Ian Cohen

Snapper's Peter Gutteridge, for example, played brief roles in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5411-the-chills/"">the Chills</a> (among others), and the band's original guitarist, Dominic Stones, was also in <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/3Ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 3Ds</a>. If you expanded that family tree to include artists influenced by Flying Nun, it would start to stretch out to book-length proportions. This debut EP by Snapper, one of a small handful of releases from the on-again, off-again band, is remarkably similar to the sound <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> would use as the nucleus for their career. Originally released in 1988, each track hums to the sound of a familiar organ drone and a wash of distorted guitar, all tied into a precision-tooled drive that mirrors Klaus Dinger's motorik drumming in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>.</p>
<p>Stereolab were, of course, expert plunderers, although their cheerful musical thievery didn’t just help fill out their sound. It was also educational, sending fans on a hunt for increasingly esoteric source material, most of which was far harder to find in pre-internet times. This EP from Snapper could be seen as a sort of year zero for Tim Gane's post-<a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McCarthy</a> work, although it's deserving of far greater praise as a work in its own right. Gutteridge only kept this lineup of the band together for one full-length album, the lauded <i>Shotgun Blossom</i>, but this is arguably the better record. It does everything this band set out to do, condensed down to four tracks, picking up on a trend from the era of bands spreading some of their best material over an EP, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s <i>You Made me Realise</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>'s <i>Hypnotized</i>, or <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Loop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loop</a>'s <i>Collision</i>.</p>
<p>The most remarkable part of this release is how assured Snapper sound, how complete their vision was right out of the gate. ""Buddy"" and ""Hang On"" are expertly constructed kraut-pop songs from long before that term was coined, both laden with vocal hooks and compelling organ lines. There's even some blurring of gender lines, another popular trick around this time, with Gutteridge and Christine Voice's vocals sometimes blending into one another. Gutteridge clearly had an astute ear for keeping everything simple, for using repetition to hypnotic effect. ""Cause of You"" only has three lines, one of which is the title repeated over and over. There's the occasional clunker-- calling a song ""Death and Weirdness in the Surfing Zone"" is perhaps overstating their knack for bleeding <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boVY83PQvX8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""California Girls""</a> into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJUpY5geWcU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sister Ray""</a> via <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5wJQkvSoOQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankie Teardrop""</a>. It scarcely matters when the sheer force of the organ drone is so joyously overpowering.</p>
<p>This EP is surfacing again via a limited edition <a href=""http://recordstoreday.com/Home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Store Day</a> release as part of <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>' reissue campaign for the Flying Nun catalog. Only 600 copies will be available, meaning it will disappear as quickly as it reappeared. Releasing it that way ties into the collectible mindset that will forever stick to Flying Nun, but this is a work that deserves a bigger audience. Gutteridge is owed long-overdue credit, not just for the bands that have taken cues from him (also among them: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3491-quickspace/"">Quickspace</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28493-moon-duo/"">Moon Duo</a>), but also for his abilities as a songwriter. ""Hang On"" demonstrates such a great appreciation of pop, for knowing exactly when to let each part breathe and recline, turning into something both forceful and beautiful. Yes, this is another story of a band that didn't find the fanbase it deserved, in this case partly due to Gutteridge's <a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/performance/8304669/The-Snapper-noise-returns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drug problems</a>. Still, it's hard not to wonder what could have been and feel a twinge of injustice at it all.</p></div>"|18014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18014-snapper-snapper-ep/|7.5|Nick Neyland

At least he has <i>Excavation</i>, a sort of multifaceted roadmap of the afterlife, to guide him. This record, his first for <a href=""http://tri-anglerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tri Angle</a>, is about the journey taken after death, making it a sequel to his eponymous 2011 debut, which was themed around someone approaching their final days on the planet. Both albums are imagined, instrumental quests, drawn out through electronic compositions with occasional strings. The first record came close to twisted <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wicker_Man_soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Wicker Man</i></a> folk at times. This one plunges into a blackened well and never gets out. There is no light relief from Krlic's malaise, no sense that we won't be here some day and there's a place at the end of it all where we might find peace. <i>Excavation</i> is quite the opposite. It paints death as a terrifying, complex process, full of confounding turns and illogical rhythms.</p>
<p>Krlic isn't exactly working in isolation as the Haxan Cloak; he has peers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>'s drone-shaped darkness, and he's in a similar orbit to the digital trudge-to-oblivion practiced by fellow Londoners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30862-raime/"">Raime</a>. But while <i>Excavation</i> continues a theme, it goes to more expansive places than anything that bears vaguely similar properties. It's bold and domineering, the kind of music that towers over you and casts a giant, intimidating shadow. There's a magical quality to it, drawn from its transportive nature. It's hard to imagine this being put together in someone's bedroom or a crappy studio, mainly because it's so far withdrawn from the everyday. Krlic has far grander thoughts in mind. He is, after all, building a whole world here, one full of mysterious scratch marks on walls, bloodstained carpets, or the noose tossed into view on the album's cover.</p>
<p><i>Excavation</i> is more soundtrack than regular album, pulling on familiar tropes from the horror world such as the sudden escalation of strings that lead to a stony silence in ""Consumed"". But Krlic doesn't follow a straight path at any point, instead setting muted rhythms in progress and disrupting them just when it feels like you've got a handle on where he's going. The depth is quite extraordinary at times, largely due to the bottomless bass Krlic deploys, helping to depict the afterlife as a relentless slog. In many religions death is seen as a destination, but here it's a struggle, another journey, a new set of circumstances with which to grapple. There's a strong sense of deterioration, of things falling apart. When ""Excavation (Part 2)"" plunges into the quiet it feels like Krlic's carefully constructed world faded away, only for it to segue into the queasy strings that beckon in the following ""Mara"" that confirm: yes, you are still here in his personal hell.</p>
<p>It's an album sequenced with a central narrative in mind, and one that's not without glimmers of hope at key junctures. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14826-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">""The Mirror Reflecting (Part 2)""</a> and ""The Drop"" are key tracks, both deploying lighter textures that symbolize a form of redemption from the sooty gloom that eats at the edges of the Haxan Cloak. They come toward the close of the record, suggesting that some kind of unsteady peace has been made in this particular form of purgatory. It adds a resigned air to the album, a sense of accepting fate no matter how bad it may be. Krlic brings the strings into greater view once again during ""The Drop"", heightening the feelings of sadness and empathy that slowly guide us away from the inky path of all-out grief and dejection. Still, the bass hits continue to punch in that sinking feeling and the beats add a dramatic flourish, always emphasizing that this is a place of sickness, not security.</p>
<p>With music we like, we often talk about the compulsion to come back to it, that need to hit the repeat button as soon as it's over. But music you need a break from can be equally powerful. <i>Excavation</i> has that air, of a place that actually needs some preparation before entering into it. It's not aesthetically similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>'s later works, but it similarly highlights how certain music specifically needs the right time, place, and mood to function. Krlic even seems to know it himself, commenting in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9070-the-haxan-cloak/"">Rising</a> feature about the effects of his nine-hour-straight recording sessions. ""Being in that zone for that long can freak you out,"" he said. Instead, <i>Excavation</i> gains power from gathering a little dust for a while, becoming a dark treat to occasionally sink into. It's not a place in which to seek refuge from life's ills, but rather one in which you can satisfy a perverse need to draw them in closer.</p></div>"|17732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/|8.7|Nick Neyland

Yet it still contains a certain romantic allure among those who never stood a chance of getting in it. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/238-art-brut/"" target=""_blank"">Art Brut</a>'s new greatest hits collection <i>Top of the Pops</i> (a two-disc set featuring a CD of B-sides and demos) is named after the defunct BBC TV rundown of the nation's favourite songs, an obsession of their ever-enthusiastic frontman Eddie Argos on which they never appeared. In typically shambolic fashion, they've only gone and forgotten to include their actual song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO3OUjLNSMI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Top of the Pops""</a>, an early and live favourite that was always prefaced by a gleeful string of fibs about where the south London band were number one.</p>
<p>Presciently named after the French for ""outsider art,"" Art Brut always shot just wide of the mark; had they been around 10 years earlier, they'd undoubtedly have been a fixture of the ITV network's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DE27DF7A9AEC318"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chart Show Indie Chart""</a>-- an earnest rival to ""TOTP"" that broadcast videos by bands like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4564-the-wedding-present/"" target=""_blank"">Wedding Present</a> (who released two singles volumes called <i>Hit Parade</i>) on Saturday mornings-- if not genuine Britpop bona fides. In a Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35010-5-10-15-20-art-bruts-eddie-argos/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> from 2009, Argos recalled seeing a copy of <i>NME</i> that asked, ""Who's the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/"" target=""_blank"">Jarvis Cocker</a>?"" ""I thought, 'Fucking hell, some prick I bet.' And I opened it up and it was me. I was like, 'Oh fuck! Well, that's nice.""</p>
<p>Just as British indie music was getting smart again after a fallow few years either side of the millennium, Art Brut's demeanor embraced indie's coziest, most cardigan-wearing past; Argos standing against all prevailing trends, trying to recreate the world of his youth. But their 2005 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/475-bang-bang-rock-roll/"" target=""_blank"">Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</a> </i>was a near perfect, shabbily anthemic post-punk record that set out Argos' abundantly hilarious lyrical stock in trade: singing about how his relationships with music and ladies were as close as the ""n"" in ""snog"" and ""song"".</p>
<p>In among the declarations of romantic haplessness (<a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/art-brut/good-weekend-live/AUN861100221?source=instantsearch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I've seen her naked <i>twice</i>!""</a>) was a rampant self-mythologizing streak so overstated it was as if Art Brut knew they could only ever fail, despite being stated with such bounding naivety and joyous conviction that they believed it would all come true. If only; Argos' benign, brilliant, <a href=""http://cobweb.businesscollaborator.com/hmhb/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Half Man Half Biscuit</a>-indebted sense of humor evident on the <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i> singles included here is something painfully lacking among young British indie bands today.</p>
<p>Art Brut were arguably obsessed with restoring a culture over individual success, which is lucky since their highest charting single went in like a bullet at number 41. Although one memorable scene in ""Gilmore Girls"" sees resident indie nut Lane Kim <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVq_tPQN9fU&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">swear</a> that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qryAwfpHG8o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Formed a Band""</a> should be the national anthem, Art Brut abjectly failed at bringing back the time Argos craved, or slowing the path of an increasingly compromised alternative music culture to the mainstream. But having committed themselves to failure after establishing such lofty goals in the first place, you'd think it wouldn't matter to them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at least in the narrative that <i>Top of the Pops</i> spins, everything that followed <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i> did so with increasingly unbecoming shades of bitterness. They'd have been better off reissuing <i>Bang Bang</i> for a second time than opting to tell this glum take on events. The songs included here from 2007's EMI-released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10336-its-a-bit-complicated/"" target=""_blank""><i>It's a Bit Complicated</i></a> (where Jasper Future replaced Chris Chinchilla on guitar) wonder ""what else can we do when the kids don't like it?"" Argos experiments with and ultimately muddles his personal narratives, and when he wearily yells ""punk rock ist nicht tot!"" it sounds like the delusional cry of a man bent over punk's dying corpse; not the words of the bloke who once joyously belted, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP6nY-112Xc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""MODERN ART! MAKES ME! WANT TO ROCK OUT!""</a></p>
<p>The malaise increases with 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12902-art-brut-vs-satan/"" target=""_blank""><i>Art Brut vs. Satan</i></a> (a return to Cooking Vinyl/Downtown), produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/381-frank-black/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Black</a>, where Argos sings of his arrested development, unruly drinking problems, and shit summer jobs. He also now hates all the idiots that just can't appreciate good music: ""If we can't change the world/ Let's at least get the charts right/ How can you sleep at night/ When nobody likes the music we write?/ Record-buying public, we hate them/ This is Art Brut vs. Satan,"" goes ""Demons Out!"", where the band start to sound like the tiresomely dogmatic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/958-the-cribs/"" target=""_blank"">Cribs</a>. The Wakefield band's 2005 single ""Hey Scenesters!"" was a disdainful comment on the emergence of indie culture that Art Brut ran around celebrating like lunatics on ""Formed a Band"". Here, the distance between them shrinks depressingly.</p>
<p>The returns don't stop diminishing: Also produced by Frank Black, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15417-brilliant-tragic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Brilliant! Tragic!</i></a>'s ""Axl Rose"" sees Argos reduced to a cantankerous cipher: ""The world is fucked, and you're an idiot/ Why don't you take a long look at my middle digit!"" He makes hapless attempts at singing in a sinister whisper that suggests a stalker ogling his unwitting intented; the band are as convincingly vigorous as someone trying to pogo on a belly full of Sunday roast.</p>
<p>Two new numbers close CD1: ""Arizona Bay"" is named for a Bill Hicks album where he fantasized about L.A. falling ""in the fucking ocean"", thus destroying the fantasy explored in <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i>'s ""Moving to L.A."" Here, Argos is in the middle of an earthquake situation that reads like a less-than-subtle take on the band's dwindling career. Closer ""We Make Pop Music"" is the only song on <i>Top of the Pops</i>' main disc that hits a musically regretful note, playing out with an almost-epic middle-eight over which Argos desperately yells, ""We make pop music! We make <i>pop music</i>!"" (Though in a recent blogpost, Argos <a href=""http://www.lofipunkrockmotherfucker.co.uk/post/29611690472/what-happened-to-having-musical-genres-people"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>, ""I only like guitar music and everybody who disagrees with me is a cunt."")</p>
<p>With the release of <i>Top of the Pops</i>, Argos keeps insisting that Art Brut were a ""classic rock"" band all along, offering the fact that they've been on the cover of German <i>Rolling Stone</i> and posed naked in the <i>NME</i> as proof. In a sense (though not the one intended), he's right: <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i> was an accidentally classic album that gave Art Brut an immediate legacy that they seemed to know they'd never top-- a fate that befalls classic rock bands obsessed with besting their best and blaming the rest rather than engaging with the culture around them.</p></div>"|17906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17906-art-brut-top-of-the-pops/|6.0|Laura Snapes

Little on Grubbs’ latest release will likely register as pop music, at least for any listeners who might reasonably expect that description to mean hooks, choruses, or hummable melodies. At the same time, Grubbs’ overall body of work is so expansive and unwieldy -- bridging as it does various streams of avant-rock, multi-media art, and academia-- that it would be a challenge to find any particular box to squeeze him into. On his first solo album since 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12299-an-optimist-notes-the-dusk/"" target=""_blank""><i>An Optimist Notes the Dusk</i></a>, there are guitars, some song-based material, vocals, and recognizable lyrics, so perhaps pop music is as good a description as any, eccentric and deconstructed though it may be.</p>
<p>It feels like a bit of a stretch to call this a Grubbs solo album. Grubbs’ resume, of course, is a long one, including not only stints in seminal post-punk acts Squirrel Bait, Bastro, and Gastr Del Sol, but also a catalog of collaborations that reads like a cross-platform who’s-who list: Loren Conners, Rhys Chatham, Pauline Oliveros, Tony Conrad, Rick Moody, and on and on. <i>The Plain Where the Palace Stood</i> proves no exception, as here Grubbs is joined by the multi-talented C. Spencer Yeh, drummer/composer Andrea Belfi, and guitarist Stefano Pilia. Grubbs’ open-ended and elliptical playing style gives his guest musicians generous room to operate, and several pieces here sound less like solo work and more like the work of a fully operational band.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the sound of the album is organized around Grubbs and his guitar. Largely avoiding the folk touches of such past works as <i>The Coxcomb</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3584-a-guess-at-the-riddle/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Guess at the Riddle</i></a>, here he sticks almost exclusively with electric guitar, generating a series of resonant droning pieces, as well as a couple of full-group cuts that might have listeners of a certain age hearkening effortlessly back to the Louisville of the early 90s. Though the word “experimental” sticks to Grubbs like a faded tattoo, there is little on <i>The Plain Where the Palace Stood</i> that covers ground that he has not crossed many times before.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a bad or disappointing thing. The opening title track, which features a vivid cameo from C. Spencer Yeh’s scrabbly violin, is as close as Grubbs’ deliberate music can come to sounding careless and risky. Here, as elsewhere on the album, Belfi’s drumming is marvelous, providing an inventive textural counterpoint to Grubbs’ thoughtful if sometimes static guitar lines.</p>
<p>Only four of the album’s 11 tracks have vocals, and, true to past form, the lyrics of “I Started to Live When My Barber Died” and “Ornamental Hermit” consist of brainy and rather inscrutable prose, thrusting his listeners into narratives that seem to have begun before we got here. It is perhaps telling, then, that the most memorable (though not exactly catchy) tracks here are instrumentals. The herky-jerk “Super-Adequate” recalls the influence that Squirrel Bait and Bastro once exerted on bands like Archers of Loaf or Polvo. And on “A View of the Mesa” and “Abracadabrant”, Grubb’s solitary guitar tones hint at the panoramic Western drones of Earth or Barn Owl.</p>
<p>Framing the album are three wordless pieces entitled “First Salutation”, “Second Salutation”, and “Third Salutation”, which include the album’s only acoustic guitar work, as well as burbling electronic drones and rumbling percussion. Though they contain lively passages, these pieces tend to pass by rather anonymously, and serve to prevent the album from maintaining much sense of cohesion or momentum. However one chooses to tag it, the album shows that Grubbs’ music and his relationship to pop convention remains as distanced, fitfully frustrating, and stubbornly idiosyncratic as ever.</p></div>"|17873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17873-david-grubbs-the-plain-where-the-palace-stood/|6.4|Matthew Murphy

He's played in many bands, most notably the pliant <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/splash.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a> mainstays <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"">Trans Am</a>. A couple of years back he put out an album under his own name titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14990-life-coach/""><i>Life Coach</i></a>, a moniker he now assumes as his solo guise. The changes made since then are barely perceptible. Essentially, he's an excellent mimic, with <i>Alphawaves</i> again demonstrating his affinity for reappropriating the core tools of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> and other krautrock acts, and for carbon reproductions of various other styles. But this isn't tribute-band trash; part of Manley's skill is in hauling new feeling out of well-trodden ideas. Klaus Dinger's motorik drum beat is now so commonplace that it's almost become corny, forcing anyone who goes near it to dig harder and deeper to draw something compelling from the source.</p>
<p>In truth, Manley only does Dinger once here, rinsing out his Neu! baggage early on and moving on elsewhere. When it comes, on the title track, it's pretty hard to resist, with drummer Jon Theodore (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"">Mars Volta</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>) sticking to the impressively straight rhythm, electronic bass pumping like pistons underneath, and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"">Robert Fripp</a>-inspired guitar squall bristling in all the right places. There's nothing new here, but it shows there's still some life to be found from well-worn ground, and it gets especially joyous when some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/"">Marnie Stern</a>-like shredding chops across everything at the midway point. When Manley decides to channel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> on the following track it feels like <i>Alphawaves</i> might be an exercise in determining whether any feeling can be dug out of influences that have been bled dry over the years, although the rest of the album ultimately ends up going down a different route.</p>
<p>If the early part of this record skies toward consciousness-altering, the rest is firmly grounded. It's not exactly Manley living out all his <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Rush"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rush</a> fantasies, but it's not far removed. Like the first <i>Life Coach</i> album, there's no set style, no musical theme that runs throughout. It bears all the hallmarks of a loose collection of ideas, probably a lot of fun to play, with no set destination in mind. At its worst it's directionless, practice-room flab (""Into the Unknown""), less a track and more just some guys hanging out, cracking open a six-pack, and getting a feel for where each other's strengths lie. Elsewhere, the 90s alt-rock vibes are strong, with stout guitar riffs vying with strung-out vocals. The solos all come exactly when you expect them to, the playing is impeccable, and the production is crisp and sharp, as you'd expect from Manley, who has produced records for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"">Wooden Shjips</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a>, among others.</p>
<p>The original <i>Life Coach</i> record was something that wandered in search of an identity and largely came up wanting. There is an advance on that here, although it still only feels like you get into Manley's head for about half the album. That may be the place Life Coach is destined to occupy, bringing in a clutch of original thoughts and renewing old ideas that have been relentlessly hammered into the ground by others. It's not necessarily a bad place to be, just one that veers between pointlessness and illumination so sharply that it comes a little too close to actually watching a band figuring things out in real time. Most musicians don't like their side projects being referred to as side projects, but it's inescapable here, that feeling of finding something to do during downtime. At least Manley keeps it lean, making sure his rock has the requisite muscle then getting out sharp after 40 minutes. There is, after all, plenty of other things he has going on.</p></div>"|17910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17910-life-coach-alphawaves/|6.1|Nick Neyland

Kentucky-turned-Minnesota one-man outfit Panopticon is perhaps the best-known proponent of combining left-leaning ideology with black metal fury, but Vancouverites <a href=""http://skagos.bandcamp.com/album/anarchic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skagos</a> are hot on his heels. They’ve even worked together on a 2010 split LP, but while Panopticon’s recent output sees Austin Lunn dealing with earthy topics like the Appalachian coal mining industry and its devastating effect upon his family’s home, Skagos prefer to wax ecological and wane mystical. They sing about destruction, elemental anguish, and man’s infinite insignificance amidst the heaving rage of a dying planet.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly Kropotkin, but then again, the atmospheric black metal duo does not currently claim a particular political affiliation (though their interest in the works of anarcho-primitivist Fredy Perlmea are well-documented). The album title is likely due more to the members’ past endeavors (bassist/vocalist Ray Hawes has done time in black/crust anarchists Iskra and nature-worshippers Fauna) and their obvious reverence for the natural world than their present inclusion in this green circle. Satan is not welcome here-- there is no room for fairy tales in Skagos’ world, and their decision to distance themselves from the trappings of traditional black metal ideology is made apparent in their music.</p>
<p><i>Anarchic</i> is a sprawling composition, split into four movements and spread across a double LP. The first side is split almost evenly between graceful, shoegazey post-rock and blasts of black metal, and feels warm, organic, and careful. It begins with soft dreamy vocals, solo and in chorus, while lonesome notes occasionally ring out and tension builds until the track explodes into furious blastbeats and raw-throated howls.</p>
<p>The album’s only real misstep comes around 25 minutes in, when a lengthy spoken word piece takes center stage and segues into regrettably mewled half-chant that, as heartfelt as it undoubtedly is, comes across as amateurish and half-baked. Side B picks back up with a single drum, beating a muted tattoo amidst ambient noise before more lackadaisical shoegaze wanders in. The black metal section is a welcome distraction, and shows the band at the top of their game; their atmospheric inclinations are all well and good, but Skagos are most effective when they’re pouring their demons out into razor-edged riffs and snarling condemnations. The tempo soon slows to a true Norwegian crawl, and the vocals drip with muddy viscosity, layered to filthy perfection. Doomy, menacing, and finely in tune with the apocalyptic visions they preach, this section is the album’s best, and the following near-acoustic passage, with its punchy little drum fills and shimmery notes, falls slightly flat in its wake. The rest of the song (there are still seven minutes left at this point) alternates between dark and light, and finishes on the same near-silent acoustic note we met at the journey’s beginning.</p>
<p>Skagos don’t mind being slapped with the “Cascadian black metal” tag-- given that they’re genuinely based in the Northwest, one can see why-- and their black metal moments do show similarities to the cyclical, rough-edged melodic style of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30080-ash-borer/"" target=""_blank"">Ash Borer</a>, Alda, or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, but it’s unfair to paint them with the same wide brush. With <i>Anarchic</i>, they've crafted an impressive, varied, and unique piece of work, one that’s not without its flaws, but that offers a bounty of rewards along its way.</p></div>"|17741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17741-skagos-anarchic/|6.8|Kim Kelly

That approach has been depicted as everything from transcendent, no-borders futurism to an exploitative colonialist ripoff, but most of his fans seem most interested in how much a given track bumps. The critical narrative shifted from Diplo as hipster scavenger to Diplo as arena-ready body-mover on the basis of a pop breakthrough that came through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a>’s “Pon de Floor”. In its original context, it was the centerpiece of an album cross-examined for appropriating dancehall culture and West Indian identity for a dayglo cartoon caricature. Then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a> got ahold of it for “Run the World (Girls)”, Diplo’s name started showing up in the credits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10805-chris-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Brown</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30583-snoop-lion/"" target=""_blank"">Snoop Lion</a> albums, the appropriation concerns shifted towards the trap scene, and the authenticity questions gradually quieted down.</p>
<p>There's still something at stake here, however, especially with the delayed, fine-tuned and much-awaited second Major Lazer album finally arriving. At this point, the project name is based more around the elaboration on one producer's vision than a group of familiar collaborators, as Switch and Skerrit Bwoy haven't made the transition from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13236-guns-dont-kill-people-lazers-do/"" target=""_blank"">Guns Don't Kill People -- Lazers Do</a> </i>to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14462-lazers-never-die-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Free the Universe</a> </i>for the respective reasons of creative differences and religious epiphany. So it's largely Diplo's statement, albeit with a new set of cohorts in Trinidad-born Jillionaire and Black Chiney's Miami-via-Jamaica sound system member Walshy Fire. So Major Lazer's fusion of club music scenes from both Europe and the Caribbean gains a couple new critical sources of firsthand input, and there's more of an opportunity for that sound to be directly informed by artists closer to the source.</p>
<p>The production's by far the strongest link on <i>Free the Universe. </i>Maybe it's not as up-front and audacious as it was on the all-stops overload of <i>Guns Don't Kill People</i>. But it's to-the-point and danceable when it's inclined to aim that way, and most of it's bound to sound commanding through massive stacks of amps. Percussion clatters through on jam-packed snare-clap-kick-hat drum patterns even before the ankle-breaking bass kicks in, while trilling digital chords inevitably steer towards all-caps siren blares. Not all of it's so energetic and frenetic; the foggy, calliope-and-guitar rocksteady underpinnings of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46030-download-major-lazers-collaboration-with-amber-coffman-of-dirty-projectors-get-free/"" target=""_blank"">Get Free</a>"" and the sweet Studio One haze of ""Jessica"" calm the proceedings without killing momentum. A few moments feel like gratuitous, instantly-dated trend-grabs, like when the trance-jungle feints of Flux Pavilion collaboration ""Jah No Partial"" displaces the mood with pro forma arenastep and DROPS THE BASS directly into a puddle of sludge. Yet there's enough here to satisfy the who-cares-crank-that-shit impulse that aptly soundtracks good times with recreational substances.</p>
<p>But there's a different set of problems here -- just look at everybody who shows up with a ""ft."" attached. Fittingly enough, there are a bunch of tracks featuring dancehall icons ranging from Beenie Man to Shaggy to Johnny Osborne. But there are also sincere, zero-slackness ballads featuring indie stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27804-ezra-koenig/"" target=""_blank"">Ezra Koenig</a> and Amber Coffman. There is also a guest spot from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3271-peaches/"" target=""_blank"">Peaches</a>. And Wyclef. And a teamup that includes Bruno Mars and Tyga. The biggest digression from the dancehall-indebted singer/toaster lineup on <i>Guns Don't Kill People</i> was Santigold, far from a sore thumb considering her definition-ducking versatility as a singer. This time around, she's the closest there is to a direct link from that last album's indie-electro soundclash to this one's omnidirectional crossover bid. And her voice kicks off what turns out to be a sadly disjointed experience: there's an awkward fake patois on what seems like every other track, and the overstuffed lineup dislodges any hopes of a unified musical statement.</p>
<p>All that there's left to do is examine the components and try to figure out what went haywire. ""Wind Up"", ""Watch Out for This"", and ""Mashup the Dance"" deliver the goods when the likes of Elephant Man, Busy Signal or Ward 21 put in their work and keep the energy levels up. But splitting the difference between dancehall and moombahton doesn't always create a distinct new whole that plays up both genres' bounce-ready qualities. The indie names fare OK, even if they sometimes veer towards caricature -- Coffman's dippy Tarzan yells and Koenig's wobbly attempt at Junior Murvin-gone-lover's rock falsetto on the aforementioned ""Get Free"" and ""Jessica"" make them seem a little more arch than they actually mean to be. And a few cuts that stray away from either of those categories turn out laughable: Peaches undercutting an authoritatively cocky Timberlee on the new wavey ""Scare Me"" by dropping a twerp-twerk verse that tries to make a sex-fluids double-entendre based around WikiLeaks, Wyclef's motivational-poster platitudes trying to pass for a hook on (yes) ""Reach for the Stars"" (eesh), and Tyga chortling out maybe the most shut-the-fuck-up verse of the year on ""Bubble Butt"" (""Damn, bitch, talk much?/I don't want interviews/Ha! I'm tryin' ta get into you/then make you my enemy"").</p>
<p>All those hitches, gaffes and odd little diversions add up. A no-brainer, easy-to-enjoy production slate gets knocked around by its flaws just enough that even the minor, acquired-taste touches seem like just another bad decision. (I don't know whether the filter that briefly makes Shaggy's voice sound like Meatwad on ""Keep Cool"" would sound iconoclastic and funny on a better album, rather than just a baffling flash of annoyance on this one, but there's no point wondering now.) If anybody actually expected this to stink before hearing it, even considering the odd assemblage of cameos here, they're probably more cynical than I am. But it's a bringdown that what should've been a more faithful yet adventurous transition into a new phase for Major Lazer winds up sounding like so much less than the sum of its parts.</p></div>"|17627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17627-major-lazer-free-the-universe/|5.7|Nate Patrin

The 2001 Luaka Bop reissue of Otis’ 1974 masterwork <i>Inspiration Information</i> was the first time many heard the original version of “Strawberry”, but that release managed to muddy Otis’ discography, as well. “Strawberry” was originally included on Otis’ previous album, 1971’s <i>Freedom Flight, </i>though it and four other <i>Freedom</i> songs were tacked onto the end of <i>Inspiration</i>. Their provenance was noted as such, but new Otis converts could be forgiven for slotting “Strawberry” as a late-album <i>Inspiration</i> track<i>.</i></p>
<p>Those extra tracks did no favors to <i>Inspiration</i>, which works incredibly well as its own statement, without the need for bonus material. Originally, it was to be the coming-out party for a tremendous new talent, though one who was no stranger to the music business. A blues guitar prodigy who’d been <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al89UR2l3oI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">playing with his father</a> (pioneering R&amp;B bandleader Johnny Otis) since he was 11, Otis played on Frank Zappa’s <i>Hot Rats</i> when he was 16, and released an album with blues-rock gadabout Al Kooper before he was 20. Though he stayed out of the recording process, Johnny Otis served as the executive producer for his son’s work, and he convinced Columbia to build Shuggie a home studio to record <i>Inspiration</i>, which took the better part of three years. Upon release in October 1974, <i>Inspiration</i> certainly sounded like the work of an isolated L.A. savant. Smooth, organ-driven California funk, quasi-new age psychedelia, loungey jazz instrumentals, string interludes-- all propelled by the same kind of analog drum machine that had piqued Ralf &amp; Florian's interest <a href=""http://youtu.be/lLkjZtqhPUk?t=4m9s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at the same time</a>.</p>
<p><i>Inspiration </i>instantly earned comparisons to Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and reportedly made Sly Stone’s jaw drop upon hearing it. The LP’s title track-- every bit as good as “Strawberry”-- was issued to radio, though it only reached #56 on the R&amp;B chart. The album failed to live up to Columbia’s expectations, such as they were, and Otis was unceremoniously dropped from the label after its release. In August 1977, as the Brothers Johnson version of “Strawberry” was emanating from car stereos and DJ booths, no one had heard a peep from Otis for more than two years. He wouldn’t return to public life for nearly 40 more.</p>
<p>Reissues are weird things, particularly for albums that don’t instantly announce themselves along clear genre lines, and especially for artists who don’t show any interest in adding to the conversations themselves. Which is why Epic/Legacy’s 2xCD reissue is the definitive version. On the first CD, <i>Inspiration</i> is included as its own entity, and appended with four extra tracks from those sessions-- solid B-sides, but impossible to imagine on the original album. The second CD, <i>Wings of Love</i>, is the collection’s real revelation, comprising 14 tracks that Otis recorded between 1975 and 2000. <i>Wings</i> reveals that while Otis was reclusive, he was far from idle. Listening in 2013, it’s hard not to compare it to the year’s other album, <i>m b v,</i> that’s<i> </i>composed of tracks that theoretically could have been written anytime over a period of decades. Reissues are pop music’s preeminent form of historical revisionism, but the great thing about the <i>Inspiration</i> and <i>Wings</i> set is that combined, they’re closer to a parallel universe greatest-hits compilation, in a world where a label embraced Otis’ genius and eccentricity, instead of driving him away altogether.</p>
<p>It may have killed his career, but what a way to go out-- <i>Inspiration</i> ranks among the 1970s most unique and personal musical statements. In the album, it’s possible to hear the kaleidoscopic ambition and bruised optimism of <i>What’s Going On</i> and <i>Innervisions</i>, hints of Miles Davis’ prolific funk-fusion period and Bob Marley’s ascendant good vibrations, the lingering specter of Love’s death-of-innocence opus <i>Forever Changes</i>, and the drawn-out, spaced-out folk-rock sigh emanating from Laurel Canyon. The month <i>Inspiration</i> was released, Otis’ friend Billy Preston hit #1 with his single “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_DV54ddNHE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nothing From Nothing</a>,” and <i>Inspiration</i>’s beatific title track channels that same generous spread-the-good-word spirit, which he refracts through the kind of sleek, jazz-derived rock that NYC transplants Steely Dan were mastering at the time.</p>
<p>Otis was no druggie, but <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/2013-02-21/music/shuggie-otis-inspiration-information-reissue/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted in a recent interview</a> that <i>Inspiration</i> highlight “Aht Uh Mi Hed” arose from one of his three acid trips, colored by the isolation-derived depression he was suffering during the album’s multi-year recording process. It’s a testament to Otis’ character that “Hed” is the <i>opposite</i> of dark. Instead, it serenely shimmers, like “Strawberry”: a drum machine and organ form a foundation for Otis to float above, buoyed by flutes and broken up by an orchestral interlude before segueing into a choppy funk coda. Even under such a spell, Otis convinces himself “it’s about time for something new,” and that he’s “got to grow.” <i>Inspiration</i> has long been cited as the symbolic birthplace of Prince, but the reissue’s timing and penchant for dream-logic also suggests that <i>Channel Orange</i> is among the album’s most prominent descendants.</p>
<p>“Hed”s otherworldly air is due in part to the Rhythm King drum machine, a gadget that Otis had fallen for when writing “Strawberry”. In late 1971, Sly Stone blended a Rhythm King track with a wah-wah guitar on “Family Affair”, lending that track its irresistible effervescence, and in February 1973, Timmy Thomas rode the Rhythm King to #1, via his single “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFU-FJzPE80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Why Can't We Live Together</a>”. The machine’s unique analog warmth allowed savants like Otis and Stone to do everything themselves, starting one of its simple metronomic presets and building a song around it. This is how “Pling!”-- <i>Inspiration</i>’s penultimate track and the centerpiece of its experimental b-side-- took shape. With only the Rhythm King keeping rhythm like a clock in the next room, Otis layers on a quiet Fender Rhodes line, stirs in a hodgepodge of instumentation-- a harp, a sax-- but never brings the track over the level of a whisper. Along with the jazzy, film-score style instrumental “Rainy Day” and percolating Esquivel-style lounge-funk of “XL-30” preceding it, “Pling!” moves <i>Inspiration </i>far away from Otis’ blues and R&amp;B roots, aiming toward a space at the time only occupied by his imagination. It’s this angle that many indie fans in 2001 were drawn to-- the Luaka Bop reissue featured pull-quotes from Sean O’Hagan, the kitsch-obsessed mastermind of the high-minded 90s British ensemble High Llamas, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> founder Tim Gane.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to imagine Columbia’s befuddled reaction upon hearing these tracks-- as great as they sound to music fans now as then, they must have signaled something closer to a break with reality, or perhaps one of those nettlesome “creative” types who release new material every 4-5 years. When Columbia dropped him from their roster, Otis retreated and regrouped, recording new tracks and sending them to labels, who uniformly showed no interest--to their detriment. As a compilation, <i>Wings of Love</i> plays like a bonafide album-- it’s got an “intro” and everything-- and a good one, at that.If it doesn’t quite show the knack for experimentation and variety hinted at via <i>Inspiration</i>, <i>Wings</i> is a quietly amazing document of Otis’ doggged determination over the quarter century between leaving the business and the first <i>Inspiration</i> reissue.</p>
<p>It’s a fair bet that Otis has never come into contact with the retromaniacal AM Gold-worshipping weirdos who’ve been lingering around the L.A. fringes for the better part of a decade now, but delightfully lo-fi, echo-laden <i>Wings</i> tracks like “Special”, “Tryin’ To Get Close To You”, and the Prince-styled “If You’d Be Mine” bear a striking (if entirely coincidental) resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>. It’s easy to parallel Otis dreaming of these demos winding up on Top 40 radio during the <i>actual</i> 1980s, with the recent chillwave contingent dreaming similar dreams from a fully nostalgic register. Elsewhere on the album, there are nods backward to Drifters-style soul (“Walkin’ Down the Country”), gaudy synth monsters (“Give Me A Chance”), and even a couple cuts closing the album that nod back to Otis’ blues-rock roots. Yes, <i>Wings</i> is packaged as an addendum to a reissue, but it’s no simple B-sides collection.</p>
<p>If all this isn't convincing enough, perhaps <i>Wings</i>’ outlandish 11 minute title track, sequenced right in the middle of the album, will. At once, it’s a reminder that Otis had few peers as a shredder (at his peak, both Bowie and the Stones offered him sideman gigs), and the sort of wild, proggy imagination that would make Yes album-art designer Roger Dean blush. It starts with seashore sound effects-- waves crashing, seagulls squawking-- and blossoms into the kind of earnestly majestic, new age prog-funk that might not be everyone’s bag, but which is impossible not to appreciate on its own merits, because it’s performed with such conviction. It only adds to the song's allure that it's been kept private for so long. Such is the wholly unique career trajectory of Shuggie Otis, who is now touring for the first time in 40 years.

If you posted something on Facebook that admonished gun violence, war, or an impingement on civil rights, <i>Desperate Ground </i>would “like” it without leaving a comment. But it ultimately rings hollow here, as the Thermals still are trying to <i>sound</i> like insurrectionists while leaning so heavy on boilerplate sloganeering you’d think they were the ones running for public office.</p>
<p>After the more introspective tone of 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14615-personal-life/"" target=""_blank"">Personal Life</a>, Desperate Ground </i>superficially evokes the Portland trio’s incendiary earlier work, speaking the same vocabulary as 2006’s high watermark, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9328-the-body-the-blood-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">The Body, The Blood, The Machine</a>--</i> so much that at the outset it feels like a return to form more than a retreat. In fact, opener “Born To Kill” could just be <i>The Body’s </i>supernatural sermon “I Might Need You to Kill” told from a different perspective. The Thermals were never much for variety or innovation anyway, and the 10 servings of zippy pop-punk here are of nearly uniform length, tempo, topic, and structure. Even the relative curveballs amidst the missionary strumming of four-chord progressions-- like Hutch Harris straining for a high note in the chorus, just exceeding his range-- seem to pop up in nearly the exact same place.</p>
<p>This classicist template is hard to fuck up, and the Thermals typically have good taste behind the boards: they might well be the only band who will ever be sympathetically produced by members of both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>, so the shift from John Congleton’s immaculate naturalism to 90s revivalist John Agnello (Male Bonding, Sonic Youth) should be a cinch. Yet <i>Desperate Ground</i> feels overproduced: The guitars are rendered toothless, in particular, the gutted distortion of “You Will Find Me”, which sounds ripped from a thrice-dubbed cassette.</p>
<p>Harris remains a distinctive and effective singer-- his nasal bray can cut through just about any kind of sonic clutter-- and <i>Desperate Ground</i> never drags, the hooks as facile and forgettable as you might expect from songs with titles such as “You Will Be Free”, “You Will Find Me”, and “Our Love Survives”. Let a latter-day Mark Hoppus or Jim Adkins get a crack at these melodies and you’d have a perfectly enjoyable and gooey low-stakes pop-punk record.</p>
<p>But <i>Desperate Ground </i>is a record that really wants to convey having <i>something to say</i> and Harris has run out of ways to say that something. Not long after “Born To Kill” sets the tone, <i>Desperate Ground </i>feels less like a sequel to <i>The Body </i>than a series of sequels to itself-- on “The Sunset”, Harris sings an executioner’s song, his remorse haunting him like his own shadow. On “Faces Stay With Me”, the same thing happens, only with faces instead of shadows. By the time “I Go Alone” situates itself between <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3MXiTeH_Pg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whitesnake</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soa3gO7tL-c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Day</a>, they’ve lost even the basic righteousness of sloganeering and you start to hear it as Thermals magnetic poetry with “blood,” “kill,” “war,” “road,” “sunset,” and “shadows” all popping up with alarming frequency. You could probably guess 75% of the lyrics from “The Sword By My Side” without even hearing it, and yes, they’re using a weapon as a metaphor for <i>another </i>weapon.</p>
<p>In a way, the stultifying generality of <i>Desperate Ground </i>does lend it a perspective, though it’s the all-too-common affliction of seeing the same wars drag on and the same talking heads making the same points on the news and feeling utterly helpless. Perhaps the pileup of clichés and the numbed production is supposed to give <i>Desperate Ground </i>a meta context, that the endless body count has rendered Harris completely desensitized. But that’s a generous reading for an album that begins and ends with guns-blazin' mission statements with plenty in between, so it’s more likely <i>Desperate Ground </i>is a failure to respond to the horror rather than an intention to reflect it.</p></div>"|17876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17876-the-thermals-desperate-ground/|5.0|Ian Cohen

Since attaining a coveted spot on Hot 97’s morning show, as well as his own weekly program, Rosenberg has become both a champion and a patron of the kind of rap he loves while demonizing music which doesn’t fit into the parameters he’s set.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on the New York underground, you know the names: a couple A$AP’s here, an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> there, and various members of the Beast Coast collective (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30676-flatbush-zombies/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Flatbush Zombies</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Joey Badass</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30965-pro-era/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Pro Era</a>, Dyme a Duzin) to round out the mix. There are appearances from the neo-conscious crowd (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30228-homeboy-sandman/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Homeboy Sandman</a>, the producer and DC transplant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30467-oddisee/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Oddisee</a>) and relative outliers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31027-smoke-dza/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Smoke DZA </a>and the Kid Daytona, but for the most part, the artists here are those that were tagged as derivative from the moment their music started appearing on Nah Right.</p>
<p>The bright spots emerge when <i>New York Renaissance </i>shows that traditional beats need not play host to conservative thoughts. Action Bronson has shown that from the beginning, and he does so again with his appearance on the Harry Fraud produced “Compliments 2 the Chef"".  Bronson was pegged as a revivalist, in part due to his beat selection and that unavoidable vocal resemblance to Ghostface. But he’s as influenced by absurdist Dipset phraseology as he is anything else, with music composed of larger-than–life scene-making, descriptions of a Epicurean lifestyle and the occasional glimpse of intense vulnerability. His best songs function as both caricature and character sketch, as he continues to add new details to his ever-expanding artistic persona.</p>
<p>The Flatbush Zombies, too, have managed to carve out new territory. Their raw punk energy--probably the most mosh-happy rap concerts I’ve attended-- translates on wax into a constant barely-checked aggression that makes boom-bap sound newly dangerous. The gunshots on their offering here, “Inf Beams,” are hardly necessary-- Meech’s opening verse is delivered in his signature off-kilter, enunciated flow, and it’s agreeably ominous.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most polarizing figure on the tape, and the one who most embodies both the pros and cons of the Rosenberg approach is Brooklyn's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"" target=""_blank"">Joey Bada$$</a>. Joey is a talented young rapper, who flows with an uncanny ease and who has yet to make a song that covers new ground. He, along with World’s Fair, Nick Caution, and many of the lesser-known rappers on the tape, make solid comfort food rap <b></b>but fail to transcend the revivalist label.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Whether that’s a good or a bad thing depends on your perspective-- apart from the occasional contemporary reference (don’t think many Brooklynites were watching Real Madrid twenty years ago) many of these songs could have come from the nineties. Songs like Pro Era’s “New Brooklyn Remix,” on which producer Dante Ross puts together an <i>Ill Communication</i> soundalike, Homeboy Sandman’s “The Plot Thickens” and Nick Caution’s “Scotty” would have been standouts then, and they can be considered standouts now. They’re far superior to the tired “Like It’s 88” or the Kid Daytona lazing out over the classic beat from “Can I Live"", neither of which would’ve have made your discerning fan’s Memorex back in ‘97.</p>
<p>When underground hip-hop develops an inferiority complex, it tends to lash out, mocking the mainstream while trumpeting its own authenticity. That’s part of the reason that Rosenberg has alienated comparatively forward-thinking people (along with the Young Money camp, who, ironically enough, have grown as stagnant in their approach as Rosenberg has in his). If you can disregard that puerile attitude, music like that found on the <i>New York Renaissance</i> is, at worst, unnecessary. At best, it adds something new to the conversation for people still interested in what exactly it is that rap is saying, and not just how it says it.</p></div>"|18012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18012-new-york-renaissance/|6.6|Jonah Bromwich

Sometimes it even feels like they're sabotaging themselves. A 2011 tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10709-the-psychic-paramount/"">the Psychic Paramount</a> seemed like a great idea in theory, but the reality of trying to compete with the sheer force and invention of their touring buddies left them sounding like wimpy traditionalists. The band's 2012 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16343-pre-language/""><i>Pre Language</i></a>, didn't help matters, somehow losing the magnetic force that made the preceding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14988-guider/""><i>Guider</i></a> worthy of many repeat plays. Fortunately, changes are afoot. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>'s Steve Shelley has amicably departed from the lineup, and the band has returned to working in great breadth on ""Kone"", a 10-minute track that builds on the promise of ""Revisiting"" from <i>Guider</i>.</p>
<p>There's something old fashioned about Disappears' approach, perhaps a natural consequence of the fact that singer Brian Case has been around the block more than a few times, first with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3044-90-day-men/"">90 Day Men</a> and then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3436-the-ponys/"">the Ponys</a>. This is music that comes from a place where there's no shame in trying ideas out in public view, where it's perfectly natural to arrive less-than fully formed. <i>Kone</i> has dropped from out of nowhere, not giving any real idea whether this is a hint of things to come, or a standalone diversion from whatever the band is plotting next. Either way, it's far more compelling than anything from <i>Pre Language</i>, opening up the suggestion that Disappears are fully aware that they function far better when working in repetition than they do when hacking everything down into more compact forms.</p>
<p>This three-track 12-inch simply offers up two versions of ""Kone"" and the additional ""Kontakt"". The version named ""Kone (edit)"" even ends in a locked groove, emphasizing the band's fondness for looking backward and firming up the suspicion that they're finally throwing up their hands and playing to their strengths. The main track is all air-raid siren drones, choppy guitar lines, heavily echoed vocal passages and, toward the close, a steady build of synthesized noise. It's a masterclass in control, never veering into sheer bludgeoning power, always maintaining a steady pace that helps lay out the underlying mood of unease. It goes precisely nowhere and is all the better for it; Disappears' best music sets a mood and pulls you down in it, leaving the listener suspended in a static state.</p>
<p>The same trick works to less effect on ""Kontakt"", especially when an ill-advised Duane Eddy guitar line surfaces, and the blurred version of ""Kone"" at the close of the EP doesn't add much to what came before. But there's an overall sense of bridges being rebuilt here, of a band renewed and galvanized for a bigger project ahead. Another album is promised later in the year, and ""Kone"" should be the natural launch point, a place from which to light the fuse. This is a tougher, more fully realized version of Disappears, operating where their most obvious influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21083-13th-floor-elevators/"">13th Floor Elevators</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>) have propelled them somewhere instead of bearing down too heavily on their sound. They've regained some attention here. Now, they just need to capitalize on the forward momentum.</p></div>"|17912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17912-disappears-kone-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

But on rare occasions, a band will make a record so thick with atmosphere that ""being there"" is just a matter of pushing play. Yeah Yeah Yeahs' 2003 debut, </span><i>Fever to Tell</i><span>, is one of those achievements: Even if you didn't make it to one of the infamous early New York shows and have the pleasure of getting your glasses sprinkled with the beery spit of a grinning, lipstick-smeared frontwoman in tattered Christian Joy, the record itself did a commendable job of bottling that experience. It was a debut that aced music's classic chemistry lesson: Combine a few unlikely, molten compounds, take a step back, and wait for the bang.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When they put out their second album, it seemed, at least at the time, like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were growing up too fast. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8889-show-your-bones/"">Show Your Bones</a></i> favored songcraft over shambolic energy, and sounded disappointingly tame on the heels of <i>Fever</i>'s maniacal night-sweats. (It was also the beginning of a creative schism in the band; as Zinner <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_P7yuexsnsgC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22I+didn't+want+to+write+and+record+in+a+studio%22+spin+nick+zinner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wfBh7qLxGm&amp;sig=FSlw6oXyO28t3qj27J-AsR4Vqec&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VOtnUcTlBeWc0AXiqIDABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20didn't%20want%20to%20write%20and%20record%20in%20a%20studio%22%20spin%20nick%20zinner&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Spin in 2006, ""I didn't want to write and record in a studio... I just wanted to do demos on a four-track in somebody's apartment."" He lost that argument.) But in the long run, <i>Bones</i> has aged remarkably well, and now feels like a pivotal moment in the band's arc, setting the tone for a career of evolution, reinvention, and constant forward motion; 2009’s excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12855-its-blitz/"">It's Blitz!</a></i> was a record of glammy, neo-Blondie avant-pop, staying true to their quirks but successfully expanding their range.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Mosquito</i>, the group's fourth record, is its first step backwards. It feels uncharacteristic, calling to mind a lot of words that have never fit this band before: confused, dreary, uninspired, and-- on one particularly baffling song about aliens-- uncool. Karen may have bleached her hair electric blonde and donned some inspired, tinselly Elvis suits, but for once the band hasn't applied a similarly gleeful spirit of reinvention to its sound. Instead, <i>Mosquito</i> aims for more of a back-to-basics approach. ""We have this shitty little downtown studio [in New York] that belongs to us,"" Karen said in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9039-karen-o/"">recent Pitchfork interview</a>, ""so we wrote songs and recorded demos whenever we felt inspired; it was kind of like <i>Fever to Tell</i> and our first demo."" But the often limp <i>Mosquito</i> lacks their earlier material's spark.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Mosquito</i> is not without highlights, but it requires some patience to unearth them, because when this record is bad, it's loudly, brazenly bad. ""Area 52"" is probably the lowest point in the band's catalog; its lyrics have a Spinal Tap syntax (""Message came from outer space/ Future of the human race"") that makes it play like self-parody. The song also features an uncharacteristically wooden vocal from Karen, who's eventually drowned out by a wash of spacey blips and bleeps. At least she sounds like she's having a little more fun with ""Mosquito"", but even her trademark charisma can't inject a sting into the weak chorus (""They'll suck your blood! They'll suck your blood!"" she tries, over and over). It's surprising how off the mark these songs sound coming from a band who used to be able to do goofy well. The upbeat songs on <i>Fever</i> careened with a wobbly, inebriated energy, but whenever <i>Mosquito</i> aims for ""zany"" or ""light,"" it teeters around like an exhibitionist ""drunk"" on non-alcoholic beer.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Mosquito"" should have been a B-side at best, but the fact that it's the title track-- and the inspiration for the garish, David-Cronenberg-vomiting-on-a-Garbage-Pail-Kids-card cover art-- makes it that much harder to ignore. That a thin, overly literal song like ""Mosquito"" is at the center of the artistic statement they're trying to make only makes this album more of a head-scratcher. Whatever's holding this collection of songs together never quite congeals-- a problem exemplified by the James Murphy-produced ""Buried Alive"", a moody, nocturnal groove interrupted halfway through by a verse from Dr. Octagon (the high-concept, time-traveling alien persona of avant-rap legend Kool Keith) that lands in the song with a heavy thud.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On repeated listens, though, a few diamonds emerge in the rough. Built around Zinner's expectant single-note riff, the gradual crescendo of ""Despair"" plays like a more muted take on <i>Show Your Bones</i>' best single, ""Cheated Hearts"", though its refrain is even more poignant. ""Oh despair, you've always been there,"" Karen sings with the perfect combination of exhaustion and defiance, ""You were there through my wasted years... there through my wasted life."" The closing track, ""Wedding Song"" (which Karen sang to her husband Barney Clay at their 2011 wedding reception) sounds a bit like a happy-ending sequel to ""Maps"", brooding with a similar emotional intensity (""In flames I sleep soundly/ With angels around me""). But the most promising-- and perhaps only truly new-- avenue the band wanders down on <i>Mosquito</i> is ""Subway"", a subtle, evocative sound collage driven by Karen's falsetto and the percussive churn of a train on the track. It's heavy on conceptual follow-through and finely crafted atmosphere on a record where both are in short supply.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On their best and most smartly sequenced albums, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs create a sense that their bratty swagger and disarming vulnerability were emanating from the same power source. In the wake of <i>Fever</i>'s amped-up ""Date With the Night"" or ""Tick"", ""Maps"" feels like an inevitable come-down, but the songs on <i>Mosquito</i> don't feed off each other in the same way. The album's most keyed-up moment comes early, in the solid lead-off single ""Sacrilege"", but when a gospel choir storms the song's closing coda it feels unprompted-- this is a band that used to be able to kindle the same kind of fire from the minimal components of its own chemistry. Still, even if <i>Mosquito</i> suggests otherwise, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' much-lauded SXSW showing and recent homecoming performances in New York prove that magic can still happen for them on stage. Maybe now you just have to be there.</p></div>"|17868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17868-yeah-yeah-yeahs-mosquito/|6.0|Lindsay Zoladz

The legend behind their 1972 album <i>Smog</i>, as Dwyer heard it, goes like this: Armando Nava went up to the mountains, took acid, and conceptualized that LP. “He came back and taught it to the band, and it is by far their biggest triumph,” Dwyer said. Although Thee Oh Sees sound almost nothing like Los Dug Dug’s-- the latter laying on the flute solos a bit too thick-- the opening track on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/69-floating-coffin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Floating Coffin</i></a> is called “I Come From the Mountain”. Like most of Dwyer's best songs, it's got muscle and drive. As usual, the story is fractured, abstracted, and therein, too nonspecific to be exclusively about Nava. But the spirit of the myth is there: “I come from the mountain, I return again,” Dwyer sings. Yes, but is he emerging from the mountain with his masterwork?</p>
<p>Based on their output from the past two years alone, it's hard to fathom what “biggest triumph” would even look like for Thee Oh Sees at this point. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/""><i>Castlemania</i></a> had Dwyer bleating “I Need Seed” in a strained toad voice; the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12682-the-dream/"">centerpiece</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/""><i>Carrion Crawler/The Dream</i></a> was a blistering Krautrock masterwork; “Goodnight Baby” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17029-putrifiers-ii/""><i>Putrifiers II</i></a> was a <i>Nuggets</i> lullaby capped by field recordings of chirping birds. Each of those albums are triumphs, and picking the ""best"" one feels like an arbitrary decision-- they suit different moods, different purposes. In that tradition, <i>Floating Coffin</i> is another resounding success.</p>
<p>And it's sort of a sadistic success. In the tradition of tracks like “The Dream”, “Tunnel Time” is carried by an adrenaline-fueled drive. But this time, the lyrics are about murdering a whole bunch of people, and the central hook is the band singing an evil laugh: “HA HA HA HA HA, HA HA HA HA HAAAA <i>HA!</i>.” Behind every infectious riff, there's a dark undertone. What's behind the strawberries on the album's cover? A murderous gaze. What's behind the earworm hooks and vamp-filled rock'n'roll? Lyrics about splattered blood and dead children. There are a few references to “the maze” as it relates to the narrator's descent into madness. In “Maze Fancier”, he's trapped and sings that there's “nothing inside of me.” Perhaps that dispassionate void manifests later on “Sweet Helicopter” when he takes a dementedly detached view of murder: “I look down and see them looking up.” With his unsettling disconnect between sweet falsetto and portrayal of a glazed-eyed killer, Dwyer definitely earns his spot in the prestigious club of murder balladeers.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to listen pretty carefully to hear Dwyer as demon or serial killer. The lyrics are run through the band's go-to filter of falsetto, voice effects, and extremely loud guitars. The title track is a chaotic burner that sounds like it could fall apart at any moment-- each element is barely held together by the bassline-- so any vocals are pretty well obliterated by volume. But for an album stuffed with great melodies, smooth transitions, shredding guitar solos, and stellar percussion work (the spastic percussion simmering in the background of “Sweet Helicopter” is a particular highlight), it's hard to mind when the lyrics take a backseat. That said, although <i>Floating Coffin</i> does quite well with its searing powerhouses, the quieter moments add a much-needed sonic diversity. The viola melody that introduces “Minotaur” is gorgeous, and once again, that's for a song that tells a fairly miserable story.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most powerful song on <i>Floating Coffin</i> is “No Spell”. The majority of the track features a gentle melody, buoyed by a soft rhythm section, and some ethereal vocals. There are words on the lyrics sheet for the song, but they appear more as a series of evaporating vowel sounds. And naturally, the quiet is broken by a WOO, a series of hefty power chords, and a guitar solo-- a thrilling stab of power amid the quiet warmth. It's a sweet melody that offers a brief respite from the bloodshed. It also illustrates that there's no pre-established blueprint for an Oh Sees album, which means there's no telling what's next. As usual, that's an exciting prospect.</p></div>"|17866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17866-thee-oh-sees-floating-coffin/|8.0|Evan Minsker

Of course, this isn’t a hugely original strategy these days. But Solar Bears’ music draws on a particularly thick soup of contrasting half- and mis-remembered pasts: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>’s windswept pastorales alongside the otherworldly film scores of John Carpenter and Vangelis; the glossy sensuousness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a> next to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Moroder</a>’s synth-disco vistas.</p>
<p>You might infer from this that Solar Bears are a sort of jack-of-all-trades of the nostalgia-trafficking underground, sampling the retro-leaning delights on offer without committing to a single fixed identity. That's valid to an extent. The duo’s 2010 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14944-she-was-coloured-in/"" target=""_blank""><i>She Was Coloured In</i></a>,<i> </i>was a sprawling record that had a habit of fluctuating erratically between moods and intensities: from wistful yearning to bucolic contentment, kitschy playfulness and back again in the space of a couple of tracks. But compared to the more approximate DIY tendencies of many of their peers, Solar Bears brought a certain smoothness of execution to the table, and a taste for pop directness that could at points tip over into the mawkish, but could also produce results with huge appeal.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that for their second LP, <i>Supermigration</i>, the Irish duo have stepped out of their bedrooms and into a professional studio, where they can pursue their pop muse with renewed fervor. The greatest indication of this comes with a pair of vocal appearances, both highlights of the album. Sarah P of fellow Planet Mu signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29004-keep-shelly-in-athens/"" target=""_blank"">Keep Shelly in Athens</a> contributes to ""Alpha People"", a gorgeously circumspect piece of synth-pop built around tremulous chords. Even more satisfying is the presence of Air collaborator Beth Hirsch on ""Our Future is Underground"", a sprightly number that overflows with spine-tingling joy in the closing minute. </p>
<p>But even where vocals are absent, there’s no doubting that Solar Bears have refined their technique over the past two years. <i>Supermigration</i> is a glistening, richly arranged album, every song lovingly wrought and festooned with lush synth and guitar work. It’s also a far more coherent record than its predecessor. Opener ""Stasis"", featuring a simple piano riff that’s wrenched upwards in pitch as if we’re ascending into some gauzy firmament, is reprised at the midpoint as ""You And Me (Subterranean Cycles)"". Such interludes serve to balance out the album’s weightier moments, and stave off the tendency towards formlessness that blighted <i>She Was Coloured In</i>.</p>
<p>As far as those heavier moments go, the duo’s success is less assured. A string of tracks expand on a disco sound hinted at on <i>She Was Coloured In</i>: ""Komplex"" coasts luxuriously on chunky synth arpeggios; ""A Sky Darkly"" is more imposing; ""Happiness is a Warm Spacestation"" is the most bombastic of the lot, and its relentlessness can feel a little overbearing. Elsewhere guitars supplant synths, as in the angsty ""The Girl That Played With Light"", proving faintly reminiscent of instrumental post-rock.</p>
<p>At times the duo are guilty of excessive portentousness, but there are just as many moments where their grandiose ambitions are convincingly realised, particularly in sunny closer ""Rainbow Collision"". Where <i>Supermigration</i> really grips the heartstrings is on slick pieces of library music revivalism that positively shimmer with kitschy optimism. At their best, Solar Bears are utterly charming.</p></div>"|17867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17867-solar-bears-supermigration/|7.2|Angus Finlayson

It's not exactly a Pete Best story, but if M83 stays on course, Fromageau could merit placement on future <a href=""http://www.collegehumor.com/article/5385560/6-musicians-who-left-bands-right-before-they-got-famous"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Musicians Who Left Famous Bands Too Early""</a> listicles.</p>
<p>But in fact, he's probably right where he needs to be. For all of the similarities between M83 and Team Ghost-- the epic heights and driving rhythms, the screaming synthesizers and hushed vocals-- an essential divergence in perspective stands out starkly when isolated in each project. As M83's music grows ever more affirmative and misty-eyed, Team Ghost is darker and sleazier, countering pastel nostalgia with a kind of stylized cynicism. The tension between Gonzalez's instincts for open-hearted pop songs and Fromageau's for clenched, noisy grooves energized <i>Dead Cities</i>, but it's almost certain that the vocal-heavy ease of access of M83 2.0 led to their breakout from critical-darling status. If Team Ghost seems unlikely to follow suit, at least it sounds like someone doing exactly what he wants to do.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that Team Ghost is said to play a kind of music called Cold-Gaze, a term coined by <i>NME</i> and embraced by the band, which should not in any way be mistaken for a thing that actually exists. On <i>Rituals, </i>which minimizes the Krautrock influences that permeated the EPs, this imaginary genre amounts to electro-pop and shoegaze infused with the poisoned throb of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>, hints of dance music, and a lot of inflammatory alt-rock guitar. The music is consistent in its hulking proportions but eclectic in style-- there is the elastic drone-rock of ""Curtains"", the minimal techno of ""Things are Sometimes Tragic"", the ersatz chamber music of ""All We Left Behind"", and the ambient pop of ""Broken Devices"". As a singer, Fromageau makes the effectively inexpressive Gonzalez sound like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckH3V_xOCnQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Church</a> by comparison, and his emaciated murmur gives even the brightest tracks (e.g. ""Montreuil"") an undertow of dissipated energies.</p>
<p>Fromageau uses different strategies to compensate for his limited vocal timbre and range, at least whenever he doesn't just bury it harmlessly in the mix. Sometimes these strategies work well and sometimes they go awry, as on the Auto-Tuned ""Pleasure That Hurts"", which sounds a little too much like an ailing Chad Kroeger singing over serious German electronic music. It's curious why Fromageau doesn't more often use the appealingly lively and unpretentious style of single ""Dead Film Star"", a sticky anthem where Team Ghost fires on all cylinders without overheating-- and, admittedly, sounds most like M83. A few too many other tracks, such as ""Away"", compensate for thin material with sheer bluster, and they can feel unwarrantedly grueling. But there's a conviction here, and that's nothing to feel sorry for.</p></div>"|17639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17639-team-ghost-rituals/|5.4|Brian Howe

During the last few years, both Richmond bands have fostered a buzz that’s escalated steadily enough to mirror the electric crawls of their music. <a href=""http://windhandva.bandcamp.com/album/windhand"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ritual Abuse</i></a>,<i> </i>Cough’s second album and first for relative metal major Relapse, evidenced the group’s ability to punish over the long haul, or to keep 12-minute marches interesting with deliberate lulls and requisite quakes. A year ago, Windhand emerged with <a href=""http://windhandva.bandcamp.com/album/windhand"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a self-titled five-song debut</a> that managed to be simultaneously spooky and psychedelic, with tremors of backwoods horror reverberating within the band’s riff-and-rhythm lockstep. It also introduced Dorthia Cottrell, a singer who slipped a fetching dose of soul into the band’s tidal sway. “Heaven”, she beckoned through repetition at the close of the record’s best song, “is on its way.” You wanted to stick around to see just what that meant for Windhand.</p>
<p>Later this year, Relapse will issue new LPs from both bands, something they’re teasing with the new, three-track split album <i>Reflection of the Negative</i>. The contributions from both bands are, so far, inarguable career highlights, cuts so well imagined and executed that you’ll, once again, want to know what’s next for both. The move is a marketing coup for Relapse, of course, but <i>Reflection of the Negative</i> is also one of the most immersive metal sets to arrive so far this year. If this is only a prelude, the main event will be aptly named.</p>
<p>As Craig Hayes <a href=""http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/162372-splitsville/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pointed out at <i>Popmatters </i>last year</a>, splits between heavy metal bands are a matter of convenience not only because they allow acts to share costs and fans but also because they serve as <i>de facto </i>display cases for subtle subgenre variations. Heavy metal is a realm of both establishing and erasing rules, meaning that a niche is pure only until someone new can come along and rearrange its ideals. That’s especially true here, with two acts from the same town and typically pinned with the same genre tags-- sludge, doom, stoner, psychedelic-- going in wildly different directions.</p>
<p>As they did in 2010, Cough uses the split LP format to go the distance with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15155-cough-athame/"" target=""_blank"">one uninterrupted track</a>. These 18 minutes are a showcase of pacing and structure. Cough rides the same theme for the distance, and they don’t suddenly sprint after distended stretches, an easy and pervasive technique in such situations; instead, the quintet methodically adds and removes elements like a creaking organ, spliced movie samples, and shrieking second guitar to maintain intrigue without seeming impatient. Vocalist Parker Chandler initially crawls inside of the amplifier wall, his shrieks made mostly unintelligible by the band’s creeping tumult. Near the halfway mark, though, the drums briefly disappear, leaving only the scrambled guitars and his now settled desperation: “The time has come for sacrifice,” he repeats. The ingenious setup keeps the track interesting by revealing the layers slowly and in an unexpected order. Nearly a decade into their career, Cough has never sounded so belligerent, frightening or immediate.</p>
<p>On its side, Windhand opt for two numbers, both of which find the band ratcheting its intensity and urgency. The shorter “Amaranth” deals in italicized aggression, turning everything from Cottrell’s arching vocals to the sprawling guitar solo that consumes the song’s back half into a point that must be made <i>now</i>. Though it’s slower than its counterpart, “Shepherd’s Crook” capitalizes on the same feeling. Every piece comes with a little extra energy, whether it’s the irascible noise-guitar introduction or the fortified punch that the drums pack in the otherwise torpid verses. On their debut, Windhand, especially Cottrell, sometimes seemed as if they were hanging around for an audience to arrive, dipping into a groove long enough to give a crowd the chance to show. But with <i>Reflection of the Negative</i>, they’re coming at the audience from all angles. They’re done waiting, and they’re much better for the shift.</p>
<p><i>Reflection of the Negative </i>also serves as an important notice for the Virginia capital of Richmond. When people talk about metal in the South, they’re quick to trot out the humid burgs of Savannah and New Orleans or, in a much different way, the death metal crucible of Florida. But Richmond has a historic and lively past with loud music, whether talking Honor Role and Breadwinner, Pig Destroyer and Municipal Waste, or even GWAR and Avail. Between Inter Arma’s <i>Sky Burial</i>, a study in metal miscegenation, and <i>Reflection of the Negative</i>, the city’s already responsible for two of the year’s most compelling metal albums. Release dates for full-lengths from Windhand and Cough haven’t even been announced yet. The time is right. </p></div>"|17894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17894-cough-windhand-reflection-of-the-negative/|7.9|Grayson Currin

The former Smiths frontman, whose health concerns and vociferous animal-rights adovocacy have recently made him to the indie blogosphere what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> is to TMZ, could've preempted the ailing rapper's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17802-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/"">latest album title</a> way back in 1991. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Moz</a> had already shown devotees he was, well, human after all, when a planned follow-up to masterful 1988 solo debut <i>Viva Hate</i> fell apart amid professional acrimony and critical rubbishing. Then, after bouncing back brilliantly with 1990's <i>Bona Drag</i> singles compilation, Steven Patrick Morrissey followed through on what he'd been saying all along: That he had no right to take his place with the human race.</p>
<p><i>Kill Uncle</i>, Morrissey's second solo LP, has a largely deserved reputation as his least distinctive. A minor album by a major artist, it still offers its own curious pleasures, particularly for the converted (who have always constituted much of Moz's audience anyway). And like another wrongly panned outing by a canonical rock figurehead,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank""> Bob Dylan</a>'s <i>Self Portrait </i>in 1970, <i>Kill Uncle </i>positively revels in its own insubstantiality: Though often critiqued according to an indie tradition grounded in authenticity and personal expression, the album is best appreciated as a campy celebration of the decorative and artificial. The original vinyl includes an etching that reads, punning on Oscar Wilde, ""Nothing to declare except my jeans""; a standalone single coinciding with the reissue is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49807-morrisseys-the-last-of-the-international-playboys-reissue-now-features-rick-astley-on-the-cover/"">7"" vinyl Rickroll</a>.</p>
<p>Morrissey might've had little choice but to wrap himself in arch humor. Where <i>Viva Hate</i> reunited him with the Smiths' producer Stephen Street and found a top-notch replacement for guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Marr</a> in the Durutti Column's Vini Reilly, <i>Kill Uncle</i>'s style varies between generically Smiths-y jangle and cabaret-like theatricality. Moz's production team here of Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer had a fairly solid track record (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Costello</a>, Madness; later, Bush's <i>Sixteen Stone</i>), and they'd actually overseen a few of <i>Bona Drag</i>'s lesser cuts. But together with guitarist and Kirsty MacColl collaborator Mark E. Nevin, they failed to give Morrissey a musical setting as singular as his own eccentric presence.</p>
<p>With the heavy lifting left to Morrissey's idiosyncratic lyrics and motley croon, he disappeared into them, tartly disowning such supposed virtues as honesty and passion. The best tracks tend to be the most bitterly funny, such as buoyant alt-pop opener ""Our Frank"", where a wryly ""r""-rolling Moz bemoans earnestness as so much vulgarity (""I'm only human,"" he sneers!), only to wind up suggesting his narrator is probably just targeting himself. ""Sing Your Life"", jaunty as the angle of a stylish cap, is a brutal ethering of the troubador-like idea expressed in its title, and contains another surprise ending: Just when it looks like Moz is about to pull back the curtain and reveal ""the truth,"" it turns out to be only that ""you have a lovely singing voice."" If the Smiths lyric from the <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>'s ""Cemetry Gates"" about how ""Keats and Yeats are on your side/ While Wilde is on mine"" was misunderstood in 1986, Moz was beating the world over the head with it in 1991. And the world still wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>The more ostensibly serious songs also mock conventional values, both aesthetically and morally. Much as other tracks here spurn the goal of expressing some timeless artistic truth, ""(I'm) The End of the Family Line""-- an elegantly swaying strummer so ""elegantly swaying"" you can almost hear the air quotes-- finds Morrissey rejecting the biological imperative of passing along his DNA. The family line might be ending, but the song doesn't right away: Just when a muffled speaking voice sounds like it's about to overtake the fading music, Moz comes back for another chorus, spitting his dynastic betrayal in the face of decent-thinking humanity one last time. Similarly, shutter-clicking whirligig ""The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye"" plays less like a straightforward tale of paparazzi and more like a bleak observation on public image. Both are funnier than their pomp and circumstance might hint. Just think: Moz is mocked for his self-aggrandizement, but it's the breeders who act like we're so special the planet needs our genetic material after we die.</p>
<p>Of course, compared with ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"" or even ""The First of the Gang to Die"", these sardonic jibes are lesser accomplishments, and not everything on <i>Kill Uncle</i> bears revisiting. The racially trolling ""Asian Rut""-- part of a regrettable triptych with <i>Viva Hate</i>'s ""Bengali in Platforms"" and ""The National Front Disco,"" from 1992's far-superior <i>Your Arsenal--</i> is instrumentally lavish, with accordion and violin, but it carries the album's undercurrent of dehumanization to an unbearable extreme: Morrissey withholds empathy for the victim of a racist attack. Though glorification of thuggish ugliness is a legitimate artistic theme that runs across the work of the writer Jean Genet and director Pier Paolo Pasolini, among many others, the result is frustrating from an artist with an unusually diverse indie-rock fanbase.</p>
<p>Like last year's <i>Viva Hate</i> reissue, the newly remastered <i>Kill Uncle</i> package is only slightly different from its original, and not exactly for the better. ""Asian Rut"" is blessedly lower on the track list, ""Family Line"" assumes its rightful place at the end, and two superfluous B-sides now interrupt the album's midsection: ""Pashernate Love"", a romp too trifling even to succeed as a trifle, and ""East West"", a confounding Herman's Hermits cover that makes sense only as a nod to the album's superficiality (Moz exults, ""Nothing is tacky!""). The redone album artwork likewise emphasizes self-awareness, with photography of Moz posing in a <i>Bona Drag</i> T-shirt, but isn't especially arresting. No extra liner notes. No bonus discs. Nothing that might boost the rating above.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy switch is the replacement of ""There's a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends,"" originally a piano-based torch song, with a live-in-studio version from 1991's <i>Morrissey at KROQ</i> EP. This take's muscular, rockabilly-infused glam-rock portends the direction Morrissey would take next on <i>Your Arsenal</i>. But perversely removing the most over-the-top, showtunes-y number from <i>Kill Uncle</i> only further undercuts the coherence of its appeal. And what about ""Sing Your Life"", which also appears in a more immediately pleasing but less conceptually appropriate rockabilly version on the <i>KROQ</i> EP?</p>
<p>Now, as ever, provoking and then withholding sensible answers to such obsessive questions remains essential to Morrissey's allure. <i>Kill Uncle</i> came at a time when U.S. audiences, on the eve of Nirvana's breakthrough, might've decided Moz was another alternative-rock icon worthy of widespread embrace, but his decidedly English quirks were almost as out of step in the states as they were in the UK, where his native Manchester had gone (to him, deplorably) Madchester and Britpop was still a couple of years away. Morrissey always knew how to toy with the press; when he came out onstage in London's Finsbury Park draped in the Union Jack, it was a scandal. Before too long, it might've been Cool Britannia, but the irony would've been lost either way: Contrary to Deerhunter's wildly entertaining dismissal of Morrissey in a <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/deerhunter-really-really-dislike-morrissey-and-the-smiths"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a>, he's no ""Sir Morrissey"" and has harshly criticized other rock musicians who accept royal honors.</p>
<p>For a sense of just how misunderstood <i>Kill Uncle</i> was, consider that <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20091026175721/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/morrissey/albums/album/116972/review/5944759/kill_uncle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i>'s review</a> at the time compared Morrissey's role with the Smiths to Sylvia Plath and chided the new record for its ""detached feel."" Surely, Plath is over on Keats' and Yeats' side. Meanwhile, over with Moz on Wilde's, detachment isn't necessarily an insult; that doesn't make the record a masterpiece, but it does make it one worth revisiting for Moz's ample cult. In a strange way, the song that best explains <i>Kill Uncle</i> isn't on <i>Kill Uncle</i> at all. It's <i>Bona Drag</i>'s ""Disappointed"", where Morrissey sings, and a crowd responds, ""This the last song I'll ever sing (yeah!)/ No: I've changed my mind again (awww...)/ Good night, and thank you."" Morrissey fandom is a lifelong exercise in self-aware disappointment, but if he really is the last of his kind, let's enjoy him while we have him. Though he's been teasing us about his looming mortality for years, he really is all too human. And he has a lovely singing voice.</p></div>"|17837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17837-morrissey-kill-uncle/|6.0|Marc Hogan

Boyd was not only a central figure in the 1960s folk revival on both sides of the Atlantic, but he produced Drake’s first two albums, <i>Five Leaves Left</i> in 1969 and <i>Bryter Layter</i> in 1970. Few knew Drake quite so well as Boyd, so few are so qualified to re-stage these songs in an affectionate tribute. The mood on <i>Way to Blue: The Songs of Nick Drake</i>, which collects highlights from the concerts, is reverent and dignified, occasionally rethinking arrangements but mostly adhering to the familiar orchestral swells, piano runs, and jazzy guitar licks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps that’s the problem. Especially in 2013, 14 years after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhryN1hSJKg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the VW ad</a> that turned every car buyer into a <i>Pink Moon</i> fan, <i>Way to Blue</i> is too rigid in its approach and too timid in its interpretations to challenge or enlarge our perception of Drake. The tracklist includes several generations of artists, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a> to Luluc, but with precious few exceptions, they turn Drake’s songs into mumbly folk-pop-- aggressively decorous and strangely passive. In fact, aside from the atrocious backing vocals on Shane Nicholson’s version of “Poor Boy”, the performances are perfectly adequate, but who wants adequate when you can easily pull up the originals, which still sound lovely and intense and devastating.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8760-green-gartside/"">Green Gartside’s</a> noble yet safe reading of “Fruit Tree”, the only artist who truly gets under the skin of Drake’s music is his contemporary Vashti Bunyan. She manages to overcome the spectacle of the historical venue and deliver a truly meaningful and disarming reinterpretation of “Which Will”, savoring certain syllables and twisting the words into new and strange shapes. By comparison, Lisa Hannigan’s cover of “Black Eyed Dog” sounds self-consciously eccentric, her warbles and coos too practiced, but that’s preferable to Teddy Thompson’s colorless take on “River Man”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Is it their fault for sounding so passive in their performances, or is it Boyd’s fault for restricting the possibilities and keeping the project so beholden to Drake’s legacy? Most likely the blame rests with everyone, but in truth the very concept of <i>Way to Blue</i> seems flawed: The setting is far too public for Drake’s private ruminations, which reinforces the idea that he lived his pain for public consumption. Boyd and his cohorts aren’t inviting you to sympathize with that pain, but to experience it voyeuristically. Or, to borrow some insight from Boyd’s book <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6627-joe-boyd/"">White Bicycles</a></i>, in which he discusses a recent concert by Aretha Franklin: “Waves of self-congratulatory affection passed back and forth between [Franklin and the audience]: she claiming credit for recognizing what they wanted to hear; the audience adoring themselves for being so hip as to want the ‘real thing.’ The music was caught in the middle, lifeless and predictable.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">(<b>Editor's note</b>: This album was reviewed from an advance copy that contained applause between the songs. The applause was later removed from the final release.

Their last album, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15231-boys-and-diamonds/"" target=""_blank""><i>Boys and Diamonds</i></a>, lived up to those first impressions: It was a collection of Orientalism-tinged ditties full of kid-friendly chants and West African melodies. But even when their songwriting was strong, they still felt more like an <i>idea</i> than a band. Their new album <i>FM Sushi</i>, released on their own Time No Place imprint with some help from Cologne techno giant Kompakt, retains that feeling of youthful mischief but reinforces it with tuneful songs and deluxe production that seemed only a distant possibility on <i>Boys</i>.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles husband-wife duo have undergone some changes since then. For one, they’ve brought in a live drummer to beef up their drum machine rhythm tracks. The pool of sounds they borrow from has also greatly expanded. While their reference points are still pretty identifiable, they throw sounds together in a much more interesting way than their old drowning-in-reverb indie pop. It’s noticeable early on, with the spry second track “He Is Sorcerer”, full of New Order grandeur and their most irresistible melody yet. Every phrase uncoils effortlessly from the last, like the stuff summer jams are made of. Tiffany Preston’s vocals sound unnervingly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>’s Karin Dreijier Andersson, but her newfound confidence to play with her voice is almost enough to look past the resemblance.</p>
<p>Though the Prestons are definitely writing tighter pop songs this time around, their inspiration comes from an unlikely source: German synth and soundtrack music from the late 70s. Tangerine Dream and their many contemporaries have been a prominent thread in electronic music for several years now, often with guarded techno types, but the trio handle the influence in unusual ways. The puffy textures serve to make their  pop songs plusher, but the inherently portentous tones provide emotional complexity as well. The title track is turned mournful heart-tugging, and they layer bluesy guitar licks over the the machine moans of “Moments I Had"". Transplanting sounds from all sorts of genres, it would be easy to label them as record-collector pop or internet music dilettantes-- but their music feels too honest and eager for such cynical categorization.</p>
<p>That being said, it does feel like they’re piecing together bits from their favorite artists, intentionally or not. On moments like the arpeggio-drenched “River’s Edge”, or especially instrumental “Thai Iced Tea”, where MIDI sax rides a bumpy groove like a toy miniature “V-2 Schneider”, they’re their own band. But on “Lacking Risk” and “Three Moons”, they blatantly ape the chintziest of 80s pop. They do it well, sure, but so do countless other bands. And considering this is a group that apparently likes to <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/15926/1/rainbow-arabias-sorcerer-mixtape"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-interpret entire Tangerine Dream soundtracks</a> in their spare time, it’s obvious that they’re capable of better. <i>FM Sushi</i>, then, is a stepping stone for a group suddenly poised to do great things, things their debut never even suggested. But looking over the precipice is different than actually crossing it-- so for now we’re stuck with them as they formulate their next move. At least it’s not a bad place to hang around.</p></div>"|17870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17870-rainbow-arabia-fm-sushi/|7.0|Andrew Ryce

(He originally posted as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/RealDondadaSC?feature=watch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dondada</a>, but was asked to switch by another musician of the same name.) In his videos, the man born Randrickas Young sings soulfully, raps fluidly, and makes his barely-there beats by pounding them out on the railing of his front porch.

<p>In December, Don dropped a mediocre mixtape, <i>Plugged In,</i> on which his formula was weakened by cheap-sounding, boilerplate beats. Most evidence of the tape has been scrubbed from the web, probably due to a lukewarm reception from those who were riding for him in the first place. But two months ago, Young released a more successful attempt to capitalize on his online popularity, one which brought back the novel, bare-bones beats that he clearly thrives on.<i> The Ol’ Soul EP</i>, a collection of new songs and YouTube favorites, is an arresting rap record, unique in its minimalist sound and bathed in the fingerprints of the South's musical history.</p>
<p>Don’s songs combine Southern rap, soul, and blues into a mix that at times recalls predecessors as disparate as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3707-scarface/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Scarface</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, Anthony Hamilton, Floyd Council, and Howlin' Wolf.  The hooks of his best songs are rough dirges and frequently espouse simple, mournful themes like “life goes by so fast” or “this is all I know.” In his verses, he’s equal parts punch line rapper and storyteller, as comfortable rattling off jokes about the color of cocaine as he is taking on the part of the Almighty in the dialectic “Song to God (My Life)”. Apart from these occasional religious digressions, Don’s subject matter consists largely of by-the-book gangsterisms but his wit sets him apart, along with that distinctive voice, a rich, gravelly baritone, untrained and harrowing. On his single  “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15124-alpoko-don-all-i-know/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">All I Know</a>”, the humming alone is intriguing enough to merit multiple listens.</p>
<p>By leaving beats almost entirely out of the question, Don demands the listener’s focus. His voice props up some of the weaker songs here-- “Street Life”, a “my girl is the streets” allegory would be a total cliché if it weren’t for its sung introduction. But his rapping can stand on its own, as demonstrated on “Gone Tomorrow”, a detail-heavy tale of an ambitious kid that balloons into a full-blown revenge epic.</p>
<p>Don is a natural dichotomy-breaker. His lyrical facility gives the lie to the stereotype of the monosyllabic Southern rapper even as his Greenville patois makes it obvious where he’s from.  His rhyme patterns are reminiscent of a trap-rapper who’s been robbed of bombastic beats.  And he professes to have a profound faith in God (saying in an interview that the best advice he can give to kids is to “stay prayed up”), but seemingly can’t resist glorifying the street life that got him sent to prison for eight years.</p>
<p>His uncomplicated approach to songmaking might make Alpoko Don seem like the antidote to music industry excess but his process isn’t quite as influence-free as one might think after seeing him sitting on the porch, creating music out of thin air. Those videos are sponsored by Young Jeezy’s clothing company, 8732 Apparel, and <i>The Ol’ Soul EP</i> was co-produced by Darrell “Digga” Branch, who has worked with Cam’ron, 50 Cent, and Jay-Z. Industry associations might be distasteful to those who have been riding for Don as a kind of rap Horatio Alger yet to be tainted by industry grime, but the music itself is hard to question: even his rework of Patti Labelle’s corporate soft-rock staple “If You Asked Me To” manages to sound gritty (and this is a song that was famously covered by Celine Dion.)</p>
<p>Don is most transfixing when you can see him work-- his are among the videos you’ll want to pull up whenever some idiot starts to question rap’s musicality. And it’s undeniable that the novelty of his approach contributed hugely to the success of his music videos. But if Don were some lousy amateur with a unique approach, his songs wouldn’t have the staying power that they do. Novelty eventually wears off but talent tends to stick in the mind, and it’s the latter that will keep <i>The Ol’ Soul </i>EP relevant longer than it takes for any gimmick to get old.</p></div>"|17991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17991-alpoko-don-the-ol-soul-ep/|7.7|Jonah Bromwich

It’s almost 15 years since he first appeared with the shy-footed but prescient “Terrapin”, which later appeared on his debut album <i>Animal Magic</i> and helped him find a name at the forefront of the downtempo electronica scene that bubbled up in the late 90s and early 2000s (a period when ambient pop albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11442-moon-safari-10th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Moon Safari</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6860-melody-am/"" target=""_blank""><i>Melody A.M.</i></a> were scoring top 10 positions in the UK charts). Drawing on the noodling notions of jazz and trip hop, downtempo became the clubbing generation’s default after-hours music: the sound of a thousand compilation CDs made for slinging on after the club or soothing heads the morning after the night before.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bonobo stood above the rest because his compositional touch was so instinctive: deftly coaxing complex emotions from machines while employing acoustic instrumentation sparingly to devastating effect. Throughout the 2000s he built on his reputation for sonic storytelling, culminating in his exquisite 2010 album <i>Black Sands</i>. Yet with <i>The North Borders</i>, Green appears to have hit a stumbling block. The balance is skewed and he all but drowns his knack for emotive instrumentation in the kind of introspective production that marked his formative period.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A number of tracks feature a stock approach to progression and release. They begin as densely layered, moody affairs, caught up in themselves and in the past. It’s only in the final minute or so that the underlying instruments are allowed to sing, and when they do the track finally feels alive in the present moment. On opening track “First Fires”, it’s the strings that finally rise above the cloudy production in the closing minute or so that provide the track with an anchor. There’s some truly lovely arrangement towards the end of “Sapphire”, when a chorus of reed instruments purr sagely to one another. Then again on “Ten Tigers” those heart-serrating strings tease in the background only to momentarily-- fantastically-- bloom as the track fades.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The problem is not so much that these instrumental flourishes are too little, too late, but that the tracks that hold them feel over-worked, the layers so dense as to stifle the ideas. “There's nobody there telling me when to stop, so often I end up adding a bunch more elements to the track after I originally thought it was done,” Green <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/bonobo-the-north-borders"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said recently</a>. “I often have an idea and it starts splintering off into a whole lot of directions; I'm interested in exploring every single one of them.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Green recorded the album in his new home of New York, following an extensive year and a half touring <i>Black Sands</i>, and you can hear his exhaustion in the album’s confusion. On one hand he appears to reach for dialogue with the chime-led melodies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> on album standout “Cirrus”, a truly joyful, free moment on the album. But on the other hand, it finds him seeking refuge in a realm he knows inside out: lolloping, jazz-inflected soundscapes. While it sounds like he had fun collecting sounds on his travels-- from a truck’s air brakes to train doors closing on the subway-- they are lost in his layering. Even his track with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a> feels like a missed opportunity: it’s a sweet enough jam but she’s so deep in the mix on “Heaven For The Sinner” that she slips frustratingly out of focus. While for all intents and purposes <i>The North Borders</i> screams “easy listening,” it’s doesn’t half tie itself up in knots. At its worst-- the limp and dated bumble of “Jets”-- it feels like Bonobo-style music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, his work with new singer Szjerdene has more energy: “Towers” breathes easier, while “Transits” has a narrative depth that largely evades the rest of the album. While it’s exciting that Green will be performing the album live with Szjerdene and a 10-piece orchestra, I can't help feeling he was playing safe by not fully embracing his orchestral exploration in the album’s recording. <i>The North Borders</i> is not a bad album-- for the most, it’s as inoffensive as those decade-old chill-out compilations-- yet a frustration persists because Bonobo is better than this.</p></div>"|17907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17907-bonobo-the-north-borders/|6.0|Ruth Saxelby

They let it play out for a few more measures of beeps and beats before launching back into their conversation. The song plays again during the closing scene, when the girl detective is listening to a weird, round, portable contraption meant to play compact music discs. The scene is quiet and poignant, not only playing the band’s wistful pop in the foreground but contrasting it with the character’s recent glimpses of the compromised adult world. “Such Great Heights” is a way for Veronica to hang on to childhood for another four minutes and twenty-seven seconds.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after <i>Veronica Mars </i>did the unthinkable and funded a feature-length movie via Kickstarter-- raising $2 million in eleven hours-- Sub Pop is reissuing the Postal Service’s platinum-selling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6432-give-up/""><i>Give Up</i></a> in a deluxe, 2xCD set. This pair of pop culture artifacts point to a growing nostalgia for the golden age of prematurely canceled TV shows (see also: the fourth season of <i>Arrested Development</i>) and indie pop as cult soundtrack. The Postal Service's lone album has proved surprisingly influential, casting a long shadow over the 2000s. Not only did it show up in films and on television-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7891-garden-state/""><i>Garden State</i></a>, <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, <i>D.E.B.S.--  </i>but its songs were covered regularly by a wide range of artists, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=ben+folds"">Ben Folds</a> to metal act Confide to a ska act called Tip the Van. In commercials for Kaiser Permanente, <a href=""http://youtu.be/95EeUAvAba4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UPS</a>, and (for legal reasons) the actual <a href=""https://www.usps.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">United States Postal Service</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5871-jimmy-tamborello/"">Jimmy Tamborello’s</a> bloops and beeps conveyed the idea of ideas: synapses firing, synergy synergizing, connectivities connecting. For better or for worse, for a little while, the Postal Service made laptops the new guitar.</p>
<p>Not bad for a side project. Tamborello and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard/"">Ben Gibbard</a> first collaborated on “(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan,” for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1121-dntel/"">Dntel’s</a> 2001 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15950-dntel-life-is-full-of-possibilities/""><i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i></a>. Apparently, they worked so well together that they kept at it, even corralling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"">Jenny Lewis</a>, Jen Wood, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5613-chris-walla/"">Chris Walla</a> to play on their songs. In the days before <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dropbox</a> and <a href=""https://www.yousendit.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouSendIt</a>, they had to snail-mail tracks back and forth, so they called themselves the Postal Service. Released in 2003, their debut was a slow grower, but it had a long life and was still producing singles in 2005. What began as a side project… well, stayed a side project, but <i>Give Up</i> looms large in both men’s careers. Tamborello failed to capture that sense of evocative purpose on either of Dntel’s subsequent albums, although he has become a key member of the L.A. blip scene that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"">Baths</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>. Gibbard has released seven full-lengths with his day-job band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>, but many of his best and most beloved tunes are all on <i>Give Up</i>. Which, by the way, is Sub Pop’s second highest selling album of all time, besting the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">Shins’</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/""><i>Oh Inverted World</i></a><i>.</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/""><br/></a></p>
<p>Even in 2013, when those perfectly aligned freckles have faded, it’s not hard to hear why <i>Give Up</i> would be a hit. The album’s highs represent a perfect marriage between Tamborello’s synths, which sound like the first rays of dawn hitting a Mister Bulky, and Gibbard’s gee-whiz lyrics, which possess a mussed-hair whimsy. The best songs here-- not just “The District Sleeps Alone Tonight” and “We Will Become Silhouettes” but also “Recycled Air” and “Nothing Better”-- evoke innocence and imagination in equal measure, a sense of the fantastical that persists as a defense mechanism against the terrible or the simply mundane. No wonder it appealed to Veronica Mars and seemingly every other teenager who heard it: <i>Give Up</i> allowed them to see their worlds differently. “Silhouettes” turned heartbreak into nuclear holocaust without sounding over the top, because who hasn’t felt like the last person on Earth? “Such Great Heights” made freckles more than something to be insecure about; instead, they became the stars that crossed lovers. Thanks to Gibbard’s twee imagery as well as his persistent use of second-person pronouns, <i>Give Up</i> reinforces each listener’s individuality.</p>
<p>By not recording a follow-up, the Postal Service never had to strike that impossible balance again-- they left it up to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11613-fireflies/"">Owl City</a>, Hellogoodbye, and too many other imitators to carry the synthpop banner. The Postal Service's dubious legacy often obscures the fact that <i>Give Up</i> is only a good album, not a great one. Those quirky lyrics curdle into something unbearable on “Sleeping In”, as Gibbard recounts a dream about JFK’s assassination and the environmental apocalypse. “Clark Gable” is a tortuously meta love song, although that might actually be the point. Sequencing is an issue as well: the album is so frontloaded that the second half drops off a cliff. How many people actually made it to “Natural Anthem”? But the highs are high enough to offset the lows, and I imagine listeners may have spent the last 10 years mentally re-editing the album so that only the good parts remain.</p>
<p>Despite the surprising success and durability of <i>Give Up</i>, Tamborello and Gibbard gave up on the collaboration. Sub Pop released an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6433-we-will-become-silhouettes-ep/"">EP</a> of covers and remixes in 2005, but it seemed more like a gesture of apology than of renewal. As a result, the band’s catalog doesn’t sprawl messily across album after album. Instead it’s neat, compact, containable-- which means this reissue doubles as a celebration of the album and as a definitive history of the band itself. The remixes-- by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"">Matthew Dear</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4183-john-tejada/"">John Tejada</a>, among others-- don’t add much to the originals besides length, but do underscore what precise editors Tamborello and Gibbard (and co-producer Chris Walla) were. Their mixes of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"">Nina Simone</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"">Feist</a>, however, are missing, as is “(This Is) The Dream of Evan &amp; Chan”, which isn’t rare but does serve as the root of all of every Postal Service song.</p>
<p>The duo covered frequently just as they were frequently covered, so the tracks by the Shins and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26448-iron-wine/"">Iron &amp; Wine</a> at least work as time capsule. The former’s deadpan take on “We Will Become Silhouettes” makes the apocalypse sound jangly and grim again, while the latter’s whispery “Such Great Heights” recalls that moment in the previous decade where folkies were slowing down fast pop songs. On the other hand, the Postal Service’s cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6496-phil-collins/"">Phil Collins’</a> “Against All Odds” is awkward in both conception and execution. And finally, there are two new tracks, the bleak “A Tattered Line of String” and the undercooked “Turn Around” (which is, sadly, not a <a href=""http://youtu.be/lcOxhH8N3Bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie Tyler</a> cover). They’re fine showcases for Tamborello’s sophisticated beats and Gibbard’s heightened melodies; the production is crisp, the hooks catchy, but these tunes lack any sense of newness or discovery or connection. More crucially, it’s off-putting to hear the Postal Service re-create that 2003 sound in 2013. That’s the burden of any album that so completely defined its time: <i>Give Up</i> remains anchored in its heyday, and like all those canceled TV shows, it only reminds us how far we’ve moved away from that particular moment. </p></div>"|17853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17853-the-postal-service-give-up/|8.0|Stephen M.

Afterall, they had Peter Saville do their cover art, just has he did for their debut 33 years ago.</p>
<p>In that regard, much of <i>English Electric</i> inititally seems like a recapitulation. The first full song on the album, “Metroland”, starts out aping the opening melody and sonics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>’s “Europe Endless”, then goes as far as to include a riff on the wordless chorale vocals, too. But the punching beat of the song feels more post-industrial, suggesting the relentless pulse underlying later groups like VNV Nation or Apoptygma Berzerk. That, and frontman Andy McCluskey's immediately recognizable singing, above all else, provides the melodic focus as well as the elegant, yearning tone, here and throughout.</p>
<p>As the album title indicates clearly enough, it's a reflective English futurism, perhaps, in the same way that a group like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> often provided a certain rainy day psychedelia that could have only derived from Great Britain and nowhere else. That English Electric itself was the name of a noted UK train and aerospace manufacturing firm from the 20th Century further underscores that sense of a specifically grounded and gone past, no less so than Kraftwerk had its own earlier obsessions with a German and Middle European technology already confronting an obsolescence.</p>
<p>Yet for all the backward glancing, there's a tension between the past and a possible way forward. “Kissing the Machine”, perhaps one of the clearest moments of a returned past, is a reworking of a song McCluskey did with Kraftwerk veteran Karl Bartos two decades back for the latter’s Elektric Music project. Meanwhile, McCluskey has noted in a recent interview that “Decimal” is meant to capture a feeling from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a>'s <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>, while the song “Helen of Troy” in its stately passion, sweet hookiness, and the title itself, captures the feeling of “Joan of Arc” and “Maid of Orleans”.</p>
<p>If there's something key, though, it's that all of this doesn't truly feel like their past redone in exactly the same way-- polished and punchier, not quite as nervously trebly, able to suggest the aggressiveness of EBM on the arrangement of something like “Our System” but not replicating it. In that regard the airport PA-styled announcement of “The future that you anticipated has been cancelled” from the opening “Please Remain Seated” turns out to be more apt than might be guessed -- it’s neither the tentative beginnings nor the top 40 pomp, but something else again.</p>
<p>This balancing of tensions may be the secret of <i>English Electric</i>’s overall appeal. If a band like Radiohead transformed the technological perceptions and considered unease of OMD’s still astonishing early 80s masterpiece<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11363-dazzle-ships/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Dazzle Ships</i></a> into their own fractured electronic nightmares, OMD are secure enough in their own sound and vision to create a “Fitter Happier” kissing cousin in the glitch-tinged and robotic-voiced “Atomic Ranch” without sounding a mere borrowing back. “The Future Will Be Silent"" crackles with suggestions of bass drops and intrusive noise, fractures and slows and weaves among a cascade of sound. “The future was not supposed to be like this,” a treated voice repeats at several points, but OMD continue to stake out their retrofuturism on their terms, a roots jam for a generation raised on wires.</p></div>"|17843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17843-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-english-electric/|6.7|Ned Raggett

It only lasts a few seconds before the guitars wrap around it like a veil, but it still feels revealing, as though we opened the door on the music just a few seconds before it was ready for us. That thump and tap, in a rhythm a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>’s “Idioteque,” tells us a lot about the album that follows: This is a record that grooves but also invites the listener to come closer, to step into its space, be still and listen. Traoré and producer John Parish have captured this music in all its rhythmic grace with great intimacy, capturing each slide up the bass or thrum of the n’goni with direct clarity.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">For music with such rhythmic body, precision in capturing the singular character of each sound is often beside the point. But Traoré’s music benefits immensely from it-- you can hear the way the her guitar twists around the other guitars and Mamah Diabaté’s dusty n’goni, and the sound sets this thicket of repeated, interlocking phrases inside the full-bodied rhythm section. The effect is of music that lives two rhythmic lives in tandem, and each one pushes the other, leaving her voice free to glide loosely over the top. Traoré’s past albums established her as a fine singer, but here, she feels more accomplished than ever, her voice bending around her words (sung mostly in Bamana) with flourishes of subtle vibrato.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Moreover, she’s developed the dynamic range of her singing and writing. “Sikey” and “Lalla” both offer slippery funk, but with two completely different feels, while “N’Téri” travels in time over its nine and a half minutes, from hushed and skeletal n’goni topped by some of Traoré’s most incredible, full-throated singing to a whirling, driving electric song. The final couple of minutes surge on a bed of beatboxing and roiling guitar. It’s an amazing performance, and a good contrast to the more concise and straightforwardly funky songs.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Traoré is from Mali, and her music carries many signatures of her homeland, from the n’goni to the language to the circular guitar figures, but her sound is fundamentally international, swallowing tradition and modernity whole to create a pop sound she can quite easily call her own. Being from her country means contending with the legacies of some of West Africa’s most internationally successful artists; at this point, I’d say Traoré fits comfortably alongside her forbears.</p></div>"|17846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17846-rokia-traore-beautiful-africa/|8.1|Joe Tangari

But, to aficionados of library music, those sleeves are utterly iconic and desirable, housing the kind of records that can easily cause questionably large amounts of money to change hands under the right conditions.</p>
<p>Library music dates back to the 1950s, when the boom in TV shows, films, advertising, and radio produced a near endless need for musical themes (or ""cues,"" as they're often called). Having a stack of library music on hand was cheaper than commissioning a group of artists to go into a studio and record a new composition, and so the impeccably played work of anonymous session musicians reached audiences of millions. None of the original vinyl releases were commercially available and many of the labels that produced the music remain steeped in mystery. Even the musicians involved are often hard to trace due to the proliferation of pseudonymous recordings, although KPM attracted some of the all-time greats, including <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Keith+Mansfield"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keith Mansfield</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+Hawkshaw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alan Hawkshaw</a>, whose work features prominently on this expanded reissue of a 1999 compilation released by <a href=""http://www.strut-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strut</a>.</p>
<p>The initial fetishization of library music came bundled with a renewed interest in exotica and easy listening that flourished alongside Britpop in the mid 1990s. At <a href=""http://www.blowupclub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blow Up</a> in London it was common to hear old library music cues being dropped by DJs such as <a href=""http://www.karminskyexperience.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Karminsky Experience</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s Tim Gane, and Barry 7 from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21-add-n-to-x/"">Add N to (X)</a>, while an adjoining room would blast out hits from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>. Fast-forward a decade, and the <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label repopularized the music. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"">Danger Mouse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"">DOOM</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> have all sampled KPM cues. The styles embraced by the players on <i>Music for Dancefloors</i> are as wide ranging as the artists who have been inspired by them. But what makes this music fascinating is the place in which it falls; never becoming simple exercises in proficiency, but never reaching the same level of inspiration as the artists whom musicians like Mansfield and Hawkshaw are clearly aping.</p>
<p>This is a scratch across the surface of the KPM library, and as such, it's wilfully disjointed. Reggae, samba, jazz, soul, and funk are all tried on for size and quickly discarded, with decidedly mixed results. There's a rare vocal track (Alan Parker and Madeline Bell's ""That's What Friends Are For""), and the best-known KPM cut, Mansfield's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P51cMstawuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Funky Fanfare""</a>, isn't included. Still, compiling this stuff is a minefield, and this is a decent way-in for the uninitiated. John Cameron's gloriously heavy ""Swamp Fever"" is among the best tracks here, and the record it's from, <i>Afro Rock</i>, could easily have yielded far more material for this album had time and space allowed. The sequencing is slick, with oddities like Nascimbene's ""Witchdoctor"" breaking up percussion-heavy, Latin-influenced tracks. Klaus Weiss's ""Morning 1/Morning 2"" even bridges some of the gaps, bringing in a wild array of styles.</p>
<p>With so many crisp and precise beats high in the mix, KPM has understandably provided a rich source of samples over the years. There's certainly a feeling of joy to much of the music here, but little or no sense of abandon. It lends much of the KPM music a unified ambience, locked down in a place it can’t quite get to. Barry Morgan and Ray Cooper's ""Samba Street"" is flooded with uplift, but never arrives at somewhere as unique and unhinged as <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Barretto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ray Barretto</a> or <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Tito+Puente"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tito Puente</a> in their respective primes. Hawkshaw's ""Senior Thump"" maps out similar territory to <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Young"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Larry Young</a>, but Hawkshaw remains earthbound, leaving Young to head toward the stars. But that's partly the intent behind this material, to stay palatable, to court as wide an audience as possible for whatever production was going to pick up on this music.</p>
<p>There's an entirely superfluous live performance packaged with <i>Music for Dancefloors</i>, taken from a performance by the KPM All-Stars at London's Jazz Cafe in April 2000. Many of the original musicians were included in the show, finally coming out of the shadows and proving that just about everyone in the business gets a second act at some point in their careers. The performances are as fastidious as you'd expect. Even the closing medley of songs from British sports TV shows is an exercise in pure professionalism: Given the chance to let their hair down and have some fun, these guys simply respond with an astounding display of chops. But it's best to forget the live show, mainly because KPM is something that doesn’t benefit from having its process laid bare. It's far better to leave it drifting in time, rediscovered every decade or so, this odd period when a strange magic was produced by greying men in cardigans channeling Sly Stone.</p></div>"|17900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17900-music-for-dancefloors-the-kpm-music-library/|7.6|Nick Neyland

It's a vibrant, dizzying film with the quality of a dream: In 1978, the late Roger Ebert <a href=""http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19780130/REVIEWS/152982475"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called it</a> ""one of the most unusual films I've seen, a barrage of images, music and noises, shot with such an active camera we almost need seatbelts."" The movie struck a chord with Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2038-a-hawk-and-a-hacksaw/"" target=""_blank"">A Hawk and a Hacksaw</a>, the American duo whose on-record explorations of the folk music of Eastern Europe shares the film's interest in the region's folk traditions, its cross-hatching of the mournful and the celebratory, and its hints of the surreal. <i>You Have Already Gone to the Other World</i>, produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhoof</a>'s John Dieterich and named after the film's most memorable line, is the group's sixth LP, with material both drawn from and inspired by the music in <i>Shadows</i>. It's a kaleidoscopic album, blending sounds from the film itself with centuries-old Ukranian, Hungarian and Romanian tunes and several new compositions that apply a few modern flourishes to the band's tradition-minded melodies.</p>
<p>There's not much separating Barnes and Trost's own pieces with the older material here; this is hardly their first time in the area, after all, and by now, they've studied all the guidebooks and absorbed most of the local customs. Whether it's Barnes plunking out ""Where No Horse Neighs and No Crow Flies"" on the santeur or Trost soaring over the title track on her violin, they've grown into remarkably lyrical players over the years, capable of great nuance and agility. Their passion for the traditional material here is obvious-- there's a palpable joy to the more boisterous stuff, a deep feeling running under the mournful material. And, whether they're using a trill from Ivan's flute as a jumping off point or starting entirely from scratch, their own compositions find ways to move the music of the film into the present without diluting it. A few judiciously applied electronic flourishes aside-- like the IDM-aware drum blowout that closes ""The Sorcerer""-- the rest of this music could've easily come from Myroslav Skoryk's original score from 1964, itself a kind of hybrid of the traditional and the modern with a strong preference for the former.</p>
<p>That Barnes and Trost would draw an album's worth of inspiration from the musical, lyrical <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors </i>seems obvious, but <i>Other World</i>, as a document of that inspiration, sometimes feels caught between a couple worlds. Barnes and Trost have played material from <i>Other World</i> while <i>Shadows</i> flickered in the background, but they're quick to point out that <i>Other World</i> is itself not a soundtrack. It's true that you can't quite sync one to the other, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6a5DH_ePVQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dorothy/<i>Dark Side</i>-style</a> and since <i>Shadows</i> already has such a rich reservoir of music running under it, they seem to want to position <i>Other World</i> as more addendum than replacement. Their version isn't better, they'd likely tell you-- just a little different. Taken on its own, though, the <i>Other World</i> LP is-- at 57 minutes and change-- a little on the long side, and while each individual piece is plenty gripping, every peak's got its valley, and all that up-and-down starts to wear on you after a while. <i>Other World</i> actually fares worst when you strip it of its context. Coming on the heels of 2011's stellar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15188-cervantine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cervantine</i></a>, <i>Other World</i> feels like it might've been stronger had Trost and Barnes held a few more things back.</p>
<p><i>Shadows</i> is, above all things, a love story, and between the grisly murders and the tender romance of the film, there's a lot of life to depict, and accordingly, a huge range of emotion to convey. By careening between joy and grief at a moment's notice, Barnes and Trost reflect the vast array of feeling at the heart of <i>Shadows</i>, and the music's constant motion speaks to the film's episodic nature. The few songs shared between the film and the LP-- most memorably ""Wedding Theme""-- reflect the tenor of the scenes they're drawn from even without the accompanying images. And their own sharp, sinewy compositions suit the tone of the film-- dizzying, buoyed by life, yet constantly aware of death-- to a T. For all the death hovering over <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i>, it's a strangely life-affirming film, a testament to the boundless passion of two souls, inexorably linked. The rapturous <i>Other World</i> takes that passion and turns it outward.</p></div>"|17831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17831-a-hawk-and-a-hacksaw-you-have-already-gone/|7.2|Paul Thompson

Fueled by internal struggle, we turn along an endless wheel of suffering, passing through untold lives in our never-ending quest for enlightenment. Some meditate upon this truth for years; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>, on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44221-new-kurt-vile-lifes-a-beach/"" target=""_blank"">Life's a Beach</a>"", nailed it for us in two mumbled words: ""Life's awhile.""</p>
<p>Vile's music has exuded this unique stoner-Yoda wisdom from the very beginning, even if you weren't searching for it. His sound-- warm, unhurried, and spacious-- doesn't demand close focus, but one of the joys of being pulled into Vile's lonely, contented universe is in discovering that he is muttering sharply self-aware things to himself.  It adds another layer to Vile's appeal; seduced by the soothing, watery-blue glimmer of that sound, which promised to make you feel like the only human in the universe, you slowly realized there's actually one other guy here, and he's kind of a wiseass.</p>
<p><i>Wakin on a Pretty Daze </i>is Vile's most spacious, becalmed record yet, and it contains some of his best-ever brand of cosmic stand-up. It opens, literally, with a stretch and a yawn: On the (almost) title track ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14909-wakin-on-a-pretty-day/"" target=""_blank"">Wakin on a Pretty Day</a>"", a wah'ed guitar rubs the grit out of its eyes while Vile beholds his furiously ringing phone with clinical detachment: ""Phone ringing off the shelf/ I guess somebody has something they really wanna prove to us today,"" he notes. Unperturbed, he moves along, concerned with something far more pressing: ""I gotta figure out what kind of wisecrack I'm gonna drop along the way -- <i>today</i>."" The music quickens for a beat or two at this prospect, but settles back down. In Vile's universe, there is time enough for everything.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <i>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</i> moves at its own stately pace and with its own serene logic and time. Songs unfurl for six, or seven, or eight minutes without peaking dynamically or changing; the tangle of finger-picked guitars on ""Was All Talk"" queue up like synth presets that Vile just lets roll. On most songs, four or five chords cycle for minutes on end, echoing upward into the record's warm room tone. ""Pure Pain"" shifts between stomping, hard acoustic chording and two wide-open billowing finger-picked chords that simply hang while Vile muses: ""Every time I look out my window/ All my emotions they are speeding/ Zip through the highways in my head.""  It can be occasionally frustrating to interact with a piece of music so fundamentally unconcerned with interaction, but like anything worth truly loving, <i>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</i> opens up slowly. The music, and the act of loving it, are exercises in patience. Or, as Vile puts it sagely on ""Too Hard"": ""Take your time, so they say, and that's probably the best way to be.""</p>
<p>Vile's releases are small variations on each other, and discerning the differences between them comes down to intangibles, things that are difficult to point to: The fact that he only yelps his little ""Woo!"" twice on ""Shame Chamber""  the first time around, for instance, indicating his bone-deep understanding that two ""woos,"" for now, are plenty. Or the way the silvery guitar leads snake through the album without ever assuming the foreground, murmuring things that reward attention in the same way Vile's lyrics do. The way the drums nudge gently into the title refrain on ""Girl Called Alex"", and how Vile's ""I wanna-"" is abruptly cut off by a stinging guitar; these details, small by themselves, offer accumulated testimony to Vile's mastery of his world. <i>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</i> breezes past like a Klonopin dream, and radiates an easy confidence that is as rewarding to return to as a melody.</p>
<p>""Sometimes when I get in my zone, you'd think I was stoned, but I never as they say 'touch that stuff,' "" Vile sings, with a hint of mockery, on <i>Wakin</i>'s closer ""Goldtone."" The song is stunning, a desert island of Kurt Viledom. Ever since Vile signed to Matador, his music has grown warmer and more expansive as he receded further into the privacy of his own mind: On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smoke Ring for My Halo</i></a>'s ""Ghost Town,"" he crooned gently, ""I think I'm never gonna leave my couch again/ Cuz when I'm out, I'm only in my mind."" ""Goldtone,"" and all of <i>Wakin on a Pretty Daze</i>, feels like the culmination of Vile's quest to get away from people, noises, civilization and find somewhere to sit and whistle his own tune. If Kurt Vile could paint a storybook Heaven, it would look like ""Goldtone"", and he signs it with his most poetic, self-aware koan ever:  ""I might be adrift but I'm still alert/ Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone."" A guitar pushes a wispy cirrus cloud across the sky, sea-blue chimes glitter, and Vile mumbles his way into the sunset. </p></div>"|17851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17851-kurt-vile-wakin-on-a-pretty-daze/|8.5|Jayson Greene

Go back as far as “</span><a href=""http://hansonrecords.bandcamp.com/track/half-animal-half-insane"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Half Animal, Half Insane</span></a><span>”, from 2002’s </span><i>Dread</i><span>, and you can hear them picking and placing their sounds meticulously. Even though the results could feel abrasive or abstract, the attack has never been messy or careless. Most of the time, it’s a precise rendering of Wolf Eyes’ horror-movie visions and hard-edged sonic obsessions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This knack for precision has reached a new level on </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors</i><span>, Wolf Eyes’ first widely-released album since 2009’s </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13320-always-wrong/"">Always Wrong</a></i><span>. It’s the clearest, most detailed record in their vast catalogue. There’s little in the way of buried elements or blurred dissonance; in fact, much of the album could be accurately described as minimal. The best example is the longest, a 12-minute dirge called “Confession of the Informer”. Sparse and desolate, it contains only a few sounds at any given moment-- and most of them are distant and fade quickly, like the after-images of a light flash disappearing inside your eyelids.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Why is “Confession of the Informer” more gripping than a standard blast of rising noise? The secret lies in Wolf Eyes’ ability to cook up thick tension with the simplest sonic ingredients. It’s a skill they’ve had for a while, but lately they’ve focused it to a point of perfection. It helps that Nate Young and John Olson-- the group’s only consistent members since 2000-- have worked diligently on this aspect of their music outside of Wolf Eyes, in the sparse sketches of their duo </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29975-stare-case/""><span>Stare Case</span></a><span>, the rangy experiments of Young’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16123-stay-asleep-regression-vol-2/""><span>Regression</span></a><span>, and the reggae-influenced rhythms of Olson’s </span><a href=""http://americantapes.us/hazel.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Hazel and Henry Slaughter.</span></a><span> It also helps that new member Jim Baljo adds a further layer of laser-like clarity in his dexterous guitar playing. (Baljo replaced </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29102-failing-lights/""><span>Mike Connelly</span></a><span> last fall, though Connelly and the other former Wolf Eye, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7929-aaron-dilloway/""><span>Aaron Dilloway</span></a><span>, both contributed to </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors</i><span>). All these factors have pushed Wolf Eyes to a peak of efficient power, where a single sound can ripple tension through the rest of a song.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most powerful of those sounds are Young’s simple yet maniacally exacting beats. It’s fitting that </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors</i><span> begins with one, tearing open the stereo space before other sounds can move in. His beats are the spine of the music, the compass around which all the other noises align. So while droning chords spark the slow-swinging “Chattering Lead”, the beat pushes them and Young’s deadened moans forward. It’s also what gives the song visceral impact, more so than the band’s tactile sheen. That sheen might make you woozy, but it’s Young’s beats that punch you in the gut.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What they don’t do, though, is push the music toward crashing climaxes. Young has recently talked about keeping the Wolf Eyes sound “realistic,” and resisting the temptation to jump from zero to ten at every opportunity. The result of this outlook on </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors </i><span>is momentum that’s primarily implicit. Swells are tenuous and elusive, lurking in shadows without ever jolting into the frame. While Wolf Eyes have often used words and images that suggest the shock of slasher films, it’s this haunting aspect of their music that truly evokes scary movies.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not that </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors </i><span>is all about negative space. The album’s busy soundscape is much more diverse and rounded than that. In places it offers full-on noise-- take the fire-bomb opening of “Born Liar”, or the siren-like wail of “Warning Sign”, not coincidentally the sole track on the album without vocals. But the fact that Wolf Eyes can do both quiet and loud, fast and slow, or frantic and subdued, is no big deal on its own. What matters is the way they make those polar modes seem united and even indistinguishable. Which is yet another reason why something as subdued as “Confession of the Informer” can feel so vital and active.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This ability to connect opposites explains why, even though they’re often associated with the wave of American Noise that rose last decade, Wolf Eyes have always seemed to occupy their own self-made world. Part of that comes from the way they’re constantly generating releases, both as Wolf Eyes proper and under an endless array of side projects and solo ventures. But it’s also because no one else has swung between extremes so deftly, in a way that makes outer edges meet on a curving continuum rather than sitting on far ends of a spectrum. On </span><i>No Answer: Lower Floors</i><span>, this fact, like the music itself, is clearer than ever before.</span></p></div>"|17968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17968-wolf-eyes-no-answer-lower-floors/|8.2|Marc Masters

Ever hear of highway hypnosis? You pull into the garage after a long drive only to realize you can't really recall the last several hours of your life? That feeling's all over <i>Recurring Dream</i>, a mesmerizing record with a distinctly sinister edge. Even as you're drawn in by its narcotic murk, you can't quite shake the feeling that something terrible's happened that you just can't quite recall.</p>
<p>From the layers of scum strewn across its every surface to the minutes-before-sunset cover art, <i>Recurring Dream</i> is well acquainted with the darkness. As on <i>Black Earth</i>, Implodes' gloomy vibe is equal parts post-punk disaffection, shoegaze's motion-blur, and the heft of post-rock. Start mining for reference points, and you'll never stop; the Jesus and Mary Chain's <i>Darklands</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"" target=""_blank"">Jesu</a>'s <i>Conqueror</i> made my notes before I realized I'd never make it out of the Js alive. Despite these disparate landmarks, the uniformly sour mood and near-constant drone that runs through just about every second of <i>Recurring Dream</i> gives it a kind of tunnel vision: whether it's the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>-style blowout in ""Ex Mass"" or the early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>-on-dilaudid vibe of ""Sleepyheads"", the persistent crackle seems to cast everything in their world in the same sunless hue.</p>
<p>Spend a little time getting acclimated to the darkness, though, and you'll start to see just how many things are moving around back there. Even after a dozen listens or so, these songs still seem to change shape, their haunting echoes and lurking rhythms fluidly rearranging themselves whenever your back's turned. And when they do break from the near-oppressive opacity, you still up and take notice. ""Prisms and the Nature of Light"" refracts an acoustic kumbaya into something stranger, more surreal. And halfway through several of these songs, guitarist Ken Camden takes a solo that burns through the night like the trail of neon in your rear-view. Their brilliance is quickly swallowed up into <i>Recurring Dream</i>'s beyond-black coloring, but these rare flashes of light only seem to deepen the engrossing darkness that surrounds them.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, <i>Recurring Dream</i>'s a slinkier-sounding record than its predecessor: the songs are more spacious, less prone to snarling, and they've lowered the volume on <i>Black Earth</i>'s stuck-between-stations fizz. It's a tradeoff: the more deliberate <i>Dream</i> doesn't move unless it has to, upping the intensity whenever it does. But, for all the tension <i>Recurring Dream</i> builds up over its 45-minute runtime, there's precious little in the way of relief: <i>Black Earth</i>'s periodic blowouts served as dread-diffusers, but the foreboding <i>Recurring Dream</i> closer ""Bottom of a Well"" prefers mystery, sending you back off into the night, disquieted.</p></div>"|17822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17822-inflated-recurring-dream/|6.8|Paul Thompson

Since 2010, he's released four solo LPs, one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/"">collaborative album with Ty Segall</a>, a live cassette, and a handful of singles. And that doesn't even cover his tenure in other bands. His albums are all nearly overcrowded by sonic ideas and psychedelic twists. Even one of his simpler songs, the acoustic track ""Balance Yr Heart"" off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16541-white-fence-family-perfume-vols-1-2/""><i>Family Perfume Vol. 1</i></a>, gives the impression that he spliced together two different-but-similar songs that were floating in his head. In just three years, he's managed to poise himself as a prolific artist in a town that runneth over with prolific artists (Segall, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29330-sonny-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Sonny Smith</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a> mastermind and <a href=""http://www.castlefacerecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Castle Face</a> head John Dwyer).</p>
<p>While gathering up old stuff for <i>Cyclops Reap</i>, Presley's prolific instincts kicked in: ""there were more coming. a better crop,"" he wrote in a press release. He wrote more songs, recorded them to the four-track in his bedroom, and scrapped the compilation altogether. The album ends up being a testament to what Presley has learned in terms of home recording: It's his best-sounding and most easily accessible album to date. It still comes packed with less-than-pristine production and some of the psychedelic tics that marked his previous work, but for the most part, these songs are marked by a surprising amount of clarity. For something with such modest origins, this thing sounds at least as good as <i>Hair</i>, which was made in the studio. </p>
<p>And these songs don't ever feel overstuffed. Everything is faithful to White Fence's well-established aesthetic, but simplified. There's no jumping around or writing three melodies when there only needs to be one. It's a refreshingly streamlined record, and more so than his previous work, there's a slight-but-palpable country influence. Presley picks an acoustic guitar, adds the occasional Southern guitar lick, and sings sweet melodies. In places, this thing could pass for a straightforward singer/songwriter album. (An influence that would make sense, seeing as he started <a href=""http://birthrcrds.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his label</a> just to release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17415-jessica-pratt/"">Jessica Pratt's album</a>.) ""Beat"" and ""Only Man Alive"", for example, are clear of fuzz and psych freakouts. He just delivers beautiful melodies backed by minimal percussion. This isn't to say that Presley's delivering shockingly intimate lyrics-- as usual, they're stories and phrases doused in abstractions and poeticisms. But sometimes, there's a warmth and familiarity in his words: The instrumentals and vocals in ""Live on Genevieve"" might sound cartoonishly warped and bleary, but the sentiment of ""I wanna live on Genevieve Street with you"" feels resonant.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all cooing and ginger acoustic guitar strumming. He balances the album's softer moments with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14940-various-artists-pink-gorilla/"">""Pink Gorilla""</a>, the beefiest track of the bunch. It's a song slathered in acid-burnt fuzz where Presley stretches out with an echoing psych guitar solo after hammering out a simple, solid power chord hook. The songs here are lovely, but ultimately, this thing needed some heft-- something that keeps the album's airier material from melding together or, worse, floating by completely, and ""Pink Gorilla"" fits the bill. That's one of Presley's greatest strengths as a composer-- he anchors <i>Reap</i>'s quieter songs with substantive sonics. </p>
<p>There's only one old song on <i>Cyclops</i><i> Reap</i>: ""Make Them Dinner at Our Shoes"", which is from 2009. Like every other track on the album, it's masked under a thin layer of hiss. It's hard to tell exactly what he's singing in places-- his vocals are occasionally eaten by his guitar or another sound-- but one phrase is always clear: ""clear open sky."" Those words are backed by bright major chords on an electric guitar and the soft, steady ambiance of a shaker. Like most of White Fence's lyrics, it's unclear what those words are trying to communicate in a literal sense, but packaged the way they are, the emotional connection is clear. </p></div>"|17850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17850-white-fence-cyclops-reap/|7.7|Evan Minsker

<p>Earlier this year, LaLonde struck out on his own with <i>Rhythymnals</i>, which he worked on with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27553-the-rural-alberta-advantage/"">the Rural Alberta Advantage</a> producer Roger Leavens. Besides establishing him as a different kind of mopey singer-songwriter-- the guy that <i>would</i> name his band's next album after his and his girlfriend's matching birthmarks-- the process gave LaLonde production experience that he in turn brought to <i>Birthmarks</i> along with Leavens, and for the first time Born Ruffians recorded songs together in the studio before seeing how they worked onstage. The result, for better or worse, smooths over the ragged edges that made Born Ruffians such a rivetingly unpredictable band in the first place.</p>
<p>A few months ago, LaLonde gave <a href=""http://beardedgentlemenmusic.com/2013/03/20/interview-luke-lalonde-of-born-ruffians/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> in which he mentioned that Toronto's BoomBox Studios, where Born Ruffians recorded <i>Birthmarks</i>, doubled as a commercial songwriting outlet. ""I think that means that Roger has to be able to adapt to survive, he needs to be able to do whatever they need him to do. If the ad direction is folky and they say they need a '<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford and Sons</a> vibe,' Roger needs to be able to do that well and execute it in a convincing way,"" he said. It didn't seem to occur to him that might be why so many bands are suing companies for using barely concealed rip-offs of their songs in commercials. At times, <i>Birthmarks</i> seems to come from this place. </p>
<p>This is as much LaLonde's doing as Leavens'; <i>Red Yellow &amp; Blue</i>'s ""Little Garcon"" appeared in an <a href=""http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/oWiRQmlAlqg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Express commercial</a> in 2011, after all. Regardless, the harmonies on ""Needle"" are libelously close to those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"">Fleet Foxes</a>, the chorus to ""6-5000"" wouldn't be out of place on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9017-a-hundred-miles-off/""> <i>A Hundred Miles Off</i></a>, and ""With Her Shadow"" borrows <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s appropriated bass lines, even if bassist Mitch DeRosier gives them an extra salty twang. Of course musicians borrow from each other all the time-- and the upshot is that LaLonde and his band mates have developed quite a versatile range-- but these hooks stand out from Born Ruffians' emphatically original material, even if their earlier albums could sound homemade to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>But commercial songwriters know what sounds good, and much of <i>Birthmarks</i> is catchy enough to get stuck in your head, if not necessarily memorable enough to stay there. On ""Too Soaked To Break"", the way LaLonde's reverbed voice ripples over keyboardist Andy Lloyd's arpeggios and woodwinds inspires such complacency that you almost don't notice the same flute melody in the chorus of following track ""Dancing on the Edge of Our Graves"". LaLonde isn't too shabby of a pop songwriter himself: after screeching about needing someone to have sex with on <i>Born Ruffians</i>, he disarmed fans with the studied boy-band swagger of ""I always said I'd be your boyfriend, and that's that"" on <i>Rhythymnals</i>' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKj55YcXBHY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Undone</a>"". He works out these newfound romantic inclinations on ""Permanent Hesitation"", awkwardly gushing, ""I am just a lotus/ And you are just a vine/ I am just a gnome/ And you are so divine."" A song later, LaLonde is back to his old ways with ""nothing but lust"" for someone else's girlfriend, so maybe not that much has changed.</p>
<p>It's still too early to say if the same can be said of Born Ruffians. <i>Birthmarks</i> is their most refined release to date, thanks to Leavens and LaLonde's production sensibilities and the addition of Lloyd, all of which helped fill widening cracks in the band's former drums/guitar/vocals setup. While those factors may have stopped Born Ruffians' total disintegration after things started to fall apart on <i>Say It</i>, they also snuffed out the strung-out charm of three guys constantly on the verge of losing their cool. And that's a loss the band should remember not to take lightly.</p></div>"|17908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17908-born-ruffians-birthmarks/|6.5|Harley Brown

The boy who fell for the emotional resonance of bone-disintegrating sub-bass only after years of playing piano privately came out against the American version of guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex </a>(whom he couldn’t even be bothered naming). Such performers, Blake contended, appealed strictly to a “testosterone-driven, frat-boy market” that couldn’t be more different from the Feist-and-Joni covers and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a> duets pouring out of the Londoner who’d just turned 23. Blake argued that his music was not only more egalitarian-- appealing to women and men equally-- but was also a purer representation of dubstep as an idea. It was a misrepresentation of American dubstep’s audiences and a presumptuous statement about What Women Want, sure, but at the same time, it was hard to fault Blake for forcefully trying to stake his claim to a patch of land within a genre broad enough to incorporate a rave resurgence and a brooding folkie.</p>
<p>Blake’s real argument for the continued relevance of his dewy, electronic gospel-folk comes via his second LP, <i>Overgrown. </i>At a few points on the record, he seems to be demonstrating to the wub fetishists that he’s also capable of sonic mayhem. Whether they’re meant as representations of conflicted emotions or simply designed to get crowds moving, the codas to “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49824-new-james-blake-voyeur-dub/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Lion</a>” and “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49967-listen-new-james-blake-voyeur-album-version/"" target=""_blank"">Voyeur</a>” are as bass-first and <i>funky</i> as anything Blake’s done to date. The last minute of “Lion”, which credits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> as collaborator, prominently showcases Blake’s gospel fixation, his wordless vocals present to acknowledge the powerful groove. For its part, “Voyeur” is possibly his most techno-sounding track to date, though you wouldn’t know it from the opening. Blake begins in jazzy repose, dwelling on a short phrase (“and her mind was on me”) over a light piano loop and minimal bass thump. The introduction of a treated cowbell and a 4/4 thump gradually morphs the song into something resembling a club track, similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>’s slow-building 2010 banger “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11612-love-cry/"" target=""_blank"">Love Cry</a>” or 2011’s simmering, sample-based “Pyramid.” </p>
<p><i>Overgrown</i> is a showier album than Blake’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">eponymous 2011 debut</a>, incorporating more gospel and R&amp;B elements and a wider variety of textures. In a way, it feels like Blake’s meeting himself midway between his LP and EP personas. The string of EPs he released before putting his blurred face and name on the cover of an LP cast Blake as the latest UK producer prodigy, capable of modern classical pieces and tracks built around Aaliyah and Kelis samples. On his first LP, however, Blake opted for the singer-songwriter move, making heart music instead of head music, alienating certain purists while gaining new fans who have zero interest in his work on the Hemlock label.</p>
<p>On Blake’s own admittedly modest terms, <i>Overgrown</i> is marked by extremes. The album starts in the mode of the 2011 LP on which he rued childhood relationships and pondered his dreams. On the title track, he mewls “I don’t want to be a star/ But a stone on the shore,” confessing he prefers to blend into his surroundings rather than draw attention to himself. For a guy who puts a crisp, pensive photo of himself on his album cover, it’s a questionable stance, and his delivery is self-serious enough to nearly tip over into self-parody. It pales in comparison to <i>James Blake</i> opener “Unluck”, though it’s saved from schmaltz through Blake’s skill at investing even the cheesiest sentiments with a palpable anxiety.</p>
<p>There’s showy, and then there’s “Take a Fall for Me”, a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a>, who Blake gives free rein to smear awkward romantic imagery all over his track. It’s easy to understand why the pair would collaborate: their production styles aren’t dissimilar, both showing a fondness for gloomy, bass-heavy soundscapes rooted in R&amp;B. Why RZA was asked to <i>rap</i>, however, is hard to understand. If you want to hear the phrase “tight as the grip of a squid” on a James Blake album, or an American’s stereotype of a proper British meal (fish &amp; chips, Guinness), you’re in luck. For the rest of us, “Fall” is Blake’s first out-and-out failure, the sort of song that should have been relegated at the very least to bonus track status, and probably should have been kept private altogether. </p>
<p><i>Overgrown </i>is not as wall-to-wall great as his debut, but fans of the first LP will still find much to admire. The most promising development is his indulged fondness for various permutations of R&amp;B and gospel styles, best evidenced on the album’s great first single “Retrograde.” <a href=""http://www.hotpress.com/James-Blake/news/I-fell-in-love--James-Blake-tells-Hot-Press/9610184.html?new_layout=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Self-described</a> as a song about falling in love, it balances the solemn soul of Bill Withers’ “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxjNauWYFfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grandma’s Hands</a>” with periodic bursts of passion, via Blake shouting “suddenly, I’m hit!” Throughout the album, he successfully splits the difference between the sultry bedroom vibes of R&amp;B’s resurgent Quiet Storm moment and the more mundane life of a British “bedroom” artist fond of keeping to himself. “To the Last”, in particular, tiptoes around a Sade-style smooth-soul composition, aided by the synthesized sounds of waves crashing ashore.</p>
<p>Blake’s deconstructive take on R&amp;B is similar in spirit to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>’s Tom Krell. In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCgrsEX-_zA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview with <i>Pitchfork TV</i></a>, Krell explained his writing process as one of locating bodily sensations that haven’t yet shaped themselves into recognizable emotions. Suddenly you’re hit, in other words, but you don’t yet know if that feeling is joy, anxiety, frustration, or terror-- you’re only aware that something’s there, and you try to freeze it, to examine it more closely, instead of simply slotting it in a category and moving on. This is exactly what Blake does so well (and, for what it’s worth, RZA doesn’t): locating these sensations, and conversing about them. On “I Am Sold”, he even manages to explain the process, by mulling a single phrase over and over, tweaking it, and approaching it from different directions: “speculate what we feel.” Instead of worrying about where he fits in a broader musical landscape, or whether he’s a “star” or not,” this is Blake’s comfort zone. Whether he’s making bass-heavy bangers, quiet meditations, or increasingly of late, something in-between, Blake is a modern master of emotional speculation.</p></div>"|17842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17842-james-blake-overgrown/|8.0|Eric Harvey

Melodic linearity and lyrical candour were never at the top of their to-do list, so it was a pleasant surprise that former frontman Steve Mason’s 2010 solo debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14231-boys-outside/"" target=""_blank""><i>Boys Outside</i></a>, evinced such a warm, welcoming folk-rock accessibility and emotional directness. After struggling through the Beta Bands’ flagging commercial fortunes and his own public battles with depression, the album essentially functioned as a form of therapy: You got the sense that Mason was not only picking up the pieces of his once-ascendant career, but of his life.    </p>
<p>It’s a process he’s still grappling with on <i>Monkey Minds in the Devil’s Time</i>, which opens with Mason in a familiar setting: lying in bed, engaged in the sort of nocturnal self-analysis that results from spending too many restless hours staring at the ceiling. The first words we hear him sing on the fever-dreamy “Lie Awake” are “At 15 years old, I had to know/ What makes you fail, and what makes you grow”, suggesting that even these astute adolescent inklings couldn’t fully prepare him for the rollercoaster course his adult life would take. But if <i>Monkey Minds</i> begins as another intensely introspective exercise, it gradually blossoms into something else entirely: over 20 sprawling but strategically stitched tracks, its temperament veers from solipsistic to altruistic, charting Mason’s transformation from a man too insecure to leave his room, to one who can no longer ignore the injustices transpiring outside his window. </p>
<p>And that progression is as much musical as it is attitudinal. The first half of the album sees Mason revisiting and improving upon the <i>Boys Outside</i> template, bolstering his gently strummed serenades with more pronounced classic-rock flourishes. The chorus-summoning piano refrain of the beautifully aching “A Lot of Love” offers a distant echo of the Band’s “The Weight,” while the cheekily churchly “Lonely” and “Oh My Lord” sway in the direction of gospel-gilded FM-radio standards like Stephen Stills’ “Love the One You’re With” and the Stones’ “Loving Cup”. But while these songs count as the most winning and instantly anthemic that Mason has produced since the days when his old band was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppJAkN4m9bY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written into the <i>High Fidelty</i> screenplay</a>, they’re buttressed by various cryptic interludes-- narrative spoken-word snippets (“The Old Problem”), squeaky melodica solos clashing with motorcylce-engine revs (“Flyover ‘98”), dubby instrumentals overlaid with Portuguese car-race commentary (“The Last of Heroes”)-- that reconnect him with the Beta Band’s exploratory ethos and deep sense of earthy groove.</p>
<p>And as you venture deeper into <i>Monkey Minds</i>, these transitory tracks start to feel less like nonsensical fragments and more as preludes that signal Mason’s restoked sense of swagger and social conscience. In a nod to early Beta Band experiments like “The House Song”, Mason cedes the mic to MC Mystro on “More Money, More Fire”, a synth-shocked rap-rant about the root causes of the incendiary 2011 London riots and police mistreatment of the underclass; the same shuffling beat is immediately repurposed on the subsequent “Fire!”, which channels the preceding song’s righteous indignation into a playful protest chant, buoyed by titanic blasts of brass imported from Primal Scream’s “Loaded.” And the string-spiked “Fight Them Back” is an even more disarming mix of funk and fury, with Mason casually commandeering a palace coup with “a fist, a boot, and a baseball bat,” topped by a sample of an especially smug Tony Blair quote that’ll inspire the rabble to start getting in their practice swings.</p>
<p><i>Monkey Minds</i>’ sharp, late-act turn into politicized proselytizing may seem jarring at first, but then it’s an accurate reflection of how politics can suddenly intrude upon our lives and upend our worldview. It often takes something as calamitous as mass, citywide arson to remind the average person that there’s a world of hurt beyond their self-involved concerns. The gorgeous closing lullaby, “Come to Me”, finds Mason right back where he started-- lying in bed-- but it’s not his anxieties that are keeping him awake: “I used to sit alone and watch your cities rise,” he sings, “It flashed across my mind the murder in your eye.” He could be addressing his prime minister, or God itself, but in any event, it’s good to know Mason is now losing sleep for the right reasons. </p></div>"|17852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17852-steve-mason-monkey-minds-in-the-devils-time/|7.9|Stuart Berman

When I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8719-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> Travis Stewart and Praveen Sharma previous to the release of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, the duo knocked back cocktails in the mid-afternoon while riffing on embarrassing screen names, potentially pornographic horror films, and, yes, the dance community's staunch seriousness. ""You got to have fun up there, man,"" Sharma sighed after Stewart mentioned a negative review the pair received for ""trying too hard"" while opening for Jamie xx.</p>
<p>Indeed, while their level of on-stage enthusiasm may not be at the level of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4832-girl-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Talk</a>, Sepalcure's sense of self-presentation differs from many in the bass music scene they're associated with, as they mouth along energetically to their own songs and frequently address the crowd (which very few DJs, for better or worse, care to do). Just before this past New Year's Eve, they ditched their originals-heavy set at a Manhattan gig for a solid hour-plus of euphoric house music; a year previous, the energy (and potential for clumsiness) at a performance at Brooklyn's Cameo Gallery was at a level that, for a minute, their sound system shut down, prompting some sheepishly enthusiastic apologies from the duo before things whirred back to life.</p>
<p>Sepalcure do very well with nightlife crowds of varying pretension, but their debut album's greatest selling point was how well it translated to the home-listening set. Sharma and Stewart inhaled a few different sub-genres of dance and expelled a romantic sound that approached pop (for bass music, anyway), fulfilling the promise of their early singles to create music that fused hard-hitting rhythms with pastoral touches and pink-cloud ambience. Their aesthetic had arrived confidently and fully realized, the work of two decade-plus veterans who, individually, finally found a distinctive sound by joining forces.</p>
<p>Last year, Sepalcure released a single for album cut ""Eternally Yrs"" that featured a new song along with a smattering of remixes, but Stewart and Sharma have suggested that, since the duo is separated by an ocean (Sharma's New York-based, while the somewhat nomadic Stewart currently lives in Berlin), there's no guarantee of the project becoming a long-term fixation. New EP <i>Make You</i>, then, is a welcome treat in existence alone, suggesting that, despite Stewart's relatively high profile due to work with Harlem pop-rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Azealia Banks</a> as well as his recent signing to electronic mainstay Ninja Tune, Sepalcure are still very much alive.</p>
<p>In addition to re-asserting their presence, <i>Make You</i> confirms that, at this point, Sepalcure aren't as concerned with growth as they are with refinement. The title track is a summation of what they do very well, as deep, belly-rumbling bass, a fragile percussive backbone, and evocative vocal samples coalesce perfectly before a fingerpicked acoustic guitar figure drifts into the mix. ""The Water's Fine"" elaborates on <i>Sepalcure</i>'s slight fascination with juke's hypnotic stutter, as woozy synths and a pile of tangled vocal cries are washed in static and hung out to dry. ""The Water's Fine"" also stands as one of a few examples on <i>Make You</i> where Sharma and Stewart subtly expand their sound-- not in style, but in scope, as they allow plenty of space between the track's elements and make for one of their most emptily dense works yet.</p>
<p>If ""The Water's Fine"" represents Sepalcure dialing back their soft-focus tendencies in favor of something more sparse and direct, then ""He Said No"" finds the duo reaching total sensory overload, with dreamy keyboards and a twinkling sense of optimism resembling a hi-fi, bass-friendly version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a> (whose ""See Birds"" stood as the odd man out on Sepalcure's otherwise club-ready XLR8R mix from 2010). ""Rumours"" is something else entirely, as a whiplashed vocal sample gets chopped up and buried by atmospheric pressure before bubbling up to the surface again. Then, things change halfway through the tune, as the structure takes on a beguiling new shape with dark, piping tones and a percolating rhythmic bed swathed in ambient hiss.</p>
<p>By the time a few synths and manipulated vocal samples meander in, ""Rumours"" has completely changed, highlighting Sepalcure's undervalued ability to take listeners on a journey, regardless of whether they're on their feet. Similar to <i>Sepalcure</i>, <i>Make You</i> closes with contemplative ambience-- the fingerpicked guitar and dotted horns of ""DMD""-- and although the EP's cohesive potency is can't match its predecessor's, the attempt to fashion a narrative underlines the duo's attention to detail. (One wishes that Stewart's Machinedrum, with its steady stream of ephemera, possessed this much quality control.) Sepalcure are still intent on having a good time, but as <i>Make You</i>'s elegant expansiveness suggests, they're dead serious, too.</p></div>"|17899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17899-sepalcure-make-you-ep/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Icelandic pianist <a href=""http://olafurarnalds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ólafur Arnalds</a>, a young composer of shadowy, wistful, slow-paced chamber music, is making it work. He began as a teenaged hardcore drummer with an illicit love of classical and film music. His efforts in that vein earned him a solo deal with <a href=""http://www.erasedtapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erased Tapes</a>, home to likeminded artists such as Peter Broderick. Touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> raised his public profile, and in recent years, Ólafur has shown signs of breaking free from indie-classical limbo, securing elite commissions (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/9273368"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a score</a> for the great choreographer <a href=""http://www.randomdance.org/wayne_mcgregor"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wayne McGregor</a>) and signing with <a href=""http://www.mercuryclassics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Classics</a>, a new classical label that lacks the prestige of Decca or Deutsche Grammophon but adjoins them via parent company Universal. He achieved all this off the conservatory track, which may account for the composer's ample immediacy and wanting complexity alike.</p>
<p>Ólafur works in blacks and whites. His musical atmospheres might be fairly abridged with the images ""night"" and ""snow;"" his releases swing from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13808-found-songs/"">casual song-a-day EPs</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14278-and-they-have-escaped-the-weight-of-darkness/"">hermetic, formal LPs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16296-living-room-songs-another-happy-day-ost/"">back again</a>. The established foundations are intact on <i>For Now I am Winter</i>: the bitterly romantic strings melting over sparsely chorded rows of simple, chiming piano intervals; the faintly dated electronic production nicked from trip-hop and IDM. The album recalls Valgeir Sigurðsson's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17107-architecture-of-loss/""><i>Architecture of Loss</i></a>, except with the dense harmonic storminess blown off. But you can certainly hear major label resources at work. Ólafur handles the laptop and keyboard instruments but contracts out a group of strings, winds, and brass from the Iceland Symphony Orchestra; the porcelain voice of Arnór Dan; and orchestral arrangements by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, who reasonably responds to Ólafur’s material with dramatic yet musically cautious accompaniment.</p>
<p>If you crave morose, impressive beauty, it's here. But for a statement on a new classical label, this sounds a lot like a stirring score in search of its ballet or film. There is startlingly little virtuosity written in the compositions, especially in the piano, where it can be hard to distinguish minimalist profundity from undeveloped themes. The strings and winds are more mobile, but Ólafur still keeps his players working through routine harmonic progressions at a pace so stately it's almost robotic. </p>
<p>The biggest change here is the addition of Arnór Dan's vocals on four songs, which like the music are beautiful and pristine to a numbing degree, at least in this low-contrast context. Making his first appearance over a glacial piano and shimmering pads, he sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony Hegarty</a> evacuated of wildness and swing-- though he does free up as the arrangement flourishes. He turns in some terrific ornaments halfway through ""<a href=""http://vimeo.com/62019116"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Old Skin</a>"", a pretty indie-pop tune that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5206-lost-in-the-trees/"">Lost in the Trees</a> with a sultry-chaste dash of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">Tom Krell</a>. He's a talented guy, and can seem to be addressing his talent more than the listener. Whereas singers you can really feel make their voices a medium something passes through, Dan's voice here is more of a carefully wrought thing unto itself-- a very fine vase on a very high shelf.  </p>
<p>This may all sound grimmer than it is. <i>For Now I am Winter</i> is competent, reasonably varied, and efficiently rousing. Muhly effectuates some pleasing motion in the strings and winds. Opening track ""Sudden Throw"" is compelling, and while its intrigue fades in the driving cinematic wallpaper of ""Brim"", that darkly shining sinuousness rises again in ""Only the Winds"". ""Reclaim"" is a dashing highlight, leaving behind airless dirges and minimalist ice sculptures for a welcome dance tempo. But the lingering impression that there's not a lot to grasp emotionally becomes stark in the thinnest tracks. My takeaway from ""Words of Amber"" is that it sounds really nice to pick a winding path through piano scales in a coldly reflective room, while ""We (Too) Shall Rest"" is a funeral dirge without a subject, a feeling without a focus.</p></div>"|17830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17830-olafur-arnalds-now-i-am-winter/|5.5|Brian Howe

Even though he released a record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16049-freeclouds/""><i>Freeclouds</i></a>, under his own name in 2011, the Baltimore-based producer and guitarist is still primarily known as a recording engineer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"">Twin Shadow</a>'s George Lewis, Jr., and as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"">Lower Dens</a>. <i>They're Flowers</i>, Tanton's debut as <a href=""http://luxurylinerpleasurecruise.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luxury Liners</a>, is a product of his time on the road. While in transit, he was forced to abandon his original guitar arrangements for the only instrument on hand: a laptop. Rather than bemoan his restrictive circumstances, Tanton ran with them, making an album that feels like a fresh start.</p>
<p>For <i>They're Flowers</i>, Tanton is concerned mostly with deconstruction and stripping things down. Nowhere is this more evident than on album opener ""Caribbean Sunset"", a John Cale cover. Tanton lifts the lyrics verbatim and tangentially follows the chordal progressions from the original, but overall he completely re-imagines the song so that it swoops and shimmer like light reflected off a glitter ball. And it rings truer for the song's exoticized female protagonist than the original's accordion, stilted violin, and a wood block for good measure.</p>
<p>But deconstruction always brings the risk of collapse, and Tanton reaches a few points in <i>They're Flowers</i> where he should have pulled a different piece out of the Jenga tower. His weak spot continues to be lyric-writing, and ""Memphis Alex"", a tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"">Alex Chilton</a>, is filled<i> </i>with insipid rhymes. The lyrics are usually easy to overlook in the face of his mastery of sound, but it can still be frustrating to parse a line, however abstract, like ""one day my prince will come running home"" (""Valley High"").</p>
<p>Over the course of the album, a recurring theme is Tanton's inability to choose between wistful synth-folk or unapologetic retro bombast, or at least how to reconcile the two. He tries on messy album centerpiece ""Life's a Beach"", which features the War On Drugs' Dave Hartley and his solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29101-nightlands/"">Nightlands</a>. The beginning wades through Hartley's voice and slow wind chimes, speeding suddenly into a thicket of keyboard effects before bringing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a> harmonies in the background. Between all that, the interlude's sagging keyboards, and the sheer length, there's just too much going on.</p>
<p>Like any self-editor, sometimes Tanton has trouble knowing when to stop, and this makes <i>They're Flowers</i> feel more like a second draft rather than a finished product. He still seems most comfortable crafting other people's material into a cohesive whole in the studio or on the road. With his own, it's telling that the most fully realized, stand-alone song is a cover. He's found his voice, and now he just needs to figure out how to use it.</p></div>"|17935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17935-luxury-liners-theyre-flowers/|6.2|Harley Brown

""Band” implies people banging on things widely agreed upon as instruments and making things that most people would recognize as ""music""-- this feels like an inadequately pedestrian way to describe what Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer are. Perhaps even more so in their absence, the Knife have come to seem like a vibe, an ethic, a dark, not-entirely-scientifically-understood phenomena; other bands are to the Knife what matter is to anti-matter. When new artists say they’ve been influenced by the Knife-- and it’s a claim countless have made in the past few years-- they are at this point referencing not just a specific sound but an entire way of being in our information-glutted world: a desire to retain a tightly controlled, precisely evocative sense of mystery and mastery over their image. Even in the wake of such pollutants as international success, ubiquitous acclaim, and frequent imitation, the Knife have found a way to keep their name meaning something remarkably unique and pure.</p>
<p>This has something to do with the fact that Andersson and Dreijer have gone to great lengths to come off like they are something other than human. On stage, they were silhouettes glowing behind a translucent screen. They gave interviews and accepted awards in disguise (moving through a terrifying cycle of <a href=""http://cdn.pitchfork.com/media/knife452.jpg"">bird masks</a>, <a href=""http://static.nme.com/images/gallery/84_TheKnife_L210406.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dystopian Blue Man Group masks</a>, <a href=""http://revolverproject.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Knife-Monkey.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">primate-inspired facepaint</a>, and of course who could forget Andersson's infamous <a href=""http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/news/37692/358b8fed.jpg"">melting flesh mask</a>?). And on the steely, electro-nightmare <i>Silent</i> <i>Shout</i>-- their first great record-- they found new ways to viscerally integrate these ideas into their sound, warping and pitch-shifting Andersson’s vocals until they grew androgynous and post-human. Somewhere in the past seven years, the Knife reached that Lynchian status where everything they do is their own, adjectivally specific kind of creepy. The early press photos for their new album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/62-shaking-the-habitual/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shaking the Habitual</i></a>, made an activity as innocent as <a href=""http://blogg.svt.se/psl/files/getimage-e1361524313557.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">swinging on playground swings</a> feel forebodingly sinister.</p>
<p>But buying ""post-human"" mythology wholesale has always sold the Knife a little short. After all, what was their breakthrough hit ""Heartbeats"" if not a heavy-breathing declaration of vulnerability? Even <i>Silent Shout</i> cut through the abstraction and found a pulse-- whether it was the strobe-lit dancefloor rhythms of “We Share Our Mothers’ Health” and “Neverland” or the palpitating storytelling of a song like “Forest Families”. The driving force of their music is the interplay between the uncanny and the familiar, though in all the theatricality it's easy to forget the latter. But the early information that trickled out about <i>Shaking the Habitual </i>served as a reminder. We’re so used to experiencing the Knife at a cool, veiled distance that the most shocking things about their return were the ones that seemed uncharacteristically personable: their faces (on full display in the anarchic video for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49304-watch-the-knifes-epic-video-for-full-of-fire/"">“Full of Fire”</a>), their <a href=""http://cdn.pitchfork.com/features/9092/21ebb4cd.jpg"">fingernails</a>, their smiles (were they actually<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/promo_650/public/media/the-knife-650-430.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <i>smiling</i></a> in that photo?). For all their sinister, shadowy abstraction, the Knife are at their most disarming and affecting when you’re briefly reminded-- and you often are, over the course of their sprawling, magnificent fourth album <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>-- that Andersson and Dreijer are human after all.</p>
<p>Boundary-busting in content and in form, the 2xCD <i>Shaking the Habitual </i>challenges plenty of perceived notions-- about extreme wealth, the patriarchy, the monarchy, environmental degradation, decreasing attention spans (“It's nice to play with people's time these days,” Andersson says in explanation of the record's marathon length), and not the least of which the Knife's own identity as a band. The winding, unbridled song structures and industrial-tinged, organic sounds are such a departure from the rest of their output that they’ve said they initially considered releasing it under a different name. <i>Shaking</i> certainly pulls from a wider aesthetic palette than any of their previous records: found sound drones (they crafted the 19-minute “Old Dreams Waiting to Be Realized” from editing hours of electronic feedback they'd recorded in a boiler room), zithers, an instrument they apparently made out of “an old bedspring” and “a microphone”-- all employed in the name of breaking their own habits. “We went temporarily acoustic,” they declared in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50003-read-the-knifes-huge-crazy-awesome-press-biomanifesto-for-shaking-the-habitual/""><span>madcap manifesto</span></a> that served as <i>Shaking</i>'s press bio. “Electronic is just one place in the body.”</p>
<p>In plenty of ways, <i>Shaking</i> seems to have “inaccessible” etched into every fiber of its DNA. It is 98 minutes long (about double the length of the already-epic-seeming <i>Silent Shout</i>). Six of its thirteen songs exceed eight minutes. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49563-watch-the-knife-share-video-for-new-single-a-tooth-for-an-eye/"">official statements</a> released with its music videos (“'A Tooth For An Eye' deconstructs images of maleness, power and leadership. Who are the people we trust as our leaders and why? What do we have to learn from those we consider inferior?”) read like museum placards. There are two long, dissonant drone pieces-- and one of them has the feel-good title “Fracking Fluid Injection”. But once you surrender to these facts and descend into <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>, its atmosphere is strangely, surprisingly inhabitable. Moving fluidly between potent bursts of electro-aggression (“A Tooth for an Eye”), seductively uncoiling, meditative grooves (“Raging Lung”) and ambient stretches, <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>-- like Swans’ recent and similarly mammoth <i>The Seer</i>-- doesn’t demand the same kind of attention the whole time. Many of the things that might seem off-putting in theory are what make it hang together so well as a front-to-back listen-- the drone pieces are sequenced such that they act as intermissions, though the kind where the air conditioner's at an uncomfortable full blast and the house lights remain, evocatively, dark. Put it on in a room and it snakes in and out of your consciousness, but on some level it’ll still have you in its chilling, atmospheric vice grip. </p>
<p>Following Andersson and Dreijer down such a labyrinthine rabbit hole would be difficult if they didn’t hook you from the start, but luckily the first three songs are among the most immediately arresting 25 minutes of music the Knife has ever made. “A Tooth for an Eye” almost feels like a belated, revisionist do-over of the band’s relatively unremarkable early work. While 2003's <i>Deep Cuts</i> sometimes struggled to find common ground between punk aggression and bright, calypso-tinged synths, “Tooth” ties these competing impulses together seamlessly as it also deftly weaves in a political message. The song’s refrain comes from the experimental British writer Jeanette Winterson’s book <i>The Passion </i>(the interstitials ""Oryx"" and ""Crake"" also reference a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx_and_Crake"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Margaret Atwood novel</a>), but Andersson brings a physicality to her delivery that muscles the line right off the page: “I’m telling you stories,” she seethes, until you can almost see the vein bulging in her neck, “Trust <i>meeeee</i>.”</p>
<p>The polyrhythmic, polymorphously perverse industrial throb “Full of Fire” feeds off the heat kindled by the opening track and rides it for a magnificently maniacal nine minutes, while the creaking, evocative “A Cherry on Top” has got to be one most deliciously creepy Knife songs yet-- of course, that’s saying a lot. (At times it sounds like Animal Collective's “The Bees”, but makes that haunting track sound like a lullaby in comparison.) Built around the bone-curdling sound of a zither warping in and out of tune, Andersson sings of riches-- “Strawberry, melon, cherry on top…The Haga Castle evening cream”-- in a heavy, manipulated voice so overripe it basically wafts decay. She's clearly having fun inhabiting the role of the fat-with-power monarch here, but her roleplaying is also an act of resistance (the band has recently cited as an influence the gender theorist Judith Butler, who pioneered the notion of thinking about gender as performance), of cutting the omnipotent down to size and suggesting that the institution's expiration date has passed. As the instrument warbles in and out of tune, the castle walls-- and the confines of pop structure as we know it-- seem to be crumbling at her and Dreijer's feet. </p>
<p>Nothing else quite matches this opening run, but the second disc has its highlights: The frenetic, gargling instrumental “Networking” recalls the best of Dreijer's techno work as Oni Ayhun and proves he can still scramble the conventions of electronic music with an effortlessness that puts him miles ahead of the Knife's many imitators. Then there's “Raging Lung”, a dank, serpentine 10-minute groove that lifts its refrain (""what a difference a little difference would make"") from Fugazi's classic 1990 debut <i>Repeater</i>. Tipping its hat to the ideologies of punk rock, gender outlaws, enviro-anarchists, and outsiders of any stripe, <i>Shaking</i> feels at time like a guided, international tour through the last quarter century of political resistance and radical thought-- or maybe an epic, authority-fucking mural painted in the part of town where all the squatters and crust punks have migrated. The most difficult part of making a record so ambitious and conceptual is, of course, bridging the gap between thinking and feeling-- a divide that even <i>Shaking</i> cannot always conquer. But all things considered, it's remarkable how seldom the Knife actually sound like they're guiding these songs with their brains rather than their hips or fists. Even at its most cerebreal, this record is palpably, poundingly alive.</p>
<p>Though not as challenging as their collaborative opera score <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/""><i>Tomorrow in a Year</i></a>, <i>Shaking</i> still knowingly, brazenly risks turning less adventurous listeners off-- and maybe those who dismiss the record for not trying to recreate the populist magic of ""Heartbeats"" or ""We Share Our Mother's Health"" have a point. The Knife would clearly like to use their music to incite the listener to rethink concepts taken for granted and challenge authority, but would a more effective method of shaking the habitual be, say, smuggling a subversive message into the greatest (and at press time, only) four-minute dancefloor anthem ever written about fracking? Regardless of the answer, that's a question the Knife are no longer interested in exploring. ""The most commercial way would have been to stick with a formula,"" Andersson observed in a recent Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9092-the-knife/"">interview</a>, but then dismissed that option entirely, saying she and her brother had now moved on to questioning conventions ""on a structural level rather than a psychological level."" And in the end, though, <i>Shaking</i>'s unruly structure-- a perfect union of form and content-- feels like a noble choice. In interviews, they've spoken about ""the importance of making your privileges transparent in order to say something political."" And the great privilege of being the Knife in 2013 is having a platform-- they've earned a devoted audience ready to approach their wildest, most challenging and passionate vision with eager ears and an open mind. </p>
<p><i>Shaking the Habitual </i>is, inarguably, an achievement. It is the Knife's most political, ambitious, accomplished album, but in a strange way it also feels like its most personal: It provides a glimpse into the desires, intellectual enthusiasms and (unsurprisingly dense) reading list guiding one of music's most shadowy duos. At its most mesmerizing, its conceptual rigor and occasional inscrutability are overpowered by a disarming earnestness: It is a musical manifesto advocating for a better, fairer, weirder world. <i>Shaking the Habitual</i> feels not post-human but profoundly humanist, fueled by an unfashionable but profoundly refreshing faith in music's ability to hypnotize, to agitate, and to liberate-- to become, in Winterson's words, ""the high note that smashes the glass and spills the liquid.""</p></div>"|17847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/|8.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Too far-out for punk. <i>We're like the ultimate outsiders</i>, Alex Coxen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8704-milk-music/"">told this website</a> in the fall of 2011. That is not just a stoned interview quip from the frontman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30054-milk-music/"" target=""_blank"">Milk Music</a>, but rather a whole estranged state of artistic mind. These guys honed theirs at home in Olympia's freak scene-- a subterranean enclave of deep rock bands like Gun Outfit, Broken Water, Weird TV, Son Skull, Hysterics, Family Stoned (note that any or all may have broken up by now, Oly-style), groups with primitive web presences or none at all, mostly documented by <a href=""http://www.perennialdeath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one tiny label</a> and <a href=""http://nutsfanzine.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ink-stained, broadsheet zine</a>. Olympia's had one of the most fertile rock undergrounds in America as of late, with Milk Music its paradigm and heart.</p>
<p>On the surface, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/60-cruise-your-illusion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cruise Your Illusion </i></a>begs to be defined by time and place. But the hissy 1980s and 90s rock of Dino Jr. and SST that Milk Music's earliest layers of thrashing, burnt fuzz recalled are now gone. There's temptation to color Milk Music an Olympia band, and yet Coxen's rapturous electric guitar leads feel more like the sound of transcending wherever you might be. And while you want to point out how Coxen's strangled, gold-hearted wail and sky-kissing solos are studiously indebted to moonlit 60s classic rock, his approach is direct and ecstatic enough to sound new. The songs have got real, heartfelt groove.</p>
<p>Coxen is also a candid lyricist who variously conveys the piercing emotional vulnerability of country blues or a confrontational punk swagger. Of his most affecting themes are sincerity, a free mind, and a world that repeatedly turns on him. Coxen winks at a cop, steals a car with a deluded bandit, hangs on a falling star. He's performative in his role of the outlaw rock eccentric-- journeying, daydreaming, and dancing around declarations of his creative intent.</p>
<p>""No, Nothing, My Shelter"" is one of the best songs here-- a charming ode to Jimi and Elvis with a rock-as-saviour theme that goes for the vein of ""Rock and Roll"" or ""Hey Hey, My My"". It showcases delicate emotional heft and arresting imagery of a ""crushed velvet moon,"" as Coxen sings open-hearted of an uprooted, nomadic existence. ""I often grieve with Hendrix/ I often turn to the King/ In my suffering,"" he sings on one of <i>Cruise</i>'s most striking hooks. ""I've always been a dancing man/ To shelter the pain/ Whenever Jimi's playing."" This is endearing stuff, and it helps that Coxen maps shining guitar leads you want to lose yourself in.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Coxen's more of a bratty punk vagabond. ""Don't fuck with me, man/ I'm illegal and free,"" he demands on a charged anthem. It might come off as a bunch of talk if not for the fact that the music itself is unhinged and lawless. On ""New Lease on Love"" Coxen puts romantic lines alongside gutter slang, a recurring technique of juxtaposition from the school of Patti Smith. ""Cruising With God"", meanwhile, might be the record's most heartwarming song, carrying religious connotations appropriate for an off-the-grid guy who has clearly approached music as sacred. The entire first verse is a take-down of phony music journalists ""From <i>The L.A. Free</i>/ To the <i>NME</i>,"" who all love Milk Music. ""But even with the music on/ Baby you've got it all wrong,"" Coxen sings, confidently. ""You haven't danced in so long."" He lets out a shriek. It's sort of sweet. </p>
<p>Eight-minute closer ""The Final Scene"" is an astounding piece of music, with backwards guitar parts, subtle flecks of soft harmonica, and sharp melodies that are beautifully harmonized into something of a 1950s doo-wop burner. Coxen stretches out the raw urgency of his rasp and shades it, conveying skin-crawling melancholic feelings more so than specific thoughts-- he references Shiva's blissful dance, a laughing reaper, crumbling mountains, angels riding a moonlit hearse. It's grandiose and at times almost comically earnest, something you could picture Lee Hazlewood singing straight. But Coxen's howl is desperate and unguarded, the opposite of a cool-talker. The song feels half its length.</p>
<p><i>Cruise Your Illusion</i> holds its ground, but there are sociological elements to Milk Music's story that make the experience of the record even more fun. In June they're touring with comrade acts Merchandise (from Tampa, Fla.) and Destruction Unit (from Tempe, Ariz.), all three of whom came up on the American D.I.Y punk circuit and have been wary of breaking through to wider popularity. They've instead favored a Sonic Youth-style embrace of counterculture and expanded musical vocabularies, thus amassing cult followings on their own terms. It's a moment that reminds me of Simon Reynolds introducing the post-punk era in <i>Rip It Up and Start Again</i>; ""Young people have a biological right to be excited about the times they're living through,"" he wrote. Milk Music's message, ethos, and spirit speak well of our own.</p></div>"|17825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17825-milk-music-cruise-your-illusion/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

It isn’t until the penultimate track where IO Echo mention the city they’re actually from-- Los Angeles, and even then it’s a namedrop of Chinatown. By that point, you may have already pegged them as an L.A. band anyways. While the duo’s quick to flaunt both kotos and kimonos as signifiers of their self-coined “New Orientalism,” <i>Ministry of Love</i>’s neon-lit reveries of insatiable longing and gothic glamour conjure a romantic ideal of their homebase that translates to an outsider who only has bits and pieces of received pop culture wisdom: one that conflates Hollywood flash, the underworld echoes of Downtown and Echo Park's poor lil' rich kids to capture all the superficial allure of LA <i>noire </i>and LA nightlife. It’s everywhere but it’s never <i>there.</i></p>
<p>“Outsiders” and the title track are reprised from their 2012 teaser EP and if their bombast tipped you off to this being a band that was <a href=""http://sites.moca.org/thecurve/2012/07/12/smashbox-presents-play-moca/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meant for MOCA</a> from Day One as opposed to dingy indie clubs, you’ve heard correctly. Singer Ioanna Gika is the new face of the <a href=""http://www.dandymagazine.com.au/2012/10/the-ally-coalition/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">House of Holland</a> eyewear line and can be seen in <a href=""http://style.mtv.com/2012/12/10/io-echo-jeremy-scott-hologram-kimono-outsiders/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Scott kimonos</a>. Her partner Leopold Ross is the brother of Atticus, a collaborator of Trent Reznor. None of this <i>matters</i>, but at the same time, it’s tough to say it doesn’t <i>not </i>matter when most of <i>Ministry of Love </i>sounds like a product of its environment; i.e., a space where fashion and art have an air of inherent tragedy even if the drugs are trustworthy and everyone at least <i>knows </i>someone famous. It's New York without the grit or the public transportation.</p>
<p>Plus, even before releasing a full-length, they’ve opened for Nine Inch Nails, No Doubt, Bloc Party, Garbage, and Florence &amp; The Machine. Besides serving as an impressive C.V., it establishes boundaries for <i>Ministry of Love </i>by intimating what type of band could conceivably appeal to a fan of any of the aforementioned while doing nothing to outshine them. It’s not exactly shoegaze, though the guitars and synths often provide granular or gossamer texture rather than riffs. The sedated sex appeal of “Shanghai Girls” and “Addicted” kinda <i>feels </i>like electroclash even if the grand production never allows it the cold austerity, as the rhythms are often as affectless as Gika’s vocals. And it’s not exactly glam-pop or alt-rock or made-for-TV indie either, as they often forgo big choruses and legible emotions for frosted atmosphere and bruised poetry equally black and purple (“the bodies melt in shadowplay,” “Mr. H. waits for the impending tide/he's going to wear black gloves”). When the title track aspires to be a Florence-sized torch song, it’s still cooled off by Gika’s ice queen demeanor.</p>
<p>It all leads to <i>Ministry of Love </i>maintaining an admirable diversity, but until the startling, plainspoken confessions of closer “Eye Father”, we never got a sense of where IO Echo begin and their influences end. What initially sound like new directions become repositioning in a continuum; “When The Lilies Die” is the most immediate of their singles, with its whistled hook and tambourine shake subtly recasting “Walk Like An Egyptian” for their pan-Asian aesthetic. “Addicted” finds Gika looking for the perfect drug amidst sanitized, OSHA-approved industrial, while “Drag Love” is looking to <i>be </i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSLqeZzTU8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Perfect Drug”</a>, its jungle-esque breakbeat also owing more to Trent Reznor than Goldie. Out of the numerous<i> Ministry Of Love </i>songs that evoke “Fascination Street”, “Forget Me Not” actually nicks the bassline and “Ecstasy Ghost”'s proto-trip-hop<i> </i>drum patterns only remind you how IO Echo probably owes its entire existence to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6lxuYme-8c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hong Kong Garden”</a>.</p>
<p>In nearly all aspects, IO Echo arrive fully formed, but it comes at a cost-- they’re hardly alone in piquing the interest of both glossy mags and dull blogs alike by playing with the raw materials of Oriental pop, goth, and electronic rock. But when you compare them to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">CHVRCHES</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a>, you realize that all of those acts developed a distinct personality before they actually got a budget. Not that <i>Ministry of Love’s </i>spiffy production does it much good anyway; “Shanghai Girls” buckles under a tide of reverbed backwash, the overactive synths of “Tiananmen Square” make it sound like it was recorded in a pinball machine, and Gika’s vocals always sound bothered by some kind of panning effect. And so for all its merits, <i>Ministry of Love </i>does come off like something of a fashion victim, sounding expensive but uncomfortable, looking good but doing little to stand out.</p></div>"|17832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17832-io-echo-ministry-of-love/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Routinely dismissed as derivative mope rockers subsisting on the least interesting scraps of warmed-over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"" target=""_blank"">Ride</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">Stones</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/466-the-brian-jonestown-massacre/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Jonestown Massacre</a> records, BRMC make music as predictable as their look: black shirt, black leather jacket, black shades, pouty lips, downturned heads. What started out as a pose is now baked in; BRMC may lack the pedigree of a legacy rock band, but they certainly have the mileage.</p>
<p>On the group’s sixth studio effort, <i>Specter at the Feast</i>, BRMC make the transition from classic-rock pretenders to full-on classic rock. At this point, grizzled weariness comes naturally to the San Francisco trio. Like fellow trad-rock true believers the Black Crowes, Oasis, and Marah, BRMC have co-opted another era long enough that they actually <i>seem</i> like they’ve been around forever. For better or worse, you know what you’re going to get from a BRMC record, and that sort of brand engenders loyalty, no matter the latest fashion.</p>
<p>The downside of sticking around is that profound loss inevitably rears its head; for BRMC, this sad eventuality occurred in 2010, when the band’s producer and sound technician (and father to bassist Robert Levon Been) Michael Been died from a heart attack in the middle of a tour. <i>Specter at the Feast </i>was made in tribute to Been-- a journeyman rocker himself who fronted 80s AOR band the Call, whose populist anthem “Let the Day Begin” is probably spinning on some classic-rock station this very moment, between “Hot Blooded” and “Twilight Zone”. BRMC’s covers “Let the Day Begin” on <i>Specter</i>, and while it doesn’t quite fit with the band’s usual blacklit gloominess, it does square with their stubborn survivalist instinct. So long as there’s an audience for meat-and-potatoes rock songs like “Let the Day Begin”, there will be bands like BRMC.</p>
<p>If only BRMC’s “rock” songs lived up to their rock attitude. The central weakness of <i>Specter at the Feast </i>is rather inexplicable: Its goodness is inversely proportional to its loudness. Given the record’s somber inspiration, it’s understandable that the best tracks are the ballads. “Lullaby” is all heart-tugging jangle and dreamily descending guitar riffs, sparkling with the mournful beauty of a last encounter. On the haunted-house blues “Some Kind of Ghost”, Robert Been whispers, “Sweet lord, I’m coming home for good” over a funereal church organ. The valedictory vibe is even more pronounced on “Lose Yourself”, an exquisite symphony of sap that evokes the final minute of “With or Without You” as directed by Cameron Crowe.</p>
<p>The obviousness of <i>Specter </i>is forgivable on these songs; even the record’s <i>de rigueur</i> Spiritualized rip-off, “Sometimes the Light”, carries the weight of real grief. Where the record falters is on the rockers, which are composed of clichés and exhausted riffs <i>only</i>. The record’s saggy middle section is absolutely murder in this regard: The rubbery basslines, brassy cock-rock guitars and needlessly repetitive choruses of “Hate the Taste” and “Rival” are autopilot junk that pad what should be an intimate record with cavernous emptiness. (<i>Specter </i>supposedly was a planned double-LP; it really should be an EP.) What hurts <i>Specter </i>ultimately is that this band can’t get out of its own way. The requirements of making another rockin’ BRMC album choke what could’ve been an affecting, low-key detour. BRMC has experience on its side; if only it also had a little wisdom to share.</p></div>"|17752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17752-black-rebel-motorcycle-club-specter-at-the-feast/|5.1|Steven Hyden

The project took its wobbly first steps back in 1999, and with new compilation <i>From the Ashes of Nuclear Destruction</i>, Grind returns to his roots (not that he’s ever felt much need to stray too far). The album offers a hodgepodge of material dating back to 2003’s <i>Evil Never Dies</i> full-length and spanning nearly 15 years of splits, albums, EPs, and rarities, all wrapped up in a neat little package for those who’d prefer not to spend their days combing through trade lists in search of that four-way split with Vomitor, Bestial Mockery, and Nocturnal. </p>
<p>Grind has long been a star pupil in the school of no mosh, no core, no trends, and it’s no secret he's never been much of an innovator (though his music is a lot of fun). He’s said in interviews many, many times that his band is a studied reflection of his own obsession with old-school black metal, thrash, and punk, and dude doesn’t just wear his influences on his tattered denim sleeves; he may as well have invested in a English Dogs chestpiece and Venom throat tattoo for all the gleeful lack of modernity his songs show. </p>
<p>On this collection, he’s culled 22 tracks’ worth of rough, primitive blackthrash, D-Beat, speed metal, and just a little sleazy rock‘n’roll from his extensive catalogue, and thrown them to the wolves as both a gift to the diehards and a history lesson for the newbies. His gravelly yelp narrates tales of apocalyptic destruction and metal hell while nimble fingers tease out furious, effective thrash riffs and howling solos and sloppy D-Beats keep atomic time. Rudimentary exuberance explodes out of tracks like “Metal Attack” and “666” as “Suicide Eye” rolls through with a sly swagger, and even the demo versions of more recent songs like “Bitch” (off 2011’s<i> </i><i>Conjure and Command</i> LP) offer a tad more venom than their more polished end results. </p>
<p>The production values here are uneven at best (duh-- it is a compilation!), ranging from raw demos to a slightly-- <i>slightly</i>-- cleaner tone, but that only adds to its charm. If you want crystalline clarity, call up Stratovarius. This one’s for the heshers, the hellions, the unwashed, and the unworried. It may not be essential, but it’s one hell of an enjoyable listen, and deserves a spot next to Körgull the Exterminator and Speedwolf on your shopping list. </p>
<p>My only gripe? The omissions of the band’s excellent Venom, Bathory, and Bulldozer covers, though honestly, the songs jammed onto this disc come close enough to that same poisonous, tapped-out vein that you barely miss ‘em. Whilst Grind and his bandmates hole up in the studio and hammer away at their next LP, this compilation will do just fine to slake your thirst and, hopefully, remind you that it’s about time you dusted off that prized <i>In League With Satan</i> single from 81 and revisit past glories.</p></div>"|17897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17897-toxic-holocaust-from-the-ashes-of-nuclear-destruction/|6.6|Kim Kelly

The trio’s debut album, <i>(Strange Songs) In the Dark</i>, and its follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16918-children-of-desire/"" target=""_blank""><i>Children of Desire</i></a>, reproduced sounds of melancholy mainstays like the Cure and New Order on a basement punk’s budget. Cheeseball drum machines battered out metronomic rhythms and shimmering guitar hooks blurred into swampy, dub-inspired textures. But even though the music was dense and trippy, the vocals were clear and urgent. Singer Carson Cox delivered his lyrics in a naked, unschooled croon that was more than a little reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> during the early days of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>, minus the zeal for wordplay and Victorian poetry.</p>
<p>On their latest LP, <i>Totale Nite</i>-- which arrives via Night People, a go-to outlet for acts that split the difference between spooky and psychedelic, including early efforts by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"" target=""_blank"">Peaking Lights</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Beaches</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27869-pocahaunted/"" target=""_blank"">Pocahaunted</a>-- the band tighten up their blend of weirdo tones and emo conviction. Merchandise songs can skew long and most of the tracks on <i>Totale Nite</i> find the band stretching out. These aren’t noodle-heavy excursions, though. The songs are long for the same reason that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>' songs are long-- they’re meant to envelope and overtake the listener through repetition.</p>
<p>The album’s best tune, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14754-anxietys-door/"" target=""_blank"">Anxiety’s Door</a>”, flows along a programmed dance rhythm for upwards of seven minutes, swapping in swatches of acoustic and electric guitars between Cox’s plaintive hoots. The song is memorable, in part, because its arrangement is eerily familiar, an echo of the Smiths' “The Headmaster Ritual”, embellished with heaps of psychic jewelry. The title track is looser, weirder, and longer, with Cox competing against blaring saxophones and washes of white noise for sonic real estate. The shrill sounds and long duration (10-minutes) make the song a more demanding listen than “Anxiety's Door”, but it's also a more complete display of the band's weird chemistry. Merchandise's take on pop works with extremes-- tweaking out hardcore kids with fey vocals and ethereal audio gook and then blasting the tamer ears with hi-frequency screeching.</p>
<p>It's only when the tempos start to slow down, like on the ambient ballad ""I'll Be Gone"", that the LP drags a little. There are still plenty of places for Cox to hide in Merchandise's music-- delay swells, blasts of noise, bottomless reservoirs of reverb-- he just never takes the opportunity. However, when the music gears down, he could stand to step a little further into the background.</p>
<p>In interviews, the members of Merchandise-- Cox and guitarist Dave Vassalotti in particular-- have laid out an earnest, if sometimes convoluted, series of principles that guide their music making. When they can, they prefer to play non-traditional venues. They are heavily devoted to their local music community and suspicious of the business practices of larger independent labels.<i> Children of Desire</i> was a well-loved record and, had the band been interested, a more mainstream-minded imprint might have stepped up to release <i>Totale Nite</i>. But so far, they've made good on their ambitions to stay off of the indie-rock cowpath.</p>
<p>Though Merchandise’s music is sonically distant from the band's hardcore pedigree, it places a similar premium on the projection of honesty and unguarded emotions. On <i>Totale Nite</i>, they manage to use small-scale elements-- jangling guitars, cheapo drum machines, toy keyboards-- to project the urgency of bands with louder screams and bigger amps.</p></div>"|17895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17895-merchandise-totale-nite/|8.0|Aaron Leitko

Ferraro has released an extraordinary amount of material since 2004, but you can divide his career into two parts, with 2011's solo album <i>Far Side Virtual </i>as the turning point. As half of noise and drone duo the Skaters and altered tape constructivists Lamborghini Crystal, he enjoyed wide acclaim, but <i>Far Side Virtual </i>saw him equally dismissed as a charlatan and lauded as a visionary.</p>
<p>Talking about <i>FSV</i> in an interview with <i>The Wire</i>, Ferraro called it “an opera for our consumption civilization.” In his work since, it became apparent that Ferraro's interest in the representation of capitalism coincided with a preoccupation with some of its most prestigious and powerful manifestations: namely modern hip-hop. <i>Inhale C-4 $$$$$$$</i>, a mixtape released under the alias Bebetune$ that swiftly followed <i>FSV</i>, and <i>Silica Gel</i>, released in 2012 as Bodyguard, made this clear. By the time Ferraro got to <i>Sushi</i> at the end of 2012, a physical release under his own name, the shapeshift was complete. He had reached a unique and beguiling electronic body music heavily informed by commercial R&amp;B and hip-hop, but somehow contained in his own <a href=""http://dummymag.com/features/2012/07/13/distroid-gatekeeper-fatima-al-qadiri-adam-harper/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">distroid</a> soundworld.</p>
<p>With new mixtape <i>Cold</i>, that restless creativity remains in forward motion. Ferraro's consistency lies mostly in his ability to confound, a disconnect of simultaneous banality and profundity that has threaded through his output more clearly than any allegiance to a particular sound or genre. For example, one of the most obvious shifts on <i>Cold</i> is his singing. It's on almost every track-- you can't have R&amp;B without it, right? He still doesn't sing very well, but while occasionally painful, the Auto-Tuned balladry is fascinating in its oddness. This style of vocal is almost always reserved for professionals, and hearing Ferraro's amateur but earnest attempts are endearing. Not unlike his pre-<i>FSV</i> solo period when he made an aesthetic out of the hyper-compressed sound of poor bitrate mp3s, it's almost as if he gets a kick out of doing things he knows he shouldn't, upending clearly defined and accepted notions of taste.</p>
<p>The production, on the other hand, is accomplished-- and unusual. One pleasure of the record is the moments<i> </i>where his instinctive, unquantized, sensual funk materializes. Another is in its weird samples: a single coin falling to the floor, what sounds like a sword being drawn from a scabbard, the muffled unintelligibility of distorted voices in the background, digital rain-- all of those appear on “Slave to the Rain”, topped by lyrics like, <i>“Wanna have babies/ And you shower them in cash.” </i>Some might be tempted to compare it to the tongue-in-cheek pop of HD Boyz, but that would be unfair: that <a href=""http://dismagazine.com/dystopia/22132/hdboyz-the-boyz-defined/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dis Magazine</i>-fueled project</a> was never sincere, and featured experimental artists aping the mainstream. But here this essentially experimental artist clearly manifests mainstream influences.</p>
<p>If the text on the press release for this mixtape (“Cold is the repetition and consumption of hedonism that cannot represent or replace one night of love... Cold outlines the human drama in a nihilistic era."") is taken at face value, Ferraro is still pondering the affect of capitalism. But his interests have been redirected musically,and he touches on the restless groove of two-step, bass swells of dubstep, the tightly sequenced synths of techno, dive-bar lounge blues, and symphonic string arrangements. And while he doesn't really flaunt the <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/2012/07/12/adam-harper-vaporwave/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vaporwave</a> sound he practically gave birth to with <i>FSV</i>, he does acknowledge it, even going so far as to call a song “Vapor Weight”. But the point with James Ferraro isn't so much that he's constantly switching genres. It's more that he's actually inventing them as he goes along, or changing them so much they become reinvented. Hypnagogic pop, vaporwave, distroid-- he's had a crucial role in them all. Within his sphere, Ferraro is one of the most important artists of his generation though, as <i>Cold </i>demonstrates, it's hard to get a handle on his career from any single release.</p></div>"|17858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17858-james-ferraro-cold/|7.2|Lisa Blanning

Enduring homelessness, extreme illness and the murder of his brother (all of which are outlined in the festival circuit documentary <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125467/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Charles Bradley: Soul of America</i></a>), Bradley came with a marketable narrative and a dynamic stage presence. Most importantly, his voice gives Daptone’s house musicians a leading man who can channel not just Brown, but Otis Redding, Al Green, and Teddy Pendergrass to boot.</p>
<p>To both Bradley and Daptone’s credit, the singer’s first album, <i>No Time for Dreaming, </i>didn't cash in on his distressing life story, but world-weariness did seep into his songwriting. It was as though harsh life lessons had taught Bradley not to expect a great deal from his apparent ""big break."" The love songs weren’t so much passionate romantic odes as they were desperate declarations of reliance, while the record’s marquee song, “Why Is It So Hard”, offered a cold flipside to the American dream. But what a voice. This wasn’t revivalism for revivalisms sake (a sneer sometimes made at Daptone), but a collection of songs sung with earnestness and authority that it trumped any such criticism. </p>
<p>Two years on, <i>Victim of Love</i> is a more optimistic record, from the Motown-inspired catchy pop-soul number “You Put the Flame on It” to the gorgeous “Through the Storm”, a quiet elegy to bury his past traumas. But these fuzzy moments are offset by new forays into more coarse instrumentation. “You Put the Fame on It” aside, producer Thomas Brenneck<i> </i>pushes his artist from the 1960s into more 70s R&amp;B than he’s previously been accustomed to. Think Curtis Mayfield’s transition from the swinging doo-wop of the Impressions to his solo, psychedelic blues of the early 70s. “Hurricane” trods much the same path as “Freddy’s Dead”, albeit replacing Mayfield’s drugged out nightmare with an environmental warning, while his handprint is all over the sizzling funk workout “Confusion”. Elsewhere, “Strictly Reserved For You” could easily slide into Al Green’s golden 1972-1975 run, and the chipped guitar lines that recall his great collaborator “Teenie” Hodges are matched with some fuzzy Sly Stone-esque axe. </p>
<p>But <i>Victim of Love</i> is ultimately a less successful record than <i>No Time for Dreaming</i>. For one, Bradley seems less connected with this set. “Love Bug Blues” offers him some blaxplotiation-style cool to ride on-- all nasty guitar lines, fluttering jazz flutes, and forceful horn stabs-- but the lyrics uncomfortably cast him as a horny singleton who has caught glimpse of a potential new conquest. His major flaw, however, has been and continues to be his lack of ability to interact with his band. At times, like on overwrought ballad “Let Love Stand a Chance"", he sounds completely detached from what’s going on around him, as if he cut his vocal a capella in studio far away from his collaborators. This isn’t helped by Brenneck, who turns Bradley’s voice way up in the mix. Considering the singer’s sheer power it’s sometimes an imbalance. For example, the title track is a bare acoustic jam only backed up with some soft background “oohs” and “ahs”, yet Bradley attacks the arrangement with full speed gusto and his potent voice begins to overwhelm. </p>
<p>These blemishes underline that Bradley is still something of a novice to professional recording and requires guidance to funnel his talents onto wax. That’s the job of Brenneck and the Daptone hierarchy, who are probably calling the shots when it comes to his evolving sound. But Bradley has a rare gift of being a singer worth hearing regardless of the material, and this alone is worth the price of admission.</p></div>"|17936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17936-charles-bradley-victim-of-love/|6.8|Dean Van Nguyen

In 1955, button-down American composers like Walter Schumann and Art Ferrante and Lou Teicher were already astral-projecting the sounds of Earth onto space, the former via <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/exploring-the-unknown-mw0000446825"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">strange chorale compositions</a>, the latter <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/soundproof-mw0001355503"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">via John Cage’s prepared piano tones</a>. But post-Sputnik, musical minds achieved their own sort of lift-off: Juan Garcia Esquivel’s exotica miniatures evolved into space age bachelor pad music and the sparkling piano jazz compositions of Chicago-based pianist Herman Blount were credited instead to his Saturn-based alter ego, Sun Ra. And in London, an audio engineer named Joe Meek heard a new world.</p>
<p>By the time Sputnik touched outer space, Meek had already ascended to the top of the charts. According to Barry Cleveland’s book <i>Joe Meek’s Bold Techniques</i>, Meek was the first UK producer to deploy overdubbing, compression, spring reverb, flange, and tape loops to studio recordings. Yet due to his schizophrenic nature, business fall-outs and fights led to Meek recording in his own flat rather than a professional studio, where his eccentric ways began to deepen. Inspired by the day’s headlines, Meek began to conceive of a concept album “to create a picture in music of what could be up there in outer space.” And yet how to evoke the alien and the unknown with only terrestrial instrumentation rendered by humans?</p>
<p>That the sound of a strange sonic world was created from the basic building blocks of a hack skiffle band recorded in his home studio, remains as remarkable a feat as your deadbeat roommate sending a rocket made out of beer cans to the moon. Legend has it that Meek used everything lying about, even the proverbial kitchen sink, recording and rendering the sound of blowing bubbles with a straw, using milk bottles as percussion and a draining sink to capture some of these sounds. There are few 20th century musical genres as odious as skiffle, but Meek set about deconstructing such pap: Traces of things like Hawaiian lap steel, tacky pianos, stiff drumming, maracas, wordless vocal harmonizing, and country guitar licks abound, yet Meek makes the quotidian sound extraterrestrial.</p>
<p>Rather than record all the performers playing together in real time as was de rigueur of the era, Joe Meek isolated instrumentation and treated everything from guitars to voices to a battery of echo, reverb, and other homemade electronic noise-making devices, distorting and distending sound until something strange and new was achieved, his end results much more than the sum of its parts. <i>I Hear a New World</i> remains the paragon for such producer-made music (think dub reggae, Brian Eno, Timbaland, etc.), nevermind that it was barely heard within that era or in Meek’s lifetime. Originally conceived as a demonstration of stereo sound in the mono era, an EP in an edition of 99 copies circulated in 1960, while a second EP had sleeves printed, but no music. Only in the grunge era (1991) did a fully-formed version of <i>I Hear a New World</i> come to earth.</p>
<p>Twenty plus years after first hearing it, via this vinyl reissue, <i>I Hear a New World</i> still sounds surreal, an alternate universe that infiltrated our own. The opening title track remains a strange hybrid, a pop confection with exotica backdrop, yet with the croon of singer Rod Freeman overlaid with sped-up harmonizing vocals. Yes, the seeds of future pop juggernauts like Alvin and the Chipmunks and Kanye West lie within this world. One can also hear the sort of musical mischief and awe-inspiring noises concocted by the likes of Nurse With Wound’s Steve Stapleton, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">St. Etienne</a>, as well as folks who later on covered the title track, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4753-television-personalities/"" target=""_blank"">Television Personalities</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4208-they-might-be-giants/"" target=""_blank"">They Might Be Giants</a>. The gurgling noises that open “Entry Of The Globbots” could easily come from 21st century laptop musicians, even if it does devolve into martial drums and more of those damned chipmunk chortles. Same goes for the crunching noise that turns into a pedal-steel ditty, “Magnetic Field”.</p>
<p>While there was bright moment of pop success in a Meek-produced novelty to come in 1962’s hit “Telstar”, the rest of Meek’s life was tragic, ultimately coming to an end in 1967 when he murdered his landlady with a shotgun and then turned the barrel upon himself. By then he had already cussed out fellow producer Phil Spector, accused a record label of planting microphones in his wallpaper to steal his ideas, and turned down the opportunities to work with a then-unknown David Bowie, the Beatles, and Rod Stewart. And yet the notion of the bedroom producer was born in <a href=""http://openplaques.org/plaques/1755"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that flat off Holloway Road</a>, a quirky cosmic yet personal sound that flows through the likes of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank""> Sir Paul McCartney</a> (circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15536-mccartney-mccartney-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>McCartney II</i></a>), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, et al., all of them releasing a similar sort of music that harkens back to this strange new world.</p></div>"|17864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17864-joe-meek-i-hear-a-new-world/|8.3|Andy Beta

Their music carries both a professional air and world-weary rasp, an impression that’s borne out of the group’s credentials, and overlapping lives, as journeyman veterans of NYC’s massive music scene for the better part a decade. The genesis for Caveman was catalyzed by the almost synchronized dissolutions of its member’s former bands, remembered now only with ghostly MySpace portals: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thesubjects"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">The Subjects</a> (lead singer/multi-instrumentalist Matthew Iwanusa and guitarist Jimmy “Cobra” Carbonetti), <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/whiteclam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">White Clam</a> (keyboardist Sam Hopkins), <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theendoftheworld"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">The End of the World</a> (drummer Stefan Marolachakis), and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/elefant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Elefant</a> (bassist Jeff Berrall).</p>
<p>They watched their former musical projects run their course and run out of steam, and slowly drifted toward each other as friends hanging out in Carbonetti’s <a href=""http://cobraguitars.com/contact/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">custom guitar shop</a> in the East Village, eventually realizing they wanted to get on with it as a band. They self-released their debut <i>CoCo Beware</i> in 2011 and toured behind an album of competent indie folk with weird proggy flourishes and surprisingly tight four-part harmonies. It was tentative in some instances and looser in others; more of an early blueprint than anything else. <i>CoCo</i> was then snatched up by Fat Possum, and when the band found themselves ready to put together their self-titled sophomore release, they were armed with the chemistry built from sharing a stage for two straight years.</p>
<p>Holed up in Iwanusa’s grandmother’s New Hampshire barnhouse, they began to work through ideas in long jam sessions, cultivating and tweaking a folksy post-rock template that’s reliant on nuanced interplay between the band members. The result is <i>Caveman</i>, a sophomore album that embraces the spacey expanses and mournful, low-key melodies only hinted at on their debut<i></i>. Gone is the straightforward thump of songs like “My Time” or the placid alt-country of “Old Friend”, replaced by stranger, more confident experiments like the lurching, ethereal “Over My Head” or the<i> Nebraska</i>-echoing “I See You”.</p>
<p>The group hasn’t rebuilt their aesthetic completely, but they are changing the way they communicate it, and the way they communicate with each other from song to song. Their rich, Brian Wilson harmonies are deployed in unexpected places, and are more haunting and reserved than uplifting. “Where’s the Time”, a bass line gurgling, syncopated slow burn that eventually blossoms into a cacophony of ambient textures and a psyched-up guitar solo, uses those harmonies to underline a chorus that’s oddly selfish and detached: “Where’s the time to waste on someone else’s life.” The fragile, atmospheric folk of opener “Strange to Suffer”, and it’s album closing counterpart “Strange”, has the group harmonizing with almost-falsettos in a way that resembles chanting monks attempting a seance, repeating the song’s only line just twice: “Strange to suffer, why do these people turn away.”</p>
<p>But for all those instances of heady explorations, there’s a lingering feeling that they are still hesitant to really kick down the doors of their songwriting confinements. A track like “Pricey"", with that incredible, stalking guitar riff that could have been teleported here from Pink Floyd’s <i>Meddle</i>, tries to be a dark, prog-inflected opus, but lurches around listlessly with pedestrian vocal parts from the usually stellar Iwanusa. Likewise, the brightly colored neon of more widely used synthesizers doesn’t always gel effectively with band’s usually sterling, rock-based musicianship, propelling some tracks to the stratosphere-- the gliding luxury of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14863-in-the-city/"" target=""_blank"">In the City</a>”, for example-- while leaving others with a garish accent mark (“The Big Push”) on an already drab composition.</p>
<p>Regardless, <i>Caveman</i> isn’t short on efforts to move the band’s sound into uncharted territories. It's <i> </i>the first release for the band as an “all in” musical endeavor and it definitely feels that way. In an age where so many group’s are driven by a sole songwriter/creative force, it’s exhilarating to hear an album that’s almost stubbornly democratic, the confidence that the members of Caveman possess in one another being their most prized asset.</p></div>"|17901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17901-caveman-caveman/|7.0|Patrick Bowman

It effectively split the Flaming Lips into two bands. On the one hand, you have the merry pranksters that have remained a constant in music-new feeds for the past decade, whether they’re <a href=""http://www.mobypicture.com/user/waynecoyne/view/11824605"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doing rails with Ke$ha</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46765-erykah-badu-is-super-pissed-at-the-flaming-lips-right-now-about-that-nsfw-video/"" target=""_blank"">beefing with Erykah Badu</a>, or taking the concept of a physical album release to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46404-flaming-lips-blood-vinyl-10-copies-2500-features-keha-erykah-badu-nick-cave-chris-martin-blood/"" target=""_blank"">literal extremes</a>. And then the other, you have a band that, over the past few years, has entered the most fiercely experimental, stridently anti-pop phase of its long and storied career. It’s just that the former aspect inevitably overshadows the latter-- even on the tours for 2009’s dark, disorienting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Embryonic</i></a>, volcanic salvos like “Worm Mountain” and “See the Leaves” simply got subsumed into the Lips’ usual onstage circus and became the backing soundtrack to more bunny-costume dances.</p>
<p>But with <i>The Terror</i>, the Lips take the bold step of bursting their own bubble. The band’s unrelentlingly bleak new album relates to its predecessor much as <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</i> did to <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>, retaining its antecedent’s weighty mood but deconstructing the instrumental bombast into more skeletal, mechanical forms. For all its claustrophobic tension, <i>Embryonic</i> still offered much in the way of thunderous rock catharsis; <i>The Terror</i> presents no such salve, drowning its meditative, melancholic melodies in a suffocating, smoggy haze of buzzing synth frequencies, with little rhythmic release. The first song may be called “Look… The Sun is Rising”, but it’s less cheery proclamation than grave warning, its stuttering drum beat and dentist-drill shocks conjuring ominous images of a not-too-distant future where the mere act of going outside will require the use of a gas mask and protective suit. </p>
<p>Tellingly, <i>The Terror</i> has resulted in a complete rethink of the Lips’ stage spectacle, one designed to disorient rather than delight. Last month at South by Southwest, the band <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmB9mvgRbr8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previewed the album in its entirety at Austin’s Auditorium Shores</a> with a set-up that deemphasized Coyne’s usual carnival-barker cheerleading in favour of an all-out video-screen sensory assault (and random acts of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ipz7hQ024"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hair-pulling</a>), the singer held in place by a custom-made synthesizer molded into a baby doll sprouting massive tentacles that extended to the stage’s backdrop. Naturally, a set of unfamiliar, unremittingly gloomy material didn’t make for ideal Friday-night entertainment for many of the 30,000 in attendance, but Coyne’s static position onstage is a fitting visual metaphor for his performance on the record.</p>
<p>Where <i>Embryonic</i> played on themes of environmental destruction, <i>The Terror</i> deals in more personal turmoil-- loneliness, depression, anxiety. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the album was preceded by news of Coyne’s separation from his partner of 25 years, Michelle, and of multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd relapsing temporarily.) Accordingly, Coyne spends the record singing like someone who’s strapped to a hospital bed, often resorting to a cautious sing-speak or fragile falsetto as if too beaten down to muster up the strength for anything more. (Or maybe it’s a vocal-eroding side effect of being the most chatty, gregarious frontman in rock.) Even when unleashing an invective like “You’ve got a lot of nerve/ A lot of nerve to fuck with me,” his voice remains eerily emotionless, relying on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17294-vicious-lies-and-dangerous-rumors/"" target=""_blank"">duet partner du jour</a> Sarah Barthel of Phantogram to give the line extra bite. </p>
<p>In light of Coyne’s more muted presence here, the real drama on <i>The Terror</i> stems from the way in which the Lips layer their tones and drones into heady, hypnotic surges. <i>The Terror</i> may be the Flaming Lips' most demanding album to date, but it’s also the most sonically of a piece, immediately thrusting you into its dense miasma and seamlessly dissolving one track into one another; in the transition from the despairing “You Are Alone” into the spectacular percussive procession “Butterfly, How Long It Takes to Die”, you hear the same quiet-to-clamor fluidity that Liars mastered on <i>Drum’s Not Dead</i>. And from the desolate post-apocalyptic atmosphere, some powerfully affecting moments emerge, like “Try to Explain”, a beautifully bruised break-up ballad that romanticizes the past while defeatedly acknowledging that things will never be the same. </p>
<p>But if <i>The Terror</i> presents a distillation and refinement of ideas initially explored on their post-<i>Embryonic</i> interim releases-- like last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16522-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heady Fwends</i></a> collaborations and their infamous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtiVedrPIOE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hours-long jams</a>-- it still feels underdeveloped in spots. At 13 minutes, centerpiece track “You Lust” is the longest song to appear on a proper Lips record since the 1980s, and a companion piece to <i>Embryonic</i>’s “Powerless”, using a coolly repetitive organ refrain as the foundation for an agitated, free-form synth freakout. But its imposing grandeur is diffused by an intrusive, creepily whispered chorus incantation and a drifting, protracted denouement that lingers for far too long. And in the wake of the absorbing, slow-roiling intensity of the penultimate “Turning Violent”, the closing “Always There... In Our Heart” (a bookend echo of “Look… The Sun Is Rising”) doesn’t quite deliver the blown-out grand finale its repeated 1-2-3-4 build-ups suggest, instead simmering down before reaching full blast. (Seemingly aware of this anti-climax, the band tack on the incongruently cheery Hyundai-ad jingle “Sun Blows Up Today” and an Edward Sharpe-assisted cover of ""All You Need Is Love"" as bonus tracks, a move that feels not unlike appending a gag outtakes reel to a film’s closing credits.) But even if it doesn’t consistently exhilarate to the same extent as the band’s most totemic works, <i>The Terror</i> is nonetheless a significant work in their voluminous canon: By matching their ever-evolving, exploratory musical ethos with less eager-to-please, more confrontational modes of performance, the album marks the moment when the Flaming Lips become whole again.</p></div>"|17804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/|7.8|Stuart Berman

The proto-blog platform Livejournal, for instance, is a ghost town today. Try to revisit a deleted past life there and you’ll likely be confronted with a crying goat informing you that the account, and all of its entries, have been capital-P purged. Never to be recovered. Resurrecting those pages would mean unearthing legions of fans of the Los Angeles indie-folk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"" target=""_blank"">Rilo Kiley</a>, whose final album was released in 2007. Rilo Kiley's frontwoman and former child star <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"" target=""_blank"">Jenny Lewis</a> was, to my memory, a spiritual guide for one subset of the Livejournal community, who'd plaster her lyrics on their entries and profile pages with Belieber-like devotion. I think of Rilo Kiley and Livejournal the way some people think of Tila Tequila and MySpace.</p>
<p>Traces of that intense Rilo Kiley fandom pop up in unexpected places today. Like the arm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"" target=""_blank"">Waxahatchee</a>’s Katie Crutchfield, which is inked with the glum charcoal drawing found on the cover of the band’s 2002 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Execution of All Things</i></a>. “I’ve listened to that record so many times. [Jenny Lewis] was a perfect influence then,” Crutchfield said in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9045-waxahatchee/"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</a>. “Rilo Kiley is obviously an indie rock band, but she sings like a real singer, which is how I always tried to sing, too.” Rilo Kiley stopped making music in 2007, and the memory of their heyday has faded to a dull flicker. But Jenny Lewis can be found in the DNA of many millennial musicians-- women in particular-- making confessional indie-rock today. When Crutchfield sings: “I don’t care if I’m too young to be unhappy,” you might think of the former child star, who told the world at age 25: “You say I choose sadness/ That it never once has chosen me/ Maybe you’re right.” Exploring old-but-new Rilo Kiley material can feel like connecting vital dots in recent history.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of unheard Rilo Kiley material out there: Sennett and Lewis reportedly wrote 60 songs together in the late 90s, before they even formed a band or a romantic relationship. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/"" target=""_blank""><i>rkives</i></a> is a full-sounding collection that reads like a long-lost Rilo Kiley album from the early-2000s, a fact that will satisfy the many fans maddened by their late-career stab at the mainstream, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10555-under-the-blacklight/"" target=""_blank""><i>Under the Blacklight</i></a>. The archive, which is out on bassist Pierre de Reeder’s tiny label, tells a story of the group before Lewis got an expensive haircut, before their music played in scenes of “Gossip Girl” and “Grey’s Anatomy”, before they signed to Warner Bros., before Ben Gibbard and Zooey Deschanel broke up (or even <i>met</i>). Before we collectively shuttered our Livejournals. The only thing that jolts you back into present-day is rapper Too $hort’s voice on a remix of the strident dance-pop track “Dejalo”, from <i>Under the Blacklight</i>. It's an outlier, and a reminder that newly recorded Rilo Kiley music is exciting in theory but would probably be peculiar and unlistenable in practice.</p>
<p>The majority of the 16 tracks have never been heard before, but their tone will feel familiar. “All the trips that take you there/ All the little white pills that you take will get you there/ All the compliments that you take, they will get you there,” Lewis reels off (she often narrates her woes in lists) on “It’ll Get You There”, a song that could very well serve as the companion piece to the beloved 2002 depressive anthem “A Better Son/Daughter”. There’s enough screaming and argyle-sweater sadness to date Rilo Kiley as an occasional emo band, but plenty of twang to reinforce the bridge they built to indie-folk land. There are uneasy love letters to Los Angeles that sound like they were composed in Nashville, and housewifely misery of Betty Draper proportions (“No one escapes their <i>liiii</i>-iiiifffee!”, small children chant on “American Wife”.) There is Jenny Lewis, just as you remember her.</p>
<p>And there is Blake Sennett, guitarist and subject of many of Lewis’s doleful lyrics, just as you remember him. Lewis told <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=mCQFHMhVuA8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=%22I%E2%80%99m+going+to+get+him+with+these+lyrics,+and+he%E2%80%99s+not+going+to+know%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f5TKm5h6D8&amp;sig=2V0NtNEc-xH1P1SPJXYUXQx2_Ys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2F9cUY2JDIXk4APD3YGABw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%E2%80%99m%20going%20to%20get%20him%20with%20these%20lyrics%2C%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20not%20going%20to%20know%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>SPIN</i> in 2007 </a>that after the pair split six years earlier, she’d thought to herself: ""I’m going to get him with these lyrics, and he’s not going to know. It will be a little secret every night on the road."" Sennett eventually took on a reputation-- unfairly, perhaps-- as a wet blanket of a sideman, preoccupied with his own creative ambitions and bitter about the division of attention among the band’s members. He eventually pulled the plug on the group after their ill-fated final record, explaining later in an interview that he’d ""felt like there was a lot of deception, disloyalty, greed”... things he “didn’t want to submit himself to.” Lewis’ (albeit minor) success as a solo artist likely salted the wound. “She’s meteoric and I’m... mediocre?” Sennett once confessed. He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>That whimpering persona translates especially harshly on <i>rkives</i>, which features a handful of tracks he sung. It's almost as though those songs, like the limp relationship post-mortem “Well, You Left”, were added to the collection to show how uniquely appealing Lewis was, to underscore her role as the heart and soul of the project. His voice is deeply, painfully unlikeable. In many ways, the gulf between Lewis and Sennett has become the gulf between Lewis and many of her most adored indie-folk classmates, whose music can sound meek or stale in retrospect. Next to Sennett’s crude whine, Colin Meloy’s overwrought attempts at poeticism, Ben Gibbard’s pallidness or Conor Oberst’s drunken antics, Lewis’ pain sounds downright lovely, her despair dignified.</p>
<p>Lewis’ pain and despair have always been unique forces, packaged in cunning ways. Six years removed from the band’s last proper studio album, <i>rkives</i> is a lens that magnifies the darkness of Rilo Kiley’s catalogue. Like their debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6787-take-offs-and-landings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Take Offs and Landings</i></a> and its follow-up <i>The Execution of All Things</i>, the collection relies on deceptively precious instrumentation and cutesy pop-folk hues to mask-- but ultimately, to highlight-- the sinister core of the lyrics. “The Frug”, a beloved early recording that appeared in a Christina Ricci movie, is perhaps the most darling Rilo Kiley have ever sounded-- but it’s a depressive tale masquerading as a cutesy dance diddy. “I can take my clothes off/ I cannot fall in love/ You’ll never see my eyes,” she says, once again with the lists. “I cannot do the smurf/ I cannot fall in love/ I’ll never fall in love.” Rilo Kiley songs are often like Edward Gorey stories-- they’re aesthetically dainty enough for children, but someone always dies tragically or has her heart broken at the end of the day. It's an appealing dichotomy that carved out a special niche for the band: Jenny Lewis proved that you can be a female singer-songwriter in the brutal, self-lacerating tradition of Liz Phair or Fiona Apple and an avatar for the arts-and-crafty Urban Outfitters set at the same time.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Today the burden of that dichotomy sits most squarely on the shoulders of Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, an artist openly indebted to the music of Rilo Kiley. When Best Coast's music began to circulate in 2009 and 2010, it sounded uncannily familar-- like the lovelorn Los Angeles ballads of a girl whose music I'd learned about through Livejournal. It turned out I'd been listening to Cosentino since our respective high school days, when she'd upload acoustic tracks under the name Bethany Sharayah. I liked it because it sounded like Rilo Kiley. ""When I grow up I know that I will be something special/ And the people will know my face/ And call me by my legal name,"" she sung on one called ""The War of Copy"", mapping out her own trajectory. Cosentino, I learned, never deleted <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=bestshoeson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her Livejournal page</a>, even once she became one of the biggest names in popular indie music, worked with Jon Brion or launched a campaign for Urban Outfitters. There she is, still with a bio that reads, ""It's hard to celebrate with a headache"", still a member of a Rilo Kiley fan community. </p></div>"|17827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17827-rilo-kiley-rkives/|7.4|Carrie Battan

Common story, except Fogarino is best known as the drummer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"" target=""_blank"">Interpol</a>, a band who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8995-interpol/"">in their own words</a> owe their success to the serendipitous combination of four people with complementary strengths and weaknesses. Daniel Kessler wasn’t much of a singer, but had an innate gift for sonorous guitar layering and handling the day-to-day business affairs of a band. Carlos Dengler had little interest in that, though his scything basslines and flamboyant public persona would become equally definitive for Interpol. Meanwhile, Paul Banks made the crucial shift from emotive singer-songwriter to cryptic shouter-seducer by tailoring his voice to the physical limitations of the band’s cramped New York rehearsal space. The final addition of Fogarino <i>really </i>put things in motion; nearly a decade older than the rest of the band, he brought an inimitable instrumental swagger as well as a necessary veteran presence and the enthusiasm of a rock n’ roll lifer who finally found his dream job. He’d been a consummate team player in the years since, so if taking the frontman role in 2013 feels as jarring as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5914-paul-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Banks</a> making a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17708-everybody-on-my-dick-like-they-supposed-to-be/"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop mixtape</a>, unfortunately, the results aren’t much better.</p>
<p>Safe to say the one thing <i>snakes/vultures/sulfate </i>has in common with <i>Everyone on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be</i> is its defining flaw: you can’t doubt the zeal or sincerity of its creator, but this new setting requires an entirely different skill set than the one they’ve established, and there's almost no transferral between the two. The combination leads to, at best, a white-knuckle grasp on competency. While spirited punk incompetency might’ve been preferable in hindsight, any band that features Fogarino on drums is at least guaranteed to <i>sound</i> professional, and would be similarly lucky to have anyone else here involved-- Fogarino enlisted the help of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus Lizard</a>’s Duane Denison and Interpol touring member Brandon Curtis, formerly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27524-the-secret-machines/"" target=""_blank"">the Secret Machines</a>, one of the few mainstream bands that could match Interpol’s mighty low end in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>And yet, the trio unlearns everything that distinguished them as instrumentalists on <i>snakes,</i> ending up with something that’s more entertaining when seen as a potential document of alternate history. It’s very easy to envision EmptyMansions as a band that might have been hastily slapped together right after the Jesus Lizard's <i>Shot </i>flopped and before Curtis and Fogarino found their own success. It sounds<i> </i>like radio-ready alt-rock ca. 1996-- so, post-grunge. Which means in practice, it’s nothing but craggy vocals, meaty riffs served medium-well, plodding rhythms, implicit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> worship and explicit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a> worship; it ends with a cover of “Down by the River” all of things. Besides hooks or any sort of spark, all that’s missing is a one-album record deal with DGC and an ill-fated tour with the Toadies.</p>
<p>That these three guys can’t even come up with any memorable instrumental moments is baffling enough, but the musical basis for EmptyMansions aims low as if that's the only difficulty level Fogarino can handle as a singer right now. He doesn’t make a total faceplant, though the dominant emotion I get from listening to <i>snakes </i>is empathy. You might feel similarly if you’ve ever tried to write songs and quickly realized your inability to perform them. All eight tracks on <i>snakes </i>find Fogarino using a newbie’s cheat codes on the mic: When it’s audible, he affects a Frank Black drawl (“That Man” actually namedrops him) that’s ostensibly meant to add intrigue to otherwise placeholder lines, but more often serves as a way to avoid committing to the demands of melody. Listening to the off-key chorus of “Lyra”, it’s easy to see why he’d go that route. Otherwise, Fogarino cloaks himself with flange effects or simply buries himself in the mix so the song that’s supposedly inspired by <i>Justified </i>(“Up in the Holler”)<i> </i>is interchangeable with the one that takes its cues from Hubert Selby, Jr. (""Sulfate"") or the one that was written by another man nearly four decades ago. </p>
<p>While Fogarino’s tentative performance spares him embarrassment, you wonder why he’s holding back when the mere act of releasing this record is ballsy as hell. At this juncture, making <i>snakes </i>was likely its own reward and it’s hard to imagine Fogarino plotting a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a>-style exit strategy. But in a strange way, <i>snakes/vultures/sulfate </i>is a record worth hearing because it serves as a reminder of the vast distance between inspiration and artistic realization; writing a good song is <i>extremely hard, </i>capable singers are rare, and compelling frontmen even more so. So EmptyMansions serve as a crossover to a <i>real</i> underground, that is, the 99% represented by bands that are equally competent, anonymous, and ultimately ignored, the sort of music resulting in lonely SoundClouds, sparsely attended bar gigs, and promo emails that are immediately deleted because the guy who played drums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17324-turn-on-the-bright-lights-the-tenth-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Turn on the Bright Lights </i></a>had absolutely nothing to do with it. </p></div>"|17904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17904-emptymansions-snakesvulturessulfate/|3.2|Ian Cohen

They cram their brief, constantly shifting tracks with a chaotic blend of hardcore, D-Beat, grindcore, powerviolence, and death metal. It's complex music that plows ahead while moving internally in dozens of directions.</p>
<p>But technical descriptions don't capture what they do so well. When Southern Lord picked up and re-released their 2010 debut LP <i>Unsilent Death </i>after its smaller first pressing sold out, they offered a comparison of 90s AmRep bands and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30560-cro-mags/"" target=""_blank"">Cro-Mags</a> going faster than either. That sort of works. So does Eyehategod's songbook played by 2013 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>. This music is more suffocating than it is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28082-suffocation/"" target=""_blank"">Suffocation</a>; it also pulls largely from hardcore and comes with plenty of raw emotion attached to it.</p>
<p><i>Unsilent Death</i>'s 10 tracks sped past in 14 minutes; <i>Abandon All Life</i>'s 10 tracks just barely break the 17-minute mark. Both releases were produced by Converge's Kurt Ballou. It's assured, sturdy music, and Ballou knows how to make it sound deep and strong. (He does an even better job of it on the huge-sounding new collection.) With this kind of material you also need a vocalist who can stand up to it, and Todd Jones (who used to play in the hardcore band Terror) keeps up with the mutating landscape behind him: he scowls, snarls, howls, screams, spits, and even quietly sighs (in the black metal minor scales and Celtic Frost-like opening of standout ""Wide Open Wound""). At times he feels like a conductor holding together a maelstrom, and when he repeatedly shouts ""I want to see you suffer"" in  the 42-second-long ""Tyrant"" and ""My goal: cause you pain"" in the 55-second-long ""No Surrender"", you believe the sentiments, even though his approach brings a lot of pleasure.</p>
<p>Nails' songs are largely about power and control, suffering and degradation; you get dozens of lines like ""On your knees before me/ I humiliate, I torture/ I celebrate your failures"" in the escalating five-minute doom-to-feedback-implosion closer ""Suum Cuique"". But these songs are also about overcoming those situations. There are sentiments like ""Resolve your vengeance make them pay"" in opener ""In Exodus"", the title track's ""Wield the fucking blade/ Pierce the fucking hate… / Your will is beyond what those cowards posses"" and ""Burn all white flags/ No fucking surrender"" in ""No Surrender"". For all the negatively people talk about Nails espousing, they're ultimately a positive band-- in the sense that they provide a rallying point and a will to power for people open to these kinds of violent pep talks.</p>
<p>But back to the beginning:<i> Abandon All Life</i> is a bracing, cathartic, darkly anthemic collection, but those not used to this sort of thing will probably need to spend some time with so it can slow down some and make more sense. People usually don't think of hardcore punk as ""headphone"" music. Nails should be played loudly, of course, but they should also be listened to carefully on headphones at some point to appreciate how they're layering these elements and creating something so seamless. This is smart, well-plotted music, which makes its anger all the more effective.</p></div>"|17784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17784-nails-abandon-all-life/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Though this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17182-mac-demarco-2/"" target=""_blank"">2</a> </i>proved the guy can do more than just an, ahem, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GMGia5B-mU&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""creative"" cover of ""Beautiful Day""</a>, he's probably not someone you'd willingly leave your kids with. But he can write a tune, and at least some people in his orbit share that ability. Take <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/capturedtracks/sets/alex-calder-time-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alex Calder</a>, the 23-year-old musician who previously played drums in DeMarco's shaggy <a href=""http://makeoutvideotape.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Makeout Videotape</a> and has now ventured out on his own with his home-recorded EP, <i>Time</i>. Mac hooked his fellow countryman up with Brooklyn imprint <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a> which, come to think of it, was the least he could do after making Calder <a href=""http://vimeo.com/21213231"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kiss a dead deer on camera</a>. But for fans of DeMarco's laid-back, deadbeat jams, Calder is a worthy acolyte, and <i>Time</i> is a delightfully shambling debut that succeeds in spite of obvious trappings.</p>
<p>Calder specializes in a demented take on spangly 1960s flower pop. It's not the freshest approach, but the songs work thanks to creeped-out undertones and his simple yet effective recording technique-- tons of fatty, grumbly low-end that helps frame the spiring, jangling guitars. Calder's music is in fact very similar to DeMarco's, but it also feels reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>'s warped pop moves, the eyelid-heavy mysticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28059-julian-lynch/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Lynch</a> and the ragged DIY appeal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a>. Though his style feels recognizable, it's far from mimetic; <i>Time</i> keeps things woolly and weird, often pushing beyond its own limits to produce music that is imperfect but strangely compelling because of it.</p>
<p><i>Time's </i>amateurism works in its favor. The lo-fidelity sonics are clearly the result of having little to work with (Calder recorded much of the EP in his living room in Montreal). He doesn't have much of a voice, but knows how to mask it in reverb. Drums are junky, ""production"" is nearly non-existent. It amounts to a snapshot of an artist getting to know himself, but one that has more ideas than he's often capable of juggling. Songs typically only have two parts, and at times feel as if they were hastily soddered together, like the hurried work of a high school garage band. It may seem philistinic, but it imparts a necessary urgency, as if these songs just had to come out, no matter the stability of the vessel.</p>
<p><i>Time</i> is ostensibly a guitar record, as Calder manages to churn out addictive little hooks at nearly every turn. He's almost as good at making odd shapes too, squeezing a surprising amount of texture out of these humble songs, elevating what would otherwise register as unspectacular. Stormy jabs of guitar litter the background of the ambling ""Location""; the paisley-patterned ""Suki and Me"" would be ready for radio if it didn't sound so dosed; the weird ""Lethargic"" finally locates a slippery, sweet funhouse mirror vibe Calder hints at the whole record long.<br/><i></i></p>
<p><i>Time</i> is definitely a slacker's dream-- if bumming cigarettes had a soundtrack, this would be it. But there's also something a little off about it, a pervading sense of unease. ""Light Leave Your Eyes"" contrasts solar-powered guitars with a spooked out chorus, complete with ghosted coos. On ""Location"", Calder sings about ""drinking again without my friends again"" in an eerie sing-song, giving way to the unsettlingly cheerful title track. Calder may not contain multitudes, but with<i> Time</i> he's built a foundation for something more layered and complex than the dirty, pretty things on display here. ""I guess I would call myself a recording artist, even though it always sounds weird when I hear myself saying that,"" Calder mentioned in a <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/alex-calder/behind-the-music-alex-calder-time/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent video</a>.

And this has been entirely by design-- except for the early 90s part, which the band probably would have rather avoided. When Mudhoney was given a plum spot next to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"" target=""_blank"">Pearl Jam</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3885-soundgarden/"" target=""_blank"">Soundgarden</a> on the <i>Singles </i>soundtrack-- the <i>Saturday Night Fever </i>of alt-rock-- it dropped a stinkbomb inside Seattle’s coronation as rock’s “it” city: “Overblown” opened with Mark Arm famously snarling, “Everybody loves us/ Everybody loves our town / That's why I'm thinkin' lately/ Time for leavin' is now.” On the new <i>Vanishing Point</i>, Arm is still playing the cranky contrarian, only now he has two extra decades of pent-up pissiness to vent at wannabe ballers. “You’ve always been the critics’ darling,” Arm bellows at some unfortunate unnamed band-of-the-month on the caustic rant “Chardonnay”. “Get the fuck out of my backstage!”</p>
<p>Arriving at a time when the indie vanguard has about as much to do with punk as <i>Glitter </i>has to do with <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>Vanishing Point </i>is both an anachronism and, if you’re on Mudhoney’s wavelength, a hilarious bulwark against everything that’s annoyingly ephemeral about contemporary underground culture. It sounds like the last stand of Generation X: <i>Vanishing Point </i>is a righteous rallying cry in favor of cynicism, irony, anti-mainstream posturing, and all of those other antiquated concepts that have been deconstructed and discredited in these new, pop-obsessed times. How refreshing that after all the countless trends that once threatened to wipe out bands of their ilk, Mudhoney is still here and not giving a fuck. “I don’t care if you think I’m a prick,” Arm leers gamely over the transgressive garage-rock thump of “I Don’t Remember You”. “It’s clear to me you’re the same piece of shit.”</p>
<p>Like all born-and-bred bastards, Arm has actually gotten funnier and more charming with age. Perhaps that’s because the 51-year old’s barbs are now as benign as the typical complaints of any out-of-touch middle-aged guy. His “piece of shit” riff on “I Don’t Remember You” is inspired by running into a pushy dude from back in the day who slaps his back too hard at the grocery store. On the smart-ass “What to Do With the Neutral”, he mocks anyone who insists he should have a positive attitude; on “Sing this Song of Joy”, he slips into a full-on taunt: “I sing this song of joy/ For all the girls and boys/ Dancing on your grave.” Mark Arm’s primary influence is no longer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a>, it’s Larry David.</p>
<p><i>Vanishing Point</i> is the first Mudhoney record in five years, the longest-ever gap between LPs for the band. Given where Mudhoney is at in its career-- still able to tour around the world, but hardly a big moneymaking proposition-- there’s no guarantee there will be another album. So, it’s nice to hear these guys playing about as well as they ever have on record: The tangle of Steve Turner’s erratic soloing and Dan Peters’ hyperactive drum fills on opener “Slipping Away” are so defiantly Mudhoney-sounding that it single-handedly justifies the price of admission. The difference between Mudhoney in 2013 and the Mudhoney of old is that what once seemed highly flammable is now reassuring. Mudhoney projects tradition and endurance, not danger; the band’s appeal these days is rooted in <i>not </i>spontaneously combusting, so that it can still exist when most of Mudhoney’s contemporaries are extinct.</p>
<p>Not that Mudhoney is resigned to being a museum piece. On “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15052-mudhoney-i-like-it-small/"" target=""_blank"">I Like It Small</a>”, Arm is back in “Overblown” mode, going on about the superiority of GG Allin, “intimate settings,” “dingy basements,” and (most important of all) “no expectations” over whatever the opposite of those things are. At the start of the song, Arm sounds alone, buried in the kicked-up smoke of screaming guitars and pounding drums. But by the end, a chorus of people has joined him-- he’s a voice in the wilderness with the backing of a no-longer-marginalized army. What else is new?</p></div>"|17833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17833-mudhoney-vanishing-point/|7.4|Steven Hyden

Wisely, the opening title track of <i>Machineries of Joy </i>is six minutes of <i>that </i>one kind of song. “We are magnificent machineries of joy” makes for a fitting thesis, as the band industriously doles out signifiers of natural highs, sighing strings, Kraut-rock propulsion, and ringing guitar chords that evoke the sensation alluded to in the closing bookend, “When a Warm Wind Blows Through the Grass”. The appropriately sylvan “Spring Has Sprung” and “Hail Holy Queen” make similarly disarming and self-evident declarations of British Sea Power’s reigning status as British indie's most literate nature boys.</p>
<p>But most of Yan's lyrics fail to appreciate or reflect the simplicity of his surroundings. Even if British Sea Power is five albums (and one soundtrack) deep, he still maintains the overzealous poetic fervor of a college freshman; when Yan informs the listener “you are a vision of extraordinary contortion/ An athletic form of warm distortion,” it’s hard to not shrug your shoulders and think, “I <i>am</i>?”</p>
<p>Book smarts and pop ambition aren't incompatible; problem is, British Sea Power continue to be a band that’s well-read but emotionally illiterate. On “What You Need the Most”, Yan sighs “You were my Pyrex baby,” which would admittedly make a decent construct for a Pusha T song. But hearing nearly six minutes of punning on the physical properties of glass (see: “getting smashed,” “cracked”) proves more tiresome than its waltz-time lurch. Then there's the would-be pep talk “Radio Goddard”, which is actively frustrating. Note the spelling: It’s not <i>Godard</i>, as in Jean-Luc, someone potentially recognizable to most people who’d come across <i>Machineries of Joy</i>. It’s most likely Robert H. Goddard, the physicist best known for developing the first liquid-fueled rocket after withstanding considerable criticism from the press. So after a couple minutes' research, the call to “tune yourself to radio Goddard” starts to make sense-- but is the point to make you feel smart if you know the reference, or to make British Sea Power look smart if you don't?</p>
<p>On the other hand, playing dumb isn't in their best interest either. Witness ""K Hole"", hootin' and hollerin' garage rock that admirably makes a spectacle of itself, but as someone whose lyrics and demeanor are more Ahab than Tarzan, Yan doesn't take naturally to the role of wild man belter. Even putting aside its awkward melody, ""Loving Animals"" makes its point very clear and still comes off more like anthropology than erotica.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If you've been keeping up with British Sea Power to this point, none of this should be a surprise; inverting the pursuits of the solitary, the naturalist and the academic into subjects for populist music has been their M.O. for over a decade. And yet, <i>Machineries of Joy</i> lacks the kind of crucial equalizers that appeal to all levels of education-- big hooks, convincing physicality, legible emotions. In other words, the exact things that they promised by rhetorically asking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>Do You Like Rock Music?</i></a><i> </i>on their gigantic 2008 album.<i> </i>It was seen as cheeky back then, but as with <i>Valhalla Dancehall, </i>the detachment of <i>Machineries of Joy </i>flips the question: does <i>British Sea Power</i> like rock music?</p></div>"|17820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17820-british-sea-power-machineries-of-joy/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Their lead singer Brian Briggs has a lovely, pure high tenor, the kind of voice that effortlessly conveys simple longing. And yet, on their second album, <i>Tales from Terra Firma</i>, they continue to be almost crushingly dull, making well-appointed and cheerfully empty music that successfully communicates next to nothing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their Achilles Heel is a simple and unfortunate one, the same on <i>Tales</i> as it was on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14528-beachcombers-windowsill/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beachcombers Windowsill</i></a>. Stornoway are clearly in love with Celtic and British folk, and yet they can't write a memorable melody to save their lives. Try to sing along to the verse melody of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiLO4qPkA64"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zorbing""</a>, their most well-known tune, and pay attention to what your face muscles are doing; most likely furrowing with the effort of recall. Each of <i>Tales</i>' painstakingly arranged nine songs sinks underneath the weight of this insurmountable problem, which is a shame.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you're making folk-pop, an inability to write a catchy melody is a difficult deficiency to overcome. Stornoway try valiantly with their complex arrangements, which quickly grow exhausting. “You Take Me as I Am” is cluttered with horn charts and pointlessly banging piano. “(A Belated) Invite to Eternity” builds to a full <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a> crescendo, with glimmering tremolo guitar and a “Tonight, Tonight”-style sweeping string section, but having built zero momentum and generated zero heat until that point, their planned fireworks display fizzles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Farewell Appalachia” follows the same pattern, with celesta, finger-picked acoustic and electric guitar all tracing an emptily pretty circle with nothing in the center. The melody of ""The Great Procrastinator"" is almost cleanly written enough to be memorable-- and then the ersatz Dixieland jazz interlude crashes in. Stornoway are deft players, and the transitions are tightly managed, but this is praise on the same order as praising the brushwork in a hotel-room painting.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Briggs’ lyrics are filled with uncomplicated images of the good old British countryside, but his lyrics trample over all these dew-covered fields with wordy, awkward phrasing: ""And in the gathering dew, I was lucid as a floodlight,” goes a line from “(A Belated) Invitation to Eternity”. “There's a hunger in the air/ A lemon swollen in the trees"" he bleats on “Knock Me on the Head”. On “The Great Procrastinator”, he sings that he is “a scientist with far too many metaphors and far too little data to conclude in time.”  They don’t read particularly well, and they don’t sound much more natural when sung.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Tales From Terra Firma</i> </span><span>is a peculiar record-- carefree music that feels leaden; tuneful-sounding songs that offer no tunes to hold onto. They seem an odd fit for 4AD, a label mostly home to singular voices. They may be a mercenary signing, an attempt to ride the coattails of Mumford and Sons' success. But Mumford and Sons, as head-smack simple and pandering as they are, have a pretty crucial ingredient in their arsenal: they write anthems. In that regard, they have Stornoway pretty thoroughly beat.</span></p></div>"|17859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17859-stornoway-tales-from-terra-firma/|4.9|Jayson Greene

The New Orleans rapper was a second-tier figure on P’s label during its absurdly lucrative late-'90s, and back then, he rapped with a throaty yammer that remained the center of attention no matter how hard the Beats by the Pound track beneath him was slamming. But Fiend’s mellowed out over the years, and these days he’s almost exclusively found atop goopy, deeply luxuriating beats, meanwhile fitting squarely into the same league of weed-rap as his buddy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>. And with <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i>, his first (but probably not last) tape of the year, he’s given us another satisfying slab of the stuff, superceding even 2011’s excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/out-the-trunk/7932-out-the-trunk-1/"">Tennis Shoes &amp; Tuxedos</a></i>. The man has his lane.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When he’s not waxing vaguely political on a track like “Blue, White, Red” or imparting a few words on fatherhood during “Violent Violins”, Fiend is laconically exploring Curren$y’s brand of girls-, weed-, and cars-based vaunting. That Oldsmo he just cruised past in? “I’m in a old school that’ll shut down your newest.” Wonder why, in the grand scheme of things, he’s barely a blip on the radar anymore? He’s “too real for TV.” The chick all over him at the club tonight? She’s got ""the type of ass to get yours in trouble.” But while these particular lines all do nicely, <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i> is a success thanks mostly to non-lyrical factors, and any ground lost due to Fiend’s not-especially-immersing penmanship is more than made up for.</p>
<p>Fiend freestyled over Washed Out’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11455-feel-it-all-around/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">“Feel It All Around”</a> early last year, but I don’t think he intended it to be the publicity stunt it might’ve looked like; Ernest Greene’s impossibly lush, Gary Low-sampling track just happens to be the kind of thing he’s come to sound gorgeous over. And as is the case with all of his other recent tapes, there’s a ton of that same energy here. Musically, <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i> is mostly nectary basslines, Nile Rodgers funk guitar, and blaxploitation horn-blasts, a framework that joins so relaxingly with Fiend’s charcoal baritone that parsing through the lyrics becomes an afterthought. It might be a backhanded compliment to say that benefits the tape, but that benefits the tape.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i> totals 22 tracks and tops 70 minutes, and any release this hefty should swerve occasionally in order to keep things interesting. Luckily, a few curves do pop up here. “Lil Sumptin” is the kind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29480-mouse-on-tha-track/"" target=""_blank"">Mouse on tha Track</a> sputter-slap that demands to be set to a video featuring a candy-colored Cadillac with obnoxiously powerful hydraulics. Later, on the back third of the tape, “No Apologies” and “Play if You Want” approach the ominous belfry trap we’re used to hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a> tear through, the latter being a beat-of-the-year contender despite its fleeting two-and-a-half-minute run time. Some of these deviations inspire Fiend to bust out that original vein-popping bark of his (not to mention more frequent use of his “WHOMP WHOMP” adlib), but not one compromises the character of the tape as a whole. A sequential triumph, <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i> plays like one long, sweeping showcase of what Fiend does best and, when things head toward monotony, some of the other things he’s capable of. He might never again find the commercial success he had early in his career, but with <i>Lil Ghetto Boy</i>, his second wind (if this phase of his career can be called that) seems to be getting even stronger.</p></div>"|17969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17969-fiend-lil-ghetto-boy/|7.6|Mike Madden

When a band sounds that tired of what it made its name doing on its own record, it can be forgiven for hanging it up afterward.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Kinski haven’t quite hung it up, though, and if you were hoping that they just needed a while to clear their heads before making a sequel to the spaced-out drone and loud-soft post-rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4463-dont-climb-on-and-take-the-holy-water/"" target=""_blank""><i>Don’t Climb on and Take the Holy Water</i></a>, well, the band doesn’t seem interested in giving it to you. Instead, <i>Cosy Moments</i> doubles down on <i>Down Below</i>’s shift to hard rock, sounding at times like it was made in the band’s hometown of Seattle about 22 years ago. I swear they were listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"" target=""_blank"">Mudhoney</a> and <i>Incesticide</i> on repeat when they wrote “Last Day on Earth"", a rampaging, punked-up rocker that flies by in less than two minutes of grunge-y dynamics and walloping drums.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">That’s hardly the only blast of crunchy fuzz-- this album only goes directly to the space-rock well once, on the pensive, flute-topped instrumental “We Think She’s a Nurse"". Even then, it does it as a set-up for “Let Me Take You Through My Thought Process"", the minute-and-twenty-one-second grunge-pop song that closes the album. Chris Martin’s lead vocals never approach the raggedness of Kurt Cobain or Mark Arm, nor does he seem especially mad about anything (the lyrics generally rely on the same love of wordplay as the band’s song titles), and his clipped melodicism combines with the bright fuzztones in a way that oddly brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>’s <i>Monster</i>. This too is a sort of outsider’s take on early '90s heavy rock, with just a bit of overt musicianship on display.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There are hints of the old Kinski in places. “Counterpointer” mashes grunge riffs into an odd-metered prog pulp, and the lead guitar on the instrumentals sometimes takes on the spacey character of yore. Overall, though, this is Kinski’s most straightforward rock album, and certainly the Kinski album with the best, most concise vocal songs. If anything, the cranked-up, low-tempo instrumentals are now where the band fares worst. It’s hard to know what most Kinski fans will think of this. They’re basically a new band now-- even more so than last time-- and they sound refreshed by the change.</p></div>"|17829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17829-kinski-cosy-moments/|7.0|Joe Tangari

At the beginning of their career, between 1977 and 1979, the great British art punk quartet released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/"" target=""_blank"">three perfect albums</a>, <i>Pink Flag</i>, <i>Chairs Missing</i> and <i>154</i>, each wildly different from the other. Then they splintered, though a bunch of post-<i>154 </i>songs-in-process came to light later, in the dodgy live recordings that made up the bizarre, messy <i>Document and Eyewitness</i> (1981) and 1996's <i>Turns and Strokes</i>.</p>
<p>Since they first reunited in 1985, Wire has had an exceptionally weird relationship to its own past. During their commercial peak in the latter half of the 80s, they refused to play <i>anything</i> from the pre-breakup era, and for the first few years of their current incarnation, they mostly acted as if they'd jumped straight from <i>Pink Flag</i> to the year 2000. At the beginning of this decade, they started looking back in earnest-- not in a ""hey, kids, we wrote ""12 x U"", remember?"" way, but in a ""cleaning up loose ends"" way. 2011's <i>Strays</i> EP contained four pieces that had been kicking around their live repertoire for a long time but had never been recorded to their satisfaction before; the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16257-wire-the-black-session-paris-10-may-2011/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Session</i></a> album that came out last year actually included a few relatively faithful versions of old songs.</p>
<p>And now they've gone back to the material they'd have recorded for the album that never happened after <i>154</i>. The 13 titles on <i>Change Becomes Us</i> are new, but the songs themselves aren't; they're all more or less newly rewritten versions of the <i>Document and Eyewitness</i>/<i>Turns and Strokes</i> repertoire. It's not the first time they've reckoned with some of those sketches, either. ""B/W Silence"" and ""Time Lock Fog"" are respectively adapted from ""Lorries"" and ""5/10,"" which singer/guitarist Colin Newman previously reworked on his 1982 solo album <i>Not To</i>. ""Doubles &amp; Trebles"" is a new version of ""Ally in Exile"", which Wire mutated first into ""Art of Persistence"" on 2000's <i>The Third Day</i> and then into ""I Don't Understand"" on 2002's <i>Read &amp; Burn 01</i>; positioned as the new album's opener, its arrangement and lyric (about a solitary agent in enemy territory) explicitly allude to the way ""Reuters"" introduces <i>Pink Flag</i>.</p>
<p>The Wire of 1980, and the band's members on the solo records that immediately followed the split, were radicals who were trying to pry open the pop-recording form and avoid repeating themselves. The Wire of 2013 have settled on a sweet-and-prickly sound that suits them, and sonically <i>Change Becomes Us</i> is of a piece with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14950-red-barked-tree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Red Barked Tree</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11979-object-47/"" target=""_blank""><i>Object 47</i></a>, the other studio albums they've recorded since the 2004 departure of guitarist/texturalist Bruce Gilbert. (These days, his spot is filled by Matt Simms, who's 30 years younger than the rest of the band.)</p>
<p>Considered as a set of songs, though, it's fantastic-- a clear look at the twisty, glittering material that had previously only been a few sparkles of possibility shining through the muck of those difficult live albums. The band who wrote these songs were a couple of years away from becoming hardcore punk icons-- there are hints of that when drummer Robert Grey breaks into a high-speed two-step on ""Adore Your Island"" and ""Stealth of a Stork"". And they were so deeply invested in non-obviousness that their lyrics sometimes read like cryptic crossword clues: the hook of ""Eels Sang Lino""-- recast here as ""Eels Sang""-- is an anagram for ""in Los Angeles.""</p>
<p>But the Wire of 1979 and 1980 were also developing their enduring fascination with unlikely kinds of beauty, and their 21st century incarnation has built some of their most fetching songs from some of the most ragged and jagged ideas to come from their younger selves. (""Re-Invent Your Second Wheel"", sung by bassist Graham Lewis, is a languorous waltz whose DNA has traces of the in-your-face <i>Document and Eyewitness</i> experiment ""Zegk Hoqp"".) History and transformation are, understandably, recurring themes in the new lyrics on <i>Change Becomes Us</i>, and it's a treat to have this missing link in the Wire story repaired, even if it's as much an anomaly in the present moment as <i>Document and Eyewitness</i> was in its time.</p></div>"|17720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17720-wire-change-becomes-us/|8.2|Douglas Wolk

If only there didn’t have to be an endless series of identical 10-second intervals after that; what’s initially thrilling about these Texas psych-rockers gets run through a loop that quickly turns monotonous, then tedious, and finally deadening. Their fourth album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/55-indigo-meadow/"" target=""_blank"">Indigo Meadow</a>, </i>is more of the same.</p>
<p>Just as 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14669-phosphene-dream/"" target=""_blank""><i>Phosphene Dream </i></a>was relatively compact and poppy compared with 2008’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11540-directions-to-see-a-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">Directions to See a Ghost</a>, Indigo Meadow </i>finds the Black Angels once again downplaying their psych side and playing up the rock. Not that the group has exited its original era of inspiration-- the menacing Farfisa organ fills and trebly guitar buzz keep the vibe firmly rooted in the 60s-- but the references have shifted a bit, away from “Sister Ray” and toward the Yardbirds and <i>Nuggets. </i>This suits the Black Angels’ current line-up; now down to a four-piece, they resemble a knuckle-dragging garage-rock band from the LBJ years now more than ever. Instead of prattling over a simple, pulsating groove for several minutes, the Black Angels now apply their muscular clomp to bluesy vamps like “The Day”, which nods towards the Yardbirds’ version of “I’m a Man”, and pseudo-menacing claptrap like the clumsy “Always Maybe”, which has the trippy keyboards and “spooky” vocal affectations of a darkly campy Strawberry Alarm Clock track.</p>
<p>It’s a not a crime for a revivalist outfit like the Black Angels to occasionally lapse into flower-power corniness; if delivered with a little self-awareness, it adds to the appeal of the anachronistic package. What’s not forgivable on <i>Indigo Meadow </i>is the pretension. “Don’t Play with Guns” is one of several mid-tempo slabs of snaky, druggy (or “druggy”) silliness that would go down just fine if the Black Angels didn’t take their own lyrical bullshit (“Now Angie, she was a demon/ She had six arms and Lucifer eyes,” etc.) so seriously. Unfortunately, the Black Angels seem themselves as bullshit <i>artistes</i>; in the press materials for <i>Indigo Meadow, </i>singer/multi-instrumentalist Alex Maas has the gall to suggest that “Don’t Play with Guns” is a comment on mass shootings like the tragedy in Aurora, CO, even though the song was written days <i>before </i>the massacre. “In ""Don’t Play with Guns"" the antagonist is a female who has the power of persuasion over a man,” Maas <a href=""http://theblackangels.com/info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> on the band’s website. “Substitute the female antagonist with a Nation, substitute the manipulated man with yourself. Heed the warning: Don’t play with guns.”</p>
<p>You mean these songs are meaningful <i>warnings </i>so long as you substitute the shallow clichés in the lyrics with real-life substance? What a convenient trick. The sprightly “Broken Soldier” is a more deliberate “message” song about societal violence, concerning a fighting man who posits that it’s “hard to kill when you don’t know what side you’re on.” But applying Maas’ logic to the rest of the record, <i>Indigo Meadow </i>can mean whatever you wish. (The dreary “Evil Things” must be about the federal budget sequester.) Sorry, but that doesn’t pass the smell test. <i>Indigo Meadow </i>isn't a window into the modern world; it's an escape from it. Bullshit is fine if you can sell it, but the Black Angels have finally laid it on too thick.</p></div>"|17821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17821-the-black-angels-indigo-meadow/|4.9|Steven Hyden

Still, these times should suit the erstwhile “Godfather of Grime”, and at least in the UK they seem to: his latest album <i>The Ascent </i>has already yielded three top 10 hits locally, including a number one in “Heatwave”. If Wiley’s career seems to seesaw between rough-hewn respectability (or obscurity, if you prefer) and goofy populism, his latest sweep into the second category coincides with what must surely be considered goofy populism’s golden age. Sadly, this is not to say that this latest career reinvention is executed with particular grace or skill, and instead <i>The Ascent </i>bows to the received wisdom of cramming as many guest artists, producers and stylistic tics as humanly possible into a 50 minute listen, presumably so as to exhaust listeners into submission.</p>
<p>This conscious attempt to please all audiences is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a> at times, especially when you measure the distance from the album’s most aggressive moment (the epileptic shudders of grime crew cut “Skillzone”) to its least (the histrionic, hospital fundraiser advert-ready “Tomorrow”, complete with fake Chris Martin chorus). But Nicki has two clear demographics in mind, and deals squarely to each of them; by contrast, Wiley’s ecumenicalism seems to blur the hard edges around each song until the strict stylistic differences hardly seem to matter. Which is a shame, because track for track several of the contortions come off pretty well, especially the obvious but obviously-fun drum and bass thumper “Reload” (random thesis: drum &amp; bass got hooky again by listening to Madonna’s <i>Confessions on a Dancefloor</i>), or the bustling, horn-driven funky of “My Heart”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s harder to get excited about Wiley and friends’ attempts at straight rap (what’s the point?) or numerous stabs at the international colors of EDM-pop. In the case of the latter, the problem is not the sound per se; arguably, the arrangements Wiley draws for are more inventive and sympathetic to rapping than are most of the better-known US counterparts, and Wiley is well-suited to the style, readily treading the tightrope between the fabulous and the fatuous. Rather, it’s that if you’re choosing a style which forecloses off so many sensory options (menace, swagger and so on) in favour of a narrow stripe of geared-up melodic anthemism, then you better ensure your anthemism is top-shelf. But the half-heartedly hedonistic R&amp;B choruses on these tunes suggest that on the international market for bolt-on pop exuberance Wiley’s credit doesn’t stretch very far. The exception is the oddly stirring, string-driven “Heatwave”, which flips the script by having Wiley sound hookier than the blankly raunched-up chorus offered by Ms D. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It seems boring and a bit lazy to say that Wiley sounds best when he’s still offering up recognisable grime tunes, but it’s undeniable that on <i>The Ascent </i>the strongest of such efforts capture the rapper in his best light, in part by offering him space to breathe, and in part because the grooves’ stop-start frigidity, their alternations of yawning gaps and sudden collision of beats, mimic the same qualities in Wiley’s flow, that ceaseless monotone command-style filled with unexpected accelerations and decelerations, like a field marshal ordering troops in time with the beat. </p>
<p>Moreover, the always-ambivalent sonic qualities of grime-- its fussiness, even prissiness, evoking so strongly the idea of guys who <i>want to be </i>hard more than they actually are; hard men of the internet comments box era perhaps-- perfectly complement Wiley’s self-obsession. On “Humble Pie” and the particularly great “Broken Thoughts” (shamefully relegated to bonus track status), Wiley recounts tales of doomed love and precarious achievement with a kind of self-puncturing smallness that seems particular to grime and Wiley as its most emblematic figure. Both tunes feature gorgeously shifting, sighing arrangements from Kid D, their stuttering beats and rippling chimes a world away from crossover, but far more intimately entwined around the rapper’s curious charms. </p></div>"|17772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17772-wiley-the-ascent/|6.2|Tim Finney

Rose has made music under several different monikers, but in the past few years, his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a> has arguably proven most vital. Even for someone working in a genre that's as constantly stylistically fickle as bass, Rose has recently proven himself one of dance music's most inventive producers, someone who'd rather take bass places it rarely frequents than simply follow trends. In Scuba's world, nothing is off-limits-- chunky rave chords, huge-sounding trance melodies, house music's persistent thud-- and whatever's in his sonic arsenal is deployed to the point where bass as a genre is nearly and completely abandoned.</p>
<p>An album-oriented artist working within a musical culture where albums have seldom been a point of focus, Rose's first two full-lengths as Scuba, 2008's <i>A Mutual Antipathy</i> and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Triangulation</i></a>, still featured an abundance of the clattering percussion and gray tones that many have come to associate with UK bass. Last year's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16341-personality/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Personality</i></a>, then, was something completely different. Loaded with bold, strident melodies as well as a few stylistic left turns, <i>Personality</i> radiated an aura of positivity that's not easily found in the genre. Less of a maximalist than Glasgow's manically minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, and not as much of a sensualist as Hotflush-signed duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29967-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a>, <i>Personality</i> regardless cemented Rose as an up-with-people artist, the type of producer who's not afraid to make something crowd-pleasing even if it means sacrificing a level of subtlety in the process.</p>
<p>When taken in chronological order, Scuba's catalog shows clear artistic progression and growth-- which is why it's a little curious that <i>Update</i>, the digital-only compilation that cherrypicks highlights from the project's seven-year existence, abandons chronology entirely in favor of establishing something approaching a narrative (it's probably not a coincidence that the last track here is called ""Lights Out""). The embrace of a non-linear tracklist proves effective, though, in connecting the dots between early material and more recent revelations, proving that even at his sparsest, Rose's keen ear for melody has proven as effective even when his hand tips the scales towards subtlety.</p>
<p>The seismic depth of this stuff isn't rude by any means, but it possesses a disorienting richness regardless, to the point where even the crispest percussive touches seem to reverberate endlessly into blackness. <i>Update</i>'s tracks unfold patiently, as even the most chaotic cuts sound micro-managed for maximum effectiveness, so when Rose zooms out to let, say, an expressive synth wash enter the fray, he's in no rush to get back to what he was on previously. He wants you to feel it, to the point where the feeling becomes awesomely overwhelming.</p>
<p>The predilection for creating moments of pure awe is probably why I often find myself reaching for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Chemical Brothers</a> after listening to Scuba. His recent material suggests that Rose shares their-- and, by extension, progressive house's-- psychedelic tendencies, but it's important to remember the Chem Bros' skewed pop instincts are what's continually ensured their commercial relevancy, too, and at his best Rose exhibits similar smarts. <i>Personality</i> cuts ""July"" and ""NE1BUTU"" represent some of his most beatifically straightforward material to date, the former employing synth stabs reminiscent of Van Halen's ""Jump"" and the latter cramming a wealth of sample triggers into its too-tough front half before declarative piano chords and a neck-whipping diva vocal tornadoes through the proceedings.</p>
<p>Then, there's ""Adrenalin"". The 2011 single and deserved centerpiece of <i>Update</i> was, at the time of its release, the first taste of what was to come on <i>Personality</i>, and it arguably still stands as Rose's most excellent work to date. Over the course of eight minutes that feel as if they could go for another hour or more, Rose carefully builds a foundation around an endless repetition of the titular vocal sample-- a 4/4 thud, some shuddering 808 figures, expressive washes of sound-- before, at the tune's near halfway point, a tidal wave of synths crash through to create something that's intangibly anthemic and irrepressibly epic, a glistening trance anthem that even those who still think of trance as a dirty word can embrace. It's the sound of staring into the sun for just the right amount of time-- or, having your mind blown by something with the transportative properties of ""Adrenalin"" while out at a club-- and it represents Rose at his most creatively generous.</p>
<p>Rose's output as Scuba dates back seven years, and as the relatively meek title of the compilation suggests, that's a span of time that doesn't necessarily demand a ""best of"" release. There are many producers, both in bass music and other strains of dance, whose catalogs demand this type of treatment for a variety of reasons, least of which being sheer availability of their catalog to those not willing to do the deep digging. (With Rose, you can get a lot from the readily available full-lengths and EPs, even if seeking out his lesser-known work and singles as SCB proves equally rewarding.) <i>Update</i>, then, gets by on the sheer pleasures it provides, a collection that transcends necessity on its own merit.</p></div>"|17905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17905-scuba-update/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

His style-- which marries the hook-bending sonic sensibility of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>, the pill-addled yawp of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>, and the playful irreverance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a> living together under the guiding aura of Lil Wayne's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cykGnl1KvcM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">experimental period</a>-- is hard to define, and he uses this mystique in memorable ways. But, more often than not, he doesn't <i>quite</i> put that enticing package together. David Drake called Thug's 2012 mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16953-i-came-from-nothing-3/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Came From Nothing 3</i></a> a ""a dense, ambitious attempt to cultivate an entirely new rap style"" while also calling it ""frequently frustrating, shifting from eye-openingly original to inconsequential from track to track."" Much of the same can be said about Thug's newest entry, <i>1017 Thug.</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">If it weren't for the moments Thug <i>does </i>puts the puzzle together, <i>1017 Thug </i>could be easily dismissed as an erratic experiment-- many songs never get started and don't stick, and the ones that do get something spinning sometimes don't end up anywhere memorable. The thing is though, when Thug finds the right balance, it makes for some of the best and most fun-loving rap of the year, songs with multiple entry points that can't help but splatter and seep into the corners of your brain. Three songs, in particular, take you to these dizzying highs, ""2 Cups Stuffed"", ""Nigeria"", and ""Picacho"". That trio of tracks is essentially a crash course in what constitutes a brilliant, potential-flexing entry from Thug, especially when couched between more phoned-in thought bubbles like ""Condo Music"" and messy, meandering joints like ""Shooting Star"". </p>
<p class=""p1"">""2 Cups Stuffed"" is without a doubt <i>1017 Thug's </i>Wake-The-Fuck-Up moment, a song that builds from an unshakeable, wheeling hook into Thug's chanting, delirious demand for syrup. ""Uno! Dos! Cups stuffed! UNO! DOS! CUPS STUFFED!"" It's repetitive in the way that a hammer's thud might be repetitive. It's great.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Following up the annoying-by-design ""Murder"" is ""Nigeria"", a watery, Gucci-featuring track that sounds like Thug is calling from the corner of the club, maybe even the bathroom stall, maybe underwater. ""Nigeria"", an ode to the potent Nigerian strain of marijuana, gives Thug license to travel around the globe, to Jamaica, to Siberia (""Also cold in Siberia,"" Thug shivers). It's a good example of the tension Thug creates, batting the trope around in a playful way, while at the same time seeming a little dangerous and unhinged, adrift in the fog of drugs and his nasal fiending is the only thing cutting through the mist. It's something else.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Curious synths provided by producer Jay Neutron lead you into the bizarro universe of ""Picacho"", a pastiche where Young Thug envisions walking up to peers in the club and bellowing ""Pikachu!,"" maybe even while wearing that red ballcap <a href=""http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30400000/Pikachu-and-Ash-pokemon-30421592-1024-768.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ash wears</a>. It takes its title from either the most well-known Pokémon, a cat/rat mixture that doubles as a tesla coil, or from the phenomenon of mixing up yellow-colored cough syrup with the more common purple-colored stuff. I'm not sure it matters.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Picacho"" is a good example of just how far Thug will stretch his voice and cadence, sometimes even leaping into a register that Mel Blanc didn't know existed. It's probably the best thing on the mixtape. <span>It's pretty incredible.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the strangest things about <i>1017 Thug </i>is just how flat the more high-visibility collaborations fall; none of the tracks produced by Brick Squad load carriers Lex Luger or 808 Mafia leave a mark, and even Gucci's appearance on the standout ""Nigeria"" proves that he and Thug aren't exactly cut from the same patterned leather. <i>1017 </i><i>Thug, </i>at its height, excites the imagination; if Thug can sensibly pour these influences and touchpoints into songs like ""Picacho"" and ""2 Cups Stuffed"", can radio omnipresence be that far behind? It might take more mixtapes than it should to find out.</p></div>"|17891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17891-young-thug-1017-thug/|7.4|Corban Goble

His debut album, <i>Bastard</i>, was filled with sharp darts for rap blogs who wouldn’t post his music, while his sophomore album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/"">Goblin</a>, </i>wanted desparately to prove Odd Future was worth all their sudden hype. In the two years since <i>Goblin</i>’s release, Earl Sweatshirt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45862-earl-sweatshirt-makes-live-debut-in-nyc/"">returned from Samoan exile</a>, Frank Ocean <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47067-frank-ocean-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/"">opened up about his sexuality</a> in a heartfelt Tumblr note and released the Grammy Award winning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/""><i>Channel Orange</i></a>, and Tyler unveiled ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45033-odd-futures-adult-swim-series-loiter-squad-premieres-in-march/"">Loiter Squad</a>"", an absurdist late night sketch comedy show. As a group, Odd Future embarked on a series of tours that connected them with an expanding base of teenagers and outcasts even as they drew fire from LGBT advocates, women’s groups, and a music press none too amused by the macabre content of their lyrics. A lot has changed, and now Tyler returns with <i>Wolf</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Where <i>Goblin </i>felt like an attempt to shoehorn the whole of Odd Future’s nihilist aesthetic into a single album, <i>Wolf </i>pulls back the curtain and reveal the talented introvert behind the music. The first thing to go is the bratty punk fury of earlier material. The insurgent bravado of “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8J-RXZ41-Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radicals</a>”, “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEySJnqJbRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandwitches</a>”, and “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk68dCUQjzE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">French</a>” is scaled back, replaced by songs that flip the conventions of his songwriting inside out. The songs about women are earnest where they used to carry murder ballads’ air of ill intent. Drugs come up, but we also hear about a remorseful dealer surveying the havoc he’s caused and a man having a mercilessly terrible time while high. <i>Wolf</i> is still the balancing act between gruff cynicism and juvenilia that we’ve come to expect from Odd Future (especially on “Pigs”, a bleak radio play about exacting revenge on bullies), but these songs are more three-dimensional. Tyler’s more likely to aim for melody instead of menace. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Wolf</i> as a whole also sounds gorgeous, and that even goes for the bruisers. The polyrhythmic hi-hats of the madcap posse cut “Trashwang” eventually give pause to a piano bridge, and the blustery lead single “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49573-watch-the-video-for-tyler-the-creators-new-single-domo-23/"">Domo 23</a>” gets a bump from a boisterous horn section. Foreboding numbers like “Rusty” (a lush reimagining of 1990s RZA production) and the nightmarish, tribal “Cowboy” are declawed by rich textures and melodicism. “Answer” sets Tyler’s longing for his late grandmother and absentee father to a bright guitar figure and shimmering organs. “48”’s crack epidemic reminiscence is adorned with elegant pianos, string stabs, tasteful guitar, and spoken word interludes from Nas. Tyler’s pet sounds are dark melodies hammered out on wonky synths and clattering breakbeats but here they come padded with embellishments that give <i>Wolf </i>a cinematic breadth. The album is pretty, but beguilingly so. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s something not quite right, though, and it’s not just Tyler’s gritty basso profundo cutting through every melodic flourish. Pacing is one problem. <i>Wolf </i>reprises the winding sprawl of <i>Goblin</i>, hitting its stride on a series of midtempo cuts on the front and back ends but losing steam on a midsection that places too many of its longest and slowest songs back-to-back. “PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer” marries three unrelated fragments in a manner not unlike Domo Genesis’ <i>Rolling Papers</i>, whose passages of short vignettes gave it an off-the-cuff feel. But the pieces here don’t hang together, and “Bimmer” is too fleeting of a payoff for the uphill trudge it takes to get there. After that, there’s the lengthy “IFHY” (“I fucking hate you,” natch.), a bit of Neptunes worship so adroit that its plinking synths and jazzy chord changes give way to a falsettoed coda from Pharrell himself. (The Stereolab-channeling“Campfire” similarly summons that band’s Laetitia Sadier for a guest vocal.) Later on, the sedate acid jazz of “Treehome95” and the closing comedown “Lone” are inexplicably split up by the shrill M.I.A. send-up “Tamale”. <i>Wolf </i>is full of good songs but in the wrong order.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, not all of the depressive sluggishness can be blamed on sequencing. Tyler makes very clear that he doesn’t enjoy the trappings of fame. The album is shot through with harsh words for critics, sheepish venue owners, puritanical parents, and groups who’ve picketed Odd Future shows. But if he’s surrounded by detractors, he only has himself to blame. He was bound to be taken for a ne’er do well by a mainstream public who first spotted him in a video eating a roach and hanging himself, to be read for a homophobe after filling his records and tweets with offensive slurs. Tyler should know that we don’t get to control the ways our words are interpreted when they leave our mouths to filter out into the universe, and we certainly don’t get to be coarse or crass without blowback. Over the length of the album, the defensive can become grating, and <i>Wolf</i>’s rebuttals are pointless anyhow. By now, you either like Odd Future and have figured out a mental workaround to reconcile their more troubling tendencies with their obvious talent, in which case this stuff is moot, or you don’t, and this acrimonious self-defense is ill-suited to win you over.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With <i>Wolf</i>, Tyler, the Creator displays a radical growth as a producer, composer and arranger, even if, as a rapper, he’s still up to some of the same antics. Still, the album contains a few of the best songs he’s ever written. “48” is a wonder, “Answer” and “Lone” delve into deeply personal matters with poise, and “Rusty” is one of the most arresting lyrical performances on the record if you can see past the self-serving chest-beating. It’s a big screen rendering of the Neptunes-meet-Stevie-Wonder-in-a-microwave quality of Tyler’s earlier works, the sound of a creative mind coming into the possession of the proper means to carry out its ideas. At its best, <i>Wolf </i>manages to make the inroads toward accessibility that <i>Goblin </i>wouldn’t and pulls it off without sacrificing too much of Tyler’s refreshing capriciousness. When the album isn’t busy telling us that we ought to like it more, it’s delivering reasons why we actually should.</p></div>"|17805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17805-tyler-the-creator-wolf/|7.8|Craig Jenkins

As frontman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28049-alice-in-chains/"">Alice in Chains</a>, he approached the subject with a cagey ambivalence that allowed that band to navigate from glam metal also-rans to grunge grunge mainstays. Drugs were a temptation as well as a burden, and at his best Staley implied that addiction prodded the scene’s severe introversion-- as if that was the pain that everyone was singing about. At his worst, though, he could be ridiculously self-righteous and pompously poetic about his habit. If you don’t believe me, read the lyrics to “Junkhead”.</p>
<p>After <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> guitarist Mike McCready and journeyman bass player John Baker Saunders met at rehab and formed a band, they brought in Staley primarily because they thought he would benefit from being around some clean musicians. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4122-screaming-trees/"">Screaming Trees</a> drummer Barrett Martin rounding out the band, they played a few shows locally as the Gacy Bunch before decorum prevailed and they rebilled themselves as Mad Season. Even that band name is druggy: a term for the time of year when psilocybin mushrooms are in bloom. In 1995, Mad Season released their one and only album, <i>Above, </i>which notched an honest-to-God radio hit with “River of Deceit”-- something that higher-profile side projects Brad and Temple of the Dog never managed. Efforts to record a follow-up in 1997 went nowhere. Saunders OD’ed in ’99, Staley in ’02.</p>
<p>18 years after its release, <i>Above </i>is getting the deluxe reissue treatment, complete with unreleased live tracks, a DVD, and some recently completed recordings from the aborted follow-up sessions. It’s a handsome package and easily the definitive statement on this Seattle footnote, but all those extras can’t compensate for what is a bewilderingly self-absorbed album, one so dully self-serious that in retrospect it may have killed grunge dead. So combative and caustic with Alice in Chains, Staley lets his ongoing self-examination curdle into clunky therapyspeak and ponderous nonsense. “My pain is self-chosen, at least I believe it to be,” he insists on “River of Deceit”, succinctly summing up everything that was wrong with 90s alt-rock.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely Staley’s fault. Mad Season was a new group, and its members were still figuring out what all they could do together. In the reissue liner notes, Barrett Martin maintains they were actually a blues band, which isn’t quite as incredible as it might sound: Saunders, older than his bandmates by a decade, had spent long years in the Chicago and Minneapolis blues scenes, backing <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/arts/music/hubert-sumlin-master-of-blues-guitar-dies-at-80.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hubert Sumlin</a> and <a href=""http://www.lamontcranston.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lamont Cranston</a>. Still, Mad Season wasn’t necessarily interested in blues structure or subject matter, at least not directly. Instead, these songs are long on vaguely bluesy atmosphere. In other words: ominous, minor key, crossroadsy. The average song length runs between six and seven minutes, which makes <i>Above</i> a real slog. They fill that time with some heavy riffage, some noodling straight off a <a href=""http://youtu.be/hs8y3kneqrs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Yellow Ledbetter”</a> outtake, some marimba chords, and a saxophone solo. It’s not blues grunge so much as <a href=""http://youtu.be/EAJeA040E2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lounge grunge</a>.</p>
<p>While Seattle is credited with stamping out the previous decade’s decadent hard rock, heavy metal was always a crucial influence on grunge. The band members’ day-job groups may have sounded like punk that had integrated classic rock at a molecular level, but on <i>Above</i> the nods to metals acts are obvious and unmistakable. Not one but two songs, including opener “Wake Up”, crib the subdued psych-murk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>’s “Planet Caravan”, and McCready does his best Jimmy Page on “Lifeless Dead” and pretty much every other song. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a>’s influence isn’t merely in his mile-high riffs, but in the relationship between the lead guitar and the rhythm section. The former struts, the latter stomps, but the effect is all too familiar. Mad Season weren’t interpreting these acts, but merely aping them.</p>
<p>Still, the band’s try-anything ethos is commendable and even occasionally exciting. The glam-punk chorus of “I’m Above” makes good use of Staley’s potent sneer. Then the song breaks for a Spanish guitar solo, and the moment is so random that it becomes bracing, as though every possibility remains open to them. That’s what a side project is for, after all. But not once does <i>Above</i> sound like the work of a real side project-- like four guys relieved to be away from their workaday gigs. Despite the success of “River of Deceit” on alt-rock radio, <i>Above</i> was not especially well received in 1995, and Staley notes this fact on the live disc. He berates critics for writing “retarded reviews,” countering that the band had a “fucking blast” recording the album. Perhaps they did, but the music they made is anything but a blast. These songs are for the most part joyless and strained.</p>
<p>Live, however, Mad Season sound more in their element. What seemed leaden in the studio comes off loose on the stage, as evidenced by recordings of their show at Seattle's Moore Theater on April 29, 1995, and footage from their New Year's Eve show later that year. Onstage, “Lifeless Dead” becomes an especially punchy jam, anchored by the tremendous rhythm section, and local saxophone player <a href=""http://fogworld.com/skerik/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skerik</a> vamps and skronks through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a>’s “I Don’t Wanna Be a Soldier” as the crowd moshes in slo-mo. The set lags towards the end and dies with a 14-minute version of “November Hotel”, but these guys actually look like they might be having fun up there. McCready even solos with the guitar behind his head. It’s goofy as shit, but that’s what makes it a highlight: it’s the one moment in the life of Mad Season when someone managed to crack a smile.</p></div>"|17824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17824-mad-season-above-deluxe-edition/|4.6|Stephen M.

On the bridge it swoops and bends dramatically, but as the song winds down, the strings split in two, flowing against each other in strange currents and eddies-- not unlike the North Carolina river that gives the album its title. It’s a powerful moment, one that imbues some real drama into a song that functions as a kind of spiritual interrogation. Is God a liberator or a conqueror? Does man rejoice or despair in His dominion? That ornate string section doesn't skirt the question.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Over the last few years, young folk revivalists have turned to traditional American music as a vehicle for spiritual catharsis: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford and Sons</a> tick off rousing anthems like they’re punching a clock, the Lumineers engineer pre-industrial sing-alongs, and Old Crow Medicine Show soldier on as a jam-band comprised of historical re-enactors. At its best, this trend imagines pop music as a potentially communal thing, <span>intended for public experience rather than headphones isolation</span>. In less thoughtful incarnations, the nuances of craft are often jettisoned in favor of fervency. Based out of Durham, North Carolina, Hiss Golden Messenger offers a fine corrective to the recent rash of folk anthems: The songs on <i>Haw</i> pose questions rather than offer easy reassurances, and head Messenger M.C. Taylor is more concerned with spiritual doubt than any kind of comforting certainty.</p>
<p>After nearly a decade with the San Francisco Americana act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/842-the-court-spark/"">the Court and Spark</a>, Taylor moved from his native California about as far east as he could, settling in the Tarheel State in the late 2000s. With a degree in folklore from UNC, Taylor has a deep knowledge of Southern folk music, especially that of the Piedmont region of North Carolina. But Hiss Golden Messenger is never beholden to tradition. There are shades of Charlie Poole and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8230-charlie-patton/"">Charley Patton</a> in these songs, but also tinges of AM Gold country, jazz, rock, and singer-songwriter pop. So “Sufferer (Love My Conqueror)” includes not only that odd string section, but also gentle bursts of rural psychedelia and backing vocals tinged with both gospel and the Gospel. “Cheerwine Easter”, named for a regional <a href=""http://www.cheerwine.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soft drink</a>, is gentle country soul with a sturdy beat and, out of nowhere, a low and lovely sax solo courtesy of Bobby Crow.</p>
<p><i>Haw</i> is fuller and more adventurous even than 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16546-poor-moon/"">Poor Moon</a>, </i>with a broader musical palette. It feels more rooted in the Piedmont, thanks to a band that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun’s</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29649-phil-cook/"">Phil Cook</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30992-black-twig-pickers/"">Black Twig Picker</a> Nathan Bowles, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a>. Notwithstanding the album’s spiritual crisis, the best moments on <i>Haw</i> are also some of the most upbeat and celebratory. “I've Got a Name for the Newborn Child” bounces along on Scott Hirsch’s buoyant bassline; in the promise of a new family, the band channels an excitement that most artists reserve for romance. Likewise, Terry Lonergan’s scissoring high-hat beat lends some joyful pomp to “Sweet as John Hurt”, a tribute to the Mississippi bluesman. But Hiss Golden Messenger remains Taylor’s project, and he exhibits a folksy charisma in this central role. His voice flattens out the hard consonants and savors the softer vowels, suggesting a regional dialect from some dark Tarheel holler. He summons immense gravity for the dark “Devotion” just as easily as he conveys a sense of unburdening on “Busted Note”. Rarely does dark doubt sound quite so inviting. Taylor understands that faith-- in God, in music, in the flow of the Haw-- is more about the struggle than the resolution.</p></div>"|17819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17819-hiss-golden-messenger-haw/|8.0|Stephen M.

Like Bleached's sound, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dnhszniNUk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> pays homage to the retro cool of the Shangri-Las (motorcycles, leather jackets, ponytails), but it also mines the tension of that thematic split-screen Clavin mentions. It cuts between Jennifer, lounging around with her guy and joyriding on the back of his motorcycle, and bassist Jessica, causing all sorts of trouble at a party with her friends. Bleached aren't presenting romantic love and roguish independence as two mutually exclusive entities: In the video, both of them seem perfectly happy. But they communicate this same message more viscerally in the sound of their music, where sweet, manicured melodies and and pummeling, dirt-under-the-nails punk energy collide. It's one of the more commanding revisionist takes on the 60s girl group sound to come along in a minute.</p>
<p>The Clavins are best known as veterans of the beloved, now-defunct L.A. punk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8093-mika-miko/"">Mika Miko</a>, where they both cut more colorful figures than they do in Bleached: Jessica set the pace for the band's manic, pogoing, sped-up surf-rock rhythm section, while Jennifer's (better known then by her <i>Dracula</i>-esque stage name, Victor Fandgore) signature move was singing (though more often, screaming) into a rotary telephone rigged up like a mic. Three years after their break-up, Mika Miko's legend is established yet ephemeral; like so many underground heroes, they never made a record that quite captured the caterwauling craziness of their live show. Not that they cared: ""I think we come off better live than we do recorded,"" Jessica said in a 2009 <a href=""http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/mika-miko-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, ""It's better to have that impact as a live band though, isn't it?"" The rest of the band nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>It's kind of ironic, then, that <i>Ride Your Heart</i> succeeds precisely where the final Mika Miko album-- the spirited but thin-sounding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13010-we-be-xuxa/""><i>We Be Xuxa</i></a>-- failed: it manages to capture some of the infectious energy of the Clavins' live show. The difference is all in the production: <i>Ride Your Heart</i> is lush but still maintains a certain loose, inviting sloppiness, which suits the more upbeat songs particularly well. Opener ""Looking For a Fight"" lurches forward with a grumbling, belligerent swagger, while Jennifer's whiplashed howl on ""Next Stop"" (""Until next tiiiiiime"") makes the song feel like an adrenaline rush: It sounds like she's shouting the whole thing out of a convertible as it zips around a tight corner. Jennifer's vocals sound comparatively stiff and uninspired on ""Dreaming Without You"" (she doesn't find much emotion in the repeated refrain ""Baby, don't cry/ Baby, don't cry""), but the stomping percussion and guitar solo (which sounds straight out of a Flamin' Groovies track and cuts through like a beam of California sunshine) shakes the song out of its stupor.</p>
<p>Not every song on <i>Ride Your Heart</i> is so lucky. Bleached's songcraft often feels bland and unimaginative, relying on familiar, pop-worn imagery (""Waiting by the Telephone"") and generic declarations of love. (The inert ""Outta My Mind"" doesn't move far beyond its girl-group-revival-by-numbers hook, ""Get out of my mind, boy/ You know I think about you all of the time."") Though there's an electric current coursing through <i>Ride Your Heart</i>, it's too often wasted on mundane material-- which is especially disappointing given how zany and lyrically imaginative their previous band was. Hopefully more of that signature flair will creep into future Bleached releases: It's hard to be content with them waiting by the telephone when we've seen them scream into it.</p></div>"|17826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17826-bleached-ride-your-heart/|6.6|Lindsay Zoladz

The Montreal quartet’s fourth record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/58-until-in-excess-imperceptible-ufo/"" target=""_blank"">Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO</a>, </i>is no exception. The group’s co-auteurs, Jace Lasek and Olga Goreas, approach the construction of Besnard Lakes’ LPs with the same level of fastidiousness that Brian Wilson and Roger Waters displayed on masterworks of studiocraft like <i>Pet Sounds </i>and <i>Dark Side of the Moon. </i>Lasek and Goreas aren’t mere songwriters who produce pop tunes; they are <i>composers </i>who create <i>musical suites </i>out of sweepingly melodic <i>movements</i>. <i>Until in Excess </i>is the most “composed” Besnard Lakes’ album yet-- the band worked on different sections of the album’s eight songs, and shifted them around like puzzle pieces until achieving the perfect specimens of epic-osity that Lasek and Goreas heard echoing like an interstellar church choir in their heads.</p>
<p>Which is to say, <i>Until in Excess</i> more or less delivers on the “wow” factor one has come to expect from a Besnard Lakes album. As with 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9914-are-the-dark-horse/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Besnard Lakes are the Dark Horse </i></a>and 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13973-are-the-roaring-night/"" target=""_blank"">The Besnard Lakes are the Roaring Night</a>, Until in Excess </i>doesn’t skimp on the creamy vocal harmonies, booming drum rattles, cinematic strings swooshes, and wicked David Gilmour guitar solos that explode out of the murk with dependably dramatic elan. Well, actually, there aren’t <i>that </i>many guitar solos on <i>Until the Excess</i>: “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14793-people-of-the-sticks/"" target=""_blank"">People of the Sticks</a>” climaxes with some awe-inspiring six-string heroics by Lasek, as does the slow-building “Colour Yr Lights In”, where the squiggly arpeggios lift the anthemic chorus to the precipice of prog-rock nirvana. But aside from the heavy riffing that grinds throughout “At Midnight”, rock music takes a backseat to loftier ambitions on <i>Until in Excess. </i>Lasek and Goreas instead turn the uplifting expressiveness that Besnard Lakes is known for in on itself, fostering a mood of introspective melancholy on a series of slow, orchestral-like pieces.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Until in Excess </i>resembles “Catalina”, a beautiful slow-motion shoegazer symphony that lards on nearly two minutes of introductory new-age synths before easing into the glimmering, mid-tempo meat of the track. Besnard Lakes reliably fill the vastness of their huge-sounding music with immaculate musical ornamentation, and “Catalina” is a fine example of their impeccable Canadian architecture. (Look out for the dreamy surf-guitar accents laid out delicately in the mix that don’t make themselves fully discernible until the third or fourth listen.) “The Specter” is another stunner, opening with a splashy electric keyboard lick that soon gives way for exquisite guitar-driven counter-melodies and spectral mellotron washes. Neither track seems all that concerned with chorus-verse orderliness, which suits a record that favors atmosphere over punchy songs.</p>
<p>So, yes, <i>Until in Excess </i>is another Besnard Lakes’ album <i>album </i>that stubbornly demands to be absorbed all at once, from beginning to end. Other than “People of the Sticks”, the individual songs haven’t been designed to stick out from the whole; the deliberate pace makes the entirety of <i>Until in Excess</i> feel like one long, woozy track. While the winking title doesn’t exactly do the album justice-- it’s not as “excessive” so much as “dense”-- <i>Until in Excess </i>does lack some of the immediacy of Besnard Lakes’ other records. The album closing “Alamogordo” ends with three attention-killing minutes of ambient noise, finally wearing out the welcome for an otherwise captivating collection. For all its beauty, <i>Until in Excess </i>is a little draggy; the balance of ethereal grace and all-out force that distinguished their breakout <i>Dark Horse </i>has tipped a little too far to the ponderous side. <i>Until in Excess </i>rewards patience, but the roar of old is missed.</p></div>"|17749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17749-the-besnard-lakes-until-in-excess-imperceptible-ufo/|7.3|Steven Hyden

With this many shareholders come obligations, so despite the increasingly obvious and pressing personal needs of Dwayne Carter the man, Lil Wayne Inc. steamrolls forward, impervious to setbacks. When Carter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49920-lil-wayne-was-hospitalized-for-seizures-again/"" target=""_blank"">landed in the ICU</a> for six frightening days this month, after seizures that many assumed were related to his ongoing, years-documented problems with codeine addiction, his handlers smoothed things over with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50006-even-mack-maine-isnt-sure-it-was-actually-lil-wayne-who-sent-that-im-good-tweet-on-friday/"">the panicked dissembling</a> of hangers-on propping up an ailing dictator. After his release, Wayne <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50054-watch-lil-wayne-shares-raf-video-with-2-chainz-addresses-health-scare-in-a-message-to-fans/"">gave a thumbs up to TMZ cameras</a> to allay fears, announcing he was “better than good.” He did look good, but he also, tellingly, shrugged and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50054-watch-lil-wayne-shares-raf-video-with-2-chainz-addresses-health-scare-in-a-message-to-fans/"" target=""_blank"">offered this</a>: “My bum-ass album is coming out... March 26? It's 26?...You’re gonna get that shit or you won’t. If not, it’s whatever.”</p>
<p>This spirit of indifference hangs heavy on <i>I Am Not A Human Being II</i>. In his review of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tha Carter IV</i></a>, Ryan Dombal observed that ""after an epic run, it seems as though Wayne has finally run out of inventive ways to say he's on drugs, or great at sex, or extremely interested in making money,” and two years later, the prognosis has only grown more grim: No song on <i>II</i>is meaningfully distinguishable from the next. Everything pumps out in an undifferentiated slurry of interchangeable dick jokes, drug references, and lame puns. <i>Tha Carter IV</i> moved nearly a million copies in a single week, and this staggering success may have sealed Wayne’s artistic fate.</p>
<p>All of the quirks and peculiarities that once made Wayne great have hardened, six or seven years later, into nearly unbearable tics. All of his lyrics have devolved into barely rearranged little puzzles of themselves, with countless versions of his ""She ride/ Take this dick like ___” formulation, none of them funny or creative: On “IANAHB”, a woman takes it like “advice,” while others ride it like both ""go-karts"" and ""the Kentucky Derby"" on ""Curtains”. His tweaking of gangsta-rap’s language has never been more perfunctory. He sounds terminally bored, and even the better rap songs on here-- the hits, like the Mike Will Made It-produced, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>-and-Drake-featuring “Bitches Love Me” or the rubbery, Bay Area-influenced clap of “Rich As Fuck”-- work around him, not with him.</p>
<p>The only moments where Wayne sounds marginally interested in his own music come when he veers furthest away from rap. On “Romance”, he sings in his croaky, limber way about his profane version of love while Cool &amp; Dre’s synthesizers smear like bionic fireflies: “She kissed my ankle when I twist my ankle/ She even did anal when she don't do anal.” On the big, clomping pop rock of ""Back To You”, his voice is a shpritz of Lil Wayne on the surface of a towering club-pop production, the kind that mashes together the respective sugar highs of Euro club-pop, hair-metal, and synth pop into a glutinous ball (If you’re wondering whose sampled voice that is crooning at the bottom of all that mess, by the way, it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Lidell</a>’s.) This might not be the most promising future to ponder for Wayne’s music, but they’re the moments he sounds happiest: as a cog in a much bigger machine than himself, set free from being the all-consuming center for the first time.</p></div>"|17802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17802-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/|3.9|Jayson Greene

With rock music in its post-Cobain slump and hip-hop’s bling period in full swing, some people were certain that pop music’s next messiah would come out of what everyone was calling the “electronica” community, and Price seemed to fit the bill. After his 1995 debut album <i>Timeless</i> became the most popular drum'n'bass record yet, he was the biggest thing in the coolest kind of dance music, and with his acting roles, high-profile romantic relationship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, and distinctive futuristic gangster-punk image he displayed an obvious talent for doing superstar-ish things. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9719-noel-gallagher/"" target=""_blank"">Noel Gallagher</a>, who’s never been an outspoken fan of non-guitar-based music, appeared on his second album, a sprawling double album that underlined how well Price fit the established idea of a pop star.</p>
<p>But even though Price looked like a superstar and acted like a superstar, he didn’t sound like one. It’s not that he lacked for pop instincts-- his collaboration with Gallagher was an amply-hooked, razor-sharp fusion of drum'n'bass and punk rock-- his artistic vision was based around hard, uncompromising beats and grandiose aesthetic statements like songs with hour-long running times. He would have been the perfect premillennial video star, if only he wasn’t so intent on making music that would alienate MTV viewers.</p>
<p>Compared to the big, broad, gregarious sounds of big beat artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"" target=""_blank"">Fatboy Slim</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Chemical Brothers</a> who were doing the best job of selling mainstream American on electronic dance music, drum'n'bass seemed downright antisocial. The 160 BPM that the average d&amp;b track clocked in at was far outside the comfort zone for most pop ears, with breaks that were designed to keep a listener from getting too comfortable with a groove. And its makers and fans tended to prefer the shadows to the spotlight, both metaphorically and literally-- the London clubs the scene coalesced around were pioneers of anti-promotion, and their dance floors were often underlit to the point of near-total darkness.</p>
<p>And for all of his apparent pop ambition, Price was one of the biggest proponents of this aspect. The Metalheadz crew he headed up was considered the gold standard for bafflingly complex beats built with a minimum of moving parts and for basslines that dove down to frequencies that could only be reproduced on extremely high-end sound systems-- even then they were more felt than heard. Its skull-with-headphones logo served a role as something like the Jesus Fish for hardcore drum'n'bass freaks. Goldie may have wanted to go big, but only on his own radical terms.</p>
<p>It turned out that rock had at least one more comeback in it, Jay-Z and Missy Elliott had been just waiting for a chance to make hip-hop cooler and weirder than it had ever been, and the “electronica” revolution wouldn’t happen for another decade, by which time it had been rebranded “EDM.” drum'n'bass itself never got a foothold in America outside of car commercials and action movie chase sequences, and as the form mutated into 2-step and dubstep Price slowed his previously hectic release schedule back to a trickle and devoted himself to appearing on a variety of British reality TV shows.</p>
<p>Drum'n'bass is overdue for a real revival, though. In the wake of dubstep getting Skrillex-ified a few producers tried heading back to the genre’s antecedent, but the movement never managed to reach critical mass. The two discs of the new anthology <i>The Alchemist: The Best of Goldie 1992-2012</i> covering the span of Price’s career make a compelling argument that the world may finally be ready for him.</p>
<p>Disc two, which emphasizes Price’s jazzier, more tuneful side is decent. In his mellower moments he indulges in a taste for 70s soul, but he often verges on smooth jazz, and his choice in vocalists runs toward the workmanlike. The third disc, which collects remixes of his work done by other artists, has more than its fair share of moments, although few feel essential. But it’s the first disc, focussing on his darker, more hard-edged material, where Price’s considerable allure snaps back into focus after years of looking increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>Some of drum'n'bass’ appeal has always been its potential to overwhelm the listener, usually through its hyperfast breakbeats and physically aggressive sub bass. The first disc of <i>The Alchemist</i>, though, is stunning in its gracefulness. Price balances the style’s assertive elements with slashes of ambient atmospherics, its headbanging tendencies with dubby mellow vibes, and a particular kind of deeply nocturnal feel that’s frequently referred to as “icy” with a warm human heartbeat. It’s the rare career retrospective that not only sounds good for the time it was recorded during, but sounds good for right now.</p>
<p>Listening to a track like 1992’s “Terminator”, credited to his Rufige Kru, it’s obvious why Price never became the megastar some people hoped he’d be. The song has grace and balance, but repeatedly alternates between a hyperspeed beat based on the Amen break and drawn-out moments of ambient freefall, teasing the listener with rhythmic feints and jabs that won’t let them find their balance. By the time a cluster of ravey synth stabs drops in halfway through it almost seems like a taunt, a reminder of the relative normalcy of an average house track. It’s a mean song, but it’s so well designed that being batted around by it is a pleasure. And after two decades after its release it doesn’t sound any less alien, or any less perfect.</p></div>"|17705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17705-goldie-the-alchemist-the-best-of-goldie-1992-2012/|8.4|Miles Raymer

When singer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Lewis Rainsbury told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9052-vondelpark/"">Pitchfork</a>'s Ryan Dombal that Rainsbury, guitarist/bassist Alex Bailey, and keyboardist Matt Law are ""really the first band"" on electronic-oriented Belgian label R&amp;S, he wasn't kidding about the band part. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/54-seabed/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seabed</i></a> is the fullest realization yet of the project's immersive smoothness, but what helps Vondelpark's debut album stand out in a deluge of <a href=""https://twitter.com/diplo/status/169559531951624192"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Radiohead quietstorm""</a> is that full-band quality, the organic fluidity of a unit who've been playing together for years.</p>
<p>These days Vondelpark are so unhurried it's almost counterproductive. <i>Seabed</i> arrives at a time when late-night, half-lit, occasionally blue-eyed R&amp;B, often with the disembodied samples and digital silences of UK bass music, has grown so abundant it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to throw up your hands and go back to old Sade and Burial records instead. But Vondelpark's gradually acquired sense of restraint is so crucial to the album that its slightly overdue release timing feels symbolically appropriate, like the bass that falls behind the beat throughout D'Angelo's surrealistic-soul touchstone <i>Voodoo</i>. When you're eyeing the long haul, there's no rush.</p>
<p><i>Seabed</i> stretches out in a state of ecstatically aching limbo, gazing at the groove instead of shoes. The record's expansive sense of chronology manifests its in the first seconds of swaying ethereal opener ""Quest"", as Rainsbury, in his mumbly croon, keeps doubling back over his thoughts about growing old and flying to the moon. The title track describes a melancholy romantic holding pattern-- ""I won't say it, if you won't say it ... You will realize""-- as subdued synth-funk cycles toward its own just-out-of-reach epiphany. The largely beatless ""Closer"", where Rainsbury vows he's ""never getting off this rollercoaster,"" conjures a weightlessness that's more astronaut than amusement-park free-fall. </p>
<p>In true Vondelpark style, <i>Seabed</i> is less a vast improvement on its predecessors than a subtle refinement. ""California Analog Dream"", reworked from 2010's <i>Sauna </i>EP, adds ghostly harmonica and a more pristinely recorded acoustic guitar, bringing the song's San Diego fantasy closer to classic 1980s UK indie-pop. But the dubwise horns and beatific bongos of 2011's <i>nyc stuff and nyc bags </i>EP, itself more polished than the debut, quite rightly led Pitchfork's Hari Ashurst to cite the sadly defunct Air France, who also mixed indie-pop vulnerability with sonic luxuriance. The pacific glow of Aretha Franklin-sampling ""Bananas (On My Biceps)"" has little more than a title in common with <i>Sauna</i>'s grittier ""Backflip (In the Sauna)"", but the clean keys and distended drums of ""Outro 4 Ariel"" wouldn't be out of place on <i>nyc stuff</i>'s ""Outro for NYC"".</p>
<p>Rainsbury, Bailey, and Law showed long ago that they could draw a crowd with a bold gesture, but <i>Seabed</i>'s appeal after multiple listens is in its details. Bailey told <a href=""http://issuu.com/londoninstereo/docs/april2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">London in Stereo</a> his favorite song on the record is ""Blue Again"", a mood piece with melismatic, near-incomprehensible vocals, a crisp drum pattern that comes perilously close to smooth jazz, and a strangely familiar, pinging sound that's like an Apple computer telling you the cursor has gone too far. ""Dracula"", which submerges itself in sub-bass-y self-loathing, is no less appealing. But the most enduring track might also be the record's most overtly romantic: ""Always Forever"", a Drake-inspired dip into <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/mellow-mellow-15th-anniversary-crystal-edition-mw0002138063"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mellow Mellow</i></a> territory, where lyrical ""tripping"" suggests lovestruck clumsiness as much as psychedelics, and Rainsbury's ""just saying"" that you're having, he's having, a time (<i>the</i> time?) ""of your life,"" so ""go on."" Much the same could be hoped for this studied young band.</p></div>"|17667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17667-vondelpark-seabed/|7.8|Marc Hogan

The label's grown to be regarded as a great educator in global beats and dance cultures: Hispanic traditions of cumbia and bachata, Jamaican dancehall, Angolan kuduro, and so on. In turn, Dutty Artz has developed a reputation for fostering older, lesser recognized sounds, and fusing them together to build something new and relevant. Often their DJs are informally delegated the task of exploring their own musical roots; Chief Boima is a stan in African dance music, Geko and Uproot Andy are well versed in Latin music. And with <i>The </i><i>Empire Never Ended</i>, Matt Shadetek, born and raised in New York City, puts aside his wide-cast net to release an album of hip-hop instrumentals.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though surprising at first, it's not an entirely offbeat turn. Shadetek has been revisiting his love of hip-hop over the last year, releasing “Giddy Up”, a self-described banjee rap track starring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>, and “La Vida Loca” with Fabolous and Pusha T collaborator, up-and-comer Troy Ave. The latter makes it onto the album and its piercing, soaring synth wails and big orchestral melodies serve as a primer for the record's larger theme. A product of the early days of New York hip-hop, clubbing at legendary drum-n-bass, jungle, dubstep, and garage party Konkrete Jungle, and a stint living in Berlin, Shadetek hasn’t entirely succumbed to any single trend or genre. He has, however, beefed up his drum machines with snares and hi-hats instead of dem-bow riddims and reggae grooves, and taken a few stylistic notes from Lex Luger to make a hip-hop record with horizons wider than just New York City. He does so with flair.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A large chunk of this album contains trap instrumentals, but Shadetek chooses subtlety in place of someone like Waka's in-your-face approach, turning the collection into a psychedelic journey that’s best for headphone listening. On opener “Visions”, a muddied voice chants as fluttering bleeps accent the trudging drums. “Jaguar” plays out similarly, but with added menace. “Logos” turns rolling snares and syncopated bass kicks into a cinematic scoring for a grim walk through city streets-- then unexpectedly launches into a frenetic dancehall riddim played out via buzzing, pitched-down synths while pushing the snares and bass toward rollicking insanity. Then there’s “Madness”, one of the album’s highlights and a testament to Shadetek’s production know-how. (He also teaches production at NYC’s Dubspot DJ school.) It’s a gorgeously lush orchestration where bloated wubs of bass bolster forlorn synths and a kick-drum. The warped vocal loop becomes a stoner's anthem and a drunken, lovelorn sentiment in one.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As far as the tracks with actual MCs rapping over the instrumentals, ""Psychomatic"", featuring Chan Dizzy and Stratdon, plays out as a dubstep-infected take on R&amp;B. And then there's Riff Raff, whose appearance on ""Bout It Girl"" is wildly confusing but somehow makes the song a standout of the 12 tracks. Its druggy, screwed hook and minimal snaps make the perfect background to Raff's sharp lines, like ""Pop a pill with either hand/ I'm ambidextrous."" Let's not forget that DJ/rupture put out an album with James Franco a few years back. Organized confusion is part of the point here: The album’s title comes from Philip K. Dick’s <i>Valis</i>, in which the author falls into crisis over the basic nature of reality and meaning. This thing has come full circle.</p></div>"|17791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17791-matt-shadetek-the-empire-never-ended/|6.8|Puja Patel

Their third full-length, <i>Heza</i>, takes their knack for writing bright, melodically-charged pop songs, but tones down the boisterousness of its predecessor, their 2011 high-water mark, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15260-actor-caster/"" target=""_blank""><i>Actor-Caster</i></a>. </p>
<p>That album grabbed you with its unabashed cheeriness; when that became too obnoxious, the more emotionally complex lyrical themes acted as something of a humanizing balm. <i>Heza</i> goes for understatement from the off, with single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14733-spinoza/"" target=""_blank"">""Spinoza""</a>, a tightly-wound bit of guitar rock that succeeds because of its reluctance to overdo anything.</p>
<p>But the same reluctance means that much of the material on <i>Heza</i> blurs together. ""Kemal"" teases at a tropical vibe but doesn't really commit; ""Extra Free Year"" earns some extra mileage out of an alien synth pattern, but in general feels flat.</p>
<p>As the album wears on, Generationals often feel like they are going through the motions. While their formerly peppy mode could be exhausting, it's difficult not to yearn for a bit more razzle-dazzle on <i>Heza</i>. True, the album's careful production, inventive percussion, and refreshing marriage of organic and electronic sounds hint at an impressive confidence that's still very much a part of the pair's personality. But they're still a competent, talented, charming band instead of a truly memorable one.</p></div>"|17818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17818-generationals-heza/|6.4|Zach Kelly

Another kind of delta is the home of a strain of blues that's associated with more intense emotion and simpler technology than the synth-pop that made Depeche Mode famous. They got interested in playing with that kind a couple of decades ago, and it served them well, at first.</p>
<p>But the partnership of singer David Gahan and songwriter Martin Gore can't escape the machine they've become, or the holding pattern they've gotten stuck in. (And then there's third member Andy Fletcher, who...<span>Anyway!</span>) The last album they made with more than two songs that have persisted in their live repertoire was <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i> in 1993. Since then, they've been on a steady regimen of releasing a studio record every fourth year, followed by a tour where they play a whole lot of songs from the era when <i>Designing Women</i> was on the air.</p>
<p><i>Delta Machine</i>, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2285-playing-the-angel/"" target=""_blank""><i>Playing the Angel</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12940-sounds-of-the-universe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sounds of the Universe</i> </a>before it, was produced by Ben Hillier, includes three songs with lyrics by Gahan, and sounds like it could be a set of outtakes from <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>. The word ""soul"" appears in five of Gore's songs here, not including ""Angel"" or ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49369-listen-new-depeche-mode-single-heaven/"" target=""_blank"">Heaven</a>"" (which shouldn't be confused with the earlier ""Halo"" or ""Judas"" or ""Sacred"" or ""Jezebel"" or ""Martyr""). It's old news that Gore's favorite lyrical topic is sin and salvation, and that's historically been a pretty fertile topic for songwriting in general. Unfortunately, there's no line here as sly as ""Strangelove""'s ""I give in to sin/ Because you have to make this life livable,"" and no sense that Gore's idea of sin extends to anything other than mildly kinky sex.</p>
<p>Then there's the blues stuff, i.e. loops of bluesy guitar licks, as on ""Goodbye"" (which might just as well be called ""Personal Jesus XIV: The Personalizing""). Another one turns up in ""Slow"", repeating endlessly as Gahan sings Gore's lyrics about taking it nice and easy in bed these days. The requisite Gore vocal here, ""The Child Inside"", might have the most embarrassing extended metaphor he's committed to date (tears turn into a river that overflows and drowns the loved one's <i>inner child</i>?). As for Gahan's own songs-- this time, their music is by Kurt Uenala-- they're generally a reasonably convincing imitation of middling Gore. His ""Should Be Higher"" is yet another on the pile of ex-junkie lyrics; his ""Broken"" is a pale Silly Putty copy of ""Behind the Wheel"".</p>
<p>It's not a totally dull record. Gahan and Gore are singing as well and hyperdramatically as they ever have. ""My Little Universe"" is a clever piece of minimalism, constructed around a bare handful of acid-synth riffs-- effectively a companion piece to their 30-year-old ""Leave in Silence"". ""Soft Touch/Raw Nerve"" is catchy enough that its rhyme of ""helping hand"" with ""understand"" is forgivable. ""Angel"" will sound pretty good on their next greatest-hits collection, as long as they don't sequence it too close to ""I Feel You"".</p>
<p>Still, what made Depeche Mode work, when they worked, wasn't just the contrast between Gore's dry detachment and Gahan's dorky innocence (up to, let's say, <i>Music for the Masses</i>) and the late-breaking badassery that replaced it (from <i>Violator</i> onward). It was their constant pushing forward of their sound-- expanding the vocabulary of what electronics could do in pop songs. Their records were packed with cross-talking hooks, ingeniously knotted melodies, noises that blurred the border between pitch and percussion. They made rules for themselves, which made it more fun when they broke them.</p>
<p>But they stopped pushing forward long ago, and now they don't even bother pretending technology has opened up any possibilities for recorded sound in the past 20 years. Now they're just extruding a new album once in a while, reconfiguring the grooves and keywords of the albums from the period when they were a force in pop, without the push toward new noises and uncertain feelings that made that music powerful. There is not a single moment of shock or freshness on <i>Delta Machine</i>, and it's enormously frustrating to hear what was once a band of futurists so deeply mired in resisting change.</p></div>"|17792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17792-depeche-mode-delta-machine/|5.0|Douglas Wolk

A pioneering figure in minimalism and an influential member of the 1980s Downtown New York scene, Eastman studied at the Curtis Institute, sang with Meredith Monk on <i>Dolmen Music,</i> sat on symposia with Morton Feldman and John Cage. He also battled alcoholism and crack addiction and lived the last months of his life homeless, rattling between Manhattan's Tompkins Square Park and a shelter in Buffalo. When he passed away, alone, some of his closest friends and associates did not know of his death until months afterward. The potted-history of his life story is of a promising, mercurial talent who thrashed himself apart trying to live too many contradictions.</p>
<p>A black, gay man rattling around loudly in the white, constrained world of classical music, Eastman was a living testament to unbounded American opportunity and woeful American inequality. To describe him in stridently political language is not to hang an unwanted frame around him; Eastman saw himself this way, and discussed his music and life explicitly in those terms. He was, by most accounts, an acrid, seething, and occasionally impossible man, a temperament you can detect in his music as far away as the titles themselves: ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich"". ""Evil Nigger"". ""Gay Guerrilla"". The language was so acidic it ate away at the concert-hall universe like stomach lining, a fitting gesture for someone who saw as much rank hypocrisy as opportunity within its walls.</p>
<p>This is a difficult, self-annihilating temperament to pay proper tribute to. On <i>The Julius Eastman Memory Depot</i>, Jace Clayton-- better and more-often known as DJ/rupture-- goes about it exactly the right way. ""Reverence can be a kind of forgetting,"" he writes in the album's liner notes, and <i>Memory Depot</i> meets Eastman on his own slanted playground, toasting to acid with acid.""Evil Nigger"" and ""Gay Guerrilla"", two solo piano pieces from 1979, form the core of the album, performed here by David Friend and Emily Manzo. Clayton feeds the results of their performances directly into his laptop and scrambles them, spitting out a third stream of input that is often altered beyond recognition. You can never quite tell, listening to the album, where the sounds are originating; the sound is a tempest with no center. The result honors the intentions behind Eastman's trickster spirit to the point that Clayton and Eastman seem very much to be making this music together in real time.</p>
<p>Clayton's take on ""Evil Nigger"" begins with a stammering single note on piano that gets its resonance choked off, until it's just a hammer hitting in dead space. The piece's smallest piece of DNA is a jittery, repetitive nervous trill, and Clayton sends this little figure through a series of frightening transformations: the trill jingles like glass shards in a grocery bag in the second, dissipates into queasy smoke in the third, flits through irradiated air like mutant fireflies in the fourth. In the fourth movement, it's nearly swallowed by a forbidding boom of undertones that well up from the echo of the piano's foot pedals; Clayton pans this roar back and forth in your headphones until it sounds like an air raid. The effect is not so much ""prepared piano"" as ""piano cut free from the time/space continuum.""</p>
<p>The second work Clayton dissects, ""Gay Guerrilla"", has the name of a manifesto, and Eastman once said of its title, ""Without blood there is no cause. I use 'Gay Guerrilla' in hopes that <i>I</i> might be one, if called up to be one."" But the piece, which contains a reinterpretation of the Martin Luther hymn ""A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,"" feels less like a call to arms than a meditation. Leaning hard into the piano pedals, pianists Friend and Manzo build a calmly hurtling sense of forward motion that is similar to John Adams' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opj_bcAahp4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hallelujah Junction</a>"". As the sound of the piano starts to leech out bits of its essence in the recording, it becomes, steadily, a music of ghosts. Considering both the state of the NYC gay community during Eastman's life, and how Eastman spent the last few years of his own, the feeling is mournfully appropriate.</p>
<p>Clayton contributes one original piece to<i> Julius Eastman Memory Depot</i>. The ""Callback from the American Society of Eastman Supporters"" posits a different outcome for the memory of Julius Eastman, a world where supporters of Eastman are so legion that they are turned away via robo-call. ""The Julius Eastman Memorial Dinner is an equal-opportunity employer,"" the narrator (sung by Sufi vocalist Arooj Aftab) chirps brightly, before the piece breaks open into a cool-blue drone and meditation. ""Regardless of age, regardless of race, regardless of color, regardless of creed and disability, sexual orientation, political affiliation"" Aftab sings, searchingly. It is a supremely Julius-Eastman moment, a short sharp bark of wry laughter fading into dead seriousness, and it caps Clayton's searingly immediate communion with Eastman's vital, contrary spirit.</p></div>"|17803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17803-jace-clayton-the-julius-eastman-memory-depot/|7.8|Jayson Greene

No matter what Lerner is singing about, it all comes out sounding clean, winsome, and <i>nice. </i>It’s a good voice for the music he makes as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27725-telekinesis/"" target=""_blank"">Telekinesis</a>-- the power-pop blueprint has long relied on boyish dudes who can turn their inner misery into sunny songs, and Lerner’s pipes puts him squarely in the tradition of brooding tunesmiths like Matthew Sweet and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1544-fountains-of-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Fountains of Wayne’</a>s Chris Collingwood. But Lerner’s soft tenor also tends to cleanse his music of any semblance of tension or grit or personality.</p>
<p>Telekinesis’ third album <i>Dormarion </i>is Lerner’s best, most bountifiul to date. At 35 minutes, it’s the longest Telekinesis record by approximately 150 seconds. Sonically, Lerner veers into synth-pop on alluring tracks like the billowy “Ghosts and Creatures” and the near-danceable “Ever True”, and flirts with toned-down hard rock on the magnetic start-stop riff of “Little Hill”. Trading in Chris Walla (who produced the first two Telekinesis LPs) for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"" target=""_blank"">Spoon</a>’s Jim Eno, Lerner has made <i>Dormarion </i>sound grander and tougher than his old records; he’s looking outside his modest melodic pop-rock for the first time while adding some heft to his always solid melodies. In the studio, Lerner handles almost all of the instruments (though Eno supplies his Bonham-like timekeeping to several tracks), but <i>Dormarion </i>sounds like it was conceived for his road band. As grabby as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>-like “Wires” is on record, the big drums and insinuating bassline ought to get hips swinging when Telekinesis plays it live.</p>
<p>Musically, Lerner has broadened his range of dynamics. But tonally, <i>Dormarion </i>is a little flat. Opening track “Power Lines” has the standard Telekinesis structure: A quiet acoustic verse, an explosive chorus, and Lerner’s sweet vocal confessing bitter truths. “I’m a broken man,” he sings. “I’m damaged goods.” Several tracks later, the low-key jangler “Lean on Me” is selling fantasies of idealized domestic bliss: “We could cross the country in our beat-up truck/ stopping every minute because the thing don’t run/ but I don’t care because we’re in love.” Lerner’s delivery is the same on both songs-- happy or sad, he sounds blank. He’s like a narrator with no vocal inflections, which makes accessing something resembling an emotional core beyond the surface beauty of the songs very difficult.</p>
<p>If <i>Dormarion </i>is a record of superficial pleasures, at least those pleasures are considerable. As a craftsman, Lerner must be counted among the best young pop songwriters working in contemporary indie rock. At his best, like on “Wires”, he offers a wealth of hooks in the verse, chorus, and bridge. There’s no question he can put a good tune together; what’s less clear is whether he can interpret those tunes as well as he writes them, and breathe a little flesh-and-blood human messiness into them in the process.</p></div>"|17748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17748-telekinesis-dormarion/|6.9|Steven Hyden

The Essex native, born Stuart Howard, showed himself to be a savvy deconstructionist on a pair of 2012 EPs. He took the raw ingredients of offbeat pop songs--melodic backbone, diaphonous vocals, clattering drumlines-- and shuffled them to create IDM tracks that felt inventive and accessible. He's using similar tricks on his debut album <i>Nostalchic</i>, while moving from deconstructed pop to a more relaxed brand of R&amp;B and soul, both genres that complement Howard's consistent interest in texture.</p>
<p>On Lapalux’s first two Brainfeeder projects, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16329-when-youre-gone-ep/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>When You’re Gone</i></a> and <i>Some Other Time</i>, you could hear the 25-year old producer cautiously experimenting with new ideas, working within traditional structures even as he experimented with outré sounds. He’s more confident on <i>Nostalchic</i>, walking the line between chaos and stability to create a sound that resembles a jittery, discombobulated version of chillwave. Brainfeeder's Hip-Hop Beats N' Bass blueprint is still present, but it isn't the focus on the album. Instead, on tracks like the back-to-back standouts ""Flower"" and ""Swallowing Smoke"", Howard's working with a hundred little slivers of the same core melody, rearranging them again and again by attaching them to different portions of the beat until, by the end of the song, they fit together smoothly. It's sampling as fine art-- as precise and painstaking as a mosaic.</p>
<p>With all these separate elements floating around, it's possible for things to get a little too messy. ""Kelly Brook"" is muddled and unpleasant, shot through with sounds that don't make sense with each other. It's as if the pieces of several different songs were never properly separated and it’s one of the few moments on the album where Howard doesn’t appear to be in total control.</p>
<p>Vocalists appear throughout <i>Nostalchic</i>, serving as amplified versions of their sampled counterparts from the guest-free tracks. Though Jenna Andrews has a strong showing on the languorous “One Thing” and Kerry Leatham’s distorted voice adds depth to the standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15076-lapalux-without-you-ft-kerry-leatham/"">“Without You”</a>, Lapalux is actually his own most reliable performer. On “Walking Words” he's familiar enough with the beat to insert what sounds like his own murmurs and distortion directly into the spaces available and his vocal ends up mimicking the track's motion perfectly.</p>
<p>With a name like <i>Nostalchic</i>, you might assume that Howard is trying to conjure something from the past, to produce the sonic equivalent of immaculate vintage clothing. The sentiments expressed on the album are in keeping with that concept: the lyrics, where they exist, tend to keep things simple with messages like “Do you want to dance?” and “I want to make love.” But, keeping solidly in line with the Brainfeeder tradition, <i>Nostalchic</i> is a forward-looking album, warm and comfortable but never obvious. </p></div>"|17795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17795-lapalux-nostalchic/|7.4|Jonah Bromwich

That urgency would eventually yield the first recordings of Muddy Waters and Honeyboy Edwards, and the first recordings of Son House since his Paramount days, but it’s hard not to feel like Lomax’s desperation-- for ferocity, inventiveness, some kind of rapture-- was probably best assuaged by his discovery of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sid+Hemphill"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sid Hemphill</a>, the so-called “boar-hog musician of the hills,” a fiddler and string band-leader once described to Lomax as “the best musician in the world.”</p>
<p>Lomax found Hemphill in Senatobia, deep in Mississippi’s Hill Country. He’d driven across a crumbling bridge and approached a “sagging, unpainted door on a weathered-gray, warping house.” Before he could knock, Hemphill, then 65, swung it open. “No one had told me that Sid Hemphill was blind, but it was the last thing you’d recall about him,” Lomax explained. “His face blazed with inner light.”</p>
<p>On August 15, 1942, Lomax committed 15 tracks by Hemphill and his backing band (Lucius Smith, Alec “Turpentine” Askew, and Will Head) to acetate disc. Hemphill never recorded commercially, and only Lomax’s field recordings of his work are extant-- meaning that unless you knew a guy (shoddy cassette tapes of Hemphill’s songs, sourced from Lomax’s discs, have been spotted in the damp palms of 78 collectors for decades, passed about like contraband), <i>The Devil’s Dream</i> is the first time anyone has been properly able to access or disseminate Hemphill’s brain-scrambling yawp. The album’s release this month, over 70 years after its creation-- as a download through the <a href=""http://www.culturalequity.org/features/globaljukebox/ce_features_globaljukebox.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alan Lomax Archive’s Global Jukebox</a> imprint, or on LP via <a href=""http://www.forcedexposure.com/labels/mississippi.records.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mississippi Records</a>-- feels both long overdue and right on time.</p>
<p>Hemphill’s masterwork is “The Carrier Line”, a rambling, six-minute blues ballad about the owner of a local logging railroad and the engineer who ran his train too fast. “You want me to put the whole 21 verses in it?” Hemphill asks Lomax before raising his fiddle and announcing himself. “Sid Hemphill! ""Carrier Song"" was made and played by him, his band!”</p>
<p>There is a wildness to Hemphill’s voice and playing that feels undeniable if not fully singular-- every note is vehement, as if it were stampeded into being, as if it might trample you, too, if you don’t start running. Those propulsive, impatient rhythms make “The Carrier Line” feel literal, like an actual train is hurtling towards Hemphill and his band, only Hemphill is too fearless, too punk rock, to flee or even flinch. Elsewhere, Hemphill’s giddiness at playing and being recorded is evident in his voice, and in the half-intelligible yarns he appears to find deeply hilarious. (“Arkansas Traveler” concerns a kid digging a hole and yellow corn and we-don’t-need-no-supper-in-Arkansas; the punch-line is Hemphill shouting “I know a place!” and <i>it’s always funny</i>, for reasons that remain unclear to me, but don’t much matter.) “Keep My Skillet Good and Greasy” is a raunchy, shambling ode to unflappable libido, and it features a heartbreaking (and unexpected) exchange between two of Hemphill’s backers, one of whom is so out of tune he temporarily stops playing (“You must be scared?” a voice asks. There’s a pause. “You must be scared.”)</p>
<p>Hemphill’s work incorporates attributes of the Mississippi Hill Country’s better-known traditions (the droning guitar blues mastered by McDowell, R.L. Burnside, and Junior Kimbrough, and the fife-and-drum music practiced by Otha Turner, Napolian Strickland, and Hemphill himself), but part of its pre-eminence concerns its inimitability. The title-track, which features vocals, a bass drum, and quills (a handmade instrument crafted from cane reeds that sounds a little like a panpipe, only flatter and more rudimentary) is a battle cry; Hemphill whoops and wheezes like a feral child lost in a shopping mall. It’s hard to imagine a more fundamentally exhilarating three minutes of music.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to lament Hemphill’s relative obscurity, and his subsequent lack of a professional oeuvre: The exuberance of his performance that day (and it is a performance, rendered heartily and with intention) can sometimes obscure his extraordinary acumen as a songwriter, and there are all the expected fidelity issues (Hemphill and his band are often positioned in awkward proximity to the microphone, and are prone to vaguely acrimonious mid-song chit-chat). The songs themselves contain a preposterous numbers of verses, and aren’t short on impious bits.</p>
<p>But then there’s Hemphill, capable of the sorts of noises only generated in extraordinarily compromised positions, of reflecting our most unruly, un-tempered, subsumed exaltations-- and even then, they don’t ever sound this ecstatic. Or this free.</p></div>"|17862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17862-sid-hemphill-the-devils-dream-alan-lomaxs-1942-library-of-congress-recordings/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

His music, from his early hip-hop moment through to his minimal techno heyday, has always been suffused with warm psychedelic colour. He brings that touch to his renowned remixes, where he reshapes the tracks of others in ways that would seem totally foreign to most. His first solo album in nine years, <i>Amygdala</i> appears after a quiet period that produced only 2009’s remix retrospective <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12769-reincarnations-the-remix-chapter-2001-2009/"" target=""_blank"">Reincarnations</a>,</i> and the founding of his own Pampa imprint. The German producer’s newest original work retains the quirky spirit of <i>Reincarnations</i> but settles into a kaleidoscopic landscape.</p>
<p>In a quote that’s been haunting <i>Amygdala</i>, Koze has apparently claimed the LP as his <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>. Hubris aside, that’s not such an unfair comparison. Both records rethink their respective genres from the ground-up, using elements and instruments that seem unusual on first glance but quietly lay the foundation for subtle reinvention. While it’s not likely to set the world on fire, dig beneath the pastel sheen and <i>Amygdala</i> is uncommonly engrossing for a techno album. Its visionary ambition recalls the fertile sprawl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Villalobos</a>’ 2003 debut <i>Alcachofa; </i>baroque techno blessed with the carefree spirit of lounge music and Quiet Storm, dressed up in tie-dye, the music on <i>Amygdala </i>glows with an easy confidence.</p>
<p><i>Amygdala </i>feels like a painting made up of delicate brushstrokes compared to techno’s laser-cut precision. Kozalla often chooses softly expressive horns or lolling organ over electronics, as on the plush spring overture of “Royal Asscher Cut”, and numerous vocal features only add to the effect. For an artist who has spoken on record how he hates collaborating, over half of <i>Amygdala</i>’s tracks have a “feature” credit as he brings out a cast of charismatic vocalists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>'s Dan Snaith to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Dear</a>. The dips into German balladry via his retouch of the classic Hildegard Knef lament “Ich Schreib’ Dir Ein Buch”, or his own heartworn slow-jam “Das Wort”, contribute to the the hallucinatory haze of styles and voices, like scrambling through a radio dial on mushrooms.</p>
<p>Koze has always had a predilection for looping microscopic vocal fragments as the chief anchor for his songs. But now these ghostly voices coexist with the fleshed-out songwriting; on “Das Wort” they provide a sugary counterpoint to Dirk Von Lowtzow’s gruff German consonants, and on “Ich Schreib’ Dir ein Buch 2013”, a Motown choir’s rendition of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” is twisted into a sickly tapestry of moans and screeches. Overstuffed and overfed, each track is an embarrassment of riches with a hook or melodic morsel everywhere you look, but Kozalla never loses the plot in the overflow of ideas.</p>
<p>That’s probably why <i>Amygdala</i> feels so accomplished: songwriting. It’s not something we often think too hard about in dance music. But Koze considers every aspect, from hummable melodies to pristine soundscapes to lyrics. Wisely leaning away from dance music cliches of love and desire, <i>Amygdala’</i>s subjects veer from everyday life to grappling with nostalgia and self-identity. Its most charming moment comes with Matthew Dear’s quirky vocal spot on “My Plans”. In a typically alien cadence, Dear addresses the anxiety of a world where everything seems to be going wrong with the cheeky line: “When I notice the world is falling apart/ I will run a bath/ And why does this make me laugh?” It’s a fine motto for Koze himself, never losing sight of his infectious sense of humour or complete resistance to trends. With <i>Amygdala,</i> he's created an album that invites obsession. </p></div>"|17793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17793-dj-koze-amygdala/|8.6|Andrew Ryce

He didn’t pine for the A-lister referrals and feature circuit ubiquity that lubricate the most well-oiled artist rollouts. He didn’t hobnob with hitmakers or kowtow to the will of radio. Instead he launched into an exploratory series of experiments: a romance-themed solo EP that introduced him as a quirky but capable producer, a one-track dump of inscrutable rough mixes for an album he lost, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>-produced album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45486-madlib-and-blu-release-surprise-album-sort-of/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib denies involvement with</a>, and a spattering of beat tapes. Much of it arrived defiantly unmastered under pseudonyms on Bandcamp, and none of it sounded like the triumphant follow-up to <i>Below the Heavens</i>, whose legacy now stalked Blu’s every endeavor.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It wasn’t until Blu had successfully conditioned his audience to quit telegraphing his next move that he made his power play: reports from 2011’s traveling hip-hop festival Rock the Bells said that Blu showed up to his set handing out copies of something called <i>NoYork!</i> that may or may not have been the ill-fated Warner album. (Blu denies doing it, but the Warner deal dissolved several weeks later.) However <i>NoYork!</i> slipped out, it was a hard left turn in a career full of them, but one that reinvigorated his artistry instead of adroitly maintaining a low profile as previous releases had. Over the last year or so, Blu has been remastering and reissuing some of the odd curios of the Warner era, and <i>NoYork!</i> has finally gotten a physical deluxe edition release via Blu &amp; his producer buddy Mainframe’s New World Color imprint. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If this is the album Blu intended to give Warner, it’s a maverick move. <i>NoYork!</i> finds Blu tapping a cadre of California instrumental hip-hop luminaries and decamping into the hyperkinetic synth haze and shambolic percussion of the Los Angeles beat scene. <i>NoYork!</i>’s team of <i>Low End Theory</i> mainstays load up the album’s front end with squelching synth workouts like Dibia$e’s “SLNGBNGrs”, which arrives like Pac-Man on power pellets and rides a corroded keyboard groove to a chaotic finish, the dizzying synth undulations of “Soupa”, and the double-time borderline Nintendocore of Daedelus’s jungle-informed “Hours” and Flying Lotus’s “Everything’s OK”. Later, Knxwledge and Sa-Ra affiliate Shafiq Husayn bring us home from the arcade with a series of productions full of airy jazz loops, but as a whole <i>NoYork!</i> is a manic trip into an 8-bit k-hole.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>NoYork!</i> manages to duck other releases’ air of intentional self-sabotage thanks to Blu’s renewed lyrical attack. Where releases like 2011’s <i>j e s u s</i> were off-putting because the rhymes tumbled out in fractious fits and starts, oftentimes more chants than verses, <i>NoYork!</i> strikes a balance between the verbose storytelling of <i>Below the Heavens </i>and the studious weirdness of his recent work. “Everybody Nose” details a childhood hip-hop obsession that turned into a rap career, then devolves into a list of beloved 1980s clothing lines and rappers in verse three. Blu bounces wistful rhymes and love raps off sung choruses from Jack Davey and Suzi Analogue early on and then coldly juggles words with friends on the album closing West Coast rap summit “Doin’ Something”. Elsewhere singsong refrains about hating work hold court with nonsensical homages to the cadence and storytelling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF Doom</a>. <i>NoYork!</i>’s rhyme experiments are rangy but self-assured, and Blu finally sounds more invested in making great rap than throwing the mainstream rap audience off his trail.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Billing this physical release of <i>NoYork!</i> as a deluxe edition is a bit misleading, though. It’s actually shorter than what’s been circulating on the net for the last year and a half, losing the Madlib and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22490-samiyam/"" target=""_blank"">Samiyam</a> productions (and the feature from psych rap recluse Edan) that padded out the album’s hazy comedown side but gaining a sleek digipak and a poster. The mixes don’t appear to have changed either, and it’s now apparent that the aged tape hiss feel of a few of these songs was an intended effect and not the result of them being unfinished, as was the case with many 2010s Blu releases. This version of <i>NoYork!</i> doesn’t offer any new revelations about the record, but as the physical document of that time a gifted rapper blew off a promising record deal to geek out in the studio with friends and then came out with one of the defining documents of his scene, it’s still a win.</p></div>"|17794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17794-blu-no-york/|8.1|Craig Jenkins

His condition means he still requires the help of others in fleshing out his songwriting, but <i>Understated</i> plays out like a crucial step toward finding his muse again. The guests here fill important roles, but are lesser known; it's released on Collins' own label, the newly-formed <a href=""http://www.aedrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AED Records</a>; and the predominant lyrical theme is one of triumphant return. There's a sense of fight here, of Collins drawing musical strength from his hell-and-back experiences.</p>
<p>Collins has always liked to juxtapose ostensibly jarring styles, famously matching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"">Chic</a>-style guitars to post-punk sharpness in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>. His best-known song, ""A Girl Like You"", found a place where 60s pop, Motown, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a> could co-exist. He's returned to a familiar set of influences for <i>Understated</i>, working in arrangements that have Paul Riser's name all over them, throwing in jangly guitar lines that hark back to the Orange Juice days, constructing grooves that resemble lost Northern Soul workouts. Collins' voice is a little more world-weary with every passing record, giving ballads like ""It's a Reason"" an extra dose of pathos, in an album already dripping in poignancy and self-reflection.</p>
<p>Still, there are signs that some of the material is a stretch for him to reach, such as certain lines in the countryfied ""Down the Line"". But even there it's impossible not to be moved by his malaise. ""Just understand, I've lost some ground,"" he croons at one point. So this is a stark record, full of uncomplicated sentiment. It's also one fuelled by a dual feeling of nostalgia, partly abetted by the backward-looking arrangements, and Collins' attempt to address where he is in the world. ""Forsooth"" and ""In the Now"" are likely paired together for a reason; the former might be the most spiritual Collins has ever gotten in song, a direct address about being alive and reborn. The latter is the most strident song here, building a deliberate buffer between his past and present selves.</p>
<p>In a sense, <i>Understated</i> feels like a course-setter for how things are going to be in Collins' career from this point onward. He's certainly shed some of the wit and self-deprecation of yore, although when he does get back there it provides respite, a deviation from the healing he's clearly keen to address in song. ""I’m a singer, of sorts,"" is the most welcome line here when it comes, all wrapped up in the humble title track, returning to something resembling the old Edwyn we all fell in love with on that first listen to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdp6iBgDUpM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Falling and Laughing""</a>. But it's important to recognize that he’s not in that place anymore, not even close to it. Orange Juice's debut <i>You Can’t Hide Your Love Forever </i>is beautiful because of its innocence, whereas <i>Understated</i> is bruised by the many experiences that came afterward. It's no lesser record for it, just one that feels like a part in the purging process rather than a place where Collins feels fully at ease.</p></div>"|17755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17755-edwyn-collins-understated/|6.8|Nick Neyland

Working as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31060-cankun/"" target=""_blank"">Cankun</a>, he mixes loops and echoes into layers of intoxicating fog, but there’s always at least one sound inside his swirl that catches your focus. It could be a chopped-up snare hit, a subliminal bass throb, or a seemingly-random guitar chord that gradually becomes a tune’s heartbeat. Whatever he chooses, these guiding sounds propel his music forward, injecting a definite pulse into what could easily become flatlined mush.</p>
<p>Those versed in muffled, retro-leaning “hypnagogic pop”-- particularly as purveyed by the <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> label-- might find <i>Culture of Pink</i> rather familiar. But Caylet morphs that style into something less like VHS-dubbed memories-of-memories than an underwater DJ set. That’s partially due to how rarely he settles into a static groove. With music this loop-heavy, it can be tempting to ride waves out toward the horizon. When done well, that choice can pay off-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"">Sun Araw</a>’s best work is proof. More often it results in lazy filler, a trap Caylet refuses to fall into. Even when a song sticks with one tempo or timbre, he rotates and cross-cuts his churning sounds to keep them in constant motion.</p>
<p>In other ways, though, <i>Culture of Pink </i>has a lot in common with Sun Araw’s gripping grooves. Both acts are partial to tropical atmospheres, using reggae-ish guitar, dub-like bass, and deep-end beats to conjure a steamy, sweaty rainforest feel, albeit filtered through the lens of psychotropic enhancements. Caylet’s best dub mutations are so humid you can practically feel the mist wafting through his sonic jungle. On “Acinom”, languid, overlapping guitars roll across rattling percussion like a stream coasting over rocks, while on “Soul Brothers”, Caylet makes a laid-back swing urgent by flooding it in reverberating tones.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of reggae and dub, one question pops to mind when listening to <i>Culture of Pink</i>: why opt for a blurry photocopy when you can have the real thing? For me, the answer is easy-- the blur here is just as appealing as the reggae/dub structures, and just as integral. I can’t imagine these tunes without their sonic density; it’s not just in the thick production, but also in the way Caylet places sounds next to each other, the way he transitions from one passage to another, even in the way he plays each instrument and inflects each note. That’s strongest on the album’s longest song, the seven-minute “Why Do You Laugh?” Though its elements are simple-- guitar flickers, bass plunges, a slow, sparse vocal-- Caylet makes them into reflections of themselves and each other, creating a hazy hall of mirrors. As the tune slowly drifts into abstraction, it becomes a microcosm of his most enticing strength: a knack for creating memorable moments rather than just evoking them.</p></div>"|17840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17840-cankun-culture-of-pink/|7.3|Marc Masters

To the University of Colorado students present at the bar to down cheap Old Style and play pool on their Californian parents' dime, they were a noisy interruption, a sideshow sanctioned by the bar yet seemingly uninvited by its patrons. Boulder in general is hostile to anything with distorted guitars at loud volume. If it's not influenced by Phish, Fleetwood Mac, or Skrillex, Boulderites don't want to hear it. Metal bands face such indifference all the time, but Call of the Void didn't get discouraged. They picked up a new vocalist, Steve Vanica, most of the band moved to much more metal-fertile Denver, and they signed to Relapse, also the impetus for the name change. <i>Dragged Down a Dead End Path</i>, their debut for the label, charges through apathy.</p>
<p>Like their peers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30672-early-graves/"" target=""_blank"">Early Graves</a> and the now-deceased <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30649-gaza/"" target=""_blank"">Gaza</a>, Call of the Void traffic in a hybrid of hardcore, death metal, and crust. There's a definite Converge vibe, if Converge still had their learned fury but were less knotty in their arrangements. Comparisons to His Hero Is Gone fly in discussing the band, but they're not so much interested in melody as they are with laying waste. “Faith and Filth”, the closing track, sounds like an outtake from Napalm Death's <i>From Enslavement to Obliteration</i>. Low end is pronounced, almost to the point where it would be more appropriate to call them a fast sludge band rather than grindcore. This is especially true on the latter half of “Theory of Mind,” where around 0:53 the band unleashes a groovy break that resembles Tragedy listening to a lot of Pantera. A call-to-arms rave-up going into a chunky riff shouldn't meld, but Call of the Void's ability to fuse disparate extreme metal influences makes it succeed. The only real “sludgy” part of the album is the introductory dirge of “Faliure”, and from there the album is mostly about speed and venom. They invoke Bower Power in the main riff of “Endless Ritual Abuse,” but even then that song is too grindy to be sludge.</p>
<p>Call of the Void have that certain strand of rage only Denver bands seem to possess. While they don't sound like their peers in Clinging to the Trees of a Forest Fire, Primitive Man, Speedwolf, or Catheter-- and those bands sound nothing like each other-- all these groups push their amps harder and play nastier seemingly to make up for Colorado's reputation as a laid-back, ski trips and bong rips state. Mellowness only serves to make them more enraged, more willing to say fuck all to limits. Call of the Void are no exception, and they're proving that Denver is a hotbed of serious vitrol and passion.</p></div>"|17928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17928-call-of-the-void-dragged-down-a-dead-end-path/|7.6|Andy O'Connor

It's been five years since Williams' self-titled debut long-player as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>, so it's a fine time to step back and re-direct the conversation. <i>Wavves</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves/"" target=""_blank"">2009's triple-v'd follow-up</a> featured monochromatic garage grinders buried under blown-out production-- not exactly the work you'd expect from someone who'd later write a Christmas song for Target with his girlfriend. It's possible that many present-day Wavves fans are unaware that those albums and his sound has changed accordingly. The beery, brawny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/"" target=""_blank""><i>King of the Beach</i></a> from 2010 featured improved production and sharp, sticky hooks that were perfectly suited to soundtrack shows on MTV (which they eventually did.)</p>
<p>Following some label drama that almost derailed that album's creation, Williams took the DIY approach by self-releasing 2011's guest-laden <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15827-life-sux-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life Sux</i></a> EP; two years later, he and current musical co-conspirator Stephen Pope have returned with the proper follow-up to <i>Beach</i>, <i>Afraid of Heights</i>. The record is Williams' first for Warner Bros. and Sony-affiliated imprint Mom + Pop, but Williams self-financed the album's recording over the course of a year. It's a big-ticket record made with indie-minded ethos, and the album's tangle of contradictions befits a guy with such a history of contrarianism.</p>
<p><i>King of the Beach</i> had real-deal rock guy Dennis Herring (Elvis Costello, Modest Mouse) behind the boards; <i>Afraid of Heights</i> features John Hill, a producer with modern pop bonafides from Rihanna to M.I.A. You can hear his touch in the pretty-sounding keyboard-mellotron loop that's interrupted by a low, persistent inner-ear thud in the opening of the typically bratty ""Sail to the Sun"", and <i>Afraid of Heights</i> as a whole is truly a headphones album, a luxuriously produced record tempered with a few moments of noisy studio trickery (notably, the scuzzy rumble of ""Mystic"") for contrast. Five songs feature strings; one features slide guitar.</p>
<p>As for the songwriting, <i>Afraid of Heights</i> finds Williams taking these new elements-- including guest vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"" target=""_blank"">Jenny Lewis</a>' contributions, only barely heard on the album's melodically winding title track-- and rolling them up tightly in his familiar forward churn. <i>K</i><i>ing of the Beach</i>'s self-loathing-as-swag anthem ""Idiot""-- one of the most straightforwardly ear-catching songs on that album-- is a jumping-off point. This means that there's less of the formless, small-scale exercises that largely made up <i>Beach</i>'s back half; some will miss the eccentricity, but <i>Afraid of Heights</i>' energizing consistency makes for a fair trade.</p>
<p>Williams' lyrics are still dripping with self-loathing. <i>Life Sux</i>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12293-i-wanna-meet-dave-grohl/"" target=""_blank"">I Wanna Meet Dave Grohl</a>"" drew sneers based on the title alone, but the sentiment never seemed explicitly careerist; at some point, you'd have to assume that this guy would rather do <i>anything else</i> rather than continue to address his own personal insufficiencies. Here, ""Dog"" and ""Beat Me Up"" deal with subservience in relationships, while the sprightly ""Lunge Forward"" ends with a wish for the end of humanity. There's talk of graves, death, bruises, and the eventuality of being alone. The negativity is sometimes so pronounced it's almost funny: ""Gimme a Knife"" closes with, ""I loved you, Jesus/ You raped the world/ I feel defeated/ Guess I'll go surf.""</p>
<p>The album's most enjoyably surprising moment arrives when he turns his attention outward. ""Cop"" is a love song, albeit a strange one: it's written from the perspective of the gay lover of protagonist John, who's just killed a policeman. ""Sit back and relax, John, just go home and quickly wash your hair/ Lay back in my arms,"" Williams sweetly sings, backed by a distant acoustic shuffle reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClsZo3T9yU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of Chris Knox's ""Turn Down the Shades"". Some strings and stray whistling enter, and the song swells into a big, beatific wash of light before the hook comes in again. It is, without doubt, the most lovely and affecting piece of music Williams has written.</p>
<p><i>Afraid of Heights</i> is the first Wavves album longer than 40-minutes and sometimes it drags. Williams is an avowed Weezer disciple, and accordingly his more dirge-y creations have always reminded me of the sluggishness found on mid-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a> albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8613-maladroit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Maladroit</i></a>. Although he mostly does the the more low-key material right here, ""Everything Is My Fault"" is a real momentum-killer, especially when you realize there's still 10 minutes of album material to get through. Still, <i>Afraid of Heights</i> provides plenty of bummed-out pleasures and Williams' obvious talent is easy to take for granted. At ""Lunge Forward""'s chaotic peak, he cries, ""None of you will ever understand me"" and that may be true, but his music continues to make perfect sense.</p></div>"|17786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17786-wavves-afraid-of-heights/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

If you're the type of person who owns only a handful of electronic albums, smart money says a Kompakt release is among them. And if you're the kind of person who owns dozens of electronic albums, Kompakt likely still commands serious shelf space. <i>20 Jahre Kompakt / Kollektion 1</i>, which begins a year-long celebration of the label in its 20th year, spreads label standouts over two discs and serves as a reminder that the label's range vastly exceeds its reputation.</p>
<p>And perhaps you do need reminding: Kompakt is hardly the tour-de-force it once was. After owning the better part of last decade with its light melodic touch and tasteful beatsmithing, the label was elbowed out of the spotlight by the harsher sounds coming from Berlin's resurgent club culture and London's fervent bass scene. These shifts threw into relief Kompakt's reputation as purveyors of gentle, polite techno more suited to dinner parties than dance floors.</p>
<p>This reputation is only partly deserved. Kompakt rose to prominence as European club culture wound down from its 90s bacchanal; some of these ravers presumably traded all-night-in-a-field parties for graphic design and advertising jobs. If Kompakt was lifestyle music, it was serving the first generation of techno fans for which the sounds represented something other than a counterculture. The label's sound-- often referred to as ""minimal techno,"" though frequently no more than one of those terms applied-- left room for sweet, melancholy vocal tracks and helped it find an audience with indie rock fans looking to dig deeper into the sounds that inspired acts such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3067-the-notwist/"" target=""_blank"">the Notwist</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>.</p>
<p><i>20 Jahre Kompakt</i> helps both the label and its fans sort through its history. It's not a greatest hits package, but a reflection of the catalog as the Kompakt principals would like to remember it-- some combination of hits and sentimental favorites. It's a smart strategy. The attitude throughout is warm and generous-- this aspect of the label's reputation is deserved-- but the tracks themselves are pliable and lightly funky. <i>20 Jahre</i> is easy enough listening at low volumes, but crank the dial to reveal gamey basslines and sturdy leads. Suggesting that this music is only for home listening is to listen only through laptop speakers-- a trend that also coincided with Kompakt's heyday. The label's ""schaffel"" (""shuffle"") sound-- predicated on swung triplets (here's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3OaMZojJRg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an example</a>)-- ensures a playful bounce. (An aside: the label's two <i>Schaffelfieber</i> compilations are ripe for rediscovery.)</p>
<p>The first track, Heiko Voss' ""I Think About You"", plays to expectations, coming off like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"" target=""_blank"">the Sea and Cake</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>. So it's probably not an accident that the second, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Koze</a>'s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/251-matias-aguayo/"" target=""_blank"">Matias Aguayo</a>'s ""Minimal"", is a relatively recent smash that mocks the label's buzzword status. ""These clubbers don't dance...'Cause that music got no groove, no balls,"" croons Aguayo, calling back and forth with a cooing female voice. The classic motorik groove of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>'s ""Over the Ice"" sits alongside the glossy sentimentalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"" target=""_blank"">Superpitcher</a>'s ""Happiness"". Dettinger's ""Totentanz"" could almost slide in alongside the pitch-black acid techno coming out of the UK these days. Most of the big names-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5140-gui-boratto/"" target=""_blank"">Gui Boratto</a>, <a href=""Wolfgang%20Voigt"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Voigt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2890-michael-mayer/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Mayer</a>-- are present, but their tracks here are curveballs. Skipping Jürgen Paape's deeply loved ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"", for example, in favor of Justus Köhncke's underrated ""2 After 909"" helps breathe life into yet another anniversary compilation.</p>
<p>There was another reason, it must be mentioned, that Kompakt was so successful: its accessibility and willingness to compile itself. Their commitment to the CD format and their excellent distribution made and make their releases easy to acquire. Annual volumes of the Total and Pop Ambient series once served as milestones, though they test patience these days. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2020-kompakt-100/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kompakt 100</i></a>, a remix album celebrating the label's 100th release, dropped more than nine years ago. One of the label's best-ever offerings-- co-owner Michael Mayer's seminal <i>Immer</i>-- is itself a mix that sums up the label's sound. There are now three volumes of it.</p>
<p>None of the material on <i>20 Jahre</i> is difficult to find, and early efforts like <i>Total 2</i> and <i>Total 3</i>, as well as <i>Immer</i>, stand as better, if less comprehensive, documents of Kompakt's sound. But for anyone new to this friendly, versatile music, <i>20 Jahre</i> is a smart, manageable introduction that doesn't give away the farm.</p></div>"|17754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17754-kompakt-20-jahre-kollektion/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

On <i>Wooden Ball</i>, the latest in a rapid-fire series of releases from the pair, only five of the 16 tracks make it over the two-minute mark. Their insistence on recording to four-track tape adds to the small feeling, lending a compressed intimacy to their bursts of all-thumbs pop. A cliche (and a truth) often uttered about four-track recordings is that you ""feel like you're in the room there with them,"" which is something often ascribed to, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/586-lou-barlow/"">Lou Barlow</a>'s work under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3743-sentridoh/"">Sentridoh</a> alias. It's not something shared by Blanche Blanche Blanche, who use the muffled textures to make themselves sound anesthetized from the world, lost somewhere in a land of their own creation. <i>Wooden Ball</i> ups that feeling tenfold from last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16920-wink-with-both-eyes/""><i>Wink With Both Eyes</i></a>, largely due to the greater complexity of Smith and Phillips' creations.</p>
<p>If <i>Wink</i> was a little too enchanted with the cheap-speed world <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink</a> created on his earliest releases, <i>Wooden Ball</i> has taken that template and tied a few more knots in it. The outcome has deposited Blanche Blanche Blanche somewhere close to the Ohio punk and New Wave scene that bloomed in the late 1970s, with specific cues taken from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>'s first couple of albums. There's a strong sense of the robo-rock approach of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8283-mark-mothersbaugh/"">Mark Mothersbaugh</a>'s band, a great rush of synthesized movement that's impeccably ordered, yet splinters off at angles you rarely see coming around the bend. Like Devo, it's manic at first, even difficult to process. Smith and Phillips clearly get a kick out of setting up songs that come close to wilting under their own good ideas. ""TED Talks"" is their best example of this to date, drawing vital energy from the deranged motion of the track, which is perfectly balanced by Smith's dispassionate vocal.</p>
<p>There's a confidence here that was only hinted at on <i>Wink</i>. Smith's singing often slows to a spoken-word pace, sometimes strains at the seams, and is regularly furnished with a brash kind of cool. It's like a cross between Ann Magnuson's work in <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bongwater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bongwater</a> and Anna Waronker's supremely disengaged delivery in <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/that+dog."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">That Dog</a>. Blanche Blanche Blanche's greatest material resembles an all-out cage match between the instrumentation and the vocals, full of roaming, mechanised basslines (""Time to Remember"", ""Cow""); wild machine noise lost in an upsurge of distortion (""Join the Creative Class""); and berserk 21st century vaudeville (""Looks Don't Run""). There's nothing that resembles relatively straight songs like ""That's Siberia"" and ""Appetite"" from <i>Wink</i>, and this record is better for it. Madness clearly suits them far better than sanity.</p>
<p>One weakness is Smith and Phillips' tendency to flick through styles and present gone-wrong versions of them; ""The One I'll Call"" attempts warped reggae, ""The Kind Dry Stream"" is a demented piano ballad. Those tracks splice up the mood of the record, but they don't need to go there, especially now they've found a footing that's close to being their own. They haven't quite shed all the Ariel Pinkisms either, but they're almost gone, with that drowsy kind of melancholy increasingly at odds with everything else going on when it emerges. Whimsy can often be so hard to get right in music, but <i>Wooden Ball</i> becomes effortlessly palatable over time in the same way as odd releases like <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Renaldo+and+The+Loaf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Renaldo &amp; the Loaf</a>'s <i>Songs for Swinging Larvae</i>. Despite the constant barrage of music, there's a feeling that the people behind Blanche Blanche Blanche have put a lot of care into this work, striving hard to dislodge their brains from the well-travelled path.</p></div>"|17700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17700-blanche-blanche-blanche-wooden-ball/|7.0|Nick Neyland

After all, they billed their first three albums as a trilogy about a futuristic community (named Foot Village, naturally) that survives and thrives after the end of the world. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8718-closing-the-books/4/"">Live</a>, their musical approach seems conceptual too: all drums and singing, with no other instruments in sight. But on that count they’re not hard-liners-- each of their albums includes sounds created by something other than percussion or voice.</p>
<p>On <i>Make Memories</i>, their first album since 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13388-anti-magic/"">Anti-Magic</a></i>, Foot Village have gone a step further and loosened the thematic concepts too. Even though one song is called “The End of The World”, and there are plenty of the group’s trademark anthemic chants, strident declarations, and cryptic slogans, there’s no discernible overarching conceit here. Instead, swells of pure sound have become paramount, taking equal footing to urgent lyrical imperatives. Hence on a track like opener “1600 Dolla Bill”, Foot Village can comfortably ride waves of cymbals and synth (courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28220-beak/"">Beak&gt;</a>’s Matthew Loveridge) for long stretches without ever singing at all.</p>
<p>There’s nothing else that abstract and expansive on <i>Make Memories</i>. But even though the remaining five tracks sit more in the established Foot Village wheelhouse of high-octane drumming and high-energy shouting, there’s something different going on this time. The hyper-kinetic pounding and stop-start bursts are sharper and more purposeful. Where in the past, parts of certain songs were merely transitional, here everything counts. The ironic result is that the first concept-free Foot Village album has their most narrative structure yet, filled with beginnings, middles, and ends.</p>
<p>There’s also a heightened focus on texture that gives these songs multiple levels. You can still jerk your head and beat your chest to Foot Village’s militaristic stomps, but at the same time it’s easy to get lost in their well-woven layers of sound. So the overlapping screams on “Warlock” feel as much like a drone as a war chant. And when clouds of cymbal wash and snare roll melt into echoing yells on “New Jersey”, the pulse-quickening effect is as psychedelic as it is visceral.</p>
<p>Foot Village’s brand of humor, a kind of gleeful insanity, remains intact too. Though their tribal multi-drum sound has been rightfully compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a>, I think they’re even closer to those Japanese legends in how oddly funny they can be-- in the way they simultaneously sound frantically nuts, naively simple, and absurdly self-aware. Take one track with the Boredoms-like title “AIDS Sucks, Make Money”, wherein the group bluntly boasts “We’ll never, we’ll never, we’ll never stop dreaming/ We’ll never, we’ll never, we’ll never stop screaming.” At this point, given the level of confidence and clarity that Foot Village’s music has risen to, that’s all the concept they need.</p></div>"|17836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17836-foot-village-make-memories/|7.6|Marc Masters

Although he <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1356"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claims</a> that most of the music's defining influences-- the effervescent touches-- come from the duo's other half, his wife Lara Rix-Martin. That's the romantic pop of Fleetwood Mac and the mysticism of Kate Bush rather than the harsh IDM of Paradinas' defining work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"" target=""_blank"">µ-ziq</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, Heterotic is about two disparities coming together. The name alone is rife with significance, implying not only the pair’s own male-female coupling, but also the term’s technical definition-- that of combining two different genes. The fruits of their labour turn not to be a ghastly hybrid but rather a seamless combination of two unique musical voices. Unlike almost anything Paradinas has put his name to, <i>Love &amp; Devotion </i>is a seductive collection of alternately romantic and foreboding pop through the lens of weird dance music.</p>
<p>With six-minute instrumental opener “Bliss”, Heterotic set themselves up well for those Fleetwood Mac comparisons. With its bobbing bassline, breezy AM gold melody and wordless harmonies, it channels “Second Hand News” in a summery bluster. But as the rest of <i>Love &amp; Devotion</i> unfurls, it’s a more somber affair, almost funereal. The group use tactile sounds-- knotty bass, tinkling pianos, full-throated mellotron-- that give off a 70s warmth, but technological anxiety threatens to bubble over from underneath. The burping low-end and ominous lead of “Robo Corp” appropriates “Welcome to the Machine”-style dread, and “Knell” is like an old Alan Parsons instrumental, searing guitar solo and all.</p>
<p>But those are the instrumentals. Warp-signed folk vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1827-gravenhurst/"" target=""_blank"">Gravenhurst</a>, a.k.a. Nick Talbot, appears on four of the album’s tracks, drastically altering the album’s mood and flow. His lyrical themes turn out to be sad and bitter, flung far from the perfect synthesis the main band's name suggests. His distinct voice tears these tracks away from sunny Cali-pop straight back into dear old Blighty, bright and chilly like cold air wafting through a cemetery. Possessed of an inherently sad voice, he’s perfect for tracks like the incredible “Slumber”, where he competes against a hypnotic vocal sample in a slow-motion waltz, forlornly mumbling “We dance/ When we dance/ We dance alone.” He’s even better on “Wartime”, where he whispers a wrenching ballad about intimacy against a backdrop that feels like a distant heartbeat. It’s like a completely separate project when you put it up against “Bliss”, which comes just two tracks before.</p>
<p>While most of the album has some degree of melancholy floating through it, whether it’s just tinged or just full-blown downer material, <i>Love &amp; Devotion </i>feels split down the middle. Not that variety is necessarily a bad thing. But with the exception of “Blue Lights”-- easily the album’s best, where Gravenhurst’s fluorescent hues channel Britpop larks rather than dour indie-- it feels as if the vocal material belongs to something much more rooted in English pop tradition than the other synthy trifles. It’s not the most cohesive listen, but then again it’s an easy one, and even easier to repeat. Subtly detailed, <i>Love &amp; Devotion</i> is the kind of record where you’re bound to notice some new little touch every time you listen. And for such a no-frills pop record, that’s an accomplishment in itself. Give them some time to find their sound, but for now, Heterotic stands as a yet another promising venture from one of the most consistently surprising minds in electronic music.</p></div>"|17863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17863-heterotic-love-devotion/|6.9|Andrew Ryce

Everything since has taken cues from styles more associated with parents’ basements, musty vinyl shops, and convention centers: dinky synth-pop, surf rock, prog and the weird science of countless 1980s New Wave bands. This flipping of the script can actually be seen as a canny move, recasting the Strokes as lovable underdogs: where they once defined effortless cool, the deeply uncool <i>Comedown Machine </i>smacks of effort.</p>
<p>That goes a long way towards making <i>Comedown Machine</i> more immediately appealing than their last two records; the Strokes sound like they’re genuinely trying here. The functional cover art of <i>Comedown Machine </i>suggests some kind of mixtape the Strokes made for themselves, 11 songs that turn out like 11 different genre experiments viewed through the unmistakable prism of their inhuman rhythmic precision and pinched EQ’ing. There are a couple of <i>Is This It? </i>throwbacks (“All The Time,” “50/50”) that turn out to be among the least satisfying things here, too flabby to fit into those same jeans from a decade prior. Otherwise, you get elastic funk (“Tap Out”), dubby dream-pop (“80s Comedown Machine”), unidentifiable Latin-tinged Casio presets (“One Way Trigger”) and plenty of soft-rock sheen that creates an ouroboros effect of the Strokes sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9030-its-never-been-like-that/"">Phoenix when <i>they </i>were trying to sound like the Strokes</a>.</p>
<p>Credit where it’s due: the guys<i> </i>sound like they’re having fun again. At least that’s the gist you get from the numerous, in-studio “throwaway” moments: the flubbed soloing that introduces the otherwise vise-tight “Tap Out” and the labored laughing that closes out “Slow Animals” only take up a few seconds, but they reinforce the idea that this isn’t Julian Casablancas’ de facto solo project despite it sounding closer to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13666-phrazes-for-the-young/"">Phrazes For The Young</a> </i>than any Strokes LP<i>. </i>But you also sense that the rest of the band getting antsy, issuing challenges to themselves to keep things interesting. Albert Hammond’s solos are charmingly anachronistic, a throwback to when tidy solos were a regular occurrence in three-minute pop songs. But they still can’t shake their tendency to stubbornly hammer at awkward riffs (“Happy Ending”) and clunky chord changes (""Welcome To Japan"").</p>
<p>Still, the limitations of <i>Comedown Machine</i>'s protracted diversity all come back to Casablancas, a man with wide range as a listener and extremely narrow range as a musician. In both lyrics and tone, he’s best at playing the laconic cad: So when he barks “you’re going too fast” on “All the Time” as a callback to “Reptilia” and the hotseat urgency of <i>Room On Fire</i>, it sounds forced. On the opposite end, the highlight of <i>Comedown Machine </i>is when he asks “What kind of asshole drives a Lotus?” on “Welcome to Japan”; you half expect him to do the <a href=""https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQPs1cr8NesjFIA2IRmiIUhZfmOfzxJYcvyOups-BAuzOnaT45o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“this guy!”</a> routine as a punchline.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of thing Casablancas does better than anyone. Unfortunately, most of <i>Comedown Machine </i>finds him doing anything <i>but </i>that. “Tap Out” features at least two of Casablancas' most elegant melodies, but his wispy coo turns them into mush. When he takes the opposite tack to channel his inner Tom Waits, he doesn’t fare much better; no one was asking what the Strokes would've sounded like in the Victrola era, but ""Call It Fate Call It Karma"" answers it anyway.<i> </i>If this all smacks of effort, at least they are not taking the easy way out. It’s the 10th anniversary of <i>Room On Fire</i> and in light of what came after, a reissue would <i>surely </i>bring more praise than the initial <i>Is This It? Yes It Is </i>assessment. Or, they could’ve followed the lead of fellow fashion plate/occasional hitmaker Suede and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17779-suede-bloodsports/"" target=""_blank"">made it a point to sound like their old selves</a> after a long, dry spell.</p>
<p>Still, it’s frustrating for anyone who still puts stock in the idea that the Strokes could and should be one of America’s biggest rock bands. After all, they <i>feel </i>like stars even if the numbers don’t back it up and reigning champs like the Black Keys have about as much charisma and sex appeal as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory"">General Tire</a>. Of course, Black Keys are writing much better songs than the ones on <i>Comedown Machine</i> and if the Strokes seem unfashionable in 2013, that's the true reason.</p></div>"|17788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/|6.1|Ian Cohen

After all, when you're an up-and-coming European electro-pop band trying to set yourself apart in a sea of soundalikes, titling your second single like a magnetic poetry scramble of one of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>'s biggest hits doesn't exactly scream originality. But once you hit play, the song itself-- a soaring synth-pop meteorite centered around a sky-high chorus-- had enough transcendent pop power to turn cynics to devotees in three minutes flat. Same went for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvJBD9MVI4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lies""</a>, the thumping debut single on which singer Lauren Mayberry declared her ability to ""make a true believer of anyone."" Something about Chvrches' pulsing, neon-brite music is like skepticism's kryptonite; their songs are executed wholeheartedly, driven by themes of belief, devotion, and discovery, and imbued with an unabashed sense of wonder. The ornate, sparkling eye make-up that Mayberry sports on stage is the perfect visual metaphor for their sound: It's as though she's trying to make her eyes wider in an attempt to take in as much of the world as she can.</p>
<p>Chvrches came together spontaneously in late 2011, when Iain Cook and Martin Doherty asked Mayberry to sing on some tracks they'd been producing and were pleasantly surprised with the results. As a trio, they're something of a hodgepodge. All three have been in bands but never one that sounds anything like this: Mayberry used to sing in the folky indie pop outfit Blue Sky Archives, Cook played with muted post-rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28-aereogramme/"">Aereogramme</a>, and Doherty was a touring member of the rumbling Glaswegian thunderclouds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/"" target=""_blank"">the Twilight Sad</a>. Despite their varied and somewhat gloomy pedigrees, Chvrches' first EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/51-recover-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Recover</i></a> shows the trio coming together to explore and embrace synth pop's artificial sunlight-- a far cry from the sensibility of the drizzly city that spawned them.</p>
<p>The title track of <i>Recover</i>, though, shines just as bright as Chvrches' first two singles, and it continues to hone a sound that's beginning to sound distinct from their electro-pop contemporaries. Chvrches have garnered plenty of comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a>, but-- with the exception of the chopped-up Megan James-like vocal hiccups that open ""Mother""-- the Glaswegians' music has little interest in deconstruction. Instead, Chvrches' music is all about the moment when everything comes together-- like when Cook and Doherty's panoramic synth vistas swoop beneath Mayberry's vocal melody on ""Recover"" to round out its anthemic chorus. While their sound often scans ""80s"" (""Now is the Time"" channels some serious <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPmTGFg06zA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OMD vibes</a>), Chvrches' sense of commanding, wall-shaking dynamism takes cues from dubstep. Occasionally (on the verses of ""Time"" in particular), Mayberry's delivery feels a little too stiff or meek to compete with the towering sounds around her. When she's on, though, her entrancing voice becomes <i>Recover</i>'s centerpiece, giving these songs their human pulse. ""You take what you need,"" she sings on the title track, ""And I know you don't need me.""</p>
<p>Doherty sings lead on ""ZVVL"", the EP's weakest track, and unlike Mayberry he doesn't quite have the charisma to take center stage. Though they're riding the strength of some very strong singles, the back half of <i>Recover</i> shows that Chvrches are still actively working out parts of their sound-- which, of course, is no great strike against a band that's only been together a little over a year. Still, what does feel almost preternaturally fully formed is Chvrches' melodic sensibility. (The sheer number of Chvrches remixes-- the best being Miaoux Miaoux's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h3m85-CFfk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">candy-coated take on ""Mother""</a>-- floating around right now is a testament to this.) As Chvrches prep their full-length debut for later this year, they're still honing the edge that's going to set them apart. But for the time being, the hooks are enough to convert plenty of true believers.</p></div>"|17789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17789-chvrches-recover-ep/|7.6|Lindsay Zoladz

Their name, of course, sounds like it could’ve been borrowed from a law firm, and, dressed soberly in suits (or at the very least a shirt and tie), tending to their instruments in a workmanlike manner, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was a trio of white collar workers indulging a hobby on their day off. It’s a mode of presentation not dissimilar to that of Kraftwerk, but in a sense Brandt Brauer Frick are Kraftwerk in reverse, stripping techno of its synthesisers and drum machines and replacing them with acoustic instruments: pianos, strings, brass, and orchestral percussion.</p>
<p>That might seem like a regressive move, and it certainly leaves the trio open to accusations of gimmickry. But so far they’ve done a fine job of dodging the various pitfalls that confront a so-called “crossover” act. Brandt Brauer Frick first emerged in 2009; Daniel Brandt and Jan Brauer both had orchestral training, while Paul Frick had studied classical composition. Thanks to their backgrounds, the Brandt Brauer Frick sound was, and is, instantly recognisable. Mechanical piano figures, played with dampened or treated strings, recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>’s works for prepared piano; detailed live-sounding arrangements reference the finicky bricolage-house of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Herbert</a>; a taste for dense polyrhythms comes from jazz, tempered with a measured pacing borrowed from the finest Detroit techno.</p>
<p>With 2011’s <i>Mr. Machine</i>, though, Brandt Brauer Frick became the Brandt Brauer Frick Ensemble, and the trio’s focus shifted away from the club and towards the concert hall. With a 10-piece orchestral ensemble in tow, the trio re-scored tracks from their 2010 debut <i>You Make Me Real</i> and elsewhere. The arrangements were smart and playful, but could feel a little rote at times. So it's good news that the trio have returned to a studio-assisted setup for their third LP. Muscular sub-bass and booming, power-assisted kickdrums are back, and the arrangements are bolder and more mercurial than ever before.</p>
<p><i>Miami</i> is a concept album of sorts, bound together by three tracks that reference the city. Opener ""Miami Theme"" is Brandt Brauer Frick at their most epic and their most po-faced, a foggy 10-minute landscape of orchestral texturing dripping with existential dread. ""Miami Drift"" reprises the mood, while the forlorn piano techno of closer ""Miami Titles"" offers little by way of warmth. Elsewhere, ""Ocean Drive (Schamane)"" seems to suggest grey waves crashing under glowering skies, an updating of <i>Sturm und Drang</i> for the techno generation. Fact is, Brandt, Brauer and Frick have spent a total of <i>24 hours</i> in the city of Miami: They're conjuring a mental state, rather than the azure-skied plastic paradise you might expect. <i>Miami</i> is by some measure Brandt Brauer Frick’s darkest record, giving freer reign to a creeping angst that’s often lurked in the trio’s discography.</p>
<p>It’s appropriate that the album’s dazzling cast of vocalists are coaxed into an almost uniformly spooky style of delivery, like ghosts leering out of the murk. Sa-Ra’s Om’Mas Keith supplies an anaemic whisper to accompany the ominous ""Plastic Like Your Mother""; deep house darling Nina Kraviz’s smoky tones are reduced to a sickly burble in the nightmarish ""Verwahrlosung"" (German for ""neglect""); Gudrun Gut’s contribution to the faintly Jeff Mills-like ""Fantasie Mädchen"" is more sinister yet. All of this is to Brandt Brauer Frick’s credit. Where <i>Mr. Machine</i> occasionally came off twee, <i>Miami</i> is sleek and vicious, pulling no punches. Moments of redemption, when they come, are fleeting and qualified, and all the more satisfying for it-- as in ""Broken Pieces"", where clipped brass chords outline the faintest hint of a pop hook under <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Lidell</a>’s strangled soul mewl. <i>Miami</i> shows Brandt Brauer Frick to have reached new heights of imagination and technical accomplishment, but it’s undeniably a challenging listen. Break through its forbidding surface, though, and the rewards can be considerable.</p></div>"|17887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17887-brandt-brauer-frick-miami/|7.8|Angus Finlayson

Where to go from here? There is one potential last hurrah that could get longstanding fans as excited as they were for the museum shows, albeit one that seems unlikely: a reformation of the ""classic"" Kraftwerk lineup, featuring Hütter, Florian Schneider, Wolfgang Flür, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31010-karl-bartos/"">Karl Bartos</a>. The latter joined the band in the mid 1970s and became much more than a sideman to Hütter and Schneider-- he has songwriting credits on some of the band’s most famous material, including ""The Model"", ""Tour de France"", and ""Computer Love"". A reunion isn't on the cards, but there's little doubt that having Bartos on stage would bring gravitas to the band, even if it had little discernable effect on the music played.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bartos left Kraftwerk in 1990, amid a swirl of rumors that he was unhappy with the slow creative pace they had settled into. But an initial burst of work, notably with <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Electronic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electronic</a> and his own <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Elektric+Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elektric Music</a>, quickly faded to silence. <i>Off the Record</i> is only the second album he has made under his own name, primarily based around music he recorded long ago, dredged up from the vaults and given a 21st century gleam. Except, much like Kraftwerk's endless retooling of their work for live performance, much of it is firmly lodged in the past. At some point, approximately around the time of <i>Electric Cafe</i>, Kraftwerk stopped feeling like the future, instead morphing into a quaint look back at how they thought the world would be shaped during their 1970s heyday. <i>Off the Record</i> takes a similar approach. Given a chance to take old material and make it new, Bartos simply leaves it suspended in the period, making few notable advances.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record is so bathed in retro that there are direct nods back to some of the Kraftwerk material he worked on. ""Rhythmus"" gives the ""Numbers"" beat a tweak, choosing to set it to a fuller musical backing and some achingly familiar robo-vocals. Bartos is one of the few people allowed to get away with such blatant mirroring of the past, but it's hard to escape the thought that he's done it all before, and better, and with a little more elegance and wit. A case in point: naming a song after the <a href=""http://atomium.be/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atomium</a>, a structure built for the 1958 World's Fair, just seems so obviously Kraftwerkian that it's redundant. The best Kraftwerk material was smarter than that; it was about great synth paeans to the German equivalent of Route 66 (""Autobahn""), or looking for beauty in minutiae (""Pocket Calculator""), or celebrating and warning about the onrush of technology (""Computer World""/""Radioactivity"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps it's unfair to judge Bartos next to the peerless heights his former band reached, but <i>Off the Record</i> clearly has aspirations to orbit exactly the same territory. Its nadir comes in ""The Tuning of the World"", a horribly clunky piece of auto-tuned sermonizing in which Bartos outlines his outlook on life. Elsewhere, there are attempts at updating some of the source material, but even that sounds decades behind; ""International Velvet"" resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11442-moon-safari-10th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Moon Safari</i></a>, while ""Hausmusik"" is a strange deviation into the light pop intonations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4199-the-the/"">The The</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-32AAp418V4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This is the Day""</a>. It's all impeccably executed and precisely arranged, as you'd expect from someone with Bartos's pedigree. But nothing here feels essential in the way that, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16733-the-lost-tapes/""><i>The Lost Tapes</i></a> did. Instead, there are hints at the reasoning behind Kraftwerk's creative silence. Hütter may have endlessly spun his wheels, but at least he had the foresight to not tarnish his reputation by rehashing inferior material.</p></div>"|17790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17790-karl-bartos-off-the-record/|5.4|Nick Neyland

Frontman Erlend Hjelvik screeched exclusively in his native tongue on the Norwegian sextet's self-titled 2010 debut, but the album spoke a universal riff language. <i>Kvelertak</i>'s gambit was to smash the barriers subdividing the metal pantheon, so that the nimble six-string grandstanding of Thin Lizzy and cartoonish machismo of AC/DC could mingle with black metal's tortured yowls and headlong blastbeats, and commune with hardcore's bottomless vitriol. Tracks like ""Blodtørst"" honored Kvelertak's righteous name (it means ""chokehold""), besting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/93-andrew-wk/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew W.K.</a> at his crank-it-up-and-chug party-metal quest, while at the same time mustering enough heft and geeky shred to satisfy any fan of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leviathan</i></a>-era Mastodon. Extreme metal and rock &amp; roll had cohabitated before-- see: early/mid 90s works by Entombed and Carcass, or the punky hedonism of Venom and their modern-day disciples such as Midnight-- but rarely with such sheer ballsy flair. </p>
<p>Kvelertak's second album, aptly titled <i>Meir</i> (""More""), doesn't tweak the basic formula. The band has jumped from Brooklyn indie the End Records to Warner Music Group subsidiary Roadrunner-- a label that was ground zero for early-90s death metal and currently backs Opeth, Slipknot, and Rush-- but otherwise, they've retained key aspects of <i>Kvelertak</i>: stunning production, almost like an extra-beefy Steve Albini job, courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>'s Kurt Ballou, eerily elegant cover art from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a>'s John Baizley and a wholesale avoidance of English. <i>Meir </i>also echoes the tantalizing inconsistency of its predecessor. As on <i>Kvelertak</i>, the choice tracks here are stunners, songs that deserve to be fast-tracked into the heavy-rock pantheon. While there are no outright duds, the less memorable material can't quite measure up, lending the album a certain almost-there feel. <i>Meir</i> isn't the magnum opus Kvelertak clearly have in them, but there's enough brilliance here to indicate that LP three or four very well might be. </p>
<p>Kvelertak's strongest songs have a way of making the hammiest stunts seem completely sensible. Lead single ""Bruane Brenn"" (""Burning Bridges"") charges into the band's wheelhouse: pummeling uptempo rawk with Hjelvik-- a stylistically limited yet enormously charismatic frontman-- shredding throat over top. First, the band hints coyly at pop, with a nifty melodic vocal hook from guitarist Maciek Ofstad and the subtle addition of Vidar Landa's pounding piano in the second verse. Then, at the 2:45 mark, they suddenly ramp down the tempo and burst into a half minute of pure power-ballad grandstanding. The moment is so shrewdly integrated, it doesn't feel like winky pastiche; it's simply what the song demands.</p>
<p>Other <i>Meir</i> standouts show off Kvelertak's mastery of disparate metal varietals. ""Spring Fra Livet"" (""Run From Life"") effortlessly juggles bluesy, shimmy-friendly verses and tremolo-picked cosmic-black-metal interludes, as drummer Kjetil Gjermundrød trades blastbeats for stadium-rock stomp. The effect is one of giddy inclusiveness, as though these marauding Norsemen were clenching their scowling, corpse-painted countrymates in a boozy bear hug. Awesomeness also abounds in ""Trepan"" (the title refers to an arcane medical practice involving skull-drilling) with its breathtaking triple-guitar stop-time interlude, and ""Evig Vandrar"" (""Eternal Wanderer""), which dispenses with style-hopping in favor of handsomely Zepped-out, stomping-giant raunch rock. </p>
<p><i>Meir</i> slackens in its second half. ""Tordenbrak"" (""Thunderclap"") features what might be the album's single finest riff-- a florid marvel that sounds something like Boston guitar wizard Tom Scholz embellishing on the Steve Miller Band's ""Jungle Love""-- but the band employs the motif like a crutch, failing to situate it into any kind of compelling narrative arc over a near-nine-minute running time. Other songs seem arbitrarily eclectic. ""Nekrokosmos"" juggles so many sections, it scans as the metal equivalent of a Magnetic Poetry blitz, and when the band kicks into an old-school thrash gallop on ""Månelyst"" (""Moonlight""), the shift registers as a because-we-can move, rather than one born out of real compositional urgency. </p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Meir</i> rights itself at the end. The final track-- entitled, yes, ""Kvelertak""-- is a timeless beer-hoister, like a <i>Back in Black</i> outtake souped up with hardcore-style gang vocals, post-<i>Jailbreak</i> fret dancing and a soulful, bittersweet chorus. Clocking in at 3:50, it's basically perfect, a reminder that epic-scale songs and frantic eclecticism are secondary to the band's central mission. Like so many of their beloved forebears, Kvelertak sound smartest when they're playing it dumb.</p></div>"|17815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17815-kvelertak-meir/|7.2|Hank Shteamer

A new Suede album, however, was not. Mere months after the Britpop progenitors embarked upon a well-received greatest hits revue in 2011, frontman Brett Anderson had returned to his decade-long practice of releasing small-scale solo albums, while a concurrent, exhaustive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15571-coming-up-deluxe-edition-head-music-deluxe-edition-a-new-morning-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">reissue</a> of Suede’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">back catalogue</a> seemingly confirmed the reunion’s retrospective impetus.

Like their 2011 tour campaign, <i>Bloodsports</i> employs the band’s post-1995 line-up-- i.e., the one without Anderson’s formative songwriting partner-turned-nemesis, Bernard Butler. In the absence of Butler’s authoritative presence, Suede’s albums sometimes veered toward the slight and frivolous, the tension and bravado that fuelled their definitive singles giving way to a certain self-satisfied complacence. But if the relationship between Anderson and Butler’s replacement, Richard Oakes, was decidedly less tumultuous, on <i>Bloodsports</i>, the guitarist’s presence has an undeniably reinvigorating effect on the singer.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Bloodsports</i>, Suede consistently strikes the balance between decadence and elegance-- a “world wrapped in tinsel,” swathed in “lipstick traces” and “second-hand furs”-- that marked their signature work. But where Anderson once aligned himself with his fellow misfits, on <i>Bloodsports</i> he’s seeking more meaningful, one-on-one connections. Though it climaxes with a bleacher-baiting gang chorus, the <i>Joshua Tree</i>-toppling salvo “Barriers” is, at its core, an intimate, open-hearted address from someone who wants his relationships to be measured in years rather than nights. And it gets <i>Bloodsports</i> off to a terrifically rousing start; the succeeding “Snowblind” and “It Starts and Ends With You” both come loaded with the sort of do-or-die urgency and knockout choruses to earn retroactive placement on 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14853-the-best-of-suede/"" target=""_blank""><i>Best of Suede</i></a> compilation.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that Suede are staging their comeback the same month as their patron saint, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> (with whom Anderson famously <a href=""http://home.swipnet.se/~w-26441/gfx/magazine/BowieAndBrett.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shared an <i>NME</i> cover</a> back in 1993). But where Bowie spends much of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17855-david-bowie-the-next-day/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Next Day</i></a> sardonically addressing his extended absence and his own mortality, Andrerson hurtles himself into <i>Bloodsports</i> with the stern-faced intent of someone who is grateful to have been granted a second chance and determined not to let it go to waste. And if his outsize passion isn’t enough to push every big-tent ballad over the top (like the middling “Sabotage”) or sell you on the odd underwritten chorus (e.g., “Come on and hit me/ With your mystery”), he keeps the frisson flowing well into <i>Bloodsports</i>’ more atmospheric and despairing second act. As the wide-eyed romanticism heard in the album’s opening stretch gives way to a vicious cycle of emotional dependency (“Sometimes I Feel I’ll Float Away”), betrayal (the eerily desolate “What Are You Not Telling Me?”), and predatory, restraining-order-worthy behaviour (the ominous “Always”), the band respond with their weightiest, most calamitous music since side two of 1994’s darkly epic <i>Dog Man Star</i>.</p>
<p>But if <i>Bloodsports</i> stays faithful to Suede’s signature sound, it represents a refreshing evolution in spirit. This is not the place to go to indulge your student-disco nostalgia; rather than try to swagger back onto the scene and try to out-snort men half their age, Suede shrewdly draw our attention to those youthful indiscretions-- ego, insecurity, obsession-- that we never seem to outgrow.</p></div>"|17779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17779-suede-bloodsports/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Making an album of wordless solo guitar compositions that remains interesting for its duration is <i>hard</i>, demanding a range of subtle skills far beyond nimble fingers-- a fine, exacting ear for color, an intuitive sense of momentum, a mind for musical structures. These are fragile musical gifts, difficult to cultivate and even harder to point out, and they become even more fragile when the focus bears down on a single instrument: You are painfully exposed, both as a player and as a musical mind.</p>
<p><i>Impossible Truth</i> is Tyler's second richly satisfying and absorbing record of solo guitar in three years. His finger-picking offers a lovely, rangy meditation on the power of the good old open-string drone, and if you listen closely, you can hear his searching intelligence animating every note. The cobwebbed cycle of chords that make up the center section of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14671-cadillac-desert/"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14671-cadillac-desert/"">Cadillac Desert</a>"" are played like an inner monologue, dimming and surging like a gas lantern. Tyler employs some of the same back-up instruments here as he did on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14999-behold-the-spirit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Behold the Spirit</i></a>; wisps of pedal steel guitar, stand-up bass, vibes and xylophone, softly glowing horns. But his guitar remains the single waveform bouncing through your headphone-space for nearly all of <i>Impossible Truth</i>'s 54-minute running time, and it never once grows tiring.</p>
<p>Once you're fully immersed in Tyler's world, you'll probably stop thinking of his music as ""solo guitar."" He has an uncommon way of making tangles of picked notes ring out like the melody of a searching pop song. Many of the <i>Impossible Truth</i>'s pieces trace the contours of a mood that feels similar to the Beatles' ""In My Life"": wistful, valedictory, touched by fatalism. ""We Can't Go Home Again"" opens with two chords that pirouette mournfully from major to minor, before easing with into a series of variations on a pentatonic theme that grow in forcefulness and confidence over three-and-a-half minutes. By the end, it feels a ringing refutation of the title's gloomy proposition. ""A Portrait of Sarah"", a tribute to Tyler's girlfriend, Sarah Souther, opens small-scale, singing a particularly romatic and sweetly ascending tune that eventually kicks into a romping double-time. It's a heart-filling moment, one of the only expressions of boundlessly personal joy on <i>Truth</i>. If there were words to this song, they would cheapen the feeling. </p>
<p>It also helps that <i>Impossible Truth</i>, like <i>Behold the Spirit</i>, is gorgeously recorded. Tyler's lines resonate a sonic space that sounds cavernous and chilly, like he's recording in a drafty, empty church. Although Tyler <a href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/on-his-new-impossible-truth-nashville-guitarist-william-tyler-evokes-the-wordless-ghosts-of-past-singer-songwriters/Content?oid=3320478"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claims</a> he was trying to escape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"" target=""_blank"">John Fahey</a> comparisons with this record, through the lived-in confidence of his playing and the sense of folkish ease settling into his compositions, he moves closer to the bracingly simple beauty that Fahey's music embodied. His strummed open chords on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14645-country-of-illusion/"" target=""_blank"">Country of Illusion</a>"" even hint teasingly at Fahey's version of ""Joy To The World,"" from the Christmas classic <i>The</i><i> New Possibility.</i> </p>
<p>But as he moves closer to Fahey's spirit, Tyler sounds more and more like himself. Every melody he plays, like the one that opens ""Last Residents of Westfall"", somehow feels as it if was always <i>there</i>, a rare musical quality that only settles in after years of weeding out the quotations that have crept into your playing. Once you've reached this rarefied air as a player, whatever your musical mind touches will come out transformed, and <i>Impossible Truth</i> is music of almost metaphysical calmness, in which Tyler's guitar surveys inner vistas and notes their vastness with a kind of Zen detachment.</p></div>"|17780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17780-william-tyler-impossible-truth/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Even its most visible modern-day adherents-- like Bruno Mars or Justin Timberlake-- reinforce the throwback assocations by using soul music as an opportunity to anachronistically dress up in suits and employ large, identically attired backing bands seated behind large name-plates. But in England, soul has been a constant lifesource for the country’s musical vanguard, whether it was post-punkers<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAVmUNZWFlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> mainlining the music’s emotional charge</a>, 1980s New Pop artists <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m94ip38UKs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">adopting its showbiz sheen</a>, or trip-hop producers <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmrfgj0MZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">taking its essence into more dystopian realms</a>.</p>
<p>The genre's dual existence is perfectly personified by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31170-lady/"" target=""_blank"">Lady</a>, a Transatlantic collaboration between Atlanta native Nicole Wray and Londoner Terri Walker. The former was once a hotly tipped R&amp;B upstart who scored <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DAtktg4gc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a hit single</a> collab with Missy Elliot in 1998, but spent much of the 2000s as a pipes-for-hire backing singer for the likes of Kid Cudi and the Black Keys; the latter earned a Mercury Prize nomination in 2003 for her neo-soul debut <i>Untitled</i>, but subsequent releases failed to generate the same critical or commercial traction. Playing the role of matchmaker is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Soul_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Truth and Soul</a>, the production team that helped ensure Aloe Blacc never needs another dollar.</p>
<div>Moreso than the singers’ individual pedigrees, it’s the producers’ involvement that provides the most immediate signpost for Lady’s modernized retro-soul aesthetic, which liberally draws on turn-of-the-70s signifiers -- from the unbridled joy of Jackson Five-era Motown to the proto-disco smooth of Philadelphia's MFSB -- but shirks any attempt for faux-AM-radio fuzziness in favour of crisp, clean contours. But Truth and Soul are under no illusion as to who the real stars of the show are, turning in tastefully unobtrusive, appealingly suave arrangements-- chirpy trumpets, silken strings, bouncing-ball piano lines, George Benson guitar accents-- that cooly complement Wray and Walker’s radiant harmonies rather than overpower them. And, in light of their solo career struggles, the singers clearly relish the opportunity to indulge in a little comfort food soul, resulting in an infectiously fun set with broad, cross-generational appeal.</div>
<p>Lady's is a well-trodden field and, at times, their lyrical tropes are overfamiliar to the point of feeling vague, if not downright lazy (e.g., “keep on running,” “get ready,” “baby slow down... you’re moving too fast”). So Wray and Walker distinguish themselves by amping up the charm and cheeriness to the max: The suggestively titled album highlight “Sweet Lady” is not some portrait of some temptress, it’s a paean to their mothers. And rather than try to play up any contrast in their voices or establish any call-and-response tension, Lady presents itself as a purely united front, portraying the kind of BFF bond so strong it can easily withstand one friend sleeping with the other’s boy. (The song documenting that transgression comes with the polite titular request “Please Don’t Do it Again.”)</p>
<p>But Lady’s geniality shouldn’t be confused for naivety. As the simmering late-album ballad “Habit” makes clear, Wray and Walker are fully aware that they’re often “smiling through the pain,” finding themselves in romantic arrangements that blur the line between feeling loved and feeling trapped; even the innocuously titled “Good Lovin’” suggests a deadbeat boyfriend’s only saving grace is that he's good in the sack. And in that admission we can observe the most authentically retro thing about Lady: how they coyly dress up unsavory subjects in innocent packages as if trying to pull a fast one past Ed Sullivan’s censors.</p></div>"|17883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17883-lady-lady/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Though they’ve explored a range of intricate ideas and dynamic approaches during the last 13 years, they’re perhaps best known for extreme volume, with tidal riffs powered by an arsenal of linebacker-sized amplifiers. In Ensemble Pearl, O’Malley is accompanied by Bill Herzog, the former bassist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4083-jesse-sykes-the-sweet-hereafter/"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Sykes &amp; the Sweet Hereafter</a>, and the two flashiest members of Japanese metal pillagers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/620-boris/"" target=""_blank"">Boris</a>-- Atsuo, the bare-chested and gong-banging drummer shouting into the microphone attached to his face, and longtime collaborator Michio Kurihara, a guitarist whose playing seems to thrive partially on sonic showmanship. If you dreamed a team for heavy rock with psychedelic tendencies, this ensemble would be an acceptable fantasy.</p>
<p>But <i>Ensemble Pearl</i>, the quartet’s elegant six-song debut, serves as a spotlight for the plasticity of the musicians that made it, not their power. The brief “Wray”, for instance, recalls little else in the vast catalogues of Ensemble Pearl’s principals. Above a wafting drone that suggests a choir of glass harps, the band adds granulated guitar notes that scrape and pop over guest Eyvind Kang’s mercurial viola tones. For the bulk of the album, however, you’ll likely recognize O’Malley’s steely tone and deliberate progressions from Sunn O)))’s more spare moments. But he avoids the monolithic sound of that group, or their full-length collaboration with Boris, 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9563-altar/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Altar</i></a>. Instead, he etches his riffs here at a relatively low volume. During the smoldering seven-minute “Painting on a Corpse”, he traces each arid note toward its vanishing point. If Sunn O))) began as an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Earth</a> tribute band, Ensemble Pearl is an extension of Earth’s latter-day testudinal blues. “Island Epiphany” begins with a similarly subdued lurch, but it rises steadily in both density and decibels. Nine minutes in, the track nears its apogee of intensity, Kurihara webbing sheets of noise and sustain through the rhythm section’s insistent trot and O’Malley’s still-flickering riff. Even then, though, the music feels more like a conversation than a shouting match or, in the case of Sunn O))), an ordered instrumental chant.</p>
<p>That conversational aspect is crucial for <i>Ensemble Pearl</i>, a record whose layers connect with one another without coercing one another. Though Atsuo has certainly been at times quiet with Boris, his playing here stands as some of the most patient and considered of his career. When the guitars go a bit wild during “Island Epiphany”, he and Herzog stay the course, fostering tension by providing an anchor. He does little more than keep time with his snare and add texture with his cymbals for “Ghost Parade”, and that distance gives even his smallest contributions that much more impact. Ensemble Pearl seems very much about sustaining the balance between being present and passive, or using minor devices to create major effects. To that end, “Giant”-- the late-album, sans-drum drone charged by amplifier hum, and Kang’s viola-- stands as this band’s crowning achievement. These 10 minutes are thick but strangely luminous. The sound is as unified and overwhelming as the audio environments <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"" target=""_blank"">La Monte Young</a> built with the Theatre of Eternal Music, but every element is clear and balanced. You’ll notice moments of twinkling timbre and radiating noise just beneath the hum, telltale signs of the real-time interaction between the players in the room.</p>
<p>That interaction began in 2009, when <span lang=""en-GB"">the band</span> first assembled in Tokyo to start writing material that became part of Gisèle Vienne’s multimedia play, <a href=""http://www.g-v.fr/creations/ve-thisishowyouwilldisappear-frameset.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>This is How You Will Disappear</i></a>. Those sessions only began to take shape as an album after the players realized how much they enjoyed working together, so, years later, they returned to the material and finished it stateside with producer and engineer Randall Dunn. Later this year, O’Malley reports, Ensemble Pearl will likely begin work on a new record with additional members. That’s good news not only because this debut itself is compelling but because, at last, it represents a clear synthesis of so many of O’Malley’s activities. In recent years, Sunn O))) has limited its activity to rare live shows, reissues, and rehearsal releases, freeing O’Malley to explore the more experimental realm of his muse. Last year, his duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5026-ktl/"" target=""_blank"">KTL</a> released its best disc yet, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16622-v/"" target=""_blank""><i>V</i></a>. His new label, Ideologic Organ, has issued excellent and overlooked work from composer Mats Lindström and improviser Norbert Möslang. He’s <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1607"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">improvised with</a> Tim Hecker and Steve Noble, and at <a href=""http://www.tectonicsfestival.com/glasgow/schedule"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">May’s Tectonics Festival</a> in Glasgow, he will perform both with American innovator Alvin Lucier and Romanian spectralist <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Iancu+Dumitrescu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iancu Dumitrescu</a>. That dossier is meant to say that, of all his projects, Ensemble Pearl feels like a probable and timely place for O’Malley’s past with Sunn O))) to collide with his future outside of it-- that is, a laboratory with purpose.</p></div>"|17680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17680-ensemble-pearl-ensemble-pearl/|7.4|Grayson Currin

Back then, his band Oval was a trio, but Popp subsequently went solo and pursued an increasingly abstruse aesthetic with a series of albums for <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/splash.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a>. Popp has often said that his work from this era was concerned with deconstructing and commenting on ""music"" in the traditional sense of the term, rather than participating directly in that culture. Oval's ""Aero Deck"", from 1994's <i>Systemisch</i>, was sampled on ""Unison"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>'s <i>Vespertine</i>, which takes a similarly deconstructionist approach.</p>
<p>In 2010, after almost a decade of silence from the Oval project, Popp started afresh with the name. He described <i>O</i>, released as Oval, as feeling like a ""debut album"". Sampled sonic minutiae were replaced with real instruments, ""loops"" replaced with ""riffs,"" and careful studio arrangements supplemented with live improvisation. The results, by Oval's standards, were unprecedentedly warm and inviting. This pioneer of the abstract was, he claimed, finally making ""music.""</p>
<p>Take a closer look at Oval's discography, though, and this narrative starts to feel simplistic. For all his emphasis on procedure over music and his use of self-imposed compositional restraints, Popp has always had something of a populist sensibility. Half of Oval's oft-overlooked 1993 debut LP, <i>Wohnton</i>, featured charmingly unschooled vocals and breakbeat-led percussion, inviting comparisons with contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5164-seefeel/"" target=""_blank"">Seefeel</a>. A decade later, Popp collaborated with singer Eriko Toyoda as So, for an eponymous LP where twilit vocal-guitar ballads lurked under the clouds of digital filigree.</p>
<p><i>Calidostopia!, </i>recently <a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/?uj7dj1azzs6jigw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released</a> as a free download, isn't so much a bolt from the blue as a return to a long-held preoccupation. This record was the result of a 10-day recording session in Salvador De Bahia in Brazil, funded by the Goethe Institute and the Cultural Foundation of the State of Bahia. Popp brought along tracks taken from <i>O</i>, its preceding EP <i>Oh</i>, and offcuts compilation <i>OvalDNA</i>, as well as some unreleased sketches. Seven vocalists from across South America transformed them, in Popp's words, from ""material"" into ""songs."" As such, this record treats vocals in a manner more direct than Popp has attempted since <i>Wohnton</i>, and foregrounds the song-like forms latent in Popp's recent compositions.</p>
<p>Given that many of these tracks have been previously released, the palette of this album will be familiar: gorgeous resonant tones, somewhere between guitar and plucked piano strings, that sputter sharply or lap like waves; splashy drums dancing nimbly around a groove; miniaturised squalls of electronic noise. In fact, as with <i>O</i>, Popp's choice of sounds is almost <i>too</i> uniform, leaving it up to the vocalists to ward off potential monotony. Here they have mixed success. At points the marriage of vocal and backing is entirely adequate but doesn't really amount to more than the sum of its parts. Maité Gadea fails to take command in ""Glossy"", and her contribution feels slightly extraneous as a result; Aiace's melodies on ""Alpen"" and ""Credit Roll"" unfold in a measured, staid manner that seems to stifle the organic nature of their backings.</p>
<p>But a handful of exquisite moments make the whole thing worthwhile. Agustín Albrieu is the most reliable in this regard, his wonderfully clear, open tone lending a starry-eyed quality to opener ""Featurette"" and closer ""Savvy Aeropuerto"". Elsewhere, Hana Kobayashi transforms ""Koral"" into a beautiful hushed lullaby, undeniably the record's highlight. <i>Calidostopia!</i> certainly feels like a hothoused project rather than a painstakingly constructed album-- the vocals are a little lacking in finesse at points, and the wholesale use of pre-existing tracks can lend the thing a feeling of inflexibility. But at its best it's a captivating listen, and an admirable move from a producer who continues to challenge himself after two decades in the game. ""This might be only the beginning,"" says Popp of this project. Fingers crossed.</p></div>"|17860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17860-oval-calidostopia/|6.8|Angus Finlayson

Those two acts have already reissued their entire catalogs, but Low have kept on keeping on. Still, slowcore is an odd sound to buoy such a long career and sturdy catalog, if only because it’s defined by its self-imposed limitation: at its best, that slow tempo can be as intense as a punk song; as boring as wallpaper at its worst. Having hit both extremes at one point or another, the most perfectly named band on the planet have owned up to the restrictions of their aesthetic.</p>
<p>As a result, their catalog is not necessarily diverse, but they’ve managed to find a great deal of variety within this small patch of terrain, thanks primarily to the open-ended nature of the band. Sparhawk and Parker have proved mainstays, with numerous musicians caught in their orbit over time (the latest being multi-instrumentalist Steve Garrington). Furthermore, Low have never shied away from working with producers who bring their own specific styles and aesthetics to their songs. In the late 1990s, Kramer, Steve Fisk, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a> helped them define and refine their sound; in the next decade, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6743-dave-fridmann/"">Dave Fridmann</a> and Matt Beckley helmed albums with varying success. All used the band’s glacial dirges as a blank canvas, and Low savored these outside perspectives, as though they knew the band was never quite a self-contained unit.</p>
<p>The latest producer to helm the boards for Low is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>, who recorded the band at the Loft in Chicago. On one hand, he’s such a perfect match that it’s surprising they’ve never worked together before: they’re all indie veterans who have come to represent various aspects of the Midwest-- Tweedy the busyness of Chicago and Low the remote plane of Duluth. On the other hand, Tweedy may be the most Americana-bound producer Low have hired, and at the very least represents a departure from Albini’s punk austerity, Fridmann’s art-sprawl, and Beckley’s pop haze. Especially compared to their 2000s output, <i>The Invisible Way</i> sounds crisp and live, produced to emphasize the individual instruments and to highlight their natural reverb. The sustain of the piano is a major component on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15024-so-blue/"" target=""_blank"">“So Blue”</a> and “Waiting”, and the Loft shapes the fading tones of Sparhawk’s sharply picked acoustic guitar on “Amethyst”. The album sounds so good-- and so quintessentially Low-- that the music distracts from the occasionally weak songwriting, which is just what it’s supposed to do.</p>
<p>This sparer sound allows Low and Tweedy to emphasize the drama of the album that distinguishes it from previous Low efforts. While “Holy Ghost” and “Mother” sound sharp in their soft-spoken approach, the pace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14748-just-make-it-stop/"" target=""_blank"">“Just Make It Stop”</a> is relentless, at least relative to how we perceive the band, with the piano pushing Parker’s vocals to a subtly harried and desperate pace that fits the lyrics. She’s a stronger presence on this album, singing five songs (nearly half the tracklist) instead of her usual one or two. Even when she’s not taking lead, she remains prominent. As Sparhawk ponders the nature of time and songwriting on opener “Plastic Cup”, Parker ghosts his vocals, her voice trailing off of his and turning each line into a question thrown into the abyss.</p>
<p>Parker and Sparhawk sound like true equals on <i>The Invisible Way,</i> as their songwriting, singing, and playing complement each other vividly. Still, he gets saddled with two of the weakest tracks here, which is especially disappointing coming so soon after his excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5700-retribution-gospel-choir/"">Retribution Gospel Choir </a>album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17533-3/"">3</a>. </i>With its prominent, yet distracting proper nouns, “Clarence White” sounds like it should allude to something specific, yet the only thing truly harrowing about it is the steady, unsettling drum tattoo. When every other instrument falls away, that simple rhythm sounds like that old horror trope: the lumbering monster you can’t seem to outrun. “On My Own” begins with a sweet, straightforward melody about the looming fear of solitude, but then blunders into a lengthy outro that awkwardly languishes in some guitar fuzz and wishes you happy birthday 32 damn times. Repetition has always been a useful, if risky tool in Low’s songwriting kit, but here it just sounds jarring, even embarrassing.</p>
<p>Even when it stumbles, though, <i>The Invisible Way </i>gives the impression of a band on the run. From what, not even they can say. But something horrible lies in wait just offscreen, something like time or death or irrelevance or separation. Low are wise enough not to show the monster, which means these songs are compelled by a strange desperation and worry-- as though Low are barely keeping their demons at bay. Nothing on these songs sounds the least bit rote or comfortable, and that’s remarkable for a band so far into an unlikely career. <i>The Invisible Way</i> suggests that Parker and Sparhawk have been able to maintain the band for so long by never making it easy on themselves. They’ve questioned every assumption about what a band like Low-- a band with a very rigid aesthetic-- can do, which has proven a sound strategy for turning a trend like slowcore into a career.</p></div>"|17781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17781-low-the-invisible-way/|7.3|Stephen M.

But if you’ve never heard or heard of the bracing Winnipeg trio named for Henry Rollins’ infamous “Kill Everyone Now” mentality, <i>Entrench</i> might fool you into believing that this is indeed their coming-out moment. A belligerent shot of heavy metal and hardcore, math rock and no wave, <i>Entrench</i> bears the best signs of a debut. It is urgent and relentless, restless and angry. Guitarist and singer Jesse Matthewson writes and leads a bit like a pissed-off teenager, too-- toward the end of the browbeating “No; I’m in Control”, he chants the song’s title eight times, as if taking his cues from a bedroom Zack de la Rocha poster. He writes about the sickening contentment of middle-age, adulthood’s end of idealism, and the existential anaesthetic of religion, making him every upstart punk you’ve ever heard. The band backs Matthewson as though these barbed rants are gospel, too, with riffs so sharp and rhythms so bruising that, like the best opening shots, they demand that you pay attention. For 47 minutes, <i>Entrench</i> becomes a vacuum of energy and attention, a void that puts everything else in soft focus.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is a debut for KEN mode-- or, at the very least, a restart. In 2011, Invisible Oranges <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/10/interview-ken-mode/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> Matthewson about the band’s transition into a full-time touring act. His answers were a bit of a downer. He described the band’s experience at festivals as “stressful clusterfucks,” decried the stunted attention spans of modern listeners, and kvetched about how immigration issues had interfered with their new “American bassist.” From the tone of the answers, the imminent end of KEN mode wouldn’t have come as much of a surprise. But seven months later, the band’s fourth LP, <i>Venerable</i>,<i> </i>bested records by Anvil and Fuck the Facts to <a href=""http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/headbang-blogpost.aspx?post=d385d4b7-35cf-4fcd-a92b-b688a3db053d"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">win</a> Canada’s JUNO Award for Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year.</p>
<p>Talk about a validating turnaround: Using their new platform to secure funding from Canadian arts organizations, KEN mode entered the studio with high-end producer <a href=""http://www.mattbayles.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt Bayles</a> for what Matthewson has <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/02/interview-jesse-matthewson-ken-mode/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called</a> the longest session of his life, and subsequently signed to international metal bastion <a href=""http://www.season-of-mist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Season of Mist</a>. What’s more, before winning the JUNO, Matthewson and his brother, drummer Shane Matthewson, incorporated that new “American bassist,” Andrew LaCour, into the band full-time. Back across the border, LaCour had played guitar and written songs in the sidewinding metal act Khaan, which convinced the Matthewson brothers to collaborate with him on these songs, the first time they’d done so in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>While <i>Entrench</i> does offer up a new KEN mode, this fresh trio of veterans leverages its past in songs that offer much more than simplistic one-and-done bursts. The structures are counterintuitive and compelling. After Matthewson repeatedly shouts the title of “No; I’m in Control”, the band returns to the first verse, reinforcing its indictment of the morally effete. “The Promises of God” has an all-italics momentum that carries through to the end. The bulk of this record sprints and stomps, but the two downtempo tracks-- string-and-electronics-lifted closer “Monomyth” and haunting metallic slow-burn “Romeo Must Never Know”-- show more development than stereotypical mid-album metal brooders. LaCour orchestrated the strings on the former and added spectral piano to the latter. Paired with his mean, blown-out bass parts elsewhere, he’s not only retrenched KEN mode’s fury but smartened it, too.</p>
<p>Those smarts also show up in Matthewson’s writing. Though he starts with the spirit of a youthful misanthrope, he backs his rhetoric with substance. He references Canada’s great Burgess Shale fossil fields, makes keen New Testament allusions, and weaves together webs of polysyllabics that, against most odds, don’t sound pretentious. Speaking of pretense, Matthewson has now been at this long enough to realize that the world isn’t a black-and-white scenario of dreamless day-jobbers and indignant Youth Crew lifers. He pokes fun at his own moral indiscretions and self-pity. During opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14769-counter-culture-complex/"" target=""_blank"">“Counter Culture Complex”</a>, he invokes the theories of psychologist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Abraham Maslow</a> to burst the bubbles of the self-righteousness in his scene. “You’re smarter than this, and human psych is more complex than you prefer to credit,” Matthewson yammers and yells, pausing for emphasis and for a quick riff that closes tight like a noose. “But I won’t argue. I’m not 17 anymore.”</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Entrench</i> for the first few times, it might be hard to believe him-- that he’s not still a teenager, that this band doesn’t have more than a decade at its back, that this isn’t your new favorite crossover crew. <i>Entrench</i>, after all, brandishes a few mottos you’ll want to keep handy, things you’ll wish you would have said in high school. The refrain of “Your Heartwarming Story Makes Me Sick” should echo in your head next time you encounter treacle or melodrama; the same goes for the titular admonishment of “Figure Your Life Out”. But there’s more to these 11 songs than simple sloganeering or reverent hardcore clamor, even if it initially feels that way. <i>Entrench</i> is the work of veterans who earned the rare second chance to make a first impression. They do not waste the opportunity.</p></div>"|17608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17608-entrench/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Hit-Boy’s most recent move was to form Hits Since ‘87, his own imprint under Interscope Records. <i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i> is a label compilation introducing HS87’s roster. It succeeds where <i>HITstory</i> didn’t when Hit-Boy surrenders control to his utility players, whose strengths carry these songs to places he couldn’t.</p>
<p>HS87 comprises Hit-Boy, Virginia native Kent M$NEY, singer/producer K. Roosevelt, and Audio Push, the rap duo best known for 2009’s West Coast jerk scene hit “Teach Me How to Jerk”. They’ve all worked together before (a handful of these songs originated on individual members' solo releases), and a natural chemistry rescues <i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i> from the clinical commercialism that has hampered recent rapper vanity label compilations. Where <i>Cruel Summer</i> occasionally felt like Kanye leading unwieldy Tinker Toy monstrosities into a war on radio, and Maybach Music Group’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>Self Made</i> series</a> coldly vampirized Southern rap aggression, <i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i> sounds like lighthearted, likeminded friends shooting the shit over plush beats. The mixtape might owe some of its mirth to the fact that it’s a free release from a group of artists stalking the edges of the average rap fan’s line of sight, but <i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i>’s breezy feel is as much a triumph of good craftsmanship as it is of low stakes.</p>
<p>Hit-Boy’s still a tough sell as a rapper because he imparts more of what he owns than who he is, and he hasn’t accrued the technical prowess required to distract the listener from that. He’s better served bobbing and weaving between his signees’ more seasoned lyricism, and <i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i> wisely slathers his appearances in hooks from K. Roosevelt and scene-stealing bars from Kent M$NEY and Audio Push, who up the ante with nimble flows and verses that ground Hit-Boy’s trash talk in salt-of-the-earth struggles. Hit-Boy’s not to be counted out, though: When he leans all the way into the Kanye persona on the title track, he comes out with a “Fuck you, we made it” anthem whose obnoxiousness for once seems hard-fought. He’s also responsible for most of the production, which is top shelf, barring tracks like “You Wouldn’t Believe It” and <i>HITstory</i> holdover “Fan”, whose production sounds like the microwaved remnants of “Clique” and “Niggas in Paris”.</p>
<p><i>All I’ve Ever Dreamed Of</i> is best seen as a showcase for Hit-Boy’s teambuilding and production skills. Audio Push's radically improved lyrical attack has awarded them a fighting chance at bounding back from the regional one-hit wonder label they’ve been saddled with since “Teach Me How to Jerk”, and Kent M$NEY makes the best of the sporadic appearances he gets here. The mixtape’s real star is K. Roosevelt, who displays an unflappable knack for hooks and a dollop of weirdness late in the album when he gets a solo spot in “Tonight” and turns in a roboticized new wave soul number that damn near bests everything else on the tape for intrigue and effortlessness. Hit-Boy's ear for talent is as valuable as his ear for sounds that pop, and his scaled back role as ringleader here is the best fit for him as a great producer who isn't so great at rapping yet. He may never get the <i>College Dropout</i> moment he's looking for, but that doesn't mean he should stop trying.</p></div>"|17885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17885-hit-boy-hit-boy-presents-hs87-all-ive-ever-dreamed-of/|7.2|Craig Jenkins

By day, the south Londoner was a teaching assistant in an elementary school; by night, he recorded synthesizer-plumped ballads in his front room. You hope for the kids’ sake that there wasn’t much correspondence between the two; story time round Daniel’s is a gloomy hour, full of mumbled doubts and unsettling lullabies. Unlike the playfulness and joy of creation inherent in, say, former kindergarten teacher <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Bat for Lashes</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9855-fur-gold/"">debut</a>, there’s little obvious link between Woolhouse’s personal and private worlds on <i>Life After Defo</i>, a disconnect that persists throughout the album.</p>
<p>Establishing these barriers is clearly some kind of protective reflex for Woolhouse: For his part, he <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/15/deptford-goth-life-after-defo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that he knows he’s not very expressive in conversation, and that making music “is kind of a way of transmitting those feelings without having to look someone in the eye.” But <i>Defo</i> plies its trade in indistinct “feelings”: The title is meant to allude to a state post-certainty (“Deffo” is a British abbreviation for “definitely” mostly used by posh students), which is backed up by a frustrating emptiness in many of the lyrics, most of which aren’t audible. “There must never be/ There will never be/ There will never be…” Woolhouse repeats during the chorus of “Bloody Lip”, without ever specifying what terrible thing must never again come to pass. “Something’s coming and I can’t see what it is,” he mumbles on the whirring glow of “Union”, reminding us that one man's profound uncertainty is another's half-assed, unfinished thought.</p>
<p><i>Defo</i> sounds very beautiful, though there’s little to positively distinguish it from similar records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/"" target=""_blank"">Active Child</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a> (XL Recordings house engineer Rodaidh McDonald worked on <i>Total Loss</i> and <i>Defo</i>), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>. Woolhouse became known through a Mariah Carey tribute jam, but says that “at the heart of every song there is a little old blues singer with a guitar.” He’s buried deep if so, beneath a monastic, reverential cloud that couches glimmering organs, stuttering firecracker percussion, beatific harp sounds, and an occasional ominous sheen that sounds skimmed from a softer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2919-mount-eerie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Eerie</a> record. There's been a significant reduction in tempo and action since 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16040-youth-ii-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Youth II</a></i> EP. If that folk singer is there at all, it’s in the forlorn, digitized Bon Iver-style vocal swoops that haunt a number of the songs. Everything here is very well executed, tasteful, and gravely intimate, but when “Bronze Age” clanks and moans into motion like a weepy <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> leading a chain gang, some heart monitor bleeps vainly searching to blur the “real and synthetic” effect Woolhouse explores here, it’s not hard to crave something sexier, more melodically robust, and stirring.</p>
<p>To give <i>Defo</i> its dues, Woolhouse has a knack for earwormy melodies, and when he pushes against his comfort zone, he can end up somewhere compelling. “Years” starts as a forlorn, vocal-led lull, but swarms into a dark, wheezing flurry of processed cries, deep horns, and loose, splashing cymbals that bear a certain similarity to post-rock done Tortoise-style. Given that Woolhouse almost exclusively mumbles throughout the record, the lyrical clarity of the chorus to “Object Objects” becomes quite affecting by comparison: “If you’re telling me there’s no such thing as heartache,” he sings, the incredulous high note of “telling me” debunking the notion better than a conclusion probably could in this situation, as the skeleton of some house tune chirrups around him.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank"">debut album</a>, <i>Life After Defo</i> will gain in vitality as it becomes the personal soundtrack to moments of horizontal intimacy and loneliness. But where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank""><i>xx</i></a> was incredibly direct and specific, and all the more human for that, <i>Defo</i> doesn’t give a great deal in the first place, its ethereal chilliness leeching off the human emotions that will undoubtedly be fed to it. Taken as a whole, it’s a pretty, enveloping record that executes its modern influences with panache, though the intangible, purely aesthetic nature of Woolhouse’s vaguely downhearted emotional state makes it hard to appreciate <i>Defo</i> as anything other than luxurious ambient icing.</p></div>"|17753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17753-deptford-goth-life-after-defo/|6.0|Laura Snapes

The album's closing song referenced a movie about a psychic dealing with the death of her dead son, so in case you haven't caught on yet, the Belfast outfit possesses a bit of a morbid streak. Frontman Cathal Cully's wavering, accent-flecked baritone drew immediate comparisons to Brad Hargett of fellow death-obsessed Slumberland labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5753-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Stilts</a>-- as did <i>Dead to Me</i>'s rollicking garage-pop sound, which resembled what you might hear if you played the Stilts' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alight of Night</i></a> at 45 RPM. On that album's highlight, the sulking ""I Lose"", Cully intoned with a touch of dour misery, ""I don't miss my old life,"" a curiously anti-nostalgic statement on a record that so dutifully mined the C86 era's darker corners.</p>
<p><i>Dead to Me</i> was a perfectly fine genre exercise of an album, but given the arguable creative zenith reached by the C86 micro-revival of three years prior, it didn't do much to create a lasting impact-- and as it turns out, Cully wouldn't have it any other way. He recently <a href=""http://www.bowlegsmusic.com/features/interviews/girls-names-interview-29260"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Bowlegs that positive reviews of the album weren't ""wholly justifiable,"" and in press materials for Girls Names' new album, <i>The New Life</i>, he claims that ""<i>Dead to Me</i> literally was dead to us by the time it was committed to wax"". He's not kidding: true to its title, <i>The New Life</i> finds Girls Names ripping it up and starting again, turning their replicative talents towards post-punk's dreamier, more spectral corners. They throw in some faintly chugging motorik and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"" target=""_blank"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a>-sized romance along the way, without ever straying from the type of spiky stuff that turned the word ""angular"" into one of rock criticism's greatest clichés.</p>
<p>Girls Names sound like a new band on <i>The New Life</i>, and at times, they are-- the group's expanded (for now) from a trio to a quartet, thanks to Philip Quinn's synth work on a few album cuts. The greatest noticeable change is in the production quality, which is greatly removed from the tin can trappings of <i>Dead to Me</i> and the 2010 mini-LP <i>You Should Know By Now</i>; Cully produced the album himself, and more bands working in this vein would be smart to hire him behind the boards. Although his hand occasionally tips the scales of self-indulgence, there's a remarkable sense of space on <i>The New Life</i>, a bright whiteness that, ironically, only increases these songs' claustrophobic mood. Even when there's only two or three instruments in the mix, as on the winding opening minutes of ""Drawing Lines"", the atmosphere is dense.</p>
<p>The instrumentation on <i>The New Life</i> is evenly spaced and more varied than Girls Names' previous efforts-- but, really, it's all about the guitars on this one. Cully handles six-string duties on his own here, and in terms of writing clean and expressive melodic lines, he proves as adept as the guitarists in Brooklyn's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a>, another group that's largely able to get by on the strength of their instrumental interplay. At points, he creates expressive layers of interplay, as dubby stabs and walkabout solos sit atop the distant jangle of ""Hypnotic Regression""; elsewhere, as on the darkly shaded ""A Second Skin"", Cully needs only one guitar to spin something melodically sticky, before doubling over in complicated, tangled figures. He's the kind of guitarist that renders indie purists' worries about their genre's abolishment of the instrument as foolishness, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Much of <i>The New Life</i>'s pleasures are found in its instrumentation, a factor which turns out to be the record's defining flaw. Cully's voice worked well as a heavy anchor steadying the relative chaos of Girls Names' previous work, but with a few exceptions-- his floaty high register on ""Drawing Lines"", the considerable swagger possessed on the album's eight-minute leg-stretcher of a title-track-- he sounds almost <i>too</i> removed on this album, his voice acting as merely another element in Girls Names' cloudy-sky mindset. (This atmospheric presence means that the lyrics don't make themselves readily available to the naked ear either-- then again, with song titles like ""Occultation"", you don't need a decoder ring to figure out what he's <i>trying</i> to say.)</p>
<p>Granted, grousing about a lack of distinctive male vocals in 2013 is not a novel pursuit, but what adds insult to <i>The New Life</i>'s moaned injury is that many singers from the musical era mined here-- the Cure's Robert Smith, Echo and the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch, Joy Division's Ian Curtis, just to name the ones who immediately stand out-- stood out for sounding bold and, often, <i>weird</i>, regardless of how accessible the music surrounding them was. For now, Cully's another voice in the crowd in that regard, but his promising talent displayed elsewhere on <i>The New Life</i> suggests that he's one to keep your ears perked up for nonetheless.</p></div>"|17886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17886-girls-names-the-new-life/|6.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Her voice is uncharacteristically low, her explosive finger-tapping guitar conspicuously absent. Instead, a piano blocks out melancholy chords over a drum fill that sounds like boulders cascading down a hillside. ""Give me a sign,"" she pleads, exhausted. ""Give me a sign.""</p>
<p>Two minutes later, she has moved on to a song called ""Hell Yes"". If Marnie Stern has a cycle, it's this: Fall down, then pick yourself back up-- and up! And up! And UP! Her music-- a frantic, precise sound that can resemble excerpts of Van Halen looped at high speeds-- combats bottomless self-doubt with limitless hope. Nearly every song in her catalog is some reiteration of the idea that even <i>you</i> can do it, probably with an exclamation point. Talking to <i>The N</i><i>ew Yorker </i>about her guitar technique <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2011/01/03/110103crmu_music_frerejones"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in 2011</a>, she said, ""Tapping is actually a way of cheating, since you're using both of your hands."" Then, like a guru trying to explain the simplicity of her secret to a talk-show audience, she added, ""It makes things a lot easier!""</p>
<p><i>The Chronicles of Marnia</i> is an extension of the transition she started on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14705-marnie-stern/""><i>Marnie Stern</i></a> toward a more controlled, more subdued sound. Not that any of her music is a good reference point for ""controlled"" or ""subdued."" <i>Marnia </i>still sounds like Marnie Stern: aggressive, busy, bright, with death-defying highs and perilous lows. But where she often used to shriek, now she sometimes sighs, and the frantic, start-stop quality of her early songs has given way to something more like a swoon.</p>
<p>Part of the relative calm on <i>Marnia</i> has to do with personnel change. Until now, she's worked with drummer Zach Hill, first of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2003-hella/"" target=""_blank"">Hella</a> and most recently of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a>; on <i>Marnia</i>, she's backed by Kid Millions, who mostly plays with Brooklyn drone and psych-rock fixture <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"" target=""_blank"">Oneida</a>. Millions plays like a firework display: Big, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT26L1vtgkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dazzling</a> and dangerous, but very well coordinated. Hill's approach-- intoxicating as it is-- is more like a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCWiogdCMY0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nailbomb</a> in a concrete-block basement. Compared to the sway of <i>Marnia</i>, the sputtering sound of 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9919-in-advance-of-the-broken-arm/""><i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i></a> has as much groove as a three-legged race.</p>
<p>For all her positive mental attitudes, Marnie Stern's music is intensely vulnerable, a quality that has always been hinted at in her music but that <i>Marnia</i> makes much clearer. Even in the midst of its most festive moments, like the conga-line rhythms of ""Noonan"", she's drawn to piercing, almost childlike questions: ""Don't you want to be somebody?"" Just as she and Millions start to build the vicious ""You Don't Turn Down"", the drums flare out and the curtain drops. ""'What took you so long?' they said out loud,"" she sings alone. ""'Got to get obsessed and stay there now'""-- an image of an artist embarrassed that they aren't capable of kicking as much ass as someone else would like. But the root of Stern's weakness is also the root of her power: The impression that she could fall apart at any second wouldn't be nearly as dramatic if she wasn't moving so dangerously fast.</p>
<p>Under all the noise on Marnie Stern’s albums there has always been a need for some kind of quiet: For the thoughts to stop cycling, for the silence to take over, for the danger, real or imagined, to be replaced by a sense of safety. Though her inspirations tend mostly toward mid-1980s triumph rock and the more agitated end of indie (Sleater-Kinney, Helium, Hella), her most original music sounds like snack-sized versions of Indian raga or Philip Glass: by building intensity until it reaches a peak so humming and hypnotic that the busyness of it turns into some kind of mystical autopilot. It makes sense that her lyrics have been strewn with the kind of inspirational talk that usually applies to athletes: Her music is the runner's high, the moment when physical intensity turns into an almost meditative state.</p>
<p>Until now, Stern has lived an artistic double life, treated like a sensitive singer-songwriter for her persona and some posthuman techno-wizard for the way she plays a guitar. On every album since her debut, these two parts of her have come closer together. On <i>Marnia</i>, they’re one. ""Close your eyes,"" she sings over the grand, noisy waltz of ""Still Moving"". ""Nobody knows when it's gonna be. Nobody knows when it's gonna be. Close your eyes,"" she repeats, consoling, for the first time in song, someone other than herself.</p>
<p>""Maturity"" is a hackneyed trope in songwriting, not to mention a word that doesn't quite suit a grown woman who periodically blogs under the name <a href=""http://vajamming.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marnie's fagina</a>. But <i>Marnia</i> isn't the single touch that shatters, it's the long, steady stare that gives way to embrace. Not obsession, as she puts it on ""You Don't Turn Down"", but something deeper, solemn, and more lasting.</p></div>"|17721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17721-marnie-stern-the-chronicles-of-marnia/|8.0|Mike Powell

Barbara Manning duets with McNew on the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band's ""I Want to Be With You""; Chris Knox, who had supposedly never played trumpet before, blurts a double-tracked solo on the Ronettes/Beach Boys tune ""I Can Hear Music.""</p>

In the early 1980s, Lee Abrams, the young prodigy radio consultant, had already spread his vision of “narrow-casting” to American radio, splitting the American listening populace into hundreds of distinct mini-markets and forcibly uncoupling the DNA strands of Black and White music for a generation of listeners in the process. MTV, on the other hand, was a sea of synth-pop, hair metal, and white faces; by the last year surveyed in this compilation, the station had still programmed fewer than 10 rap videos total.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The result was a systemic, pervading sort of cultural racism that had been allowed to gather like rot. It even tainted those who benefited from it, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"" target=""_blank"">Hall &amp; Oates</a>, whose records were promoted on the advertiser-friendly and lucrative White pop FM stations that their Black musical heroes were banned from. Such was the world that French hipster Jean Karakos surveyed with a baleful eye when he first visited New York City in 1981: “I saw it with my own eyes in the shops-- there was nothing interesting in these big stores. Just mainstream rock, the same old shit all the time,” he told <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/11470-celluloid-records-review-essay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Quietus</a>. ""So, I decided at that point to go and live there in the States.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Having started in the record business in Paris as an importer, Karakos had spent years loading his car with the best and most interesting records he could find in London’s Rough Trade shops and driving them back to home to sell and distribute. Egged along by his writer friend Bernard Zekri, who was already in New York, he relocated and began exploring on the ground. New York City in 1981, it turns out, was a pretty ideal moment for those who were looking to sniff out interesting culture. Hip-hop was snaking its furtive way down from the Bronx and into downtown clubs like the Ritz and the Roxy, prodded along enthusiastically by ambassadors like Fab 5 Freddy, where it fell in front of the eyes of transfixed interlopers: Rick Rubin, ambling out of his Weinstein dormitory to the “Wheels of Steel” night at Negril; Wendy Day, the stout working-class white woman who would go on to form the Rap Coalition, having her world recalibrated by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1852-grandmaster-flash/"" target=""_blank"">Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five</a>; and Karakos, along with his friend Bernard Zekri. Karakos, like Rubin and Day, was enraptured by what he saw and decided to get involved.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The story told by <i>Change the Beat </i>is of this moment-- the first collision between Bronx rap with downtown hipsters, the moment when the first art school kids and rappers mingled and checked out each others’ weird records. As with all nascent connections between white and black cultures, the moments it documents are furtive, endearing, electric, and ill-advised. The title of the compilation comes from the only rap track that Fab 5 Freddy ever cut; at Karakos’ behest, Freddy rapped in French over a spare backbeat alongside Zekri’s French-speaking girlfriend (calling herself “Beeside” or “B Side” or just “Beside”) and the resulting song became a club hit. Freddy’s vocal tag also found its way into the backbone of Herbie Hancock’s “Rockit.” It is one of the many great leaping-synapse moments on <i>Change the Beat</i>, one where you can hear a charge in the air of mutual discovery, and the rules for countless future sub-genres being written. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There are dozens of these “Eureka!” moments spread across <i>Change the Beat</i>’s 30 tracks: Karakos, aided and abetted by his likeminded house producer and label partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2435-bill-laswell/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Laswell</a>, began greedily bottling lightning everywhere around him. The 1983 electro classic “Wildstyle” is here, from Afrika Bambaataa’s outfit Time Zone. There is “Makossa Rock,” eleven minutes of slow-motion controlled explosion by Laswell’s group Deadline, which counted Manu Dibango on sax and Bernie Worrell, offering his signature squeedling jello-mold keyboard funk, among its members. Oh, and who shows up on guitar “Doriella du Fontaine”, chop-chording along to the shaggy-dog proto-rap by The Last Poets member Lightning Rod? That would be Jimi Hendrix, along with Buddy Miles, on a tour stop. Cataloguing all of the “holy shit” moments documented on <i>Change the Beat</i>, and considering their accumulated weight on the dance, rap, punk and art scenes that followed, is almost exhausting. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Change the Beat</i> is never exhausting. Disorienting, maybe, as you veer from asphyxiated post-punk wheezes like “Killing Time” to French cold-wave numbers like Nini Raviolette’s “Suis-Je Normale” to Ginger Baker’s “Dust to Dust,” which is just some twanging guitars and fretless bass. Celluloid released <i>everything</i>, genre or sales potential be damned, and that came to include some stuff that just wasn’t any good, like the minute-long rant that is the free-jazz group Last Exit’s cover of Jimmy Reed’s “Big Boss Man”, or stuff that hasn’t stood the test of time, like French avant-rock bass guitarist Ferdinand Richard’s stumbling garage-psych “Tele, Apres La Meteo.” Through all of it, though, even the small rough patches, runs a certain boundless city energy, the energy of people falling in love with other people’s ideas while the tapes were rolling. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This energy is never more palpable or infectious than “The Escapades of Futura 2000”, which presents listeners with a tableau not far away from what most people imagine when they romanticize early 1980s downtown New York: Futura, the famed American graffiti artist, rapping goofily over a live funk groove; Fab 5 Freddy, cheering along in the background alongside fellow graffiti legend Dondi White. Keith Haring is shouted out in the song’s outro, and on the hook, Futura mounts a heartfelt aesthetic defense of graffiti-- “There’s a lot more to it if you check into it, but the problem is you’re probably looking right through it!”-- that doubles as a neat metaphor for the plight of the developing genre with which graffiti was inextricably tied. If you <i>are</i> given to romanticizing cultural eras, you could pick worse moments to cherish.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, a shadow of melancholy hovers over the idealism of <i>Change the Beat</i>, and the Celluloid project by extension. The purity of the enthusiasm and curiosity coursing through the music tells its own story,and it’s a beautiful one-- about the power of music to teach empathy, leap over societal barriers, and broaden experiences. But the truths pressing in outside the studio walls complicate that story: Radio remained effectively segregrated, walling hip-hop off into nightly mix shows or Urban formats, until 1993. The more opportunistic, less scrupulous members of the scene Celluloid documented, meanwhile, found ways to cash in: Malcolm McLaren’s turntables record “Buffalo Gals” became a crossover hit, finding its way into the mainstream pop world that ignored Grandmaster Flash. Against this backdrop, Karakos’ furiously creative, quixotic little label seems less like a revolution and more like an island, a brief moment of respite from the larger struggles that resume the minute the music stops playing.</p></div>"|17495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17495-change-the-beat-the-celluloid-records-story-1980-1987/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Of course, radio stations are fickle by nature, which is what makes them such an enduring lyrical metaphor. <i>The Stand-In</i> is a gorgeous-sounding chronicle of such archetypal props, characters, and sounds, though the conceit does occasionally smother their narrator’s natural, vital wit.</p>
<p><i>The Stand-In</i> was written in Rose’s living room, where she would get drunk with her two best friends and write songs for characters, underpinned by a streak of personal experience. Warring couples, wallflowers, mismatched just-marrieds, the haunted heartbroken, and fading stars all crop up, united by their mistrust in appearances, awareness of how we can bring out the worst in one another, and a life of lowered expectations. There’s a sneaky, killer couplet at the end of “Pink Champagne”, all softly weeping pedal steel and somberly stepping bass drum, where, some time after a Vegas wedding that they knew was a bad idea even then, the groom wearily observes, “Never will forget the day you turned and said to me/ ‘Darlin’, it was just as lovely as I dreamed that it could be.’”</p>
<p>That slightly passive mode of dejection lingers over parts of <i>The Stand-In</i>, though. Caitlin Rose is witty, brilliant company in interviews and on-stage, and songs like “Shanghai Cigarettes” from 2010’s <i>Own Side Now</i> amply proved that her charming voice can carry all those qualities musically, too. Rose started out playing warehouse punk shows alongside bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28937-jeff-the-brotherhood/"" target=""_blank"">JEFF the Brotherhood</a>, but the often disconnected, character-led nature of <i>The Stand-In</i> means that she’s usually singing at half-mast in a sweet but mopey tone that seems to say, “don’t worry about me, I’ll be okay”; on the Hawaiian cabaret of “Golden Boy”, she pleas for a cad to stick around under the proviso, “I won’t ask you what you’re here for if you’ll stay.”</p>
<p>Although Rose’s voice contains fathoms of power largely untapped here, it is a striking instrument to carry a hypnotic, achey-breaky, pop-catchy chorus, of which she has bucketloads. It's the magnetic power of these choruses that stop <i>The Stand-In</i> from slipping into classy, stiflingly comfortable pastiche. She bares her teeth a little on “Waitin’”, a scathing, sad number where two former halves of a couple realize that neither party ever thought it would work out; on “Only a Clown”, co-written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2174-the-jayhawks/"" target=""_blank"">the Jayhawks</a>’ Gary Louris, she flips a clichéd couplet about putting “a record on” and having the “band play a song” by rolling her eyes at the idea that songs “all about love and believing” have anything at all to do with real life.</p>
<p><i>The Stand-In</i> opts out of such conundrums by existing in a sort of fantasy world where people call the radio when they have no-one else to speak to-- more over, where people call each other at all. Its use of swooning pedal steel, twangin’ electric guitar, and ringing tube amps give it a period-perfect, shuttered-off feel that's occasionally prone to becoming a tad cheesy, but in an un-self-conscious, honest fashion. Rose's imperviousness to the whims of modern production and concerns is admirable in a way, though she's undoubtedly got the chops to shed the stylistic crutch if she wanted to.</p></div>"|17796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17796-caitlin-rose-the-stand-in/|7.0|Laura Snapes

While previous albums offered opportunities for wisecracks and appreciative homage-- the heavily referential cover of 2011's <i>Dress Like Your Idols</i> is one such example-- their newest record, <i>Pretend to Be Brave</i>, finds the group maintaining their finely honed sonic equilibrium while exploring intriguing new lyrical motifs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For a breezy, compact guitar pop record, <i>Pretend to Be Brave</i> is surprisingly concerned with maturity and mortality, and this juxtaposition is the source of some of the album's finest moments. Crane immediately explores the former on the wonderful album opener ""Sharpshooters"", a lovely ode to domesticity and companionship that celebrates the resiliency of an adult relationship. The song is BOAT at its best: playful, concise, and armed with sweet, taut guitar melodies. Elsewhere the album is peppered with statements that often opt for gravity over sardonic wit, from the rain-soaked near-death narrative of ""Inside an Aquarium"" to the nautical adventure gone awry of ""With the Sea at My Back."" Album closer ""Grind Likes Gears"" strikes the record's most poignant, bittersweet note, chugging slowly and flecked with pedal steel: ""As months turn into years/ We grind to halt like gears/ Stripped of all their paint and rusting away."" Crane's endearing yelp ably supports these newly serious lyrical themes: he sings about love, aging, and death with an appropriate degree of emotional investment, and never seems flippant.</p>
<p>BOAT's attempts to pair their more complex thematic material with equally engaging songs achieve varying levels of success. The presence of guest vocalist Shelley Short elevates several tracks to new heights, her sweetness complementing and softening the high end of Crane's vocal work; on standout ""Interstellar Helen Keller,"" their interplay is simultaneously reminiscent of both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28243-eternal-summers/"">Eternal Summers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">the New Pornographers'</a> super duo of Neko Case and A.C. Newman. That said, the band's tendency towards brevity occasionally means worthy ideas or melodies are cut short and prematurely discarded. The aforementioned ""Sore Toes and Elbows"" soars to a powerful climax but lacks the lengthy build-up it deserves, and a handful of songs on the album's back half hint at interesting rhythms and melodies without allowing them room to breathe. Crane and his bandmates have tapped into a reservoir of solid ideas that are ripe for expansion, and <i>Pretend to be Brave</i> indicates they could justify using the extra space and time.</p></div>"|17839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17839-boat-pretend-to-be-brave/|6.8|Jamieson Cox

""All that matters is that you recognize that it's just about respect,"" he sings. The song was on 'N Sync's final album, <i>Celebrity</i>, which sold nearly two million copies in the U.S. in its first week-- and by that point the group had gone platinum about 30 times over. Even back then, this desire for meaningful admiration was nagging at Timberlake. ""Pop"" is slyly referenced on ""Strawberry Bubblegum"", a love-as-sugar-rush space-soul trifle from the singer's third LP, <i>The 20/20 Experience</i>. ""I'm gonna love you 'til I make it <i>pop</i>,"" he goes, emphasizing the last word with the exact same sense of joy as he did 12 years ago. But now there's no irked aftertaste. Justin Timberlake is respected, and he's using that cred to make an eight-minute love song with the word ""bubblegum"" in its title that astutely references Barry White, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>-style ambient R&amp;B, and Sly Stone. He's walking the walk and chewing gum at the same time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The same can be said for the rest of <i>The 20/20 Experience</i>, which has Timberlake seamlessly conflating the last 40 years of pop, soul, and R&amp;B into a series of warping seven-minute songs that shamelessly extol the joys of music and marriage. More ambitious <i>and</i> judicious than his first album, <i>Justified</i>, and more consistent than 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11888-futuresexlovesounds/"" target=""_blank""><i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i></a>, the record mixes up not only genres and traditional song structures, but entire critical value systems. The poptimists who rode Timberlake's wave to post-guilty-pleasure virtuousness may decry its lack of three-and-a-half minute hits; old-schoolers may dismiss its simplistic themes. But by combining the direct warmth of a picture-perfect wedding with music that is complex and expansive, he's harkening back to an era when the biggest-selling album could begin with a six-minute, multi-part, groove-based epic called ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" and another extended, expertly arranged, gloriously campy touchstone called ""Thriller"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Within his own discography, Timberlake's current path can be traced back to one song, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>-produced ""Cry Me a River"". More than any other, that track-- which sounds as odd and gothic and heady today as it did in 2002-- made way for his current role as first-class pop vanguard. <i>FutureSex</i>, spearheaded sonically by Timbaland once again, developed the syncopated formula further, lengthening beats, adding scene-setting interludes, and generally approaching pop with the sort of rule-crushing abandon that is often desired but rarely achieved. But then Timberlake went into movieland, and Timbaland, along with many of his peers, went into Euro-schlock-land, and ""SexyBack"" became an ever-foggier memory, made more poignant because it marked a time and a collaboration that seemed completely over. Which is yet another reason why <i>The 20/20 Experience </i>is such a welcome comeback. It's not only about the return of a human being who can hold an entire stadium rapt for hours, but a producer who had seriously lost his way. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>20/20 </i>has Timbaland, along with protege Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon, returning to the sounds that flipped so many ears at the beginning of this century: the Bha<span class=""s1"">ṅ</span>g<span class=""s1"">ṛ</span>ā rhythms that drive ""Don't Hold the Wall"", the squealing vocal samples of ""Spaceship Coupe"", the sinister synths of ""Tunnel Vision"". And the new twist is also a blast from the past: many songs here are augmented with live instrumentation and vocal harmonies that go back to Motown, Stax, and Trojan. The stunning soul strut ""That Girl"" samples reggae great King Sporty's ""Self Destruct"", with Timbaland and Timberlake essentially approaching retro-pop with a hip-hop mentality. It's then, it's now, it's the type of song that'll be around for a long while. </p>
<p class=""p2"">""That Girl"" also sums up the album's overall message: ""I'm in love with that girl, and she told me that she's in love with me,"" sings Timberlake, cleanly and sweetly. The rest of the record unspools that contented emotion-- presumably inspired by Timberlake's 2012 nuptials with actress Jessica Biel-- in various ways. He's high off of love on ""Pusher Love Girl"", he's enjoying a five-star reception with his head-turning date on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14762-suit-tie/"" target=""_blank"">Suit &amp; Tie</a>"", he's exploring the cosmos in a two-person vehicle on ""Spaceship Coupe"", where he sings, ""Everybody's looking for the flyest thing to say/ But I just wanna fly away with you."" The lines double as a love-dumb self-critique; though Timberlake cites Bob Dylan as an idol, he's no bard. This pop star is at his best when leaving intricacies to the music, like the voyeuristic, slightly creepy feeling of all-encompassing infatuation that imbues the swarming ""Tunnel Vision"", or on ""Mirrors"", which conveys both the arena-flattening power and pillowtalk intimacy of finding solace in another person across its eight minutes. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>20/20</i> is akin to another recent album that successfully teased-out excitement from satisfaction, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/"" target=""_blank""><i>4</i></a>. And like Beyoncé, Timberlake is looking to put himself above the fray of those pushing boom-boom beats to quick, repetitive, and oftentimes-numbing hits. It's a sensible strategy. Admittedly, pop culture wasn't built on sensible; instead, it rewards youth and conflict-- there's a reason why Rihanna has more #1 solo singles than JT and Beyoncé combined. Happy marriages, as a rule, do not sell records. But they could. And Timberlake is in a particularly opportunistic position to indulge in such aspirations. As a star who grew up in the money-printing CD era, he's got enough notoriety and loyalty to be able to challenge his audience without alienating them. So he's giving hopeless romantics just a little hope, one clattering seven-minute ode at a time.</p></div>"|17736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17736-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42387-5-10-15-20-julian-lynch/"">installment</a> of Pitchfork's ""5-10-15-20"" series, Lynch even hinted that it had to be that way because he didn't want to annoy his neighbors. It's work that tiptoes gingerly into the world, and there's something endearing about that, indicating a lack of confidence, perhaps, or an intuitive reflex to stick a few barriers between himself and the world that he can't dislodge. </p>
<p>Parallels have been drawn between Lynch's work and post-rock in the past, and it's hard to escape those again on <i>Lines</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14801-carios-kelleyi-i/"" target=""_blank"">""Carios kelley i""</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14801-carios-kelleyi-i/""></a> initially spins into the wistful orbit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">the Sea and Cake</a> before taking a detour into the jazz fusion world <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> explored on <i>TNT</i>. The difference between those groups and Lynch is that, some four albums into his career, it's still hard to figure out who he is and what he's trying to communicate. Lyrics are mostly rendered indecipherable, good ideas are picked up but never returned to. It's music that easy to marvel at, to admire the technical skill and use of sound. But it's much harder to fully fall in love with.</p>
<p>Lynch's music is always meticulously arranged, and the pristine structure of <i>Lines</i> makes it feel like little has changed in his painstakingly precise world since 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15307-terra/""><i>Terra</i></a>. Lynch has a considerable talent in this arena; he knows exactly when to bring in a parp of flatulent horn, or to release the tension when a great pile of instrumental parts begin to teeter on top of one another.</p>
<p>He can play it simple, too. ""Lines"" is one of the prettiest songs he's written to date, and is expertly built up from a simple piece of strummed repetition that allows the rest of the instrumentation to amiably wander into the track as it progresses. It's the second longest song here, which feels key. Often Lynch is a little too quick to call time on his genre digressions. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>-influenced ""Horse Chestnut"" feels like it could have arrived at a different spot altogether if he loosened the tight control on it. But that isn't, and never has been, Lynch's place, and wishing him to get there is, by now, a mostly futile pursuit.</p>
<p>That ""place"" where Lynch resides still mostly remains in the folk tradition, in affably worked songs spun around simple guitar structures, like this album's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15090-gloves/"">""Gloves""</a>. There's never any dirt under his fingernails, never any sense that he has the confidence to reach a place of great lyrical depth. And that's fine, mostly. Occasionally there are unwelcome turns, the stodgy rock of ""Onions"" being a particularly egregious offender, but mostly this is Lynch doing what he does in his usual tasteful but somewhat unremarkable way. If <i>Lines</i> adds something to the world, it's akin to the feeling you get from a small act of kindness from a stranger. Not something you forget in a hurry, but not something that necessarily adds much significance to your life. Lynch seems comfortable here, scattering out another set of question marks, his unassuming approach etched in just a little harder with every passing release.</p></div>"|17782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17782-julian-lynch-lines/|7.0|Nick Neyland

The North Carolina rapper prefaced 2010’s <i>Feel This</i> with an announcement fitting for a release that made its way through chipmunk-soul, stadium-EDM, and a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NXBgSCSrIk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Laffy Taffy”</a> remake: “I’m Deniro on some tracks, Deniro Farrar on other tracks.” He hasn’t outright claimed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DID</a> as an influence on his songwriting since then, but his personality has remained elusive. The production of last February’s <i>DESTINY. altered</i> mixtape was sometimes busy enough to shroud him in the mix, while October’s <i>Kill or Be Killed</i> was a full-length team-up with Oakland’s fast-rapping Shady Blaze and consequently didn’t always keep him in the foreground longer than a minute or two. It’s only this time around, with <i>The Patriarch</i>, his second solo tape, that the resolution on Deniro has been high enough for us to really gauge him.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old’s voice falls somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"" target=""_blank"">Bun B</a>’s and that of former G-Unit great Young Buck, but his verses have a lot more in common with the ones Freddie Gibbs has been pumping out. Deniro’s a gangsta rapper, more or less, except he’s as prone to inverting typical gangsta-rap formulae in order to highlight his desperation and struggle as he is to rampant misogyny and violence. The epigram here is a nod to Shyne’s rant “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muuxIHlVPyg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dear America</a>”-- “I’m only what America made me/ Young, black, and fuckin’ crazy”-- and Deniro’s often at his best when extricating his dilemma strand by strand. This can be found in both understated revelations (“I ain’t got shit to my name but this AK”) and more pronounced intimations of his elder-statesmanship, like this one from “Thug Till I Die”: “Makin’ millions sellin’ grams, that shit ain’t realistic/ It’s either death or prison, that other shit television.” Deniro’s had a bumpy personal life-- his younger brother, in fact, is currently facing a murder charge-- and there’s palpable pain and hard-earned sagacity here, at least when he’s not saying something like his “chopper make ‘em dance like a ballet recital.”</p>
<p>Deniro’s native Charlotte doesn’t boast much in the way of a traditional sound, and so, unlike many Southern rappers, he has no moral obligation to add to some specific regional legacy. It’s a freedom that works in his favor. Besides Nova Scotia’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hemsworth</a> and Chicago duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6293-flosstradamus/"" target=""_blank"">Flosstradamas</a>, <i>The Patriarch</i>’s producers are all very minor names, staples only in the tight-knit community of so-called blog-rap. But they’re also guys who have worked with Deniro before, and they’re starting to figure out the best approaches to backing him. From the skyward ambience of “Feel the Rain” to the gyrating “Back/Forth/Back” to “My Life”’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl83mI69nX4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Kick, Push”</a>-like kick-clap, these are all great-to-excellent beats. But just as crucially, not even the busiest productions (“Look at the Sky”, the remix of Hemsworth’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14702-basedworld/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">“Based World”</a>) stand out so much as to obstruct our look at the guy they’re supporting. Which is good, because the guy they’re supporting is worth hearing as clearly as possible.</p>
<p><i>The Patriarch</i> might not present anything <i>totally </i>uncommon during its 50 minutes, but there are a couple personal breakthroughs here for Deniro. “Thug Till I Die” might be his first deliberate earworm, and while it recruits light Auto-Tune in an effort to make the most out of the chorus, it puts Deniro in a nuanced sensitive-thug mode instead of just making him sound soft. On the other hand, “Big Tookie” is the most replayable song with a titular reference to gangland since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MVzP4MaJ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“B.M.F.”</a>, its tumbling, Hemsworth-provided keyboards providing a supremely effective contrast to some of Deniro’s hardest bars yet. Until <i>The Patriarch</i>, I had no major reservations about labeling Deniro a “blog-rapper,” the title he’s so often been handed thus far. These two songs-- and plenty of others here, really-- render that designation questionable. Whatever the next step is for Deniro in 2013, he seems more than ready for it.</p></div>"|17884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17884-the-patriarch/|7.5|Mike Madden

His first release, a self-titled CD-R that was later pressed to LP, didn’t stray far from that band’s sound. The songs, which were recorded to a cassette four-track, were simple and spontaneous-- thick with blistering solos, bluesy churn, and lo-fi gristle. But deep down in the murk, Polizze stashed a handful of great hooks. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14916-public-service-announcement/"" target=""_blank""><i>Public Service Announcement</i></a>,<i> </i>his third LP under the name, but his oldest set of recordings, the guitarist spliced his fuzz-addled leads into three chord pop songs that recalled 90s classic rock apologists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets/"" target=""_blank"">Meat Puppets</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, Polizze has expanded the project into a power trio, recruiting drummer Mike Sneeringer and bassist Kiel Everett, and hit the road opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>, and Dinosaur Jr. <i>Water on Mars, </i>which is out on Drag City, is the first record that this lineup has done together and also the first of the band’s LPs to be assembled in a professional studio. As a result, the murk and sloppiness of the early records has been mostly swept away. </p>
<p>Purling Hiss is one of a community of Philadelphia-area bands that have been combing dino rock tropes through weirder, outsider sensibilities. Most of the band’s peers-- Kurt Vile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">the War on Drugs</a>, and Blues Control-- fold spacey effects and new age tones into chord changes that venerate Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty. Ambience isn’t Purling Hiss’ thing, though. They rock at high volume and in earnest. Album opener, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14925-purling-hiss-mercury-retrograde/"" target=""_blank"">Lolita</a>”, could have snuck onto the b-side of Nirvana’s <i>Bleach</i>, riding a screeching riff that ping-pongs between octaves into a sleazy, chugging verse. Indie rock guitar hero status is too easily bestowed these days, but Polizze deserves some recognition. He’s not a show off, but his playing betrays a few years spent patiently studying guitar heroes both cool (Kawabata Makoto) and uncool (Grand Funk Railroad).  </p>
<p>On <i>Water on Mars</i>, Polizze makes an effort to show off both sides of his songwriting-- the heavy, gnarly stuff, but also the slacker-pop hooks that made <i>Public Service Announcement</i> stand out. As a lyricist, Polizze steers clear of deep reflection and introspection. He’s a more of a generalist, blurring everyman rock thoughts (“Everybody wants to have a good time”) with a little bit of urban dirtbag dream logic (“Found a god in a parking lot, saw a life in a grain of sand”). His softest turns here, “She Calms Me Down” and “The Harrowing Wind”,  are as moody and skewed as any of his bedroom tapes.</p>
<p>On the record’s title track, Purling Hiss’ two personalities blend together. The song, which carries on for more than seven minutes, inverts the usual verse-to-jam trajectory. Polizze’s vocals only arrive after five minutes of fuzz-wah histrionics and rather than building to a dense crescendo, Sneeringer keeps the band in line with a steady marching rhythm. It’s heady and blown out, but somehow easygoing at the same time. The ability to slide between these two poles is what makes Purling Hiss’ unique. They have the riffs, but none of the anxiety.  </p></div>"|17713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17713-purling-hiss-water-on-mars/|7.3|Aaron Leitko

In these eight songs, the destroyer becomes the vaunted creator. Humankind sends the earth into a vortex of despair and decay. End-times gloom represents a lone currency of hope. The music is made to match, too, with salvos of rapid-fire black metal and plumes of foreboding instrumental drift lightning the lantern toward darkness.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Sky Burial</i>, however, is one of the most exhilarating experiences you might hope to have with a record, largely because its creators sound so obviously intoxicated and energized by the possibilities of music itself. As these five multi-instrumentalists and experimenters work through creaking doom and obliterative marches, smoldering introductions and scowling grooves, the sense that they’re loving every moment of this is pervasive. They foreground their enthusiasm and counter the darkness with contagious élan. Appropriate for an album so obsessed by the beginnings that endings can bring, <i>Sky Burial</i>’s misanthropic heart is inspired enough to make one, well, happy.</p>
<p>At nearly 70 minutes, <i>Sky Burial</i> is a massive stylistic crucible where unlikely influences and aspirations bleed and blur into one another. Inter Arma represents a convergence of disparate traditions-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"" target=""_blank"">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"" target=""_blank"">Pentangle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28432-immortal/"" target=""_blank"">Immortal</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6873-enslaved/"" target=""_blank"">Enslaved</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"" target=""_blank"">Sleep</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8441-the-staple-singers/"" target=""_blank"">the Staple Singers</a>. Though all these strains share the same space, Inter Arma never sounds claustrophobic, meaning they give each component its due before showing how it can cooperate with the next approach. Acoustic interludes in the midst of loud rock records, for instance, certainly aren’t novel ideas, but when Inter Arma push away from the amps and drop the howls, the acoustic instrumentals don’t function as mere sideshows. Lined with sighing steel guitar and sustained piano notes, the four-minute “The Long Road Home (Iron Gate)” shows similar development to the 10-minute epics that bookend it. Inter Arma opens its successor, “The Long Road”, with more than seven minutes of rising rock ’n’ roll action, reaching the <i>It Still Moves</i>-sized<i> </i>limits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">My Morning Jacket</a> before catapulting, without hesitation, into a malevolent Scandinavian-influenced blast. At one point, “Westward” flips from a patchwork of noise and grindcore into the sort of open-wheel blues metal you’d expect from millennial Allman descendants.</p>
<p>One could counter, of course, that being stoked on making music isn’t enough to make said music good. The teenager enlisting friends to join a basement rock band is certainly zealous, but that doesn’t mean their tunes are worthy of your time. But Inter Arma isn’t just ardent. Rather, these songs are both well designed and well executed. The ingenious “’sblood” rides the same riff and rhythm for most of its six minutes, while Mike Paparo shouts four repetitive lines about the limits of the earth. He breaks the lines into pairs, though, a device that the band uses to create a tripwire of tension as the audience awaits the conclusion. Opener “The Survival Fires” might be the band’s best dexterity showcase to date. Drummer and instrumental cleanup man T.J. Childers works through demanding patterns; he rolls into stuttering beats and lumbers into distended grooves. The guitars match the action, countering the central theme with grinding dissonance and sudden breakaways. In metal, this sort of spirit without the skills to match can be a missed opportunity, while the skills without the spirit can be worse still. Musically, Inter Arma is good enough to manage all of these sounds; emotionally, they are excited enough to make them work in one righteous exhortation.</p>
<p><i>Sky Burial</i> will likely land as one of the year’s great breakthroughs for a heavy act, standing, at least in my mind, as the same sort of pay-attention proclamation as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10726-the-body/"" target=""_blank"">the Body</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i></a> in 2010 or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16345-sorrow-and-extinction/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sorrow and Extinction </i></a>in 2012. That’s good news for Relapse Records, the venerable metal syndicate that picked up Inter Arma after their fine full-length debut, <i>Sundown</i>. But listening to <i>Sky Burial</i>, you get the sense that an escalation of notoriety won’t change Inter Arma so much. They are, after all, already making music that doesn’t make sense on paper. Segue the Southern rock instrumental into Second Wave black metal screech? Sure. Volley from tightly wound prog into swaggering stoner land? OK.</p>
<p>The root of Inter Arma’s creative success seems to be their delight in stubbornness, their willingness to indulge what they’d like to indulge, with no need to negotiate genre expectations. In this post-everything moment, where multiple sounds often arrive at once, it’s common for young musicians to exist as magpies, collecting stylistic scraps only to display them as their own piece. It is, however, much rarer for those results to seem so wholly synthesized, even as the individual parts don’t buckle under the weight of their accoutrements. <i>Sky Burial </i>does just that, brandishing erudition just enough to arrive at a crossroads of inspiration and innovation.</p></div>"|17607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17607-inter-arma-sky-burial/|8.2|Grayson Currin

So he dispatched himself to Tulum, a small community in Mexico, where, <a href=""http://www.emusic.com/music-news/interview/interview-phosphorescent/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he said</a>, ""I just checked out of my life for a while."" As he took long solitary walks in the woods and swam, the pieces of what would become <i>Muchacho</i> began taking shape in his mind.</p>
<p>As with everything Houck does as Phosphorescent, from 2007's urban-rustic classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10815-pride/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pride</i></a> to his 2009 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"" target=""_blank"">Willie Nelson</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12656-to-willie/"" target=""_blank"">tribute record</a>, this little story has an endearingly second-hand ring to it, as if Houck was obediently following the dictates of some dog-eared country-drifter playbook tucked in his back pocket. But this credulousness is also key to his music, which glows with simple reverence and purity. On <i>Muchacho</i>, Houck gathers together everything he's attempted-- beery, rollicking country-rock, haunted tribal hymnals, regret-soaked bar room heartbreak-- and fashions it into something close to a defining statement.</p>
<p>The first layer of <i>Muchacho</i> to savor is the simple gloriousness of its sound. Houck records his music largely alone, bringing in key players for individual parts but crafting the end results meticulously, in isolation. With the assistance of engineer John Agnello (Kurt Vile, Male Bonding), he has produced a bright, rich, warmly three-dimensional record, one that fuses the headed-for-the-big-city bar-rock signifiers of <i>Here's to Taking it Easy</i> with the night-sky awe of his earliest work. In fact, the album feels like a daylight version of <i>Pride</i>, a point hammered home by the contrast between that album's ""Be Dark Night"" and this one's two book-ending hymnals.</p>
<p>Accordingly, listening to <i>Muchacho</i> often feels like being warmed by afternoon sun as it floods your window. Every sound is lovingly recorded and given a cradle of space: The rounded pop of the drum track on ""Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master)"", paired with tumbles of upright piano and softly pattering bongos; the dryly whispering bowed harmonics that open ""A Charm/A Blade""; the mournful little mariachi trumpet solo winding through the country waltz of ""Down to Go"". The first thing we hear on the record, introducing the opening ""Sun"" hymnal, is a dreamlike, welcoming major-key synth flutter. Those synths reappear on ""Song For Zula"", mingling with crystalline threads of pedal steel guitar, lifting country's signature instrument further heavenward.</p>
<p>At the center of all these majestic noises sits Houck himself. His voice is an unreliable instrument-- reedy, hiccuping, prone to cutting out entirely mid-note-- but he plies it heartbreakingly, never more than on <i>Muchacho</i>. On ""Sun, Arise!"" and ""A New Anhedonia"", he stacks himself into massed, keening layers, like a church full of choirboys. It’s a technique that he’s used before, but he has never sounded as overwhelming as he does here. The persistent catch in his voice, meanwhile gives him an unstable, baby chick fragility, magnifying the pathos of a line like, ""See honey I am not some broken thing/ I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee"" from ""Song For Zula"".</p>
<p>One of <i>Muchacho's</i> main thematic concerns is redemption, and it’s one Houck explores with his customary ringing, allegorical language. Sometimes his writing grows so high-flown that it eludes sense: ""I was the wounded master, and I was the slave… I was the holy lion, and I was the cage/ I was the bleeding actor, and I was the stage,"" he sings on ""Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master)"". More straightforward is this, from ""Muchacho’s Tune"": ""See I was slow to understand/ This river’s bigger than I am/ It’s running faster than I can, though lord I tried."" It’s a simple sentiment, pitched somewhere south of Zen koan and just north of heartland-rock cliche, and it maps out the coordinates of Houck’s world: It’s a place where well-worn sounds are the most beloved, where ideas and poses are settled into like old chairs. On <i>Muchacho</i>, Houck invests this world with new beauty and profundity. </p></div>"|17522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17522-phosphorescent-muchacho/|8.8|Jayson Greene

Because they've received ecstatic acclaim from the most excitable parts of the English music press, they will inevitably be described as “hyped” or (worse) “over-hyped.” And this will impact how <i>180 </i>is perceived in this country, because of the aforementioned long line of scrappy (and hyped!) pub-rocking British blokes that have tried and failed to make an impression in the States. But Palma Violets aren’t actually being shoved down any American throats-- the group’s energetic classic-rock re-workings are the polar opposite of what’s considered fashionable in <i>our </i>national music press. Over here, Palma Violets are in the untenable position of seeming vastly oversold while really being a huge underdog. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>180 </i>is an appropriately modest yet likeable effort for an underdog act-- bigger on heart than brains, the record’s lack of sophistication speaks to the bands members’ age and limited experience (they’ve been together for less than a year and a half) as well as their dearth of cynicism or guile. Palma Violets play proudly sloppy rock‘n’roll that unapologetically draws from the most obvious sources imaginable for a young band from London: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"" target=""_blank"">the Clash</a>, the Velvets, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"" target=""_blank"">the Doors</a>, a little Springsteen, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">Oasis</a>’ <i>Definitely Maybe</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/779-clinic/"" target=""_blank"">Clinic</a>’s <i>Internal Wrangler, </i>the first couple of Libertines singles. Given that the band members all hover on the north and south sides of 20, it’s fair to assume that they’ve only been listening to those bands for a few years. Rock music probably entered their lives with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/"" target=""_blank"">the Arctic Monkeys</a>, and they’re still thrilled by it. <i>180 </i>is an act of evangelism from giddy enthusiasts who don’t know how well-worn these sounds are because they’re new to <i>them. </i></p>
<p class=""p1"">The single that started the mini-wave of Palma-mania in the band’s home country is “Best of Friends”, which is placed at the start of <i>180 </i>like an invitation<i>. </i>Truth be told, it <i>is </i>a great song, with a tightly strummed guitar riff pitched somewhere between punk and Merseybeat and a bear-hug of a chorus hollered with beery gusto by guitarist Sam Fryer and bassist Chilli Jenson. The excitable chemistry between Fryer and Jesson is what ignites Palma Violets’ lauded concerts. On “Best of Friends,” they consciously grasp for the legendary shouty harmonizers of Brit-rock’s past, and while they’re no Strummer and Jones, they squarely nail the pint-hoisting romanticism of fresh-faced pals forming a gang and striking out against the world. Lyrically, “Best of Friends” is like a prequel to Faces’ “Ooh La La,” where the sting of a busted-up romance (even if it’s brushed off when the guys sing, “I wanna be your best friend/ I don’t want you to be my girl”) is still fresh and not yet imbued with the wisdom that will come in retrospect. “Best of Friends” is also the rare instance where women show up in the universe of <i>180</i>; what follows is strictly boy stuff.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The production on <i>180 </i>(capably handled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a> bassist Steve Mackey) wisely emphasizes the fevered intensity of Palma Violets’ live show over the songs, which don’t add up to much beyond their record-collector parts. If Mackey’s only instruction to the band wasn’t “just plug in and plays, lads,” it could’ve been: <i>180</i> is structured like a gig, with the attention-grabbing hit followed by fun but less memorable tracks that build gradually in excitement. The secret weapon throughout is keyboardist Pete Mayhew who, judging by his licks, is influenced exclusively by the Doors’ “Light My Fire”, the Velvet Underground’s ""Sister Ray"", “and Faces’ “Stay with Me”. Mayhew supplies trance-y drone to “Step Up for the Cool Cats” and a menacing psychedelic patina to “Chicken Dippers”, almost single-handedly preventing <i>180 </i>from relying too heavily on the more predictable, monochromatic guitar-rock bravado of songs like “Johnny Bagga’ Donuts”, the album’s loudest and dumbest track (in a good way). </p>
<p class=""p1"">No, Palma Violets don’t deserve the amount of ink they’ve received overseas. The songwriting is a little undercooked: “We Found Love” is rife with lyrical groaners (“gonna find myself a ladyfriend and stick by her until the end”) and ends with a direct lift of the riff from “Sweet Jane"". Palma Violets aren’t there yet; if they aren’t tossed on the young rock dude scrap heap too quickly, they might just get there. But the best moments of <i>180 </i>transcend matters of craft. Palma Violets are reminiscent of what it’s like to hear rock music for the first time, and not have anything clever to say in response. Sometimes a good racket speaks louder than words.</p></div>"|17731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17731-palma-violets-180/|7.0|Steven Hyden

So far, so Fox Searchlight. But forget fey; that basement gave her license to get <i>loud</i>, and the songs on <i>Ripely Pine</i> are true to their original forms, bolstered with rugged, hefty arrangements largely written by Spaltro. Her bodily, biblical epics call to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Buckley</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3141-okkervil-river/"" target=""_blank"">Okkervil River</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1920-helium/"" target=""_blank"">Helium</a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a>.</p>
<p>The lyrics of <i>Ripely Pine</i> are hungry for love and experience and bone-picked honesty. She explains the title as a kind of openhearted longing, though it's gorier than that: “Let’s crawl all over one another like crows on a carcass,” she sings like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"" target=""_blank"">Sharon Van Etten</a> leading a gospel choir on opener “Hair to the Ferris Wheel”. “Like ants on a crumb starving only for the taste of tongues.” It leaps and pivots through soft woolen strums to freewheeling 1990s alt.rock-- that structural skittishness is a constant throughout-- and establishes Spaltro’s palpable experience of love as a messy, fetid thing, perhaps more remarkable for the fact that she wrote these songs when she was 18, 19. “Love is selfish/ Love goes tick-tock-tick/ Love knows Jesus/ Apples and oranges,” she sighs of its many coexisting contradictions.</p>
<p>“You with the nape that holds my gaze/ You with the tongue that speaks my name,” she glowers on “Aubergine”, slyly sizing up her intended like prey on a plain. The brooding interlude comes amid truly joyous New Orleans-style carnival blasts, and the song’s broiling-over stream of consciousness approach makes it feel like an incredible street party. The best songs on <i>Ripely Pine</i> are unpredictable in a way that’s refreshing because of their sloppy energy, not in spite of it. Some of them have been worked on for five years, but they’re executed with unaffected confidence rather than niggled perfection; there are pitchy vocals here and there, and with only three songs under four minutes and almost everything playing out like the closing number of a headline festival set, it’s much too long. While her gentler solo songs are pretty enough, they can also be samey, making the hour length even less necessary. But what <i>Ripely Pine</i> has that much comparable rousing-but-empty country-tinged trad rock doesn’t have is raw, credulous fire.</p>
<p>The best songs here are all nearly seven minutes long, but their erratic structures make compelling stages to watch dueling tirades of emotion swarm around one another. Spaltro wields ferocity and timidity equally well, to the extent that it’s hard to tell which is her more frightening mode. The incensed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14954-lady-lamb-the-beekeeper-bird-balloons/"" target=""_blank"">“Bird Balloons”</a>, an unresolved tale of betrayal, regret, and acceptance, has an excellent, spat pay-off: “My hair grew long so I fucking cut it/ And when you looked away I stuck those trimmings in your locket, ha ha ha ha.” “You Are the Apple” eases into a bluesy lope and twang, and then a swashbuckling burst of timpani and strings, Spaltro screaming, “I still need your teeth around my organs.” What <i>should</i> be the payoff to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30335-alabama-shakes/"" target=""_blank"">Alabama Shakes</a>-loose “Crane Your Neck” is Spaltro howling “I’m as blue as blood before the blood goes red,” in a cadence borrowed from the hilt of “Fake Plastic Trees”; its “twist yo’ hips” shimmy-to-fade epilogue is unnecessary and a bit rote.</p>
<p>The “blue blood” line crops up a few times on <i>Ripely Pine</i>, notably on “Aubergine”, where Spaltro comitragically sings about how someone makes her “into an egg without yolk,” making it clear that she means the lifeless shade of blood, not the regal kind. Conversely, <i>Ripely Pine</i> is one of the most nourishing, deeply alive records of this young year. On closer “Taxidermist, Taxidermist”, she reconciles with herself: “‘How do you do?’ I say/ ‘I’ve heard such lovely things about who you are and where you’ve been/ But be in me again.’” These songs are about Spaltro five years ago; hopefully reassembling the parts doesn’t mean locking up these messy song banquets for a neater record next time around. The taste is too addictive.</p></div>"|17723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17723-lady-lamb-the-beekeeper-ripely-pine/|7.8|Laura Snapes

The most immediately striking thing about <i>Via</i>, the latest album from the former Uzi, Live Skull and Come singer/songwriter, is how little her voice has changed over three decades of performance. For evidence, check out clips from Come’s classic 1992 debut album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49202-matador-to-reissue-comes-eleven-eleven"" target=""_blank"">Eleven: Eleven</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49202-matador-to-reissue-comes-eleven-eleven"" target=""_blank""></a></i> soon to be reissued by Matador. By that point Zedek’s voice had already matured to a well-cured rasp, and 20 years later it still sounds as potent and seemingly durable as ever; the aural equivalent of someone whose hair turns silver in his or her 20s and then essentially looks the same throughout adulthood.</p>
<p>What has changed over the years has been the nature and arrangements of Zedek’s bands. Uzi and Live Skull made spiky No Wave, whereas Come specialized in a distinctive form of emotive scorched-earth blues/punk. Since the dissolution of Come in 2001, Zedek has fronted bands that tend to slip in between various genres, buffering her voice and electric guitar with a variety of acoustic instruments in a manner that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">the Bad Seeds</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a>. While she has never quite found an instrumental foil to fully fill the crucial role former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"" target=""_blank"">Codeine</a> guitarist Chris Brokaw played in Come, her longtime collaboration with viola player David Curry and pianist Mel Lederman has proven a good match for her knotty songcraft. On <i>Via, </i>their playing sounds loose, familiar and jammy, with the musicians able to pivot from lively near-country rock to passages of noisy turbulence in the flash of an eye.</p>
<p>In a recent <i>Boston Globe</i> <a href=""http://bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/02/28/scene-and-heard-thalia-zedek-band-hits-brighter-note-with-new-album/eyKk7ym6KwF8XXzgRCpzaN/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">piece</a>, Zedek expresses bemused chagrin at her reputation as a brooding artiste. “It’s already started with the reviews,” she says. “It’s the same ‘angst, agony, and anguish’ bit. I think, ‘What are you listening to?’” She's not entirely wrong; “agony and anguish” are too harsh a description for the songs on <i>Via</i>. But neither is the album all major keys and sunny beaches. (Even in her earliest work it is hard to find a Zedek song that sounds young and frivolous.) As ever, Zedek specializes in thorny songs that unflinchingly address adult topics and full-grown problems, with the malleable backing of her guitar and band providing either momentary refuge or sympathetic cries of exasperation.</p>
<p>You don't have to dig too far into the likes of “Walk Away,” “Get Away”, or “Go Home” to pick up on a theme of dislocation; <i>Via</i>’s songs frequently seem to dole out advice to characters caught between one home and another, stuck in a pattern of bad situations or repeated mistakes. “Did you ever come to find that what you thought that you had lost was right where you left it last?” she sings on “Walk Away”. As with so much of Zedek’s best work, these songs have the nurturing feel of someone talking others through decisions where there is no clear right or wrong choice, in a manner free of platitudes or pat answers.</p>
<p>This sense of nurturing goes a step further on the forceful “In This World”, a crisply-strummed acoustic pep talk to a struggling friend that could double as a universal call of the nursemaid or long-term caregiver. “Won’t you help me and heal your body? Won’t you give me some kind of sign?” she asks before eventually declaring, almost as an afterthought, “Because there’s nobody that stands completely alone in this world.” It’s that slender reed of hope or recovery that continually shines through even <i>Via</i>’s darkest moments. The album closes with two lengthy tracks, “Lucky One” and “Want You to Know”, which each last more than six minutes and generally let the full group’s restless, roiling music do the heavy lifting. The sequencing seems rather odd, as either one could just easily be the big cathartic grand finale and putting them right next to one another tends to blunt the impact of both. Nevertheless, the camaraderie evident in the band’s tumultuous playing serves as a balm against any of Zedek’s dreaded “angst, agony, and anguish,” as though intended to leave the listener with the impression that things in this life might yet work out, despite any evidence to the contrary.</p></div>"|17737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17737-thalia-zedek-band-via/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

The <a href=""http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mutant Sounds</a> blog, so long a bastion of barely-heard esoterica, recently ran into trouble, ultimately <a href=""http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-end-of-era.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deciding</a> to take down the vast collection of free downloads they had lovingly curated since 2007. Mutant Sounds has <a href=""http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/2013/03/mutant-sounds-reborn.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> it will continue in some format, although the download archive apparently won't be returning in full, pushing its myriad obscurities a little further back into the shadows. That stuff is still out there, of course-- anything released to the internet never goes away for very long-- but the ghost-like presence of shuttered ""sharity"" blogs, all emptied of their wares, already resemble thoroughly picked-over corpses discarded at the roadside.</p>
<p>Mutant Sounds mostly traded in obscure, out-of-print, long-forgotten releases; music that was either impossible to find, inordinately expensive, or both of those things. A re-interpretation of ""issues pertaining to copyright online"" is cited by the blog owners as a reason for removing the files. Perhaps it's wise that they're protecting themselves in this way, even if copyright issues feel like the furthest thing from the minds of artists releasing limited edition cassette-tapes three decades ago. Either way, the biggest loss, other than the free ticket to wallow in some of music's darkest, most mysterious corners, is the fact that a handful of musicians whose work circulated on those blogs ended up getting officially reissued on proper labels. This was a place far removed from rampant piracy. Often, it felt like an invaluable service was being carried out. </p>
<p>The folks at the <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Digitalis</a> label first came across the work of U.K. duo Leven Signs via a ""chance encounter"" with a cassette of their solitary album, <i>Hemp Is Here</i>, originally released in 1985. A search of the Mutant Sounds archive brings up a 2007 <a href=""http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/2007/05/leven-signs-hemp-is-here-lp-1985-uk.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">post</a> for the album, which is likely to have been most people's entry point to the record. In many ways it typifies the spirit of the blog, taking great lurches in style, having scant regard for the world outside, sounding like it was recorded on a piece of old kitchen roll. Sometimes it bears a tiny resemblance to the wider post-punk narrative being spun at that time, especially when clattering, gamelan-influenced percussion collides into the kitchen sink sound of bands like <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Rip+Rig+&amp;+Panic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rip Rig + Panic</a>. But its most overt tie to post-punk is in its desire to tear up music history in order to not sound like anyone else at all. </p>
<p>Leven Signs is the work of Peter Karkut and Maggie Turner; the latter provides vocals that occasionally sound like a less-stern <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>, all buried so deep in the mix that it feels like she's performing somewhere else, in a distant room, with a different band altogether. What Karkut is doing is anyone's guess. There are perceptible organ tones, noises that resemble <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_whistle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slide whistles</a>, percussion that sounds like a recording of one of those wind-up toy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPXOxucXpcw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drumming bears</a>. It's clear that a lot of work and thought went into <i>Hemp Is Here</i>, especially in the tracks where abstract tape loops are laced around one another, recalling the future voyages into playfulness of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Focus+Group"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Focus Group</a>. There's also a strong sense of junk shop experimentalism later shared by groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a>, where everything is thrown up in the air and loosely arranged after it lands. </p>
<p>At times <i>Hemp Is Here</i> shares a sense of discovery with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>'s later works, albeit one executed on a fraction of the budget. Occasionally a male vocal emerges on certain tracks, presumably belonging to Karkut, bearing a deep, throaty abrasion that closely mirrors Walker. Similarly, it's not hard to imagine Karkut mic-ing up a piece of meat and thwacking away at it, just to see where it will take him. That place where Leven Signs ended up is still hard to define, even some 28 years later. But the beauty of this record, and much of the Mutant Sounds family of which it feels a part, is in the feeling of listening to something that fell between the cracks, that perpetually escapes easy definition. Digitalis tracked down Karkut in order to release <i>Hemp is Here</i>, although few details on how this recording came into being are forthcoming. It's a more powerful work that way, carrying around a few hundred imagined histories on its back. </p></div>"|17777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17777-leven-signs-hemp-is-here/|7.2|Nick Neyland

After all, here is a band that, in an attempt to overcome the seven-album itch-- and possibly give themselves something new to talk about with interviewers after 15 years in the game-- turned to acclaimed sound-collagist Daniel Lopatin (a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>) to mix their 2012 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17291-free-reign/"" target=""_blank""><i>Free Reign</i></a>, only to shelve all but two of his submissions. You could sense that second-guessing on the final product: While <i>Free Reign</i> saw the band stretching out more than usual, with its psychedelic drones and funkier grooves, the album was still quintessentially, claustrophobically Clinic, caught between competing desires to expand the band's sound without dramatically altering it.</p>
<p>But <i>Free Reign</i>'s shortcomings aren't anything some corrective surgery can't fix. And so, just months after the album's release, we have <i>Free Reign II</i>, which is not so much a remix album or a sequel companion piece as a complete do-over-- the U.K. indie equivalent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvinAPPfyAQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bobby Ewing suddenly turning up in your morning shower</a>. <i>Free Reign II</i> reinstates Lopatin's original mixes (plus new ones for ""Miss You"" and ""You"", the two songs of his that made the previous cut) and resequences the album in reverse order. But while this may read like some egregious ploy to make fans buy the same record twice-- song titles are merely appended with a ""II""-- they should be thankful Clinic are going through with the plan. In this revised form, <i>Free Reign</i> is elevated from an intriguing if flawed work into the band's most consistently illuminating and sonically adventurous album since 2002's <i>Walking With Thee</i>.</p>
<p>In Lopatin's hands, <i>Free Reign</i>'s subliminal textural details take the starring role, smashing through the original's glass-ceiling containment to reveal a vaster sense of space and far greater dramatic tension. The album's low-key, wandering closer, ""The Sun and Moon"" is reborn as <i>Free Reign II</i>'s deliriously disorienting opener, its Manzarekian organ pumps amplified into glass-shattering tremors and free-jazz sax squeaks heigthening the carnivalistic clamor. On the original <i>Free Reign</i>, the blissed-out reverie ""Misty"" gradually eased you into the record, establishing a slack, laissez faire tone; here, ""Sun and the Moon II"" violently thrusts you in, foreshadowing the more turbulent funhouse experience to come. Even the found-sound recordings of children at play that permeate ""You"" assume a more sinister, predatory tenor on ""You II"", their increasingly mutated voices fusing into the sheets of guitar noise that eventually consume the song. In this revamped context, the ascendant organ drone that rises above the song's fiery outro feels less like a simple <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a> tribute and more like a spacecraft escape from an exploding planet.</p>
<p>Lopatin can't rehabilitate every track-- ""Cosmic Radiation"" is still a scatterbrained psych-jazz scribble of a song. But his gnarlier mix and flipped-script sequencing do wonders for what was <i>Free Reign</i>'s most rudimentary turn, ""See Saw"". Where the original overemphasized its temper-tantrum bashed beat and remedial, morse-code melodica riff to the point of annoyance-- its position as second-track nearly derailing <i>Free Reign</i>'s momentum from the get-go-- the song is utterly transformed into <i>Free Reign II</i>'s explosive side-two climax. It's the moment where all the strategic soundscaping Lopatin has exercised over the course of the record comes to a head: The drums stomp with crater-inducing force, the guitars turn several degrees thicker and nastier, Blackburn's impetuous vocal is reverbed into a more antagonistic scowl, and whole thing swirls and snarls like a fairground attraction spun out of control. And in its wake, ""Misty II"" finds its true calling as the album's comedown closer, sending us adrift on a billowy bed of analog-synth starbursts. (It's followed by a tacked-on bonus track, ""Done and Dusted II"" that hearkens back to the motorik bounce of early singles like ""The Second Line"", but doesn't quite fit with the album's droning, cerebral vibe; nor does it give Lopatin much opportunity to go crazy on the console.)</p>
<p>One can only imagine that Clinic's reticience to initially release this vastly superior version of <i>Free Reign</i> can be chalked up to misgivings about showcasing Lopatin's textural trickery at the expense of the group's performances. But <i>Free Reign II</i> is precisely the sort of risky, rejuvenating album Clinic needed at this point in their career, one that audaciously upends the perception that this band just releases the same album over and over. Sadly, it's been brought to market as a secondary, supplemental release whose belated appearance may have bypassed the window of opportunity to recapture some of the considerable buzz the band enjoyed back at the turn of the millennium and re-stoke the interest of fans who may have tuned out since. At the very least, it puts lie to that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Hogan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old shampoo-ad slogan</a>: sometimes, you do a get a second chance to make a seventh impression.  </p></div>"|17762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17762-clinic-free-reign-ii/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14233-in-ruinsin-ruins-baths-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""In Ruins""</a>, a spindly, exotic earworm of a track was an undeniable standout that should've played to a bigger audience. Despite encouraging <a href=""http://www.emusic.com/album/fol-chen/in-ruins-ep/11916694/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix EP</a> (and soundtracking one of the more <a href=""http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2010-10-13/watch-mark-paul-gosselar-sex-scene-in-weeds-is-nsfw-and-awesome/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">satisfyingly strange onscreen love scenes</a> in recent memory), ""In Ruins"" still cast a long, curious shadow over the rest of the wandering <i>New December</i>. But with <i>The False Alarms</i>, Fol Chen's third LP, it seems as if the song's modest legacy can be extended a little further. <i>The False Alarms</i> follows ""In Ruins""'s lead and homes in on the band's gift for obtuse but viscerally catchy songs, just like the one that could've launched a thousand car commercials.</p>
<p>""The False Alarms"" opens the record with a distinct air of confidence, with Sinosa Loa's vocals fluttering at the forefront and producers Samuel Bing and Julian Wass dicing up equilibrium-disrupting pulses, clattering drums, and capering bell tones. There's a new lightness in these songs, no matter how familiar they might seem. <i>The False Alarms</i> boasts everything from clipped acoustic guitars to digitized harpsichord sounds to dance-kit mined beats. But this time around, everything is implemented so cleanly and economically, what was previously a bit slow and staid now feels reinvigorated. The songs are given the necessary room to breathe, as everything is placed deliberately and little is wasted along the way. <br/><br/><i>The False Alarms</i> is just flat-out catchier. There's an impressive amount of single-worthy material, to the point where the creepy-comely <a href=""http://stereogum.com/1233182/fol-chen-200-words-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""200 Words""</a>, the one they actually went with, would probably be the fourth or fifth choice for most. The early back-to-back combo of ""I.O.U."" and ""A Tourist Town"" is a particularly exciting one-two. ""I.O.U."" initially sounds too precious with its shy vocals and dewy twinkles, but it eventually becomes addictively slinky, thanks to its simplicity. Better is ""A Tourist Town""-- a legitimate banger and an easy companion piece to ""In Ruins""-- complete with Middle Eastern inflections and an ""I got drunk again"" chorus that begs to be featured in a loft party sequence on the next season of <i>Girls</i>. Other notable tracks don't garner quite as much attention, but all come equipped with welcome reference points. Both ""200 Words"" and the robo-spooked ""Boys in the Woods"" both owe a debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2408-ladytron/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Ladytron</a>, while ""Doubles"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a> trying to translate <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgjkth6BRRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hollaback Girl""</a>.</p>
<p>Still, old habits die hard. The other half of <i>The False Alarms</i>, while not a complete wash, finds the band sounding lost. Detours into coldwave and seance-y Scandi-pop still feel like an attempt to steer things in a new direction, but the songs fall prey to the same kind of directionless, inertia-deprived trappings that helped sink Fol Chen's previous records. With so much engaging material sprouting up elsewhere, it feels less like an act of self-sabotage. So <i>The False Alarms</i> just simply isn't the record it could've been, but it's hard to complain too much when you get to walk away with a handful of fine songs. </p></div>"|17756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17756-fol-chen-the-false-alarms/|6.9|Zach Kelly

L.A.-via-Boston DIY grunge-popper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29116-colleen-green/"" target=""_blank"">Colleen Green </a>stands resolutely in the second group. Her scrappy brand of minimalism follows in the tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"" target=""_blank"">Beat Happening</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">the Ramones</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17781-blink-182/"" target=""_blank"">Blink-182</a> (she’s cited the band’s 1993—1999 run as a crucial influence; in other words, nothing after the fart-and-boner-joke auteurs’ short-lived <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“mature phase”</a>) and is based in a faith that most things worth saying can be expressed with just a deadpan drum machine, an uncomplicated couplet, and three torpedoed power chords. Green’s persona is a logical extension of her music, too. When an interviewer <a href=""http://www.identitytheory.com/interview-singer-colleen-green/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked</a> her last year to elaborate on the lyrics to her song “Green One” (what did green <i>signify</i>, he wanted to know—nature? her family name? weed?) her response to this question was as laconic, goofy, and no-frills as one of her best songs: “I dunno, it’s like, green is just what I AM, you know?” To ask Colleen Green <i>what does it all mean, man?</i> is sort of like asking Joey Ramone to elaborate on the pedagogical philosophy of the teaching methods at Rock &amp; Roll High School.</p>
<p>The songs on Green’s Hardly Art debut <i>Sock it to Me</i> are brazenly simple, but they have a shrugging, take-me-as-I-am charm that makes them feel like celebrations of their own limitations. All of her songs begin with a nearly identical beat made by a drum machine that sounds like a model discontinued about 20 years ago. When asked why she uses a drum machine, she’s said it’s because she doesn’t know how to play the drums; I doubt she will ever learn. Her music is anti-striving: why push past your limits, it seems to ask, when you can just get stoned (her Twitter handle, it must be said, is “<a href=""https://twitter.com/colleengreen420"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@colleengreen420</a>”) and then write some pretty solid songs with the chords you already know?</p>
<p><i>Sock it to Me</i> mines the melodic sensibility and lyrical themes of 60s girl groups-- good boyfriends (“When He Tells Me”), bad boyfriends (“Darkest Eyes”) and mean girls at school (“Every Boy Wants a Normal Girl”). But while the first wave of girl group music was a profession of collectivity and shared wisdom, Green’s music is proudly solo, the product of one singular, isolated person. Not that it bothers her. About a minute-and-a-half into the album, on the infectious, wound “Only One”, she engages in a multi-tracked call-and-response chant with herself. “Oh yeah/ Uh-huh/ Oh god/ I really love my boyfriend,” she sings, and then plays her own backing singer: “She really loves her boyfriend.” In Green’s solitary bedroom-pop universe, loneliness isn’t a source of sadness so much as aesthetic choice and, occasionally, a well-executed punch line.</p>
<p><i>Sock it to Me</i> comes on the heels of a couple solid cassette releases-- <i>Green One</i>, <i>Cujo</i>, and the awesomely titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1204-descendents/"" target=""_blank"">Descendents</a>-wink <i>Milo Goes To Compton</i>-- and tightens her established formula without cleaning it up too much. When Green’s on (which, on this 10-song album, is a little more than half the time), her melodic sensibility is almost Merritt-esque; in fact, the delightful “Taxi Driver” sounds like a long-lost Claudia Gonson-sung track off the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"" target=""_blank"">Magnetic Fields</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11049-distortion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Distortion</i></a> and has a silly, curmudgeonly conceit to match (“I wanna be a taxi driver/ I wouldn’t have to talk to anybody”). The sun-scorched “Time in the World” also ranks among her best, its distorted synthesizer riff adding the perfect amount of blown-out, overexposed atmosphere to its beach-pop hook. Green’s strongest songs are almost always her upbeat ones, though. She hasn’t quite figured out a way to translate her music’s charms into the slower material, and so after getting off to a strong start, <i>Sock it to Me</i> moves from a sugar rush to a diabetic coma about halfway through, no thanks to the somnolent title track. But the B-side picks up beginning with “Darkest Eyes”, which combines grumbling power chords with some of the record’s most poignant lyrics: “I tell him every day he’s the only one I wanna see/ And his eyes look right through me.”</p>
<p>Green’s songs are like single-panel stickfigure comics. Some people will dismiss them as amateurishly two-dimensional, while plenty of others will find their personable, unpretentious ethos crucial to their appeal. But at its most sly, Green’s music seems to be mocking the very idea that an artist needs to grasp for depth or profundity as she evolves. The darkest song on the predominantly sunny <i>Sock it to Me</i> addresses some kind of unnamed anxiety-- it’s called “Heavy Shit” and its most revealing lyric goes, “Heavy shit on my mind.” Still, like most of <i>Sock it to Me</i>, maybe it’s sharper and more cathartic than it seems. After all, turning bad feelings into flat, darkly funny cartoons is one surefire way to defang them.</p></div>"|17738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17738-colleen-green-sock-it-to-me/|7.2|Lindsay Zoladz

For the last decade or so, the dove-throated Mitchell has been whittling out a catalog of introspective acoustic albums; 2010’s <i>Hadestown</i> was a “folk opera” based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, set in a post-apocalyptic mining town and with a side-eye cast upon the underbelly of the Great Recession. Hamer, meanwhile, has split his career between man-for-hire gigs (he lent guitars and delicate vocals to Mitchell’s two most recent LPs) and more personal projects including, last year, a collection of traditional songs from the U.S. and the British Isles recorded with Irish musician Eamon O’Leary.</p>
<p>This brightly ruminative collaboration was sprouted a few years ago when Mitchell and Hamer discovered their shared fascination with the British folk cannon established by Harvard professor Francis James Child in the late 1800s, and the revivalists of the 1960s and 70s who brought the peaty old ballads back into pop consciousness. Mitchell and Hamer are hardly alone in their fondness for this stuff, of course; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">Fleet Foxes</a>’ Robin Pecknold, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"" target=""_blank"">the Decemberists</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5215-elvis-perkins-in-dearland/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Perkins</a>, and Drag City troubadour <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3583-alasdair-roberts/"" target=""_blank"">Alasdair Roberts</a>, among others, have made their debts evident in recent years. But while many modern appreciations of traditional folk come in the form of live covers, B-sides or general thematic interpolations, on <i>Child Ballads</i> Mitchell and Hamer take a more immersive approach, nestling deep into these tales of fair maidens and knights and shape-shifters and milk-white steeds instead of forcing them into some kind of conspicuously modern milieu. </p>
<p>The album’s runtime is slight, just seven songs, and its production is sparse but cozy: fingers audibly tumbling against guitar strings, vocals close and warm. The general scene suggested is of the pair holed up alone together in some winter-whipped cabin with only a roaring fire, the bulk of the British folk-music canon and a real nice recording setup for company. (Reality: It was recorded in a regular old Nashville studio.) Hamer’s lake-clear voice, at first, seems almost too conventional to pair well with Mitchell’s yowl, but in time they begin to balance out; if either had tackled the project alone, neither would have wound up with something so satisfying, so unexpectedly intimate, as this.</p>
<p>Mitchell and Hamer cop to some lyrical and structural contemporization, but most changes are in the phrasing, ironing out the crumpled corners of lines like “shape it bairn and bairnly like/ And in twa glassen een ye pit.” They’re right not to feel too precious about the source material; long before and long after Child swooped in with his wire-framed glasses and philological theories, these songs were all always in state of natural flux, fudged and flubbed and rearranged along the way according to audience and performer. Mitchell and Hamer especially take liberty with “Tam Lin”, the Scottish legend of rose-stealing maidens and lusty shape-shifters; a protean thing itself, appearing in Child’s collection in 14 different forms, here the trimmed down arrangement throws aside the traditional involvement of a vengeful fairy-queen aside to focus on the core story of headstrong adolescent lust and its eternal repercussions.</p>
<p>The real challenge seems to have been the reclamation of the songs from themselves, prying something immediate and compelling from characters and names and dramas besot by neutralizing familiarity-- the curse of the archetype. <i>Child Ballads</i> mostly accomplishes this by the sheer force of Mitchell and Hamer’s radical empathy. From the panicked grief of the wife of the falsely accused “Geordie,” to “Clyde Waters” and the unsinkable mania of young love, to the sacrifices of the crew of “Sir Patrick Spens”, every performance is imbued with an uncanny compassion, as if the words and the wounds weren’t all a half a millennia old and half fantastical to begin with. Through Mitchell and Hamer, these characters, made flat by design and even more by time, spring into full dimension, ache and grieve and flirt, live and die and get born again.</p></div>"|17650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17650-anais-mitchell-and-jefferson-hamer-child-ballads/|7.0|Rachael Maddux

In <a href=""http://thesludgelord.blogspot.com/2013/02/interview-with-sannhet.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a February interview</a> with the cannily named blog The Sludgelord, the Brooklyn trio’s guitarist, John Refano, confessed that he and his bandmates were all working stiffs, using music as an aggressive outlet but not as an alternate income inlet. “I don’t have any real aspirations to make a living off Sannhet,” he said, “simply to spread our vision to as many like-minded people as possible.” Chances are, most musicians issuing debut albums this year-- as Sannhet has done with the excellent nine-song browbeater, <i>Known Flood-- </i>won’t turn their music into money, either, whether or not that’s a stated goal. Making music a sustainable profession has long been a high-stakes, low-chances gamble, dependent on variables generally beyond prediction, much less control. Saying that your new <i>band</i> isn’t intended to be your new <i>job</i>, then, borders on redundancy.</p>
<p>But Refano’s admission is an important one, because that attitude seems directly related to <i>Known Flood</i>’s twin senses of purpose and economy. This is an urgent instrumental album that welds the power of black metal, sludge metal, and grindcore to the structures and orders of post-rock and post-punk. That might sound tedious, but Sannhet bypasses the extravagance and indulgence that such a blend has largely come to imply. Instead, they operate with a workmanlike efficiency that gets these pieces to and around the point with thrilling dependability. Refano and company don’t show off or linger. Though Sannhet comprises strong instrumentalists, none of them deserve to be feted individually here. Rather, the guitar, drums, bass and a litany of samples cooperate constantly. They play this stuff hard and fast, like dudes with jobs to do and families to tend to when practice is over. <i>Known Flood</i> lasts for about 47 minutes, but unless you’re watching the clock, it’ll take some repeats for you to notice. It seems to flash by in half that time.</p>
<p>To that end, variability serves Sannhet well. Their gambit, “Absecon Isle”, rips open with black metal menace and streaks by in white-hot arcs. Its chaser, “Safe Passage”, lessens the rumble into a chug that’s heavy like Bastro or even Shellac, phosphorescence emerging from electric wallop. “Moral” uses its front half to ratchet tension with a riff that wraps back into itself; for the piece’s back half, though, Sannhet obliterates that tension, each member slashing at the them as though they’re trying to tenderize it. Each of these songs clock in at less than four minutes, a testament to Sannhet’s Cincinnatian interest in making one statement and summarily moving to the next one. That quality recalls last year’s excellent debut EP from New Hampshire’s Vattnet Viskar, a band that delivers similarly melodramatic metal with punk-like concision.</p>
<p>Sannhet doesn’t merely feign concision simply by writing short pieces. No, nearly half of these tracks break the five-minute mark. But each of the longer numbers roll several themes and transitions into a relatively compact framework, again avoiding boredom by a bustle of activity. “Slow Ruin,” one of two that makes it past seven minutes, volleys from field recordings to Touch and Go throb, from post-millennial blackened grandeur to an expansive noise fadeaway.

For starters, Korine, the mind behind cult classics like <i>Gummo</i> (his directorial debut)<i> </i>and <i>Kids</i> (he wrote the screenplay for Larry Clarke's film), cast Hollywood wildcard James Franco as the uncannily <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"" target=""_blank"">RiFF RAFF</a>-like rapper/dealer Alien while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> makes his screen debut as his drug kingpin rival. Meanwhile, Korine tapped Disney Channel star Selena Gomez as the conflicted Spring Breaker, Faith, and former <i>High School Musical</i> star Vanessa Hudgens as the reckless, dangerous Candy. An early teaser features the leads belting out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"" target=""_blank"">Britney Spears</a>' ""…Baby One More Time"" and that's not the only (nor the most memorable) Spears homage in the movie. And then, to top it all off, Korine hands the soundtrack to EDM figurehead <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a>, a former Warped Tour band member turned posterboy for dubstep's more malignant cliches.</p>
<p>It's clear from the opening credits of <i>Spring Breakers</i>-- the most cartoonishly turn't-up Spring Break scene you could possibly imagine, accompanied by the drop-heavy debauchery of Skrillex's calling card ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites""-- that Sonny Moore was the man for the job. His music, old and new, serves as the spine of <i>Spring Breakers, </i>a compilation that also features carefully selected rap tracks and his remix of Birdy Nam Nam's ""Goin In'"" along with contributions from electronic musician and soundtrack veteran Cliff Martinez. The latter, who also steered 2011's well-received and similarly tense <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drive</i> OST</a>, is a critical presence. Both musicians contribute their own ambient-leaning, instrumental originals to the soundtrack-- Martinez handles the curious, searching electronic interludes ""Pretend It's a Video Game"", ""Your Friends Ain't Gonna Leave With You"", and ""Never Gonna Get This Pussy"", while Skrillex handles the relatively more aggressive textures of ""Ride Home"" and ""Park Smoke""-- but the fiber of <i>Spring Breakers</i> is the sonic influence that they have on one other.</p>
<p>Skrillex, in particular, benefits from Martinez' presence. Though Moore has recently attempted more laid-back approaches to composition, songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTp-TaOf_0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Reason""</a> didn't sound as idiosyncratically <i>him</i>, and<i> </i>don't prove as captivating or recognizable as his contributions here. The new music, stitched between previously released tracks (like Skrillex's ""With You, Friends (Long Drive)"" and Gucci Mane's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15739-ferrari-boyz/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ferrari Boyz</i></a> cut ""Young Niggaz""), achieves an important headspace for both the dramatic arc of the film as well as the soundtrack as a piece of music. Between the blurry revelry and the careening rush of consequence borne of violent impulse, <i>Spring Breakers </i>is all about the state between that original drug-fueled adrenaline burst and the depressing comedown crush. By cleverly interspersing the soundtrack with their original arrangements, Skrillex and Martinez successfully find that headspace throughout.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <i>Spring Breakers</i> teases out the connections between songs that would be difficult to hear otherwise, offering new entry points. Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka</a>'s ""Fuck This Industry""; on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank""><i>Flockaveli</i></a>, the track comes across as repentant and desperate, a song that finds a self-doubting Flocka siphoning out his signature bellow in favor of a restrained, contemplative whisper. Here, it serves as a momentary sense-collecting pause before the chaos. By leading into Martinez pieces, Skrillex's ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"" gains a pensive new tone, a fresh context that's only underlined by the orchestral back end redux of that track, as well as the Martinez/Skrillex sequel ""Son of Scary Monsters"". On <i>Ferrari Boyz</i>, ""Young Niggaz"" is known as one of the only tracks where Gucci and Waka didn't sound totally asleep, but here, it's a flag-bearer for shaking away the dark thoughts and getting back to the party; after all, it's spring break.</p>
<p>There's a turning point of the film, where some characters decide they're overwhelmed and scared by this neon fantasy world and others find it all the more captivating. The question arises: Do we leave the party, or stay? Given its relatively seamless mesh of spiky, aggro party music and the more contemplative electronic moments created by Martinez and Moore, <i>Spring Breakers </i>is the rare soundtrack that covers both extremes and makes it work as a whole.</p></div>"|17801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17801-various-artists-spring-breakers-ost/|7.6|Corban Goble

Don’t get the wrong idea, though. The drummer’s solo-musings are only “pop” in comparison to his main gig, whose expansive, abstract thrashing sounds sort of like a flaming 8-bit meteor plunging into the Burning Man festival.</p>
<p>Those same drum-and-bass-meets-Jackson Pollock rhythms provide the foundations for Black Pus, but here, Chippendale sometimes reigns in the pounding to make way for singsongy melodies. Over the number of small-run CD-R and CD releases that he’s done under the name since 2005, there’s been a marked progression from free-form havok to music that is, in its own claustrophobic and LSD-singed way, kind of tuneful. And this latest release, even more so.</p>
<p><i>All My Relations</i> is the first Black Pus record to have been recorded in a professional studio, rather than at home on Chippendale’s cassette four-track. As a result, it’s noticeably less blown-out than those previous efforts. Producers Keith Souza and Seth Manchester-- who have engineered records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27751-the-skull-defekts/"" target=""_blank"">Skull Defekts</a>-- help to inch the fidelity forward, strengthening the low end and bringing definition to the stew of psychedelic gook that drifts around the drums.</p>
<p>Not that <i>All My Relations </i>is any kind of step toward the mainstream. The added clarity actually makes the music sounds even more aggressively gonzo. On album opener “Marauder”, Chippendale wails and hollers over splatters of rhythm, accompanied only by a kick drum-triggered oscillator. That sound-- which mutates over the course of the album from dentist drill grind to rubber band flop-- acts as a stand in for his Lightning Bolt co-conspirator, bassist Brian Gibson, providing a consistent pulse for the drummer to rail against.</p>
<p>On subsequent songs, Chippendale chills out a little. On “1000 Years”, the drummer temporarily shelves his flashier moves, playing a fairly straightforward beat. The vocals are pulled high enough in the mix that they are often intelligible, even though they’re smeared with delay. It’s only in the track’s final minute, when the high-pitched and gnarled samples fade in, that things get appropriately weird.</p>
<p>Sensory overload is Chippendale’s forte, and as a member of Lightning Bolt, he’s helped make some of the most authentically psychedelic music in recent memory. <i>All My Relations </i>makes a few nods to conventional songwriting, but, really, it’s just as dense and repetitive as anything the drummer has ever put out. Using the multi-track setup, he colors in the nooks and crannies between snare cracks with the kind of stoner-shrapnel that would make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a> jealous.</p>
<p>The record's most experimental move, by Chippendale's standards, might be the printing of a lyrics sheet on the inside jacket. Some of them are surprisingly laid back. ""I'm just trying to keep my head straight, keep my mouth above the waves, trying to create something great,"" goes the closing line of ""1000 Years"". ""But I just take it day by day.""</p></div>"|17634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17634-black-pus-all-my-relations/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

The former was a softly warped, pastoral record with Spanish lyrics and prominent Latin guitar; the latter is a more urbane electronic pop record with lyrics in English and Spanish. But in every style Roberto Carlos Lange develops, a sultry, dreamy temperament remains apparent, from the shimmying cadences and simmered arrangements to his just-woken-up voice. <i>Invisible Life</i> is the clearest and most dynamic Helado Negro record to date.</p>
<p>His transition from acoustic to electronic took place on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15489-canta-lechuza/""><i>Canta Lechuza</i></a>, which was lively but sometimes drifted through embryonic learning passages. Helado Negro generally deals in smart sounds rather than memorable songs (outside of maybe <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-w8w3A5EFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""El Oeste""</a>) but that changes with <i>Invisible Life</i>. Lange has committed to his MPC game and tightened it up, knotting his signature atmospheres into immersive, highly musical beats scrawled with unstable sub-rhythms. The glass-brick chords and deeply pumping bass of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14626-dance-ghost/"">""Dance Ghost""</a> are solidly constructed but hairline-cracked by jittery, stereo-panned clicks, and Lange's shivery falsetto halfway through lifts the whole arrangement up a level, breaking it free from its foundations. There are many patient, considered payoffs, as when, late in ""Arboles"", a staccato synth begins skipping atop the leisurely Latin rhythm.</p>
<p>A nostalgic feel lightly creeps in to <i>Invisible Life</i>, from the cartoonish snake rattles and bird whistles shot through the bass arpeggios of ""Lentamente"" to the gear-shifting 8-bit theme of ""Catastrophe"". Other songs are rooted in Caribbean music or techno. But Lange's most compelling moments come when he circumvents cultural references, exhuming mysterious but vibrant sound-worlds from the ocean floor of his imagination. He's never before ventured anything as formally distinctive and effectively delightful as ""U Heard"", which feels densely compacted even as its varied timbres peel off in every direction-- rubbery plucks bouncing around a low octave, bubble-like blips rising and sinking, and percussion threshing straight ahead.</p>
<p>A couple tracks don't measure up to this standard of invention. The rather thin ""Relatives"", for instance, plops Helado's pal Jon Philpot (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5531-bear-in-heaven/"">Bear in Heaven</a>) atop a rocksteady template of knobby bass and skating backbeats and then calls it a day. There are other guests lurking around, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a> supposedly playing guitar on ""Arboles"", which isn't prominent. Helado Negro actually seems to have begun as a more collaborative project. Lange has previously worked with Julianna Barwick and Guillermo Scott Herren. But there's always been something solitary about it, and the most subtly bewitching tracks on <i>Invisible Life</i> feel like the internal weather of a mind billowing and clearing. His once noticeable traces of tentativeness around electronic tools have disappeared. At the time, <i>Canta Lechuza</i> seemed like Lange dabbling in electronic music, but in the retroactive light of <i>Invisible Life</i>, it sounds more like him finding his voice.</p></div>"|17690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17690-helado-negro-invisible-life/|7.4|Brian Howe

The band was originally conceived and executed as the solo project of one M. Lehto, who gradually expanded the lineup to include a handful of musicians from other Finnish bands. The first few releases focused on acoustic, largely instrumental neo-folk, woven around themes of nature worship and bereft of the harsh black metal elements that surfaced later on. As the years passed and seasons changed, so did the songs Lehto wrote. He eventually altered his approach with 2007’s <a href=""http://dmp666.bandcamp.com/album/the-streams-of-the-end"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Streams of the End</i></a> EP, which abandoned the acoustic sound for a more metal-oriented approach. The music became more nuanced and refined, as gentle intros and interludes dovetailed nicely with the more inexorable dark metal passages (to employ the “dark metal” catchall in lieu of banging on about “melodic folk-influenced black/death/doom metal” forever). The album embraced his earliest influences, namechecking Katatonia and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5048-opeth/"" target=""_blank"">Opeth</a> while borrowing bits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"" target=""_blank"">Agalloch</a>, Empyrium, and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"" target=""_blank"">Ulver</a>. </p>
<p>It’s unwise to slap a band as mercurial as October Falls with overarching generalizations, so, as far as this particular album goes, there is a solid base of Finnish melodic death/doom a la Swallow the Sun underpinning the more recognizable black metal rasps and wistful folk-- unsurprising, given the addition of Ensiferum bassist Sami Hinkka (formerly of Finnish death/doom greats Rapture) and drummer Marko Tarvonen of Moonsorrow/Barren Earth. Though October Falls has always been Lehto’s sole domain, it sounds as though his companions had a bit more of a say in the writing on this record. There is still plenty of black metal to be found here, but Lehto’s songwriting has matured and moved into solidly melodic territory. “Bloodlines” is a perfect example; the swinging main riff could have popped up on any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">Rapture</a> album, and “Boiling Heart of the North” is a sad, dreamy waltz. The overall effect is of stateliness and melancholia, especially when Lehto chooses to indulge in atmospheric touches and acoustic instrumentation like the subdued piano lines and sounds of wind and rainfall scattered throughout.</p>
<p>Not all of Lehto’s forays into melody work well, though he manages to avoid falling totally flat. The title track hauls out some seriously 1990s goth metal vocals, and while his voice is pleasant enough, falling into a sonorous midrange , the whole exercise feels strained and overdone. The ragged howls that follow are much more effective, and are far more suited to the light-fingered dirge and apocalyptic lament of the song and the album itself. October Falls’ strength lies in the juxtaposition of those ferocious vocals with its pastoral, wintery requiems, and when that balance is overturned, the results lack charm.</p>
<p>The positives of <i>The Plague of a Coming Age</i> outweigh this relatively minor quibble, though, and make for a satisfying listen. October Falls should be much more popular than they are; they should be sharing stages across the States with Paganfest bands, or at the very least, headlining small festivals in Germany and thrilling European crowds. Their music is finely tuned, beautifully composed, and an excellent example of how well this style of melodic, dark metal can be done. This is an album to return to on cold and lonesome evenings.</p></div>"|17605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17605-october-falls-the-plague-of-a-coming-age/|6.2|Kim Kelly

That sort of realization would turn the one-time glam rocker into a studio sage over the course of the 1970s, but just as crucial was his understanding that one producer had already taken the lessons of Jamaica to heart in Germany, utilizing the mixing board to re-structure the music he was producing. The man born <a href=""http://connyplank.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Konrad Plank</a>, and the music he captured to tape in the 70s and 80s, wholly altered both the trajectories of German <i>kosmische</i> music and the Neue Deutsche Welle; British punk, new wave and New Romanticism; electro and industrial music; and-- years after his passing from cancer-- alternative rock. There may be no more daunting task than to encapsulate the man in a box set tribute.</p>
<p><i>Who’s That Man</i> makes that attempt across four CDs, courtesy of the <a href=""http://groenland.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grönland</a> label, who were also responsible for ending decades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"" target=""_blank"">Neu!</a> bootlegs by properly reissuing the German band’s massively influential three studio albums. The reason Neu! was so influential on the likes of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3749-sex-pistols/"" target=""_blank"">Sex Pistols</a> is due in no small part to Plank, who captured the magma-like intensity of the band on tape. Described by Sheppard as “ursine and lank-haired, dressed like a Viking and [a] ‘mad scientist,’” by the time Plank began to make his name as a producer, he had already studied under <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"" target=""_blank"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and recorded Marlene Dietrich. To trace his production credits from 1969 onward is to follow the lineage of krautrock itself. Plank was behind the earliest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"" target=""_blank"">Ash Ra Tempel</a>, and Guru Guru albums along with innumerable others. (Can, Amon Düül, and Faust were among the few genre proponents not bearing his fingerprints.)</p>
<p>Eno himself encountered Plank when he ventured to the German countryside to collaborate with Moebius and Roedelius of Cluster, and his is the first voice you hear on the box set, on the woozy pop Eno &amp; Cluster collaboration “Broken Head”. Plank’s studio was in a converted farmhouse in Neunkirchen, 30km east of Cologne. “His mixing desk had been modified so that with one finger he could simultaneously deploy echo and panning effects,” Sheppard wrote. “For Plank, mixing was a matter of quixotic performance as it was technical application.” While his cues might have been taken from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"" target=""_blank"">Lee “Scratch” Perry</a> and King Tubby, Plank’s productions eschewed easy earmarks. And while his influence on the likes of Martin Hannett is evident, the box shows that there was no singular “Plank sound.”</p>
<p>For one disc at least, <i>Man</i> captures some of Plank’s essence. Spiky no-wave electro noise from Japan rendered with half of Can that anticipates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silent Shout</i></a>? Check Phew’s “Signal.” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>-style punk? That would be D.A.F.’s rumbling “Alles Ist Gut”. A dark, cavernous b-side on a debut single from an act that would become one of the 80s most revered pop acts? See <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23572-the-eurythmics/"" target=""_blank"">Eurythmics</a>’ “La Sinistre”. Beatific oceanic ambience? Cue up closer “Leb Wohl!” In a three-song span, the set shows how Plank moved from the producer’s chair onto a more active, collaborative presence in the studio: from the jittery and jangly noise courtesy of Plank’s collaboration with Moebius to a proto-industrial spoken word piece with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3541-the-red-krayola/"" target=""_blank"">Red Krayola</a>’s Mayo Thompson, and onto an alien yet ebullient proto-techno track from Moebius-Plank-Neumeier (of Guru Guru). Yes, the producer could be more than just a finger pressing record, a participant in the very sound he was rendering to tape.</p>
<p>But by the second disc, the man, his sense of capturing space, and his great oeuvre fall woefully out of focus. His groundbreaking work harnessing the unfettered electronics of early Kluster and Kraftwerk is wholly missing (with the latter’s disavowal of their first four albums leading up to <i>Autobahn</i> acutely felt). Same goes with his New Romanticism work alongside Ultravox and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24311-john-foxx/"" target=""_blank"">John Foxx</a>. His stranger 80s work, producing the likes of A Flock of Seagulls, Les Rita Mitsouko, and Whodini, is also noticeably absent. Instead, one has to suffer through a stodgy and useless cover of “Eleanor Rigby” and the man’s own drunken bellowing of “Silent Night” at the disc’s end. And why Bluepoint Underground’s namechecking of the man in the late 90s warrants inclusion here is beyond me. The last disc comprises a live set, featuring Plank fully transitioned to performer down in Mexico in 1986, unleashing squalls of industrial noise alongside Dieter Moebius and Arno Steffen, less than a year before he succumbed to cancer in 1987.</p>
<p>Worse still is the entire disc of underwhelming remixes. Automat’s “Broken Head” remix is serviceable, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2366-justus-kohncke/"" target=""_blank"">Justus Köhncke</a>’s flatulent remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8798-michael-rother/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Rother</a>’s “Feuerland” only detracts from the original’s eloquence. Günther Lause reducing Phew to the sound of jingling jewelry while music plays two rooms over need not take up 10 minutes. Same goes for a sleep-inducing remix from Crato that’s also past the double-digit mark. Eye from <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a> does a cartoonish, whiplash remix that goes to the other extreme, giving the impression that none of the remixers involved really understand Plank.</p>
<p>After four discs, one comes no nearer to understanding who that man was. Refined and impish, noisy and tranquil, grotesque and resplendent, Plank’s handiwork feels at once ineffable and instantaneous. When the jackhammering of Neu!’s “Hallogallo” ruptures the proceedings midway through disc two, the effect remains startling. One remains hard-pressed to identify specifically what Plank contributed and what sprang from Rother-Dinger, but the close partnership is evident. And it sounds nuts four decades later. ""Craziness is something holy,"" Plank said in an interview with <i>Electronic </i><i>Musician</i> magazine shortly before his death, and yet the set conveys only the merest glimpse of the man’s insanity.</p></div>"|17582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17582-whos-that-man-a-tribute-to-conny-plank/|5.9|Andy Beta

Grohl’s essentially the middle-man who helps the geezers look cool to the kids: He’s got an open-door policy for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf9KBxTg-nw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock and Roll Hall of Famers to join him onstage anytime</a>; he’s got enough charm and charisma to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13717-them-crooked-vultures/"" target=""_blank"">coax the most reclusive living member of Led Zeppelin out of semi-retirement</a>; and he’s always on hand to help Grammy Awards producers <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzx3S_JkTHU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mitigate the encroaching influence of EDM</a>. This sort of cross-generational appeal has made Grohl not just the nicest man in rock, but its Employee of the Month for nearly 20 years running.</p>
<p>And no doubt, he’s probably the only person who could have made <i>Sound City</i> happen. Grohl’s directorial debut pays tribute to the legendary-- and recently shuttered-- L.A. studio that produced Fleetwood Mac’s 1975 self-titled effort, Tom Petty’s <i>Damn the Torpedoes</i> and what seems like every other album in perpetual classic-rock radio rotation, not to mention alt-rock touchstones like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Rage Against the Machine’</a>s debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>’s <i>Pinkerton</i>, and, of course, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>’s <i>Nevermind</i>. But if the impetus for the film is a certain they-don’t-make-’em-like-they-used-to nostalgia, its accompanying soundtrack release-- also documented onscreen-- is a noble attempt to put the lie to that sentiment. Having purchased the facility’s hallowed Neve 8028 board and installed it at his own 606 Studios, the Foo Fighters frontman used his documentary as an occasion to gather various famed Sound City alumni together to create new music using an old-school tool.</p>
<p>However, “being friends with Dave Grohl” is not the most coherent unifying principle for a stand-alone album, given that his friends here include everyone from Stevie Nicks to Corey Taylor of Slipknot. And a mutual admiration for a bygone recording studio doesn’t provide much of a conceptual conceit to build a record around. Grohl, naturally, sounds the most invested in the cause: His epic showdown with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"" target=""_blank"">Trent Reznor</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Homme</a> on “Mantra” climaxes with a rallying cry (“And all of this will never be the same”) that essentially reads as an indictment against the technological and economic shifts that drove the studio out of business. But other artists, like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/378-black-rebel-motorcycle-club/"" target=""_blank"">Black Rebel Motorcycle</a> dudes on “Heaven and All”, simply show up as if they were cutting their own album. With its hit-and-miss deviations in tone and quality, <i>Real to Reel</i> feels less like a tribute to a studio that created some of the greatest albums of all time, and more like an approximation of a typical Active Rock Radio playlist.</p>
<p>The album works best when embracing the sheer absurdity of its ad-hoc supergroup combinations. Back in 1981, Rick Springfield and Lee Ving (of L.A. hardcore heretics Fear) represented the polar opposites of the rock-frontman ideal. Here, we find them on back-to-back tracks leading various Foo Fighters with equal amounts of bravado and self-deprecation. Springfield’s “The Man That Never Was” makes for a cheeky comment on his own faded celebrity, while Ving’s berserker turn on “Your Wife Is Calling” feeds on the neuroses of the domesticated aging punk. But the 62-year-old Ving is neither the oldest nor most impetuous guest on hand here: After making its surprise debut at last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48928-watch-12-12-12-benefit-with-kanye-west-bruce-springsteen-paul-mccartney-members-of-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">December’s Hurricane Sandy tribute</a> concert, Paul McCartney’s “Cut Me Some Slack”-- which sees the former Beatle backed by the surviving members of Nirvana-- still excites with its “Helter Skelter”-scaled bombast, hoarse-throat howls, and fierce double-timed outro. It’s the best representation of Grohl’s intent for his <i>Sound City</i> mission, to recapture some of the raw spontaneity that’s been lost in an era where so many recordings are clicked and cut with clinical precision.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that many of the other collaborations here feel as generic and laborious as a ProTools tutorial. Grohl, Masters of Reality’s Chris Goss, and half of Rage Against the Machine team up for “Time Slowing Down”, which comes off like a rejected Stone Temple Pilots audition for <i>The Crow</i> soundtrack; “From Can to Can’t”, meanwhile, squanders the power-pop chops of Cheap Trick’s Rick Nielsen and desert-burrowing bottom end of Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder on a plodding post-grunge power ballad belted with clenched-neck earnestness by Corey Taylor.  But it’s the date with Stevie Nicks that feels like <i>Real to Reel</i>’s biggest missed opportunity: “You Can’t Fix This” is a forced attempt to update the witchy-woman archetype of “Rhiannon”, but its heavy-handed lyrics about dancing with devils forsake mysticism for melodrama. And yet, even <i>Real to Reel</i>’s failures are a testament to the greatness of Sound City Studios-- in that they prove it takes more than the right equipment, the right people, and good intentions to recreate the magic of what once was.</p></div>"|17810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17810-dave-grohl-sound-city-ost/|5.3|Stuart Berman

In the interim, the late-career Rubin-style makeover has become just as much of a cliche as the album of standards from the American songbook. A release about a new collaboration between the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31129-the-delfonics/"" target=""_blank"">Delfonics</a>' William Hart, and Adrian Younge, a producer several decades his junior, said that the resulting album was going to be ""what the kids call 'hip-hop'""-- which sounds a lot like an unappealing welcome to the rap game Rubin-Cash formula.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that Younge's approach towards working with an older artist is less like Rubin's and more like Quentin Tarantino's: Instead of aiming for gravitas and youth culture appeal, he's placed Hart in his own stylized and slightly warped vision of the past that's both a tribute to the Delfonics' heyday, a radical deconstruction of it, and something altogether original.</p>
<p>Younge and Hart's album doesn't actuallly sound much like a Delfonics record. In the group's late 1960s and early 70s prime, they were at the vanguard of the Philly sound that replaced the hard-edged funk that girded the popular black music of the time with a slick breeziness that could occasionally border on easy listening. Delfonics records were gorgeously produced, with Hart and his rotating cast of support singers floating layers of vocal harmonies over lush beds of strings and horns.</p>
<p>Younge-- who produced the album, co-wrote all of its 13 songs with Hart, and played a couple of dozen instruments on it-- exchanges all that for a sonic aesthetic that has more in common with the more eccentric strain of soul and R&amp;B records that are so beloved by hardcore crate diggers and producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>. Instead of the luxe orchestration that was a trademark of peak-period Delfonics, Younge has given Hart idiosyncratic arrangements full of harpsichord, glockenspiel, and the electric sitar, which impart an element of campy psychedelia, but thankfully avoid crossing fully over into kitsch. With a mix that leans heavily on analog grit and high midrange tones, it sounds like the test pressing of a long-lost psych soul record rescued from a storage unit, and achieves a similar kind of retro accuracy that Younge gave to his soundtrack for the 2009 faux-vintage blaxploitation flick <i>Black Dynamite</i>.</p>
<p>For much of the album Hart sings solo, another departure from the Delfonics sound that we're used to. Purists might be consider the move tantamount to sacrilege, but it suits the material. Hart treats Younge's arrangements like an obstacle course, slipping nimbly through them with an agility that belies his age. His falsetto is still as crystal clear as it ever was, even if he has to bend the occasional high note in order to find the right pitch.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential issues with calling this record <i>Adrian Younge Presents the Delfonics</i>: Crediting what's essentially a William Hart solo album to the group could be considered questionable, and Younge taking top billing on the record's title and artist credit is either audacious or presumptuous. And anyone expecting a revival of the Delfonics sound we all know and love very well may walk away disappointed.</p>
<p>Taken on its own terms, though, the record works. And if Adrian Younge's approach to the project becomes the new formula for older artists, then all the better. A musician demanding the respect they're due is understandable, but one taking their reputation and using it to crack open new artistic territory is much more interesting.</p></div>"|17811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17811-the-delfonics-adrian-younge-presents-the-delfonics/|7.5|Miles Raymer

Though the Huntsville, Ala., rap duo's musical boldness pulled together various corners of the internet-- <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14976-the-one-cohesive/"">The ONE... COHESIVE</a></i>’s “How Far” sampled Beach House’s “10 Mile Stereo”, while <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16053-g-side-the-island/"">iSLAND</a></i>’s “Gettin It” sliced up Tame Impala’s winding “Why Won’t You Make Up Your Mind?”-- ST 2 Lettaz and Yung Clova always had their feet cemented in the spongy, candy-coated stylings of early 8Ball &amp; MJG and other Southern luminaries. It was an aesthetic that, if not exclusively theirs, no one else did better, and it provided the foundation of five satisfying (if commercially ineffectual) albums in barely four years, from 2007’s <i>Sumthin 2 Hate</i> to 2011’s <i>iSLAND</i>.</p>
<p>While Clova, as the head of Athens, Ala.-based collective Lambo Music, has continued to release new material since he and ST officially parted ways, the latter has worked faster. Less than a week after the breakup came his debut EP, <i>R.E.B.E.L</i>., which proved to be the most sonically daring release ST’d been involved in yet. Sampling the Beastie Boys, Bone Thugs, Empire of the Sun, and Skrillex, much of it was as kinetic as any of the party-rap by his Huntsville pal Jackie Chain (albeit in a much different way). Not only did it suggest ST would be just fine without his former partner, its best moments justified G-Side’s dissolution in that it exposed a singular vision that might never have been achieved by the pair as, well, a pair.  </p>
<p>Originally planned to be G-Side’s sixth LP, <i>The G... The Growth &amp; Development</i> wound up as ST’s full-length solo debut. It marks the first release of the 27-year-old’s career that doesn’t have much in the way of continuity. Three tracks approximate pure East Coast classicism-- “Trillmatic”’s first half, for example, could hardly be more reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17497-illmatic/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">that Nas album</a>’s “Memory Lane (Sittin’ in Da Park)”-- and two more aim for the club nearly as overtly as G-Side’s “College Chicks” did in 2009. Of course, those make for two very distant poles, but given that ST has written both with unabashed hubris and of everyday struggles whose details wouldn’t sound out of place on some meditative Rhymesayers single, we know the guy has range. And everything on <i>The G</i> falls within that range.</p>
<p>Besides those from the well-intentioned but occasionally goofy “Not a Luv Song”, these verses don’t show any sides of ST we haven’t seen before. Fortunately, he has no problems finding inventive ways to tread his usual topics. Here’s a note on his dope-dealing history from “Green Light District”: “Hit that bitch with P’s and O’s/ She flip them letters like Vanna White.” On “Flashlight”, ST steps back for a survey of the Big Picture, growing as pensive as ever in the process: “What good is having a voice if you only talk about yourself?/ What good is having a choice if you only choose to hurt somebody else?” Later on that same track, he looks at his surroundings and concludes, “This ain’t livin’, that’s why I’m livid.” Nothing worldview-shaking or stunningly pithy, maybe, but as per always, ST consistently gets the job done here.</p>
<p>A few obstacles prevent <i>The G</i> from reaching a serious peak or sustaining any real hot streak: some elements that were surely appended to give the album a more expansive feel-- GMane’s interstitial musings, the longish in- and outros, the instrumental “Lighthouse”-- account for too much of the album’s 42-minute duration. (Those GMane interludes don’t serve the same narrative purpose as, say, Kendrick’s mom’s do on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">good kid, m.A.A.d city</a></i>.) It’s also frustrating that ST insists on working with relative unknowns instead of collaborating with a heavyweight who might help draw him somewhere near the limelight of rap in a grand sense; Grilly and Bentley might sound a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">Big K.R.I.T.</a> and a more restrained <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29471-gunplay/"" target=""_blank"">Gunplay</a>, respectively, but they lack the intangibles those guys would bring if they were actually here. Barring the EP/pre-album teaser <i>Prelude... To The G</i>, <i>The Growth &amp; Development</i> might be the feeblest release of ST’s career so far. It’s never bad, but it could have been more streamlined, and we should be hearing a little more ambition from a guy who, as he tells us on “Flashlight”, is hoping to be a star at some point.</p></div>"|17857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17857-st-2-lettaz-the-g-the-growth-development/|6.5|Mike Madden

A half-Irish, half-Italian classically trained opera singer with roots in rural Canada, Zeffira is perhaps the only living person who's both worked with visual vanguard Chris Cunningham and performed for Pope John Paul II. Shortly after <i>Cat's Eyes</i> was released, Zeffira went off on her own and put together a pair of solo tunes, including a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s ""To Here Knows When"", that led to the eventual creation of her solo debut, <i>The Deserters</i>.</p>
<p>Zeffira handles writing, singing, and production duties here, and also assembled and conducted the orchestra, whose parts were recorded at Abbey Road, narrowly avoiding bankruptcy in the process. She plays <i>nine</i> different instruments. Of course, one only needed a listen to <i>Cat's Eyes</i> to glean Zeffira's considerable talents-- the broken-radio orchestral pop on which she took the lead easily make up the album's high points. However, much of <i>The Deserters</i> consists of mournful melodies. When the tempo occasionally picks up and percussion enters the equation  the effect is akin to throwing your iTunes on shuffle and transitioning from Air to, say, Pantera.</p>
<p>There's an unmistakable presence that looms over <i>The Deserters</i>, same as it did with <i>Cat's Eyes</i>, and it's that of late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a> singer Trish Keenan. At this point, it's impossible to talk about Zeffira's voice-- a fragile, even-tempered thing that's worlds away from what you'd expect with operatic experience-- without mentioning Keenan in the same breath. Broadcast's sound has proved more influential in modern indie with every passing year, but while a few Keenan-alikes have popped up here and there Zeffira's timbre is exceptionally similar. It hovers over almost everything else, an anti-gravitational presence amidst an already weightless environment.</p>
<p>Her voice suits the album's main theme: the act of leaving. Sometimes, Zeffira's the one taking a hike, as she does atop the piping synths of ""Letters From Tokyo (Sayonara)""; elsewhere, she's left standing at the ""Front Door"" waiting for someone who may never return, or detailing someone like the vanishing girl at the nucleus of ""Break the Spell"". Her lilting, detached voice stays in the same mood throughout, emphasizing the uncertainty contained within these 10 songs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, Zeffira's voice isn't notable so much for who it sounds like as it is for how she uses it-- which brings us to that My Bloody Valentine cover. Obviously, it's a good time to unleash a take on any tune from <i>Loveless</i>; regardless of when this was recorded, the opportunity wasn't wasted. The original's swirling guitars and ambient confusion are swapped out for, at first, just Zeffira's voice and her piano-- then, a distant buzzing, picked strings, and swelling woodwinds and brass that build in their intensity to the point where the prettiness is suffocating come the end. Play it loud enough, and it almost works just like its source material.</p>
<p>It's a bold, smart take on a song that's oft been pilfered. Unfortunately, the cover also highlights <i>The Deserters'</i> biggest flaw. This is a record that operates in two modes: light, floaty-yet-expansive orchestral pop, tempered with a few doses of samey motorik noir. Blame the learning curve-- after all, this is someone who's only been making pop music for two or three years thus far. A little more stylistic and structural variety could lead to something special. </p></div>"|17428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17428-rachel-zeffira-the-deserters/|6.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Even the song's run-together spelling suggested something slurred from the corner of the mouth. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>'s ""Perfect Circle"", the song danced in the middle distance, defying you to twist the lens and sharpen its edges.</p>
<p><span>Carmen Villain, aka Carmen Hillestad, is a similarly blurry prospect: The fact that she was once a model, appearing on the cover of magazines like </span><span><i>Vogue</i> </span><span>and </span><i>Marie Claire</i><span>, seemed to be the only available scrap of biographical information. One of few exceptions, an interview</span> <a href=""http://kulturbloggen.com/?p=66115"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>she posted to her own Facebook page</span></a><span>, was conducted entirely in Swedish. Google Translate helped to extract a few intriguing morsels: She chose the stage name Villain to help distance herself from her modeling career. Her debut album </span><span><i>Sleeper</i> is the first music she's ever shared with the world, after writing in private for years.</span><span> And much of the album, she said, ""is about indifference, being in a kind of emptiness.""</span></p>
<p>This foggy unease and blankness communicates itself everywhere on <i>Sleeper</i>, a frustratingly imperfect record that nonetheless holds onto the essential mystery that sparked my curiosity. It is gloomier than ""Lifeissin"", which surfaces through the murk here as a lone moment of clarity. Hillestad surrounds her bored, flat-as-earth vocals with a smeared wall of half-tuned guitars, evoking the seedy prowl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a> and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>. There are strong hints of bad drugs, and the unpleasant sensations that accompany them.</p>
<p><span>The songs with strong, legible vocal melodies carry themselves the best, transforming all of this disaffection and spiritual emptiness into something worth making your own. Hillestad has a knack for curdled, nursery-rhyme melodies, like the late-album highlight ""Dreamo"", which walks up and down the same four half-steps like someone humming to themselves. ""They caught me staring out the window,"" she sings, a lifelong dysphoric on guard against another well-meaning intervention from the outside world. She hits this note repeatedly in her lyrics, which seem to regard regard human interactions through a thick pane of bulletproof glass. ""People keep telling me, real life can be real nice,"" she sings on ""Two Towns"".</span></p>
<p><span>This noncommittal shrug occasionally prevents </span><span><i>Sleeper</i> </span><span>from hitting harder. Without pushing further into her exploration of despair or sharpening her songwriting, Hillestad sometimes lets her music just sit there. Stretches of the album simply drift past, like the cut-and-paste interlude ""Slowaway"" or the six-minute drone piece ""Obedience"", during which there isn't much left to focus on save for the album's rich, reverb-heavy production. ""What is love, but a second hand emotion?"" Hillestad sings on the haunting ""Dreamo"", quoting a beloved Tina Turner line. In my attempts to gather some surrounding context, I ended up corresponding briefly with Hillestad, who told me the quote was a tribute to the lifting power of a memorable song. ""That Turner lyric is a sort of reference to the type of cultural noise, for example heard through the radio, that could momentarily drag me out of the detachment I could quite often find myself in,"" she wrote. It's a neat object lesson in where she should go next: Music expressing detachment is easy, but music that addresses it requires some heavier lifting.</span></p></div>"|17773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17773-carmen-villain-sleeper/|6.6|Jayson Greene

<p>While not exactly a trend within itself, it's interesting to see how Banhart's latest follows a similar route to recent solo albums from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30840-christopher-owens/"" target=""_blank"">Christopher Owens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25867-jim-james/"" target=""_blank"">Jim James</a>, longhairs who had similarly been burdened with messianic praise and rock savior archetypes. Like those men, Banhart has eased back on multiple levels after increasingly ambitious records, digging up pre-Beatles concepts of pop and rock while writing from non-punk states such as loving with levity and aging with grace. <i>Mala</i>'s no less diverse than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/553-cripple-crow/"" target=""_blank"">Cripple Crow</a> </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10687-smokey-rolls-down-thunder-canyon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon</i></a>, but it's exponentially less heavy-handed in its genre-hopping. As the lovely instrumental ""The Ballad of Keenan Milton"" attests, he hasn't completely foresworn solo acoustic performance, but otherwise, these songs are short and spare, little more than reverbed electric guitar accompanied by light drumming and rudimentary synth tones. It retroactively posits him as something of a missing link between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> and Owens, which is an accomplishment within itself.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these are by far Banhart's most plainspoken and legible songs. Considering they're in the form of soft-shoe jazz or playful R&amp;B, there isn't <i>urgency </i>per se, so much as immediacy resulting from how <i>Mala </i>often feels like snippets taken from Banhart's daily life. ""Daniel"" namechecks bars and street names as well as ""waiting in line to see Suede play,"" while the record's cloaking, murky production gives the impression that he stills lives on a more mysterious plane than most of us. It also gives Banhart the freedom to get a little goofy even when <i>Mala </i>sounds dead sober. The muffled disco strut of ""Für Hildegard Von Bingen"" reimagines the 12<sup>th</sup>-century mystic as ""a VJ on location"" and leaves it as just a passing fancy Banhart felt worthy of capture rather than some high-minded metaphor. Likewise, ""A Gain"" is more of an interlude than a song, about a minute of free-form violin and Banhart muttering lines about being a disappointment to his mother, hair gel, and the W Hotel. As he rushes to jam in every last word in the line ""love is gonna be a long lost biological father,"" he's laughing at his own emo capacity as well as the nakedly ""confessional"" format.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Mala </i>makes good on its titular inspiration by way of including plenty of silly songs about love. Which is different than ""silly love songs"" in a crucial way-- Banhart's light touch with the more embarrassing aspects of relationships cuts against the occasional whimsy, and his self-deprecation feels earned, humanizing him as someone who can be a jerk in mundane ways: a guy who dated starlets but probably got yelled at for leaving the toilet seat up. Banhart takes on a deeper register that's equally suave and fatuous on ""Never Seen Such Good Things"", a song that borders on rhinestone cowboy pop. He laments a lost love with momentary nobility before the gawky phonetics and crude sentiment of ""if we ever make sweet love again/ I'm sure it would be quite disgusting"" make it a multilayered joke at the expense of our faulty memories regarding exes. This is even more pronounced on ""Your Fine Petting Duck"", a duet where Banhart and Kras play ex-lovers on opposite ends of a proposed reconciliation; Kras wants him back, Banhart is quick to remind her of the numerous ways in which he was a total ass: ""If he ever is untrue/ Just remember I was too... <i>and so much more so.</i>"" For whatever reason, it switches midway to a lo-fi electro-pop thump while Banhart and Kras sing in German, because... why not? Even if it's fiction and decidedly anti-romantic in content, the feel is that of an inside joke between two people who really like each other; in practice, it's an ironic Valentine that's a powerfully effective demonstration of the conspiratorial giddiness of new love.</p>
<p>So it's best to think of <i>Mala </i>as a new beginning for Banhart than a triumphant return to form-- for one thing, this is <i>not </i>the sort of record that will bring back the diehards who felt he fell off the moment he traded in his four-track, to say nothing of cleaning up his image and reneging on the promise of ""Long Haired Child"". And he still isn't the most fastidious editor of his own work; on the whole, it's for the best that his mojo and humor are given equal billing on <i>Mala</i>, though he should've kept the Zappa pastiche ""Hatchet Wound"" to himself. But one overly bawdy locker room joke is a small price to pay as Banhart sounds refreshed and relieved here, someone happily on the outside looking in rather than trying to situate himself as a countercultural star, and finally taking the opportunity to show that he doesn't take himself as seriously as a lot of people take him.</p></div>"|17800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17800-devendra-banhart-mala/|7.6|Ian Cohen

Most of his songs are about regular folks facing down some challenge, whether it’s a powerful corporation, a corrupt politician, or simply hard times. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4416-uncle-tupelo/"">Uncle Tupelo</a> in the early 1990s, he wrote paeans to anonymous laborers and pitiable drunks, although the ensuring alt-country movement borrowed the romanticism and ignored the radicalized politics of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8344-no-depression-still-feel-gone-and-march-16-20-1992/"">March 16-20, 1992</a>.</i> In the 2000s, he discovered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody Guthrie</a> and recorded a few albums of languid agit-folk-rock that were heavy on vague outrage and light on sense. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7331-okemah-and-the-melody-of-riot/""><i>Okemah and the Melody of Riot</i></a>, named after Guthrie’s birthplace, had all the passion of a thesis paper, as though Farrar admired his idol’s righteous anger but had no idea how to duplicate it. Even on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13741-one-fast-move-or-im-gone-music-from-kerouacs-big-sur/"">One Fast Move or I’m Gone</a>,</i> his 2009 book report on Kerouac, Farrar lost himself in unquestioning idol worship of the Beat Poet.</p>
<p>If those albums depict the American everyman laboring and traveling, Son Volt’s latest, <i>Honky Tonk</i>, shows the Little Guy at leisure. As the title suggests, the milieu is the roadhouse full of people nursing beers and broken hearts while wearing ruts in the dance floor. Instead of Okies or Beats, Farrar’s inspiration is Bakersfield, the California crossroads that figured so prominently in the country of music of the late 1960s. Acts like Buck Owens and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1872-merle-haggard/"">Merle Haggard</a> emphasized electric guitar and drums, steely riffs and solid rhythms, and that harder sound distinguished them from the more traditional strains of country emanating from Nashville. For Son Volt, that means a constant two-step rhythm, a fiddle that swirls in and out of focus, pedal steel that sheds a tear in everybody’s beer, and an electric guitar that bounces around some of the faster tunes like “Bakersfield”.</p>
<p>It may be the best Son Volt has sounded in a decade and the most engaged Farrar has sounded in longer, but that’s not really saying much. As a singer, his voice drifts into a muddied, low monotone that favors an unhurried midtempo and tends to flatten the melody; as a songwriter, he tends to favor obtuse wordplay that obscures rather than illuminates his subject matter. On <i>Honky Tonk</i>, he makes the most of those limitations, more or less. His voice sounds positively animated on “Seawall” and “Barricades"", and he lovingly draws out the long vowels of “blues” on “Angel of the Blues”, as though reluctant to actually part with the word.</p>
<p>To adapt to the roadhouse setting, Farrar’s songwriting has grown more straightforward as well, even if he favors the same theme on almost every tune: “Don’t let the barricades of life keep the wild spirit still.” But some of his attempts to evoke actually do evoke; some of these songs sound like they have thousands of highway miles between them and are coated with dust. “Down the Highway” may be his best roadtrip anthem since “Windfall” on Son Volt’s ’95 debut, <i>Trace</i>. “There’s a world of wisdom inside a fiddle tune,” he sings. “Throw this love down the highway/ See where it takes you.” The scale is less ambitious, but writing about the travails of the heart is just as righteous as building a <a href=""http://www.ushistoryscene.com/uncategorized/woodyguthrie/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">machine to kill fascists</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with <i>Honky Tonk</i> is that it’s more suited to the road than the roadhouse. The pacing is so languid, the dynamics so muted that I doubt this iteration of Son Volt would last very long in a real honkytonk. They’d clear the dancefloor and possibly get drowned out by chatter. While the Bakersfield sound is not strictly dance music, it is by its very nature social music, meant to be experienced and enjoyed communally. Yet, Farrar’s songs sound introverted instead of extroverted, suited more to his own idiosyncrasies as singer and bandleader than to the needs of his perceived audience. In other words, you can’t scoot a boot to this album. Farrar continues to sing about regular folk, but still hasn’t found a way to sing to them. </p></div>"|17771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17771-son-volt-honky-tonk/|5.9|Stephen M. Deusner

Sometimes the beats didn't line up with the quality of his rapping. Sometimes he tried to wear a lothario's robes instead of playing to his hard-nosed blue-collar strengths. But Boldy's presence was reason enough not to skip ahead. He spends most of his time detailing the intricacies of selling cocaine and raps with a numbed monotone, and he's the kind of rapper who boasts of his product's popularity while looking over his shoulder, afraid of being usurped by a younger version of himself. But he manages to be someone you root for.</p>
<p>Boldy's new EP, <i>Grand Quarters</i>, gathers songs from the last few years and adds new material. Half the tracks are produced by Chuck Inglish of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5772-the-cool-kids/"" target=""_blank"">the Cool Kids</a>, whose minimalist knock meshes well with Boldy's gritty, no-frills style. Inglish's work is more black-marker outlines than finished watercolors, and his beats are some of his hardest yet, stripped down and hollowed out to their most elemental parts-- usually, just granite blocks of bass, cavern-sized drums, and simple synth lines to provide some color. </p>
<p>""Gettin' Flicked"" finds a second home here after first appearing on the 2010 Cool Kids mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14329-tacklebox/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tacklebox</i></a>, and surrounded by other tracks similar in aesthetic, it's even more effective. Woozy synths approximate police car sirens, and Boldy crafts a tight narrative in which, after being released from jail, he goes straight back to the only life he knows. It's packed with details that give it a lived-in feel, like the fact his Air Jordan XII sneakers don't have any laces or that it was his aunts Lynnette and Marsha who accepted his collect call when he was arrested. The broken-subwoofer thump of ""For the Birds""-- the only one of the three Inglish-produced tracks not to have been released in some form before-- frees Boldy to dig into the corners of the track as he expands on slang for a brick of cocaine into a track's worth of fowl-inspired drug talk. Because they leave so much room for him to maneuver, these tracks serve as an excellent introduction for those unfamiliar with Boldy. The wide-open spaces highlight how flexible of a rapper he is, how much energy he can inject into a tightly-coiled style. His raps aren't quite melodic, but they possess a musicality that keeps them engaging. </p>
<p>The new tracks further highlight that flexibility. ""Come Here"" is bombastic and celebratory, radio-friendly without sacrificing Boldy's idiosyncrasies-- the song even finds him trying on Auto-Tune for size, and thankfully it's more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rebirth</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>. ""I Can Pull It Off"" is probably the most melodic production Boldy has ever rapped over, a shimmering tapestry of adrenaline-soaked synths with a sticky hook to match.</p>
<p>Because it repurposes older material, <i>Grand Quarters</i> feels like a stopgap release more than anything else, a lead-in to Boldy's forthcoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a>-produced album, scheduled for later this year. The outlines of two diverging courses for Boldy's career are plotted here. But given Alchemist's noir-ish take on classic New York boom-bap and ""Power Glove"", their collaboration from last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16922-russian-roulette/"" target=""_blank""><i>Russian Roulette</i></a>, it's likely that the album will hew closer to spacious, harder-hitting sound of the first half. But Boldy's surprising range here suggests that he'll be ready for whatever comes.</p></div>"|17798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17798-boldy-james-grand-quarters/|7.3|Renato Pagnani

In an <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/09022-sonic-router-025-bandshell-hessle-audio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with <i>The Quietus</i> last year, the 21-year-old Northern UK-based producer claimed the closest he'd come to a club experience was seeing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> during their epochal 2007 tour, and that his music had only received notice after e-mailing Hessle Audio co-boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30976-ben-ufo/"" target=""_blank"">Ben UFO</a> some of his music after hearing his regular Rinse FM show back in 2011. (When it comes to putting his stuff out there, though, he admits ""I don't have much of a web presence, musically""; his Soundcloud, in accordance, contains nothing but silence.)</p>
<p>The internet can be a desolate place, and Bandshell more or less lives on the internet, so his music follows suit. His debut EP, last year's Hessle-released <i>Dust March</i>, less resembled proper techno than it did a skeletal, perverted take on the genre. The beats were sparse and unstable, with few intrusions-- static washes, distant shouts, a few evenly spaced synth droplets-- thrown in as window-dressing to accentuate the bare rawness of it all. Fellow hot-ticket e-countryman and reformed enigma <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30208-evian-christ/"" target=""_blank"">Evian Christ</a> ""<a href=""http://dummymag.com/new-music/2013/02/06/evian-christ-introduces-bandshell/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">introduced</a>"" Bandshell last month on <i>Dummy</i>, and considering the producers' shared fondness for dry, brittle textures, the association makes sense. Whereas Evian Christ's coruscating hip-hop mutations are presented in relative high-definition, though, Bandshell's music frequently sounds as if it's being played back through an old Tascam that's been thrown down a few flights of stairs.</p>
<p>""Broken"" is a word that's popped up a few times in attempts to describe Bandshell's sound; appropriately, ""Winton"", the lead track off of his <i>Caustic View</i> EP for Mute offshoot Liberation Technologies, sounds like busted parts held together with masking tape. (<i>Caustic View</i> is the third release from Lib Tech, following strong output from Laurel Halo and Surgeon/Regis pair-up BMB, and it further suggests that the imprint is one to watch for off-center beat fare in the future.) The tune's thick bass introduces something more floor-ready than anything on <i>Dust March</i>, but as the tune's structure continually reassembles and regurgitates itself, its spastic movements resemble how you'd imagine someone attempting to dance to the thing.</p>
<p>""Winton"" is aggressive and splayed, and it's the only track on the EP that operates as such-- <i>Caustic View</i>'s four pieces travel on their own paths. ""Nice Mullet"" is all hissing steam and dirty tones, with piping machinery as a rhythmic backbone; ""Landfill"" switches out the fog for a healthy dose of paranoia, as noise blasts puncture the atmospheric humidity before a sludgy synth melody turns the whole thing into a bombed-out anti-anthem. Most intriguingly is ""Winton""'s A-side sharer, ""Perc"", the EP's longest and most meditative cut. The composition is relatively simple-- a few interlocking synths that sound as if played from six rooms away, a sneakily melodic low end, the warm thud of the backbeat, and the faintest whiff of tape hiss-- but the results are affecting and contemplative, reminiscent of the prettier moments on dance deconstructionist Actress' beguiling 2012 album <i>R.I.P.</i></p>
<p>Bandshell has stated that he used to ""write a lot of music"" but is more judiciously creative as of late. So despite the possible assumption that <i>Caustic View</i> suggests artistic growth from his material out there thus far, the fact that two of these tunes have appeared on previous mixes potentially disproves a sense of chronology-- ""Landfill"" especially, as it appeared on Bandshell's own Sonic Router mix around the time of <i>Dust March</i>'s release. (In a full-circle of sorts, ""Perc"" showed up on Ben UFO's recent, relatively rough'n'tumble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17553-fabriclive-67/"" target=""_blank"">Fabriclive mix</a>.) Instead of piecing together Bandshell's past and future, then, it's more fun to wonder where the promising talent will go with his sound next.</p></div>"|17763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17763-bandshell-caustic-view-ep/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

The quartet falls in behind Willi Stabenau’s initial bass rupture and powers through an up-tempo crunch, with singer Fade Kainer growling in time above the punch. Most of the song follows this format, but tucked strangely between these parts are brief lugubrious impasses that steal the momentum. On first listen, these short drones play out like such shocking forks in the tune that they seem swiped from another song entirely, vestiges of one track accidentally spliced into this one’s militant clip. Upon repeated inspection, though, these lulls are musical foreshadowing for the number’s midsection, which, however bracing it remains, downshifts toward a viscid lurch. Batillus, then, attempt to add a little compositional sophistication to their musical burl.</p>
<p>The ploy almost works, but however intelligent and elegant the mechanism might be, the choice to add those faded clips ultimately stalls the motion of “Rust,” a song that, otherwise, is simply a blast. <i>Concrete Sustain</i> thrives and dies by this premise— that is, add unexpected elements to metal that’s alternately no-, low- and mid-tempo, and attempt to shake loose the formulas of doom and stoner metal. When the plan works, <i>Concrete Sustain</i> is a captivating record created and energized by new possibilities. For instance, brilliant opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14897-concrete/"" target=""_blank"">Concrete</a>” backs a reaper of a guitar riff with Geoff Summers’ stuttering funk drumming, offsetting the gloom with unexpected pep. The elements here are familiar, though their arrangement is not. The result is exhilarating.  </p>
<p>Batillus formed as an instrumental trio in 2007, and Kainer took the microphone two years later. He serves double duty, acting not only as the lead singer but also as the textural locomotive, using an array of synthesizers and samplers to back the band with electronics and to sample and layer his voice in these songs. During “Beset”, the album’s eight-minute centerpiece, he uses this toolkit to profound effect. He growls between the doomy crests of guitar, but he replicates his lines beneath the lead, forming a crisscrossed web of howling phantoms and demons. It’s a tad frightening but, mostly, it’s sonically interesting, suggesting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7581-black-one/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black One </i></a>collaborations with experimental aesthetes such as John Wiese, Oren Ambarchi, and Malefic. When Greg Peterson creeps through a guitar solo toward song’s end, Kainer again supports it with a wash of soft, gray noise, mirroring the earlier effect of musical valances. Summers adds ricocheting dub drums to the start of “Cast”, Peterson triumphant post-rock radiance to the front of “Thorns”-- dual intriguing elements that confirm Batillus’ intention to break beyond their form’s barriers, as well as their own.  </p>
<p>Though Batillus have some remarkable ideas for the progression of their sound and, really, of metal itself, they don’t always have the necessary perspective to make them work. Moments of <i>Concrete Sustain</i> are entirely invigorating, but some of them arrive within songs that lack focus or steady development, frustratingly embedding gems within a morass of gravel. “Cast”, for instance, sports not only those great snare pops but also a roiling bass line from Stabenau that, again, borders on funk. The song itself, however, is a lopsided mess, with a structure that collapses beneath the shifting weight of its unstable parts. “Mirrors” bullies through the same psychedelic sludge as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a> but allows Kainer to go on a bit of a noise rampage, with his electronics overpowering the rest of the band in moments of intoxicating power. Rather than end the song with that thrilling peak, though, Batillus trudges through to the other side, epitomizing the act of anticlimax with a slow fade to silence.</p>
<p>Risk doesn’t always deliver reward, of course, and that’s the fate <i>Concrete Sustain </i>suffers. Still, it’s good to hear Batillus clearly trying to outfox themselves and their peers. They even succeed in fits, starts and, with only their second half, at least a third of their songs. For a band so obviously on the offensive, that approach affords a prime position for the future.</p></div>"|17823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17823-batillus-concrete-sustain/|6.9|Grayson Currin

In 1969, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> was just another struggling London songwriter desperate for a break, he shot a promotional film to showcase his particularly dramatic brand of performance. Along with a handful of songs-- including an early version of ""Space Oddity"" in which a tinfoil-helmeted Bowie is seduced by a couple of space sirens-- the reel included an original mime piece called <a href=""http://youtu.be/jiKWEf2luMY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Mask""</a>. It shows Bowie, looking like the least intimidating pirate of all-time in tight white tights, a frilly top, and a pageboy wig, stealing an invisible mask and proceeding to charm his family, co-workers, and eventually entire concert halls by simply placing it on his face. ""Autographs, films, television-- the lot!"" he says, in voiceover, describing the opportunities afforded by his mysterious new facade. ""Had a very strange effect on me, though."" The mime ends with the white-faced ""star"" giving his biggest performance yet-- and then he can't get the mask off. It strangles him. ""The papers made a big thing out of it,"" he continues, ""funny though, they didn't mention anything about a mask."" Even before David Bowie gained a smidge of notoriety, he was well aware of its pitfalls-- and his own susceptibility to the lure of disguise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To put it mildly, this self-aware attraction to reinvention has served him well. In the 1970s, he rifled through looks, genres, and band members without hesitation, from space-age glam, to cocaine funk, to harrowing ambience, to name a few. In more modern terms, consider Radiohead's whiplash transformation between <i>OK Computer</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kid A</i></a>... and then consider how Bowie pulled off equally radical shifts at least <i>five times</i> between 1970 and 1980 alone. This malleability astounds because it runs so counter to the way most of us think and behave. It's non-conformist, uncomfortable, and irrational, without any of the detrimental consequences that are supposed to come along with such rule-breaking. Granted, a stupendous coke habit nearly killed him and he wasn't able to be a present father to his young son during that time, but even those disappointments led to the despondency that fueled his oblique Berlin trilogy. While many artists claim to despise the status quo, only a few have discarded previous successes with the abandon of Bowie, especially during that flawless decade-long stretch. ""Tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming,"" read the tagline in an ad for 1977's <i>""Heroes""</i>. It was anything but hyperbole. Back then, Bowie may have had many masks, but he knew exactly how long to wear each one.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The following couple of decades weren't quite as fulfilling, with Bowie reaching stadium success, over-diluting his art, and then doubling-back and over-corroding it. Whereas the 70s run was marked by unpredictability, the 80s and 90s were more transparently reactionary, with Bowie eventually following trends rather than leading (or ignoring) them. But this is what happens to rock stars, right? They age, they wither, and they eventually play 30-year-old songs to 50-year-old people who are doing their best to avoid nostalgia's bittersweet aftertaste while nursing an $11 Bud in the back of a basketball arena. Bowie could've gone that route. He didn't.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Following the death of his mother, the birth of his daughter, the decision to lay down roots in New York City, and a reunion with Tony Visconti, the producer who helped him hit career highs like <i>Young Americans</i>, <i>Low</i>, and <i>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</i>, came 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/882-heathen/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heathen</i></a>. The album found Bowie in a contemplative mood, finally finding peace by twisting up his own past in a way that did service to his accomplishments without overtly repeating them. The following year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reality</i></a> pulled off a similar trick, and it seemed like David Bowie was settling into a respectable late-career renaissance. And then, on June 25, 2004, he collapsed backstage after a show in Germany, and had to undergo emergency heart surgery. ""I tell you what, though, I won't be writing a song about this one,"" he joked, following the angioplasty. ""I can't wait to be fully recovered and get back to work again.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Nearly a decade of silence followed. Rumors of retirement or serious illness came up once in a while, but that's about it. In Paul Trynka's 2011 biography <i>Starman</i>, a friend of Bowie's was quoted as saying, ""If you were in hospital after a heart scare, would you be wishing you'd spent more time flogging yourself on tour? Or would you be wishing you could spend more time with your five-year-old?"" The explanation seems reasonable; Bowie was going to avoid rock'n'roll fogey-dom by avoiding rock'n'roll altogether while making up for his early fatherly failures. But then he figured out another way to move ahead.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On several levels, David Bowie's 24th studio album is a cunning act of sleight of hand. On <i>The Next Day</i>, he hasn't only come to terms with his past-- he's making his old material work for his new material. For Bowie, the always-savvy son of a public relations man, it's good for business and good for art. The <i>""Heroes""</i>-erasing cover is an admission, a boast, and a provocation (""how <i>dare</i> he!"") all at once. And by keeping the album's recording sessions a tight-lipped secret, the back-from-the-dead exclamation of its announcement was that much more pronounced. Also, by abstaining from any new interviews and only releasing a few drab black-and-white promo photos, he's all but forcing the press to go back through his archives to fill the inevitable cover stories from all across the globe. So, there's long-haired <i>Hunky Dory</i> Bowie on the cover of France's <i>Telerama</i>, a lightning-eyed Aladdin Sane fronting the UK's <i>Q</i>, a <i>""Heroes""</i> outtake peering out from Japan's <i>Rockin'On</i>. He turned the ""David Bowie is dying!"" worry into a thousand fawning would-be obituaries that instead build excitement for his new album-- all while he's likely sitting at his computer, sipping tea and enjoying the coup.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The music found within is also something of a bait-and switch; on the surface, many tracks are uptempo rockers that recall various moments of Bowie's near-50-year career-- hopeful fodder for a tour that looks unlikely to take off-- but delve into the lyric sheet and you'll find death, war, graves, murder, and ghosts at almost every turn. Admittedly, this is not new subject matter for the singer-- his 1967 debut album ended with the theatrical ""Please Mr. Gravedigger"", an essentially a cappella tale of a child killer and a man re-digging holes for bodies after a bomb tore up their original resting places. And there's the glam apocalypse story of 1974's <i>Diamond Dogs</i>. But while those yarns could be fanciful and campy-- the musings of a young man glamorizing or sensationalizing the ultimate end-- <i>The Next Day</i>'s deathly bent is more blunt.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Inspired by English medieval history books, the title track tells of a man being dragged and maimed by an angry mob. ""Here I am, not quite dying/ My body left to rot in a hollow tree,"" sings Bowie, in a husky voice. The simmering ""Love Is Lost"" observes a troubled, perhaps suicidal 22-year-old girl whose ""fear is as old as the world."" It builds to a clenched-fist climax with Bowie ruefully pleading ""oh, what have you done?"" ""Valentine's Day"", meanwhile, is a Ziggy-style romp... about a tiny-faced school shooter; ""How Does the Grass Grow?"" offers a quasi-sentimental graveyard tale in which Bowie quips, ""Remember the dead/ They were so great/ Some of them""; ""You Feel So Lonely You Could Die"" wishes comeuppance upon a heartless Cold War assassin. You get the point. It may very well be his bleakest set of lyrics to date, words that don't glorify death as much as they detail its cruel inevitability throughout history. So while ""The Next Day"" could be seen as an optimistic phrase on paper, on the title track its describing nothing less than eternal brutal violence: ""And the next day, and the next, and another day.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Musically, <i>The Next Day</i> isn't as radical or dreary, as it bounces around from style to style, casually suggesting past greatness while rarely matching it. The production is clean and crisp, almost to a fault, leaving little room for the off-kilter spontaneity that highlights Bowie's best work; it's no coincidence that two of the album's best moments, on the skulking ""Dirty Boys"" and the taut ""Boss of Me"", feature glorious sax solos from longtime collaborator Steve Elson. Too often, though, the instrumentation sounds museum-ready. This is a shame, especially considering Visconti's pedigree-- this is the same guy who revolutionized the way rock drums sound on <i>Low</i> by pitching them down using a device that, he boasted to Bowie at the time, ""fucks with the fabric of time."" The same effect teasingly shows up ever-so-briefly on <i>The Next Day</i>, at the start of ""Love Is Lost"", and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Walker</a>-style closer ""Heat"" nails a disconcerting ambience, but otherwise, the album's sonics could've certainly been fucked with a bit more.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In 1974, <i>Rolling Stone</i> sat a 27-year-old Bowie down with a 60-year-old William Burroughs to <a href=""http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Press/1974/0228/rsinterview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discuss</a> accelerating technologies, the uselessness of love, and the quality of porn films from country to country: ""The best ones were the German ones,"" Bowie concludes. (In one of the few <i>Next Day</i> press photos, the 66-year-old Bowie sits beneath a photo of himself and the famed author from that '74 interview.) They also touch on the trappings of public perception. ""They want to see their picture of you,"" says Burroughs, ""and if they don't see their picture of you they're very upset."" David Bowie has made a career of walking that line between the picture people want to see and the one he wants to give them. In this way, <i>The Next Day</i> finds him as astute as ever, casting a ghoulish shadow over sounds and images we know and love. In fact, there was at least one exclusive magazine cover photo to go along with the new record; according to an editor's letter, the image that appeared on the front of last week's <i>NME</i> arrived in his inbox with the message, ""This is just for you. No-one else has seen this. David would like to be on the cover."" The photo, shot just last month, shows two eyes-- one pupil bigger than the other-- behind a stark white <a href=""http://www.wotyougot.com/pictures//2013/02/david-bowie-nme-020312.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mask</a>.</p></div>"|17855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17855-david-bowie-the-next-day/|7.6|Ryan Dombal

It's a reminder that what we bring to a piece of music shapes how we listen. In the crudest of terms, it's an album adapted from a score for a piece of theatre based on novel responding to a historical event. More specifically, it is the work of Berlin-based producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/"" target=""_blank"">Apparat</a>, commissioned by German theatre director Sebastian Hartmann for his 2012 production of Tolstoy’s <i>War and Peace</i>. While these cold facts could perhaps appear impenetrable on paper, <i>Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre) </i>is a delightful challenge to both fixity and expectations.</p>
<p>There are many layers of response at work here and, similarly, as many reflections and echoes between the various responses. It was the result of intense collaboration between Hartmann and his cast, Apparat’s Sascha Ring and the musicians he involved, and with the ever-shifting nature of the production itself during the making and staging of it with the score performed live by an orchestra each night. That inherent sense of flux permeates every note on the album; it surprises at every turn. The delicate music box chimes of “K&amp;F Thema” seem to come from nowhere, like sparks of vibrant light shooting up from the stark, watery landscape of the preceding “Blank Page”. Swelling strings proceed to engulf the chimes until they themselves are cut short, succumbing to distant drums sending out a warning. “K&amp;F Thema (Pizzicato)” is, as the title indicates, a plucked variation on the main theme, conveying a level of affected yet affecting sophistication. The desire to join the dots in the bigger narrative is strong: is this the aristocracy’s last dance before the war fractures their insular way of life?</p>
<p>Swimming beneath Ring’s orchestral arrangements is a primordial soup of sonics: the falling of rain outside a window, the awkward tumble of unknown objects, a shrill whirl of drills. The hustle and bustle of these sounds ground the grandiose orchestration in the real world, give it an abstract sense of the mud and blood-splattered physicality of war. Ring’s skill here recalls the work of cult techno producer <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/2011/10/21/my-hero-apparat-on-torsten-proefrock/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Torsten Pröfrock</a>, a man he has previously paid tribute to for instilling in him “the idea of sounds having a patina [...] That sounds really needs something like that-- a little dirt is always important in your music.” There are also lines to be drawn with the work of cellist Julia Kent who incorporates found sound into her recordings. On an even wider level, it speaks to the many conversations going on in contemporary composition today: briefly, about whether to embrace electronic means, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Meredith</a> has done, or uphold tradition in composing solely for orchestra.  </p>
<p>Ring has, of course, come to the orchestra from the other side of the fence. It was his last album <i>The Devil’s Walk</i> that first found him breaking with his techno production past to more fully incorporate instrumentation and his own singing voice. While there's a touch of mid-90s, prog-rock musical theatre to the two vocal tracks on <i>Krieg und Frieden (Music for Theatre)</i>-- “Light On” and “A Violent Sky”-- it's not unwelcome. Ring’s orchestral and electronic score communicates the narrative’s swing from complacent luxury to riveting despair, showing what happens when worlds collide.</p></div>"|17624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17624-apparat-krieg-und-frieden-music-for-theatre/|7.5|Ruth Saxelby

The pun spoke volumes. Young Dreams are baroque, a little anachronistic and, occasionally, wincingly earnest-- but at least their self-presentation shows that they’re fully aware of all these things. Everything about them has an air of almost orchestral grandeur. A Norwegian pop collective whose membership sometimes is as high as 12, their press material describes them not as a band but a “sovereign nation.” Their recent single, the floating, psych-pop anthem “Fog of War”, was a standard tale of alienation and teenage dreams, except for the fact that instead of pining for the girl next door, the narrator was “waiting for my own Athena.” Dream big or go home.</p>
<p>Young Dreams are from Bergen-- a city where, by their own admission “it rains 400 days a year”-- but sonically, <i>Between Places</i> imagines a place where the sun shines bright. Their densely flourished yet weightless pocket symphonies owe an obvious debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>, but certain elements of their sound also nod to more contemporary artists: the buoyant vocal harmonies on “Footprints” recall<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/""> Grizzly Bear</a> circa <i>Veckatimest</i>, while “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14870-first-days-of-something/"" target=""_blank"">First Days of Something</a>” centers around a breezy riff that wouldn’t sound out of place in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> song. Still, <i>Between Places</i> has a thematic unity that makes it something more pointed than a collection of influences. Whether about escaping the oppression of adolescence or your dreary local weather patterns, Young Dreams’ music exalts the transformative power of imagination. “I think it's a reaction to the weather we have: freezing cold, no light,” the de facto frontman Matias Tellez <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzZdW9grghA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> of their sun-dappled sound. “I think it's just that, when things are miserable, you start dreaming of things that aren't as miserable.""</p>
<p><i>Between Places</i> is certainly an impressive <i>sounding</i> album. Its best songs, like “Footprints” and the eponymous “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12762-young-dreams/"" target=""_blank"">Young Dreams</a>” achieve a difficult balance of feeling grand and baroque but never overcrowded; woodwinds, synthesizers and choral background singers add a fullness to the atmosphere but duck out of frame right at the moment when they’d be too much. The hooks are unabashedly epic, and the atmosphere is immersive but light. The album’s high point, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14427-fog-of-war/"" target=""_blank"">Fog of War</a>”, sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"" target=""_blank"">Killers</a> song coming apart in the outer reaches of the stratosphere.</p>
<p>But Young Dreams have to work some things out down on earth before they can effectively soar that high. Tellez’ lyrics often either too bland (“We’re restless, that’s why we keep on moving…We’ll live forever”) or, when he zooms in and attempts a bit more specifics, clumsy (“I couldn’t stop talking/ I now need a charger for my mobile phone”). This wouldn’t be such a problem if the songs weren’t structured and mixed as though the lead vocals were the most important things going on-- they haven’t yet mastered the trick that a band like Grizzly Bear do so well: presenting lead vocals as though they’re just another instrument in the song, and using lyrics more for texture than explicit meaning. The band’s songwriting chops are evident on <i>Between Places</i>, and it’s refreshing for a debut to err on the side of being <i>too</i> ambitious, when so many new indie bands nowadays suffer from the opposite problem. But the content of these songs doesn’t quite earn their epic execution. “Not empty, because of our young dreams,” Tellez professes on the closing track, but it’s the dreams themselves that feel hollow and faceless, the kind whose specifics you strain to remember the next day.</p></div>"|17812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17812-young-dreams-between-places/|5.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Using terms like ""fearless"" to describe musicians who cycle through contrasting styles in their career often comes across as lazy shorthand for competency-- the music rarely eclipses its obvious influences. Allien has occasionally veered close to that space, although mostly there's a strong feeling of immersion in the genres she splintered off into in works like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11525-sool/""><i>Sool</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14244-dust/""><i>Dust</i></a>. <i>LIsm</i>, a single track that clocks in at 45-minutes, is her most fractured work to date, a piece that veers from abstraction into song-oriented forms and through the clubby territory that made her name. It's adapted from a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/ellen-allien-official-fanpage/07032011-ellen-allien-drama-per-musica-centre-pompidou-paris-france/496531496913"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">work</a> she produced for a dance performance at Paris' Pompidou Centre in 2011, with Allien subsequently retooling the music she composed to give <i>LIsm</i> a peculiar life and feel of its own.</p>
<p>This is more likely to be a one-off project than a firm detachment from the scene that spawned Allien, but it's certainly something far closer to avant rock circles than it is to anything approaching dance music. As an overall work it bears few peers, although there are passages that produce a sense of familiarity. The opening guitar strum is reminiscent of the slow creep lead-in from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPJrrkYT5Eo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nice One""</a> by improvisational Portland troupe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2158-jackie-o-motherfucker/"">Jackie-O Motherfucker</a>, while the clear-eyed pop that closes out the track is just a production budget short of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Luke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Luke</a>'s domain. In between those bookends come impulses that need a road map to make sense of, although the beauty of <i>LIsm</i> comes from dipping in and getting lost. The sequencing is skillfully cut together, as you'd expect from someone with Allien's DJ pedigree, although it never ends up as a mere technical feat to marvel at. She's clearly more interested in digging out an emotional core to this work.</p>
<p>It's a wayward journey, which appears to be the intention of the piece, although at times it produces the kind of mixed results you get from opening a novel at a random page and trying to make sense of it. Sometimes that can produce a whole other world, a place where the reader is forced to color in the background in interesting ways; at other times it's impossible to get your bearings. <i>LIsm</i> is both those things, a place where the minimal techno of <i>Sool</i> brushes up against primal screams reminiscent of the stringy howl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>' Angus Andrew, only to take a thrilling left turn into gamelan-influenced percussion. At those points, <i>LIsm</i> forges ahead with purpose, resembling a DJ set that's part education, part historical melting pot. When it doesn't work it feels a little clunky. Sparse jazz moves collide with glacial <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a> synths, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">0PN</a> drones segue awkwardly into classical piano, drum machines pointlessly sputter into life then fade away.</p>
<p>That sense of just trying stuff on to see whether it works has some merit, but it does cause <i>LIsm</i> to lose purpose at crucial junctures. There's a sag in the center of the piece, a feeling of Allien not keeping her eye on the bigger picture as a soupy array of styles slosh about aimlessly. It's no surprise that her exit door out of there is via the kind of thoughtful techno that harks back to her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/411-berlinette/""><i>Berlinette</i></a> days. But in this context it doesn't feel like a retread, instead coming across as a crucial part in the <i>LIsm</i> narrative, a way of figuring out how darker fare can form part of a slow build toward celestial clubland. The barbed metallic drones that guide Allien to that place are the highlight of the track, a beautiful mesh of criss-crossing figures, all set at purposefully difficult angles to one another. That's <i>LIsm's</i> place, looking for commonality where none exists, succeeding because it shapes conversations through the klutzy way its parts are assembled.</p></div>"|17774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17774-ellen-allien-lism/|6.4|Nick Neyland

They helped inspire the creation of <a href=""http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flying Nun</a>-- perhaps the most important independent label in the country’s history-- and last year their influence was recognized via induction into the New Zealand Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It’s odd, then, that for decades after their 1980 demise, their music was represented primarily by a record they didn’t even like. That’s because the production on their sole, self-titled album (issued on major label WEA) buffed the edges off their melodic but raucous post-punk.</p>
<p>Flying Nun rectified that a bit in 2005 by reissuing a newly-mixed version of <i>Toy Love</i>, adding singles and demos in a 2xCD package called <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Toy-Love-Cuts/release/446818"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cuts</i></a>. But for anyone curious about the band’s reputation as a vital, high-wire garage act, now is truly the time to dive in. A few months ago, Goner issued <i>Live at the Gluepot</i>, a ripping double LP of recordings from the band’s final shows. And now Captured Tracks, as part of its new<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49042-captured-tracks-and-flying-nun-partner-for-expansive-reissue-series/""> reissue program</a> with Flying Nun, has compiled two discs’ worth of singles and demos under the name <i>Toy Love</i> (a slightly confusing move, since the original self-titled album is not included).</p>
<p>Of the two, <i>Live at the Gluepot</i> is more immediately impressive, just in terms of sheer speed and momentum. Amazingly, Toy Love played nearly 500 shows in their brief existence, and here that experience is loudly obvious. Each of the record’s 25 short, sharp songs flies by so quickly you might find have trouble remembering any single one. But that’s likely the point--- Toy Love doesn’t sound interested in finding perfectly-crafted melodies, but in cranking out tightly-wound tunes with as much snarling energy and coursing blood as possible. That head-down approach is reflected in the between-song banter of singer Chris Knox. His wry intros-- “this next one we found on a back of a chewing gum wrapper in 1939”-- suggest the music should be taken just seriously enough to enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Toy Love did bury some memorable gems inside their quick-shot post-punk, and that’s clearer on Captured Tracks’ compilation. Punchy tunes like the winding “Squeeze”, the rising stomp “Sheep”, and the swaying “Swimming Pool” (in which Knox oddly parodies Bob Dylan’s nasal croon) all rival the best of contemporaries like the Buzzcocks and the Undertones. I’m most partial to “Amputee Song”, an anthem for the limbless that predicts both the organ-driven garage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a> and the weird monster tales of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4392-tall-dwarfs/"">Tall Dwarfs</a>, the equally-vital act that Knox and guitarist Alec Bathgate went on to form. It also highlights Toy Love’s unique combination of bold enthusiasm and dark humor-- it’s hard to imagine anyone besides Knox making a nihilistic chorus like “We don’t exist!” sound so exultant.</p>
<p>Enthused humor has been a Knox/Bathgate trademark since the days of their first group the Enemy, from which Toy Love was spawned. And Knox has valiantly maintained that attitude since suffering a stroke in 2009. Many artists rallied around him after that tragic event, creating a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13859-stroke-songs-for-chris-knox/"">tribute compilation </a>and rekindling interest in his great body of work. Hopefully this pair of Toy Love releases will do the same, but you don’t have to know who Chris Knox is to appreciate <i>Toy Love</i> and <i>Live at the Gluepot</i>. All you really need is a pair of working ears.<b><br/></b></p></div>"|17724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17724-toy-love-toy-love/|7.7|Marc Masters

<p>Flying Nun rectified that a bit in 2005 by reissuing a newly-mixed version of <i>Toy Love</i>, adding singles and demos in a 2xCD package called <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Toy-Love-Cuts/release/446818"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cuts</i></a>. But for anyone curious about the band’s reputation as a vital, high-wire garage act, now is truly the time to dive in. A few months ago, Goner issued <i>Live at the Gluepot</i>, a ripping double LP of recordings from the band’s final shows. And now Captured Tracks, as part of its new<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49042-captured-tracks-and-flying-nun-partner-for-expansive-reissue-series/""> reissue program</a> with Flying Nun, has compiled two discs’ worth of singles and demos under the name <i>Toy Love</i> (a slightly confusing move, since the original self-titled album is not included).</p>
<p>Of the two, <i>Live at the Gluepot</i> is more immediately impressive, just in terms of sheer speed and momentum. Amazingly, Toy Love played nearly 500 shows in their brief existence, and here that experience is loudly obvious. Each of the record’s 25 short, sharp songs flies by so quickly you might find have trouble remembering any single one. But that’s likely the point--- Toy Love doesn’t sound interested in finding perfectly-crafted melodies, but in cranking out tightly-wound tunes with as much snarling energy and coursing blood as possible. That head-down approach is reflected in the between-song banter of singer Chris Knox. His wry intros-- “this next one we found on a back of a chewing gum wrapper in 1939”-- suggest the music should be taken just seriously enough to enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Toy Love did bury some memorable gems inside their quick-shot post-punk, and that’s clearer on Captured Tracks’ compilation. Punchy tunes like the winding “Squeeze”, the rising stomp “Sheep”, and the swaying “Swimming Pool” (in which Knox oddly parodies Bob Dylan’s nasal croon) all rival the best of contemporaries like the Buzzcocks and the Undertones. I’m most partial to “Amputee Song”, an anthem for the limbless that predicts both the organ-driven garage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a> and the weird monster tales of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4392-tall-dwarfs/"">Tall Dwarfs</a>, the equally-vital act that Knox and guitarist Alec Bathgate went on to form. It also highlights Toy Love’s unique combination of bold enthusiasm and dark humor-- it’s hard to imagine anyone besides Knox making a nihilistic chorus like “We don’t exist!” sound so exultant.</p>
<p>Enthused humor has been a Knox/Bathgate trademark since the days of their first group the Enemy, from which Toy Love was spawned. And Knox has valiantly maintained that attitude since suffering a stroke in 2009. Many artists rallied around him after that tragic event, creating a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13859-stroke-songs-for-chris-knox/"">tribute compilation </a>and rekindling interest in his great body of work. Hopefully this pair of Toy Love releases will do the same, but you don’t have to know who Chris Knox is to appreciate <i>Toy Love</i> and <i>Live at the Gluepot</i>. All you really need is a pair of working ears.<b><br/></b></p></div>"|17724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17724-toy-love-toy-love/|7.9|Marc Masters

I just didn't expect it to happen so soon for the Men. Over the course of two quick-succession albums, 2011's <i>Leave Home</i> and last year's <i>Open Your Heart</i>, the Brooklyn bruisers' primordial post-hardcore roar had exploded into a constellation of possibilities, exploring everything from krautrock to country to shoegazed psychedelia. But the Men that hit the road in early 2012 to promote <i>Open Your Heart</i> were already a different band than the one documented on that record. Their once-unwieldy noise was being harnessed into a more economical drive and harmonicas were being blown. A band that less than two years ago sounded like descendents of Big Black had already found their way to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_from_Big_Pink"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Pink</a>.</p>
<p>This is the Men that greet us on <i>New Moon</i>-- recorded, natch, in a cabin in the Catskills. And what gracious hosts they've become, welcoming us in with the gentle, piano-tapped lullaby ""Open the Door"". Even when you take the band's rapid-fire maturation into account, the song still startles with its angelic harmonies, peaceful images of ""trees swaying,"" and general air of bonhomie. But if the opener seemingly announces a break from the band's formative inspirations, <i>New Moon</i> as a whole reinforces their spiritual connection to them. In hindsight, 1980s indie rock wasn't so much an antidote to the preceding generation's dinosaur rock as a tough-love corrective measure to revitalize it, from the Minutmen’s CCR/BOC boosterism to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a>'s sand-blasted take on the Byrds. What the Men ultimately share with their SST forbears isn't a sound but a work ethic, with a record-release output that can barely keep pace with their artistic progression, fuelled by a blatant disregard for the punks they're bound to piss off along the way. </p>
<p>But as <i>New Moon</i> proves, there's a big difference between respecting tradition and being boring, between quieting down and going soft, between being earnest and being sappy.  The album's more rustic first side may exhibit their newly professed fondness for Tom Petty, but the spirit is still a lot closer to Johnny Thunders' Heartbreakers. Acoustic guitars are front and center, but they slash and scrape rather than soothe; the early double shot of ""Half Angel Half Light"" and ""Without a Face"" suggests <i>Full Moon Fever</i> had Jeff Lynne been ousted from the producer's chair and replaced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_(producer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Spot</a>. What initially impresses about the record is not just that the Men have reconciled their growing affinity for delicate, confessional songcraft with their usual raw frayed-nerve energy, but how easy they make it look. </p>
<p>That's not to say there weren’t some growing pains along the way: Shortly after the release of <i>Open Your Heart</i>, the band excommunicated bassist Chris Hansell, the guy responsible for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VKsjmFD-bk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the most unforgivably caustic, phlegm-splatterd songs in the repertoire</a>. A recent <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-02-27/music/the-ascent-of-men/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Village Voice</i> cover story</a> claims Hansell was shown the door because he couldn’t afford to keep up with the band's growing tour commitments, however, his scuzz-punk regressions were increasingly at odds with the Men's ever-evolving aesthetic. And playing a big hand in that development was the band's go-to producer Ben Greenberg, who was not just promoted to replace Hansell, but immediately placed on equal singing and songwriting footing with founding members Mark Perro and Nick Chiericozzi. To say he fits right in would be an understatement; his two standout turns-- ""The Brass"" and the urgent ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_37bssHkE8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Repulsion</a>""<b> </b>redux ""I See No One""-- respectively push the paint-peeling power-pop of <i>Open Your Heart</i> further into the red and into the rough. (The band's ranks have also expanded to include new fifth member Kevin Faulker, to satisfy their surging demand for lap-steel.)</p>
<p>In contrast to <i>Open Your Heart</i>'s exploratory eclecticism, <i>New Moon</i> unabashedly plays to the extremities of the Men's sound. But the album counts as the band's most cohesive statement yet, thanks to savvy sequencing that gradually amps up the volume and ramps up the velocity. You can even hear the precise moment the band snaps in the middle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14987-the-men-i-saw-her-face/"" target=""_blank"">""I Saw Her Face""</a>, when the song suddenly up-shifts from a sad-eyed, ""Cortez""-killing dirge into a ferocious, full-torque rave-up, blazing the trail for the album's decidedly more raucous second act.</p>
<p>But where <i>Open Your Heart</i>'s stylstic diversity sometimes felt like genre tourism for the sake of it (the country song was actually called ""Country Song"", after all), <i>New Moon</i>'s sonic dichotomies are emblematic of a deeper emotional distress. No matter which of the band's three frontmen are singing them, the Men's songs are pretty simple: someone's usually missing someone who's far away, or dreaming of a better place,<b> </b>and there's often alcohol involved. But over the whole of <i>New Moon</i>, you get the sense the Men are coming to grips with the men they want to be (loving, upstanding, domesticated) and the kind of men they have to be-- i.e., the sort of hardened souls that must spend most of their year in vans and dives in order to survive. As the album flames out in the psych-punk apocalypse of ""Supermoon"", the moment as is as poignant as it potent: Like the retired hitman in countless gangster movies who gets pulled in for one last hit, <i>New Moon</i> bristles with all the internal tension of a dormant beast that, try as it may, can't ever be fully tamed. <i>Open Your Heart</i> was the sound of the Men issuing themselves a challenge-- ""I wanna see you write a love song!"" Perro exclaimed on the opening track. <i>New Moon</i> follows through on that promise but inevitably discovers that, when you do open your heart, blood gets spilled.</p></div>"|17668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17668-the-men-new-moon/|8.2|Stuart Berman

And up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4850-planningtorock/"" target=""_blank"">Planningtorock</a> went, at least in title; yet ""Misogyny Drop Dead"" is a far subtler affair than its 2012 counterpart. It matches that song's brittle percussion, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">Knife</a>-y synths, and androgynous vocal, but adds a blunt lyric (""Misogyny, drop dead and dump the script… 2013, our time is ahead"") and some funk on the verses. Rostron's vocal skirts and thrusts around the beat to almost playful effect, somewhat like Merrill Garbus of tUnE-yArDs in her more reggae-influenced mode. The production makes it seem as though misogyny hasn't got a chance.</p>
<p>""Misogyny Drop Dead"" marks a thematic change from 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15498-w/"" target=""_blank""><i>W</i></a>: Back then, Rostron <a href=""http://www.catch-fire.com/2011/05/interview-janine-ronstron-aka-planningtorock-about-her-politics-of-self-extension/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> she was ""never interested in writing literal lyrics"" about feminist theory. There's not enough material here to tell whether it's a one-off (well, two one-offs) or the start of more overtly political work, but what's here is compelling enough to make it seem a viable direction. The song leads a 12'' single, with a remix by Pursuit Grooves that makes the original even twitchier, the instrumental interlude ""Agender"", and ""Public Love"", an eight-minute call to arms beat that constantly threatens to crumple in on itself, a sample that sounds like a baritone sax played through a loudspeaker, and the rallying cry, ""public love is back!"" ""P-U-B-L-I-C!"", she cries halfway through.</p>
<p>Everything's kind of spelled out like that, making literal what was previously assumed in Planningtorock's work. As a result there's little here as suddenly striking as, say, the lyrical knives-in-the-back throughout <i>W</i>'s ""I am Your Man""-- but perhaps that's the point. It can be liberating to be this unsubtle. In the <a href=""http://vimeo.com/59651338"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for ""Misogyny Drop Dead"", Rostron's face is hidden-- standard for Planningtorock-- behind quick cuts and dark lighting. But look closely at the grotesque mouth and you'll see a grin, and study Rostron's movements and you'll realize they seem a lot like dancing. ""You've got the power to prove,"" Rostron sings at the end of the track. Celebration's as powerful proof as any.</p></div>"|17769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17769-planningtorock-misogyny-drop-dead-ep/|6.5|Katherine St. Asaph

If you take in a few plot points-- say, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16247-man-with-potential/""><i>Man with Potential</i></a>, followed by 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17401-pro-style-ep/""><i>Pro Style</i></a>, and then this new EP for <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a>/<a href=""http://www.softwarelabel.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software</a>-- it feels like you're simultaneously witnessing a refinement of his vision and the gradual destruction of his core aesthetic. In a 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8718-closing-the-books/2/"">interview</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/"">the Out Door</a>, Swanson discussed how he was often bugged about krautrock and electronic influences on his former band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4714-yellow-swans/"">Yellow Swans</a>, and how the duo's early experiments were born out of ""not being satisfied with what generally existed"" in those styles. That sense of dissatisfaction has continued on the beat-heavy output under his own name, taking a scorched earth policy toward EDM that gleefully pulls out all the ugly innards of the genre.</p>
<p><i>Punk Authority</i>, the latest in a string of wittily titled releases from Swanson, pulls everything into a bigger, fuller, more expansive framework. The title conveys confidence, even if it is some private, unexplained joke, and it's a feeling matched in the music. Here, everything is pushed up into the red. Even less cluttered moments, such as the clock-ticking beats that form an intro to the title track, are in the throes of deterioration, lost in an attempt to bend everything toward breaking point. At times there's only a tiny semblance of order peaking through the debris, but it's always there, just about keeping everything together. Still, it's hard not to think of this as some kind of end game that Swanson has been careering toward, especially when that title track is shunted into a pure whiteout phase that makes it hard to focus on anything other than the unholy shitstorm spewing out of your speakers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Punk Authority</i> is only concerned with the present, not the future or the past. This is Swanson finding a new type of delirium and wallowing in it, letting it expand and contract over four tracks that begin in unadulterated mania and never look back. It's obtrusive, even obnoxious at times. The first lick of noise from ""C.O.P."" feels like a bratty kid spitting in your eye and lifting your wallet from your pocket while you're still comprehending what happened. The bleepy motif strung throughout that track is the closest anything here gets to having a solid link to dance music, ultimately coming off like a version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2581-lfo/"">LFO</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3og0oFiDO3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freak""</a> stretched out on a torture rack. There's something cleansing about returning for repeat plays, a sense of Swanson purging some unidentified horrors from his life. The silence that settles in at the end of the EP resembles the pause in time needed when comprehending a piece of really bad news.</p>
<p>The track that precedes that silence, the 13-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14752-life-ends-at-30/"">""Life Ends at 30""</a>, is Swanson's wildest statement yet, a berserk piece of man vs. machine noise that's as bruising as it is euphoric. It's a dense work, plagued by a million tangential thoughts all piled up on top of one another, creating a sense of claustrophobia that never lets up. The term ""nosebleed techno"" has already been coined to define a sub-genre of hardcore, which is too bad; it would be the perfect ugly descriptor to hang around the neck of most of the material here. ""Life Ends at 30"" is a great example of Swanson’s ability to gain a form of lunatic momentum that positions him right on the brink of chaos. He doesn’t appear interested in total formlessness, instead reaching a place that gets as close as he can to all-out loss of control then just about pulling back. Getting there is a thrilling white-knuckle ride, like peering over the ledge for 30 minutes but never jumping off.</p></div>"|17706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17706-pete-swanson-punk-authority-ep/|7.5|Nick Neyland

The two met when they both joined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2842-bob-mould/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Mould</a>'s touring band (Morel and the ex-<span>Hüsker</span> host a monthly DJ night in D.C.). The stylistic gap between a post-punk legend like Canty and a song-and-dance man like Morel might seem a bridge too far, but Canty and Morel's pedigrees, impressive as they are, don't really loom all that large on <i>Deathfix</i>, their <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31128-deathfix/"" target=""_blank"">new band</a>'s self-titled debut. Canty and Morel bonded over a love of shaggy 1970s rock, and there's plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"" target=""_blank"">Big Star</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>'s influence to be found on <i>Deathfix</i>, cut with swampy grunge, post-rock, and a touch of funk. So many new bands from established artists hinge on the tension between the two styles, but there's not much tension of any kind to be found on the surprisingly loose-limbed <i>Deathfix</i>. Unmoored from expectation, uninterested in rehashing past glories, Canty and Morel make for the basement, looking to make a racket all their own.</p>
<p>Opener ""Better Than Bad"" practically swings an arm out the window and asks if you need a lift. The glam-spangled, sweet-as-Raspberries power-popper seems to be at least 90% hook, its ribbony lead guitars driving the song's melody off into the night. ""Low Lying Dreams"" introduces the first of several unseemly characters, as Morel's Mark Lanegan-worthy leer gives way to a sweeping eastern-tinged crescendo. Faraquet's Devin Ocampo and Medications' Mark Cisneros joined Canty and Morel in the studio, fleshing out their demos with bits of their own, and the results are remarkably fluid, never showboaty, perpetually locked-in.</p>
<p>Most of Deathfix's lyrics concern themselves with the down-and-out. Characters sidestep sobriety, idolize wantonly, die in depressing fashions. Take ""Hospital"", which flits between the mania of a fever-dream (""the patients are turning red"") to a young girl, a do-not-resuscitate order, and a patient's bed with a regrettably high turnover. Morel and Canty won't paint you a portrait, exactly, but there's enough detail in these thumbnail sketches to suggest a very real (and very troubled) cast of characters hanging in the shadows of these songs. Until ""Dali's House"", that is.</p>
<p>""Dali's House"" is a goof; that's the only explanation. Riding a stock funk groove with a distinct jam band lean to it, ""Dali's"" finds our speak-singing narrator wishing he himself could house a loose gathering of cool kids from the annals of history: Jane Birkin, Muhammed Ali, Mr. Dali himself. If some guy wryly intoning a who's who over a locked groove sounds a little familiar, that's because it's supposed to: ""I wish I was James Murphy's house,"" Morel notes, ""because you can steal ideas, and Daft Punk's always playing there."" It's kind of a rimshot in search of a punchline, but there's just a hint of acid in the delivery that makes it awfully hard to conclusively figure for a burn or a tongue-in-cheek tribute. Considering how quickly the song devolves into silliness-- ""I wish I was the guy from House's house""-- we'll go with the latter. But while the first DJ to fake-out an LCD-expectant crowd with ""Dali's House"" is a hero in waiting, essentially it's just one of those jokes that gets less funny every time you hear it.</p>
<p><i>Deathfix</i> quickly recovers with ""Playboy"", which charts a surprisingly nimble path between tricky jazz rock chords and starry-eyed, lighter-flicking balladry. But the snarl of its guitars can't keep the slow-burning ""Mind Control"" from getting a bit bogged down in its own murk. There's no shortage of dynamism in Deathfix's arrangements, a lot of little parts sliding past the periphery. But the strange paths some of these songs travel to get to their eventual crescendos occasionally gets them stuck in one place, or one mood, for too long. Penultimate track ""Mind Control"" gradually builds to a window-shaking post-rock climax, but it takes eight minutes and a false ending to get there. <i>Deathfix</i> gets its expansive, laid-back feel from the relaxed conditions under which it came together, but that's also the source of its occasional directionlessness and the fuck-around vibe of ""Dali"". The approach gives Deathfix a certain slightness that may rankle fans of either of its principals' more serious work. It's hard to imagine that bothering Morel and Canty much, though; they're clearly having way too much fun.</p></div>"|17809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17809-deathfix-deathfix/|6.4|Paul Thompson

Around the turn of the century, serious-minded pop scholars were telling us that listeners would stop caring about compendiums of songs with pre-designed tracklists and conceptual underpinnings. The online world was supposed to free us from the tyranny of 50-minute bulks of music. We would now only be concerned with gloriously succinct, stand-alone tunes. But that hasn't happened. There's still an expectation that makers of songs need to group them together into LPs and EPs at some point, even if those songs wind up suffering in the process.</p>
<p>One band that doesn't benefit from the album format is Glaswegian indie pop trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30916-golden-grrrls/"" target=""_blank"">Golden Grrrls</a>. The band's full-length debut comes after a series of 7-inch and cassette-only releases that presented Golden Grrrls' modest, pared-down charms in appropriately modest, pared-down packages. As guitarist Ruari MacLean acknowledged in a <a href=""http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/introducing-golden-grrrls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2012 interview</a>, Golden Grrrls derive their sound from ""classic American indie stuff"" and ""also a lot of Flying Nun/Kiwi pop stuff."" That much is obvious from a cursory listen to<i> Golden Grrrls</i>, which is built on MacLean's buzzed-up riffs and flat, deadpan monotone playing off the surprisingly intricate (but always novice-level simple) instrumentation and backing vocals supplied by guitarist Rachel Aggs and drummer Eilidh Rodgers.</p>
<p>When heard in two or three-song bunches, <i>Golden Grrrls</i> sounds great; opening track ""New Pop"" is 110 seconds of chest-bursting guitars and charming boy-girl vocals giggling and making eyes at each other. The next song ""Past Tense"" offers more of the same: a chirpy melody, slipshod rhythms, low-key (and off-key) harmonies. By the third track ""Paul Simon"" (the legendary singer-songwriter is surely referenced for his jangly, pre-<i>Bridge Over Troubled Water </i>Simon &amp; Garfunkel hits, not his more adult-oriented solo material) the formula has already been strongly reiterated and not at all elaborated upon.</p>
<p>If <i>Golden Grrrls </i>had ended there, it would've been another pleasurably slight and bite-sized entry in the band's discography. But even though the next eight songs only last about 20 minutes, the rest of <i>Golden Grrrls </i>feels much longer. There are some good songs here: ""Think of the Ways"" is a delicate beauty, and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14616-weve-got/"" target=""_blank"">We've Got…</a>"" brings the record to a reliably breezy conclusion. But Golden Grrrls was born to make 7-inches; this band needs to say its peace and leave, not linger while the buzz wears off. The bursts of bright energy and amateurish enthusiasm on <i>Golden Grrrls </i>shine on wondrously for several minutes, but after a while the limitations of stunted musicianship and repetitive songwriting take over.

On the surface, it was a modest record-- 11 lo-fi acoustic songs written and recorded in the span of a week while snowed in at her parents' neighborless Alabama home near the body of water from which the project takes its name. Chronicling missed connections and cell phones smashed in moments of frustration, it was an album-length meditation on the modern allure of going off the grid (the first song was called ""Catfish"", but it wasn't about <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=catfish"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that</a>). But what gutted you was a voice that cut through the murk like infomercial shower cleaner. Crutchfield sang frankly (""I think I love you, but you'll never find out"") and without inhibition, as if she desperately wanted but didn't expect to be heard.</p>
<p><i>Cerulean Salt</i>, Crutchfield's new album, <i>is</i> going to be heard. But from its opening moments, you get the sense that she's ready for it, the newfound assurance, steadiness, and clarity of her voice immediately obvious. ""We are late, we are loud, we remain connected as you're reading out loud,"" she sings on the smolderingly evocative opener, ""Hollow Bedroom"". Like <i>American Weekend</i>, it begins with just a guitar and a voice, though this time the instrument's plugged in and the recording sounds more professional. (It was still recorded at home, this time in the Philadelphia house she shares with her sister and bandmates.) But it's no less intimate-- if anything, the clean recording only brings you in tighter. Crutchfield's voice rises to be heard over the distortion that kicks in during the song's final minute. ""And I don't believe that I care at all,"" she sings with quiet defiance. ""What they hear through these walls.""</p>
<p>Since her early teens, Crutchfield has been a precocious, prolific songwriter, and now that she's in her early 20s, she's already a veteran of a number of short-lived projects: an early solo act called King Everything, plus a few melodic punk bands she played in with her twin sister, Swearin' frontwoman Allison, including Bad Banana, the Ackleys, and P.S. Eliot. Crutchfield hails from Alabama-- a fact that's stamped all over her voice's twangy swagger-- but her songs have a drifter's perspective that suggest that, in a sense, she's also come from everywhere. Her music is partially about being young and on the road, what happens in those rare cases when teenage wanderlust is not a suburban daydream, but an everyday reality.</p>
<p><i>Cerulean Salt</i> is full of vagrant wisdom and people who might once have hitchhiked across the country but were born into a moment when they could just join a punk band instead. They crash on shitty group house floors, cram their gear and bodies into vans with questionable, unexplained ""blood on the back seat,"" and shirk from commitment whenever feelings are anything more than fleeting.  ""I'll try to embrace the lows,"" she sings on ""Coast to Coast"", a song whose buoyant static makes the most of her new band members (Kyle Gilbride and Keith Spencer from Swearin' add bass and drums). </p>
<p>Crutchfield has a way of delivering a line so casually that it takes a half-dozen listens to fully realize how devastating it is. ""I had a dream last night, we had hit separate bottoms,"" she sings, a brilliant, crushing line hidden in the middle of the gently strummed ""Lively"". Her songs paint scenes in quick, deft strokes thanks to her knack for knowing exactly which physical details will carry emotional resonance. There's something almost unbearably poignant about the wedding reception she describes where ""make-up sets on [the bride's] face like tar"" and ""the champagne flutes poorly engineered, employ dixie cups and jars.""</p>
<p>Marriage, tradition, and lineage are all sources of great anxiety in a Waxahatchee song. There was a track on <i>American Weekend</i> about a grandmother, with the repeated refrain, ""You got married when you were 15,"" uttered with disbelief, as though Crutchfield were trying to imagine how different her own life would be had the same been true for her. These themes are explored in more depth on <i>Cerulean Salt</i>; in ""Swan Dive"" she confesses that ""dreams about loveless marriage and regret"" keep her up at night, while she presents a peer's wedding as more of a ""tragic epilogue"" than a celebration on ""Dixie Cups and Jars"" (which feels like a slightly more harrowing take on Built to Spill's ""Twin Falls""). ""You’ll remain,"" she says to her, ""I will find a way to leave gracefully, or I'll escape."" Where she'll go isn't clear, but it's these free-floating desires and unanswered questions that give Crutchfield's songs their haunting power.</p>
<p>""This place is vile, and I'm vile too,"" Crutchfield howls on the stunning closer, ""You're Damaged"". In the hands of a lesser singer, a line like that might feel too exposed. But Crutchfield's characters can't help but be exactly who they say they are: they're catfish in a <i>Catfish</i> world. And as they squirm, flop, and clumsily make their way through their lives, their specific experiences become something universal. ""For me, the only way to write lyrics is not to think about other people at all,"" Crutchfield said in a recent interview. ""You just have to write stuff for you and only you, and not worry about how people are going to take it. It'll be inevitably relatable because it's true to you."" It’s that blazingly honest, hyper-personal quality that places <i>Cerulean Salt</i> in the tradition of Elliott Smith, early Cat Power, or Liz Phair's free-flowing <i>Girlysound</i> tapes-- the work of a songwriter skilled enough to make introspection seem not self-centered, but generous.</p></div>"|17688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/|8.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Surfacing in 2012, the project followed just about every unwritten rule in the up-and-coming, home-schooled electronic producer playbook. The <a href=""http://misterlies.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-neighbors-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Hidden Neighbors</i> EP</a>-- a seductive, downtempo affair informed by strains of subterranean, laptop-engineered music from the UK-- was released under a cloak of anonymity. After revealing himself as Columbia College student Nick Zanca, a <a href=""http://misterlies.bandcamp.com/album/dionysian-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7""</a> and an <a href=""http://misterlies.bandcamp.com/album/mass-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""ambient gospel"" collaborative EP</a> with fellow Chicagoan <a href=""http://differentsleep.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Different Sleep</a> followed, though neither proved quite as compelling as his initial effort. And finally, last summer, Zanca holed himself up in a lakeside cabin in Vermont to record his first proper full-length, <a href=""http://misterlies.bandcamp.com/album/mowgli"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mowgli</i></a>. But despite the buzzworthy pretenses surrounding his debut, <i>Mowgli</i> feels refreshingly untethered to anything other than Zanca's own impulsive yet careful direction. Instead of becoming encumbered by its heavy reliance on mood and atmosphere, <i>Mowgli</i>'s patient nature makes room for some serpentine-like twists turns that often bear rich and strange fruits. Though the footing may not always be so sure, it's a record worth paying attention to thanks to it's reluctance to walk a too-familiar plank.</p>
<p>""My music has to do with imaginary things,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8818-mister-lies/"" target=""_blank"">Zanca told Pitchfork back in May</a>, and while <i>Mowgli</i> most certainly has a well-mapped root structure (he name-checked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, and ""1990s trip-hop"" in the same interview), it's so curious and elusive, you feel as if an <i>Inception</i>-style plundering of his daydreaming would be the only real way to unpack it, however subtle and simple its defining components might seem. Still, Zanca is most likely a lucid dreamer, as his knack for creating standalone sounds-- the almost uncomfortably sharp handclaps on opener ""Ashore"", percussive elements that sound as if they were secretly recorded in a decaying old apartment building on ""Dionysian""-- makes the album feel very much of this earth. But despite not being quite impervious to gravity, <i>Mowgli</i>'s ultimately an act of auditory hypnosis egged on by repetition and lush textures. A good number of these songs are landlocked by similar swaths of beatific fog, as familiar shapes remain a bit too blurred to really make out. But as Zanca lifts his various veils, these songs reveal themselves in unsettling, warm, or chaotic ways that feel shy, sexy, and more than a little scary, sometimes all at once. Though few records can really claim it as an asset, <i>Mowgli</i> invites return listens <i>because</i> it's so difficult to put your finger on.</p>
<p>Zanca's neatest trick on <i>Mowgli</i> is being able to emulsify opposing sounds in interesting ways, evoking a wide stretch of emotions over seemingly tiny soundscapes. Often times, it sounds like it's stuck between two different rooms, as the noise from either collides in ways that almost nauseate at first, but become harmoniously fractured as they slowly sync. ""Ashore"" feels like the work of a trendy, tweezer-wielding chef, plating various components just so until a huge wave of cotton-candy wrapped synth blows everything off the table. ""Align"" manages to juggle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>-like euphoria, a burly, wormy synth line and ghostly wails and still make sense of it all. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13975-dionysian/"" target=""_blank"">""Dionysian""</a> is both joyful and hellish, a headrush of a track that culminates in a cacophonous rage, blowing hot all the while. But not all of Zanca's creations are so cleverly caustic-- ""Ludlow"", named for the Vermont town where <i>Mowgli</i> was born, is funky, sultry, and comfort food-y in ways that make it fully apparent why Zanca chose to record there.</p>
<p>For someone not yet old enough to legally drink, Zanca is ahead of the game in a lot of respects, but it doesn't mean he's impervious to the same trappings that present themselves to every young musician, especially ones who make music as insular as Mister Lies does. Too often <i>Mowgli</i> feels like a series of exercises, its mantra-like repetitions eventually rendering themselves somewhat directionless. Other times, things simply don't pan out at all, like ""Canaan"", which features a poem that came straight from freshman AP English class, or the jittery <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14844-lupine/"" target=""_blank"">""Lupine""</a>, darting around like a sloppy game of racquetball. Over the course of a year, Zanca has proved himself to be a musician than can produce songs that are interesting and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13405-cleam/"" target=""_blank"">songs that are actually just plain great</a>, and in working to find that balance on <i>Mowgli</i>, we can see that while it's engaging to watch him try and synthesize these two halves of his personality, it also means that Mister Lies is a project that's still in need of fine tuning. There's little question that Zanca knows where he wants to go, it's now just a question of figuring out how he wants to get there.</p></div>"|17640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17640-mister-lies-mowgli/|6.6|Zach Kelly

She already seemed to know the answer: House, with its sensuous rhythmic patterns and lustrous textures, is commonly described as a music of feel, of thoughtless submission, but even in the moment of seduction the dancer can watch him or herself getting lost in the music, observe, and perhaps feels a bit uneasy at their easy sacrifice of a bit of their humanity in the name of communal hedonism. Perhaps this sense of double-awareness is what the music itself thinks about at night: you can hear it in A Tale of Us' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsamh1b764"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of Fuckpony's ""Bongo Porn"", the swirling delirium and compulsive jerking of the original ushered through unexpected minor-key passages of sadness, regret, even existential crisis, as if the groove is forever pivoting on that point where pornography might turn, almost imperceptibly, into a scene from Steve McQueen's <i>Shame</i>.</p>
<p>The ""Bongo Porn"" remix lays bare most brutally the vibe which Canadian house duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29353-art-department/"" target=""_blank"">Art Department</a> stalk on this DJ mix, their first for their record label No. 19 Music's flagship series, and an unashamed extension of the sounds and emotions they explored on their 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15361-the-drawing-board/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Drawing Board</i></a>. If, for the most part, <i>Social Experiment 003</i> scales slightly lesser heights than the peaks reached on their debut (the epic ""Vampire Nightclub"", the by turns creepy and bittersweet ""ICU""), it also avoids that record's tendency towards heavy-handed overstatement, preferring a ""show, don't tell"" aesthetic of minor key melodies and densely layered rhythmic patterns (rather than dolorous Ian Curtis vocals) to get across the duo's persistent themes of desire, obsession, self-disgust, and fear of abandonment.</p>
<p>The resulting sound feels neither modern nor particularly retro, although it's certainly arguable that the music's buffed up, high-gloss late night classicism resembles just a bit too strongly the kind of music that, say, Poker Flat label boss Steve Bug was playing nine years ago. Criticisms along these lines are true enough as far as they go, and Art Department will never win any awards for bravely conquering uncharted territory, but it would be unjust to ignore the dedication with which the duo strive to form a solid aesthetic around house's ambivalent hidden narrative of the dissolution of the self, going right back to Robert Owens' harrowing Chicago house classic ""Bring Down the Walls"". Fittingly (if somewhat obviously so) Owens offers guest vocals on two of the highlights here, starting with Art Department's own remix of Luca C. and Brigante's ""Tomorrow Can Wait"", all slithery <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> synth arpeggios and ceaseless house percussion over which Owens' anti-temporal hedonism emerges more as a quiet moan of dread. Jackin' Rabbit's ""Full of Dreams"" is even more existentially pregnant, using a bruised-sounding bassline and Owens' hypnotic murmurs to frame house music's escapism as a kind of prison of the mind.</p>
<p>Appropriately, Art Department's sequencing is patient, frequently letting individual choices spin well past the five minute mark so as to underscore the sensation that these grooves are webs to trap dancers in. This approach works less well on the weaker cuts, where the music seems to simply spin its wheels with a clean-edged and mildly trippy but emotionless panache (see Ali Love's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_lMQoX761g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of Brigante's ""The Jungle"", or Art Department, BLUD, and Shaun Reeves' ""Robot Heart""), but pays off in spades on the warm but steely tech-house of the two final tracks, Gregorythme's ""Artificial Tears"" and Art Department's own ""Insomniac"", each running for close to eight minutes and offering up their own driving repetition as the only stable reference left in a world lost to doubt and uncertainty. Keep dancing? You've got no other choices left.</p></div>"|17734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17734-art-department-social-experiment-003/|7.3|Tim Finney

She’s doing what most artists who became famous at a young age eventually do, which is to say that she’s rebelling against what made her famous. A darling of the British press before she was 20, Nash is no longer signed to a major label and instead crowd-funded her new album, <i>Girl Talk, </i>online. She traded her sundresses for a leather jacket, dyed her hair black with chunky white-blond streaks, and got a all-female band she’s dubbed “girl gang”. Nash co-wrote her first album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a>’s partner-in-crime Paul Epworth, worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/"" target=""_blank"">Suede</a> guitarist Bernard Butler on her second, and on her third, diverges wildly from the BRIT Awards-approved path initially predicted for her.</p>
<p>As was the case on Nash’s first two records, her neurotic tendencies rival that of George Costanza; so even when there is action, it feels like she’s overthinking things. But the music feels visceral, especially compared to 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10605-made-of-bricks/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made Of Bricks</i></a> and 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14136-my-best-friend-is-you/"" target=""_blank"">My Best Friend Is You</a>.</i> She’s mostly ditched the cutesy, Spektor-esque piano riffs of her debut and the acoustic strumming that defined both previous albums. She’s apparently taken up the bass, which drives songs like “Are You There Sweetheart?” and ""Death Proof” (yes, after the Tarantino film), and tried to make it sound rockabilly. She continues to mine throwback sounds, but now she seems as much inspired by Link Wray and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"" target=""_blank"">the Clash</a> as girl groups and Wall of Sound. On songs like “Sister”, her vocals are downright guttural, erupting a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2544-courtney-love/"" target=""_blank"">Courtney Love</a>’s during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"" target=""_blank"">Hole</a>’s heyday as Nash goes off the rails emotionally. She’s still all over the map when it comes to style but it mostly works on <i>Girl Talk</i>, with the exception of the clunky melody of “Labyrinth” and the out-of-place orchestra that closes the album with a <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> soundtrack vibe.</p>
<p>Nash was one of those artists who broke on Myspace, but now she’s repping hard for the Tumblr feminists, the type of girls who read Camille Paglia and identify with riot grrrl but reblog photos of Kurt Cobain and dip-dyed hairdos. Everything about <i>Girl Talk</i> screams “take me seriously,” yet even by her own admittance on opening track “Part Heart,” Nash still searches for temporary happiness in an Essie bottle. These certainly aren’t mutually exclusive ideas within the context of feminism in the year 2013, but it feels like a fine line to walk. That said, some young, mainstream female singer needs to stand up for this stuff. Katy Perry decries the word “feminist” while Lady Gaga defends it to death, but what about the relatable artists? Nash has always been a favorite among girls who feel like they never get the guy; if her greatest accomplishment is that her girl-power superhero act rubs off on them, it’s far from the worst thing. “You have a problem with me ‘cause I'm a girl, I'm a feminist/ And if that offends you, then fuck you,” Nash screams on “All Talk”. It’s the kind of stuff that haunts dudes, like being called “creepy.” When she was a teenager, the best dig Nash could come up with was to call a guy a dickhead or say that his friends are “much fitter,” but with age has come an ability to sling insults that aren’t so surface-level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nash’s lyrics can come off slightly Gender Studies 101, like knee-jerk reactions from someone who’s probably been called a bitch by boys a few times. “You’re trying to tell me sexism doesn’t exist/ If it doesn’t exist, then what the fuck is this?/ How many boys will it destroy?/ How many girls and boys will it annoy?”, Nash raps (you heard me) on “Rap for Rejection”. On the same song, she bemoans the fact that music magazines-- where she finds “real cool bands”-- are kept near men’s mags on the newsstand. It’s a little preachy and confessional, but there’s truth in most of what Nash sings about on <i>Girl Talk</i>, at least for the ladies in the room who are still figuring out how to be capital-A adults. And really, at this point, it’s hard to imagine that isn’t Kate Nash’s main fanbase.</p></div>"|17787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17787-kate-nash-girl-talk/|6.4|Jillian Mapes

This cohort was best represented on the 2010 compilation <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14022-pvi006ibb004/"">PVI0006/IBB004</a></i>, jointly released by artist-run labels Paradise Vendors and Italian Beach Babes. As that generic title implies, the scene was more about inter-band camaraderie than a specific sound-- more about sharing split releases and trading links than hiring publicists or branding themselves. So it's no shock that no movement ever came from it; in fact, a few of the bands don't even exist anymore. But others-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28096-male-bonding/"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28155-cold-pumas/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Pumas</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28253-thee-fair-ohs/"" target=""_blank"">Fair Ohs</a>-- have gone on to make more substantial work on their own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At the head of that surviving class sits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28169-mazes/"" target=""_blank"">Mazes</a>, thanks to the leap they've taken with their second album, <i>Ores &amp; Minerals</i>. Its predecessor, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15228-a-thousand-heys/""><i>A Thousand Heys</i><span>,</span></a> was a solid take on 90s American indie, but a bit too beholden to its influences. <i>Ores &amp; Minerals</i> fixes that and adds a lot more. Singer/guitarist Jack Cooper <a href=""http://www.alternativejukebox.com/2013/02/mazes-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>claims</span></a> he wanted to make a record ""that wasn't influenced by anything but influenced by everything,"" and his trio has achieved that seemingly paradoxical goal. You can still hear traces of other bands here, but Mazes' sound now is more an idiosyncratic hybrid than an enthusiastic photocopy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's perhaps due to how the trio wrote their songs this time. Many began as loops rather than melodies, resulting in immediate hooks that gradually extend into something longer-lasting. The effect is clear from the very first track, ""Bodies"", which morphs from a simple indie pop tune into a hypnotic twin-guitar jam. It evokes similar journeys by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"" target=""_blank"">Television</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"" target=""_blank"">the Feelies</a>, not in exact sound but in feel-- that is, in the way its seven minutes of blissful music would still be effective at twice the length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The template set by ""Bodies"" is furthered by the krautrocky title track and the mesmerizing ""Skulking"", which ramps into a crescendo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>-like fuzz. In between those expansive pieces lies a wealth of sonic variety. There's the slow sway of ""Dan Higgs Particle"", the proggy, Malkmus-esque lope of ""Sucker Punched"", and even an eerie piano piece called ""Leominster"". Mazes fuse those styles by sheer force of personality-- each tune bears their own thoughtful approach first and influences second.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It also helps that Cooper keeps the words to a minimum. Many of his lyrics on </span><i>A Thousand Heys </i><span>comprised long sentences spooled out in a breathless, sometimes rambling rush. But here he sticks mostly to short phrases with lots of pauses in between. The tactic gives the album a haiku-ish feel, with Cooper exploring his subjects--- relationships, divorces, aging-- in terms that are openly universal rather than limitingly specific.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is one moment on </span><span><i>Ores &amp; Minerals</i> </span><span>that could be about something particular. Halfway through the title track, Cooper sings about ""looking in, looking out on a scene that's distorted/ Liking things, friend it, report it/ You're contorted.""

After exiting Interscope, he gave 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11503-the-slip/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Slip </i></a>away, something he'd done a year earlier with his Saul Williams collaboration. Reznor turned the release of the expansive collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghosts I-IV</i></a> into a series of referendums regarding the future of open-source content, the power of filesharing, and the potential for new models of physical record releases. How many more two-hour-long collections of instrumentals earn <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/arts/music/04nine.html?ref=business&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their own stories in <i>The New York Times</i>?</a></p>
<p>In February, Reznor and Nine Inch Nails again returned to the headlines. Less than four years after putting the project on hold and disavowing the road, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49681-trent-reznor-announces-the-return-of-nine-inch-nails-extensive-touring-for-2013-and-2014/"" target=""_blank"">Reznor proclaimed</a> that Nine Inch Nails was ""reinventing itself from scratch,"" employing new members for the stage and perhaps the studio. This year, according to Reznor, the band will make a run through America's arenas; next year, they will head to Europe. Perhaps the timing was mere coincidence, but appended to the end of most every story exalting the resurrection was notice that, in only two or so weeks, Reznor would release the debut LP from the band he started when Nine Inch Nails stopped, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28841-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">How to destroy angels_</a>. That project, those pieces duly noted, is a collaboration with his wife, singer Mariqueen Maandig, Reznor cohort Atticus Ross and visual artist Rob Sheridan. These angles are the dreams in which publicist handbooks must come embossed.</p>
<p>Well, maybe not: <i>Welcome Oblivion</i>-- the 13-track, one-hour collection from How to destroy angels_-- isn’t the sort of record that will reinvigorate the latent devotion of Nine Inch Nails fans or, for that matter, recruit new faithful. <i>Welcome Oblivion</i> mostly maintains the elliptical electronic approach of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17297-an-omen-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>An Omen EP_</i></a>, repurposing three of its songs and expanding on that short disc's mix of soft industrialisms, acoustic exotica, and instrumental expanses by simply doubling the number of tracks. At its best, <i>Welcome Oblivion</i> is undecided and unfocused, with moments of intrigue scattered through songs that wander on an album that rambles. At its worst, <i>Welcome Oblivion </i>is passé and redundant, suggesting recent successes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a>, and a litany of others without improving upon them. All the hype, Coachella live debuts, and fortuitous timing in the world can't mitigate the feeling that, at last, Reznor's work has been bested by that of the relative youth he might've inspired.</p>
<p><i>Welcome Oblivion</i> at least starts strong: The blistering glow of opener ""The Wake-Up"" balances a deep throb with melodic chirps and Maandig's expertly crisscrossed vocals. She spends the back half of the 100-second song working through a series of reversed and reordered syllables, eventually arriving at the beckoning question of ""Is anybody listening?"" Yes, actually: This auspicious introduction perfectly pits the band's power against the singer's poise.</p>
<p>But that union doesn't last long. Maandig often sings like a stand-in, with her pleasant voice politely holding the place for something greater. In the verses of the title track, for example, she shouts from behind a digital scrim, her voiced barbed and warped, much like Reznor in Nine Inch Nails. When the chorus arrives, though, she eases from the theatrics, settling into a coo that ruins the clamor. It's hard not to imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Sleigh Bells</a>' Alexis Krauss ripping through the same role with delight. ""How Long?"" leans toward sex and drama, with a ricocheting beat and icy keyboard line offering danger and seduction. Maandig tries to play the part, but the coquettish winks in the chorus feel like a game of childish dress-up. Despite a sudden volume boost, the Auto-Tuned chorus is diminutive and dismissible. At least it puts the imagination to work: How would <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Vernon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> handle this mechanical motion, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9507-karin-dreijer-andersson/"" target=""_blank"">Karin Dreijer Andersson</a>?</p>
<p>These problems aren't Maandig's alone. Rather, they are symptomatic of a band that still hasn't settled on its style or aim. The final quarter of <i>Welcome Oblivion</i>, for instance, is the album's only largely instrumental chunk and an overloaded appendix. The motorik rise of ""Recursive Self-Improvement"" provides little but discursive filler on a record already unsure of what it wants to be, while closer ""Hallowed Ground"" offers an exultant comedown for an hour that has been neither cohesive nor compelling enough to warrant its own fanfare. ""Ice Age"", a banjo-and-noise vestige from <i>An Omen</i>, is once again an outlier that clears an inspired new path for the band; it goes un-followed. And the creeping ""Keep It Together"" initially slinks with the sinister mystery of the Tri Angle Records family, with Maandig and Reznor smoldering beneath a bass quake. But the back half of the song goes almost entirely to Reznor, who puts his voice between the cracks of the beat to illustrate the already obvious lyrics-- ""I can't keep it together.""  It's hard to argue with him.</p>
<p>In light of Nine Inch Nails' imminent relaunch, the future of How to destroy angels_ remains a compelling question mark. After a promising first EP in 2010, the project now sounds stalled amid a flood of possibilities and ideas, each distracting and detracting from another. The thought of How to destroy angels_ being sidetracked, then, is a disappointing one, because this is the sort of band that could benefit from <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/howtodestroyangels/sets/how-to-destroy-angels-2010"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the same digital model it employed with its introductory EP</a>-- put everything out all the time for free and online, until a favorable focus emerges. If How to destroy angels_ end here, though, they will remain a footnote ensconced in amber, the project Trent Reznor attempted to use to stay current but ultimately used to restart Nine Inch Nails. </p></div>"|17675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17675-how-to-destroy-angels-welcome-oblivion/|6.2|Grayson Currin

These days, he's known more as a guest or hired session gun than a solo artist and <i>A Love Surreal</i> feels very much like the personal project of someone who has embraced the ability to make music away from commercial expectations: jazzy, muted, idiosyncratic, and completely without high-profile guests (unless you count young jazz iconoclast Robert Glasper as such). <i>A Love Surreal</i> breathes some of the same insular oxygen as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren"" target=""_blank"">Todd Rundgren</a>'s <i>Something/Anything?</i>, another effort by someone who had figured out that he wasn't ever going to be a marquee star, and, with a shrug, closed his studio door to the outside world.</p>
<p>Recorded in live, spontaneous-sounding takes, <i>A Love Surreal</i> is a long, liquid suite, shifting through long instrumental sections during which Bilal is doing nothing but crooning wordlessly, doubling and tripling his voice into freely rippling layers. That doesn't mean it's boring or static. The mix is filled with tiny surprising sounds-- a high, pulsing keyboard whines in your head on ""Winning Hand""; dusty, boxy drum programming throughout that recalls the napkin-doodle electronics taking up the back half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3183-shuggie-otis/"" target=""_blank"">Shuggie Otis</a>' <i>Inspiration Information</i>. There are guitars everywhere-- acoustic and sun-dappled on ""Lost for Now"", electric and bluesy on ""Astray"", stabbing Steve Cropper leads on ""Winning Hand"". On ""West Side Girl"", they clump together like wet tissues while Bilal multitracks his voice into dizzying layers around them: His harmonized vocals stack behind the verses, and the foreground is flooded with breathing, moaning, muttering, exclaiming, and whispering. He seems to gravitate naturally to smaller-scale, more granular moments like these, which make <i>A Love Surreal</i> mandatory headphone listening.</p>
<p>His sense of melody remains compellingly strange, his harmonic ear bent permanently by operatic and jazz training and his reverence towards decades of atmosphere-first psychedelic-soul LPs. <i>A Love Surreal</i> is short on big, arcing-rainbow melodies as a result, but one of its joys is watching Bilal warp his voice into improbable shapes: nasally and needling on ""Longing and Waiting"", Donny Hathaway-expansive on ""Slipping Away""; ""7""-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> raspy on ""West Side Girl"" and ""Astray"". On ""Butterfly,"" the Robert Glasper collaboration, he lets his voice shoot into a startlingly unbounded falsetto, one that feels like it could plausibly keep climbing and climbing. The song has nothing but Glasper's free, shimmering piano and some drowsy guitar effects to mark its edges. It never ceases to be captivating.</p>
<p>There is very little on <i>A Love Surreal</i> to suggest that Bilal has his ear cocked to what is happening to the R&amp;B landscape around him. There are no rap guest spots, despite Bilal's reliable presence on the other side of the ""ft."" on a decade's worth of indie-rap albums. Calling in favors doesn't seem to interest him. Having outlasted the ""next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"" target=""_blank"">D'Angelo</a>"" tag that hung on his earliest work and weathered a decade in the solo artist wilderness, Bilal seems to have found his sweet spot somewhere between ""hired session gun"" and ""weirdo auteur.""</p></div>"|17816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17816-bilal-a-love-surreal/|7.6|Jayson Greene

MTV Raps"" and ""Saved By The Bell."" His buzzed-about mixtapes <a href=""http://antwon.bandcamp.com/album/fantasy-beds-mixtape"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fantasy Beds </i></a>and <a href=""http://antwon.bandcamp.com/album/end-of-earth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>End of Earth </i></a>featured production from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9778-pictureplane/"" target=""_blank"">Pictureplane</a>, and he’s rapped over Suzanne Vega and Goldfrapp samples. In short, he's a perfect fit on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29388-heems-of-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Heems</a>' Greedhead label; between himself, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>, Big Baby Gandhi, and others, it crosses nearly every racial, sexual, cultural, and aesthetic barrier and presents the most comprehensive picture of hip-hop’s reach in terms of both fans and performers. But while <i>In Dark Denim </i>is certainly heartening in how it shows Antwon's various eccentricities to have currency and mass appeal on the whole, like too many of his peers, his multifaceted personality strains to compensate for his deficiencies as an actual recording artist.</p>
<p>Though he slots into whatever internet-rap zeitgeist of 2013 you can think of, when Antwon makes multiple namechecks of <i>Sex Style, </i>it's worth remembering how much <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2324-kool-keith/"" target=""_blank"">Kool Keith</a> in his various guises appealed to the kids who were otherwise into punk rock. This is true in regards to prolificity and <i>especially</i> true in regards to scatology. If you're gonna be turned off on general principle by lyrics such as ""sexiest nigga/ lesbian couples wanna solo/ tongue inside her pussy now she send me naked photos"" or ""I'll send you love letters when I fuck you on your period,"" you probably won't last five minutes.</p>
<p>Much to his credit, Antwon never strikes you as being needlessly repulsive; at best, he considers sexual congress as something of a quid pro quo and considering he'll throw in a goofy, heartfelt line like ""and them titties are like the highlight of my weekend"" during ""3rd World Grrl"", <i>In Dark Denim</i> comes off as wish fulfillment, more like a teen's giddy recount of his first time at a strip club rather than a jaded misogynist that sees it as a confirmation of a proper gender relations. Moreover, Antown's facility with hooks make ""Werk 4 Me"", ""3rd World Grrl"", and ""Boomerang"" sound like all-ages party starters even though they'd require chanting ""three rounds in a row she gon' work for me/ pussy all wet, let it squirt for me"" and ""I bet that coochie tastes real good/ tight real nice for the boys in the summer.""</p>
<p>While his various appetites have earned him comparisons to a multitude of overweight lovers, Antwon's hardcore past is very much evident in his vocals, an effective, one-note attack that’s half playground bully, half class clown. Or, within the context of <i>In Dark Denim'</i>s musty, <i>Thrasher </i>VHS production, something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> if they showered up and decided to write the vast majority of their songs about oral sex. There are times when Antwon gets into bleak sociopolitics and warrants similarities to his fellow Bay Area noise terrorists, but make no mistake, <i>In Dark Denim </i>is for the most part absolutely filthy, turning its title in an uncomfortable double entendre.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s not surprising that guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29764-cities-aviv/"" target=""_blank"">Cities Aviv</a> and B L A C K I E lend their production efforts, as they share a similar, unshakeable conviction about the compatibility of punk-rock aesthetics with twerk-rap lyricism. But much like Aviv's most recent tape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17456-black-pleasure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black</i> <i>Pleasure</i></a>, <i>In Dark Denim </i>appears to be the work of someone who values ideas at the expense of execution. Or, on a more mundane level, the actual listening experience of <i>In Dark Denim </i>is inexcusably flawed for Antwon's most high-profile release to date.  For one thing, the mixing is atrociously muffled and off-balance, and rarely in a way that enhances the experience.  Something like the volatile, Afrocentric ""Burn Away"" benefits from the clatter, but otherwise ""1MillSnippet"" and ""Boomerang"" sound like poor YouTube rips and gain nothing from the bouncing reverb and complete lack of bass. Meanwhile, Antwon's flow on ""Still Guarded"" is barely on speaking terms with its beat, an unfortunately fitting closer for a mixtape that simply sounds rushed as opposed to urgent.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the tracks that delve into Antwon's darker past are the most underdeveloped. ""Burn Away"", ""1MillSnippet"", and ""Rare 2000s"" contain intriguing details-- talking shit to his parole officer, friends dying of meth addictions, nights at the local park-- but either cut off short or rely on outside sources to drive their point home. All things told, Antwon has the inverse problem of most rappers-- his persona is fully formed and he has a gift for choruses, it's every other part of the songwriting process that tends to get shortchanged. These are fixable problems, though. So while <i>In Dark Denim </i>is an occasionally fascinating look at an intriguing talent, that doesn't mean it’s a success on its own terms.</p></div>"|17838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17838-antwon-in-dark-denim/|6.2|Ian Cohen

On that note, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29065-suuns/"" target=""_blank"">Suuns</a>' <i>Images Du Futur </i>is indeed a derivative record, but in a paradoxically unique way that doesn't allow the typical mitigating circumstances to be considered. The Montreal band doesn't recall a specific <i>era </i>of music, nor do they remind one of the kind of band so ingrained in the culture that they're basically public domain. This is something far more weird: on their debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14770-zeroes-qc/"" target=""_blank"">Zeroes QC</a>, </i>Suuns <i>occasionally</i> sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/779-clinic/"" target=""_blank"">Clinic</a>, a band that is still functioning and wholly idiosyncratic, in between extended bouts of electronic, psych-prog freakouts. But here they sound like that band and that band only to the point where it's a protracted game of chicken with the audience-- or Suuns have actually never heard Clinic before in their lives. Otherwise, how could they <i>not notice</i>?</p>
<p>The most overt similarities make it almost impossible to hear anything else-- ""Minor Work"" pretty much rips off Clinic's single most identifiable riff (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9xyWtGAsz8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Second Line</a>"") verbatim, and I'm just gonna give people taking Copyright Law this semester a freebie and suggest you place ""Sunspot"" and <i>Walking With Thee</i>'s ""Come Into Our Room"" back-to-back. But otherwise, Suuns are just guilty of having the kind of exceptionally good taste that just so happens to be shared by countless other bands. It's clear from the propulsive, linear, and chilly songs of <i>Images Du Futur </i>what makes them tick-- the mechanical pulse of kraut-rock, post-punk's fractured syntax, and unorthodox instrumental techniques, studio trickery owing equally to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> and dub, and overall, the morose, drowsy demeanor of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>. At times, it can be genuinely exciting to hear all of these elements coalesce, especially when given the rhythmic drive that accurately previews their visceral live shows-- opener ""Powers of Ten"" draws out tension between a frantic buzzsaw riff and a heavy drum plod, Ben Shemie's guitars imitate Doppler effects and power drills on ""2020"", and sunlit harmonies peek through the overcast pallor of ""Minor Work"".</p>
<p>And yet, Suuns can never mount the best possible defense to accusations of theft: to add <i>something </i>new to it and prove they're refracting their influences through their own ideals and experience rather than just filtering. As a result, nearly every song on <i>Images Du Futur </i>feels like a bin of used CDs or an mp3 folder rather than a living thing, something to peruse rather than engage. Whether it's the rather not-magnificent ""Holocene City"" or the dreary ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14567-edies-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Edie's Dream</a>"", Suuns sound cold when they mean to sound cool,<i> </i>channeling music obsessed with motion but more or less running in place themselves.</p>
<p>Likewise, Shemie doesn't do much to let you in; beyond his half-mutter, half-hiss vocals evoking pitch-perfect Ade Blackburn karaoke, whenever he repeats sentence fragments as a way of sounding urgent, it just sounds like tossing of flavorless word salad, overly plainspoken and cryptic at the same time. You wonder about the message being conveyed by bullishly-titled closer ""Music Won't Save You"" and it just feels like an unintentionally apropos eulogy for a record that disappoints by geeking out over its record collection and effects pedals without offering some kind of emotional center. Pretty much any way you slice it, <i>Images Du Futur </i>is just too clinical.</p></div>"|17671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17671-suuns-images-du-futur/|5.0|Ian Cohen

They're still a hybrid of early Cryptopsy's blinding technicality and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28082-suffocation/"" target=""_blank"">Suffocation</a>'s NYHC-esque breakdowns-- ""slam parts,"" to those in the know. There are plenty of bands that attempt this fusion, but few do it with such care and precision. Defeated Sanity have always been stronger than their ""brutal death metal"" peers in part because they do not use either of those elements as a crutch: too much technicality can only hide a lack of songwriting and ideas for so long; slams serve as fun reprieves, but should never be the center of one's sound. Defeated Sanity strike a balance between both, making their product more potent.</p>
<p>On <i>Deformity</i>, they use a much crisper production than on their last album, 2010's <i>Chapters of Repugnance</i>, taking out some of the low end and cleaning up the guitar sound. For their tech side, this is a boon. Christian Kühn's guitar work gets to shine as a result. The slams do suffer a little from the greater absence of bass, but they still pack plenty of heft. <i>Deformity</i> features the same lineup as <i>Repugnance</i>, save for new vocalist Konstantin Lühring, who replaces A.J. Magana. He doesn't sound that much different from his predecessor, just a tinge lower. Band members as interchangable parts has plagued metal for some time, but think of the upside to Lühring's seamless transition. Cryptopsy's biggest strength was their distintive vocalist Lord Worm, and since his two departures from the band, they've never regained their footing. Defeated Sanity don't have to worry about that.</p>
<p>Throughout the record, there are interludes that, while fitting with the macabre feel of the music, are not the sounds you'd normally find on a death metal record. The oddest of them is on ""Verblendung"", capping off with a layer static burying a drum pattern somewhere between Converge at their most experimental and IDM. ""Lusting for Transcendence"" ends with a guitar drone over the sound of someone eating flesh, which is fairly death metal in and of itself. It's also be interesting to see if the piano that caps ""Verses Of Deformity"" could be woven more tightly with the music. The interludes signal a desire, perhaps on the band's part, to want to bring new elements and directions to their sound. One instance of a desire to musically expand does not come from an interlude, in fact, it doesn't come until the album's almost over. The end of ""Martyrium"" (where Magana makes a guest vocal appearance) has drummer Lille Gruber cutting loose and going off on a bit of a freeform jam. For most of the album, he's connected with the guitar, but in this instance, he's on his own tangent, not caring what Kühn does. A whole album of that would be a disaster, but that taste at the end serves as a fitting closer.</p>
<p><i>Deformity</i> sees the Defeated Sanity at an interesting point in their career. While sticking to their sound, they've making moves that indicate they're ready for bigger things. In some ways, the stage is set: in all of the mainstream music press' more recent fascination with extreme metal, Wormed-- a Spanish band who are Defeated Sanity's few worthy contemporaries-- being featured on NPR may be the strangest.

A couple of years ago, after being tapped by Hannibal's Copenhagen-based electronic group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28590-quadron/"" target=""_blank"">Quadron</a>, producer/vocalist Mike Milosh flew to Denmark to work with the group and they hit it off. Eventually, Quadron producer Robin Hannibal moved to L.A. in pursuit of a woman, and Milosh coincidentally relocated there as well, and started his own serious relationship (which has since evolved into a marriage) before they reconnected musically.</p>
<p>From what Milosh has said, Rhye's primary goal is to pay tribute to this type of world-tilting romantic experience, but so far the pair have delivered their interpretations of this very personal phenomenon from behind a veil of secrecy. They released their first single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49401-rhye-share-open-video-detail-album-tour/"" target=""_blank"">""Open""</a>, anonymously, and promoted it in a deliberately opaque fashion, like a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CT3OOVacHo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube video</a> of Milosh serenading his wife with a solo piano rendition of the song, shot in a way where you can barely make him out in silhouette. Even after revealing their identities, the pair refuse to say where the group's name comes from or what it means, and their full names don't appear anywhere in the liner notes to their debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/38-woman/"" target=""_blank""><i>Woman</i></a>.</p>
<p>Even without a face to attach it to, Rhye's music itself feels deeply intimate. Much of this comes from Hannibal and Milosh's deft arrangements-- each of <i>Woman</i>'s 10 songs makes its point with a bare minimum of moving parts. Beats, basslines, and Milosh's voice are at the center of nearly all of them; although a majority of the tracks boast arrangements for horns and strings, most of these are so subtle that you might not even realize they're there until you read the liner notes afterward. The lean production leaves little space between the listener and the songs, and they feel almost touchably close.</p>
<p>And then of course there's Milosh's voice itself, a gorgeous and graceful countertenor that many listeners have mistaken for a woman's, especially in the days before the group unmasked themselves. He's a subtle performer, but also canny. The restraint that the pair shows in their arrangements also carries over to his singing, which rarely rises above the volume of a conversation. It's gentle, soothing, and easy to get lost in.</p>
<p>That voice has drawn a number of comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>, and the music behind it only underlines those similarities. <i>Woman</i> offers few sounds or ways of deploying them that wouldn't be familiar to an R&amp;B fan in the 90s, especially if they were into the British wing of the genre that at the time was focused on making gently bumping, slightly jazzy bedroom music.</p>
<p>And although Milosh is an <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/music/rhye-offers-a-warm-croon-wrapped-in-an-enigma.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outspoken critic</a> of what he considers a trend of crass sexualization in pop music, the album still embraces the physical aspects of the romantic experience it intends to glorify. Its sensual aspects may share the same sense of self-control (it's sexy without being overtly sexual, erotic but not lascivious). As well-mannered as its carnal side may be, <i>Woman</i> is bound to become fodder for a tasteful boudoir soundtrack, something to be slotted next to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>, another band Rhye's been frequently compared to.</p>
<p>The satin-sheets sensuality and Milosh's vocals are impressive enough that they could save an otherwise unremarkable album, but the pair are also gifted songwriters who seem even stronger as a pair than as they did separately. <i>Woman</i> has only one bad song on it, though it should be noted that it's seriously bad: ""One of Those Summer Days"" is boring and hook-free, and it not only dives face-first into the kind of sickly cloying sentimentality that they studiously avoid on the rest of the songs, but does so to the accompaniment of a drippy smooth-jazz alto sax solo.</p>
<p>But a good number of the remaining songs come breathtakingly close to their own kind of perfection, at least close enough that it's hard to imagine how anyone could improve them. ""Open"" may be so derivative of Sade that you may as well call it an homage, but considering that the closest point of comparison would be Sade's ""By Your Side""-- one of the few truly perfect songs in pop history-- that's hardly a complaint. And I'd be surprised if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a> and the members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a> aren't holding their new singles up to the lithe, clean-lined modern disco sound of ""The Fall"" and frowning at the results.</p>
<p>Music about happy, successful relationships is always a tougher sell than music about romance gone bad, for the same reason that tragedies are more compelling than stories where everything works out fine for everyone. Bad fortune is naturally fascinating and contentment isn't, and unless you're in a happy, successful relationship you don't want to hear about someone else's. But <i>Woman</i> somehow gets to break those rules, in large part because the music itself is so easy to fall in love with.</p></div>"|17693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/|8.5|Miles Raymer

The producers in FoF's stable draw on every musical ingredient available to them; they source samples and influences from any decade, genre, or style that they're interested in. What's most impressive about what Shlohmo and his peers are doing, and what's epitomized on <i>Laid Out</i>, is the way that they can transform vocal samples into instrumental elements while retaining the immediacy and accessibility we normally associate with pop vocals. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Two sections of the Shlohmo's new EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/25-laid-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>Laid Out</i></a>, have an uncanny catchiness. The first is from the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14965-shlohmo-dont-say-no-ft-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Say No""</a>, featuring Tom Krell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a> singing in his most desperate falsetto. The other sticky section is the loop from the best track on the EP, ""Out of Hand"". There's an obvious difference between the two: one features a singer emoting as best he can, with provocative, romantic lyrics. The other has just the ghost of a vocal, with words that are difficult to make out. But there's no difference in the intensity of the emotion that both songs conjure and the instrumentation in both is geared towards emphasizing those central refrains. </p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14771-later/"" target=""_blank"">""Later""</a> the six-minute centerpiece of the album is similar to ""Out of Hand"" with its looped, anguished vocal sample. Only here, the voice is blurred beyond the point of recognition. The track doesn't have the same kind of grab as its predecessors (perhaps because the repeating loop is less recognizable as a human voice), but it's equally intense, with waxing and waning drum machines that surround and heighten that go-for-broke sample. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Laufer's last project, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16219-vacation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Vacation</i> EP</a>, played around with these kinds of melodies and samples, but that record largely avoided pop leanings. It was withdrawn, soft, pretty, akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a>'s debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/"" target=""_blank""><i>Space is Only Noise</i></a> or to Teebs' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14798-ardour/"" target=""_blank"">Ardour</a>. </i>And while it was solid, <i>Vacation</i> was made for people who were already comfortable listening to electronic music. The first three tracks on <i>Laid Out</i> have far more ambition: they're meant to pull in pop and R&amp;B listeners who might not otherwise be drawn towards electronic music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The last two songs on the EP, ""Put It"" and ""Without"", hold more back and function almost as sketches of the songs that come before them. Each has an instrumental through-line that one can imagine being replaced by a stronger sample. They're smart and well-constructed but they can seem out of place, and dwarfed by what came before. Still, those first three: Shlohmo's already one of the better producers of his young generation and <i>Laid Out</i> should add substantially to his growing reputation.</p></div>"|17735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17735-shlohmo-laid-out-ep/|8.0|Jonah Bromwich

Eschewing the confessional approach along with overtly personal lyrics, his last two albums were less about himself and more about all of America all at once, as though Ritter were reconstructing <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Description_of_Banvard_s_Panorama_of_the.html?id=XpGckgAACAAJ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Banvard</a>'s panoramic trip down the Mississippi. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10680-the-historical-conquests-of-josh-ritter/""><i>The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter</i></a> and <i>So Runs the World Away</i> boast ambitious feats of songwriting and composition, yet his craft often undercut rather than underscored his headiest insights. The music sounded too composed: too predetermined, too polite to adequately depict the chaos and sheer weirdness of history. It makes sense that his best work to date isn't an album or a song, but a novel, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brights-Passage-Novel-Josh-Ritter/dp/0812981847"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bright's Passage</i></a>, which blended history and fantasy, grand tragedy and life pre- and post-WWI into imaginative literary fiction.</p>
<p>For his seventh full-length, Ritter has abandoned the broad canvas of history. <i>The Beast in Its Tracks</i> is his most ostensibly personal album to date, smaller in scope yet deeper in detail than anything he's done yet. Technically, it's a break-up album, inspired by his divorce from singer-songwriter Dawn Landes. But that label implies messy emotions, lives upended, dishes thrown. Ritter's songs are less about recrimination than recovery. In a <a href=""http://sacksco.com/notes/josh_ritter.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">letter</a> to fans, he explains that his first songs as an ex-husband were too bitter to record, ""full of hatred and self-pity,"" but time allowed him to gain a new perspective. Rather than recount his precipitous post-split freefall into alcohol and self-loathing, <i>Beast </i>picks up a year or so later, when a new and stable relationship has righted his ship and put him in a more generous mood: ""I've got a new lover now,"" he sings, without boasting. ""I hope you've got a lover, too.""</p>
<p>That distance has its advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it allows Ritter a big-picture perspective: the past as a landscape he has traversed and can see more clearly from this peak. <i>Beast</i> is contemplative and forgiving, a means of burying one relationship to commit to another, and Ritter nicely evokes the excitement and resignation of such a transition. On the other hand, distance is distance, and much of the album is too cool, too levelheaded, too past tense. The spry pace and playful melody of ""Nightmares"" distract from the horrors described in the lyrics, as such nightmares are safely over. The best moments are the rawest and least guarded, when the pain and regret sound inescapably present tense: when he laughs off his insomnia on ""Evil Eye"", when he notices similarities between his new lover and his old wife on ""A Certain Light"", when he finally allows himself to enjoy a bit of happiness on ""Joy to You Baby"".</p>
<p><i>The Beast in Its Tracks</i> forgoes the expansive arrangements of Ritter's previous albums in favor of scaled-back arrangements that emphasize a few instruments interacting directly with each other. The songs build patiently, allowing repeating musical themes to mirror persistent lyrical themes. ""Hopeful"", the album's highlight, opens with a spare acoustic strum, then builds from the ground up: a simple drumbeat, a simple electric guitar pendulum, a one-note piano theme. The effect, however, is surprisingly sophisticated. On that song as well as on ""Bonfire"", Ritter rushes his delivery, packing the measures with as many words as he can. There's a new, anxious energy to his vocals, which gives the sense that he's trying to get his thoughts out before they grow cold or before he loses his nerve. It's an effective and illuminating technique, revealing just how much divorce and recovery have changed Ritter: He seems to understand that all those mixed emotions can't be so easily fit to music.</p></div>"|17673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17673-josh-ritter-the-beast-in-its-tracks/|6.8|Stephen Deusner

With their irreverently fun, homemade 2009 ""mixtape"" <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13317-jamz-n-jemz/"" target=""_blank"">Jamz n Jemz</a></i> and their proper debut follow up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14115-no-mas/"" target=""_blank"">No Mas</a></i> the next year (a somewhat cleaner take on their ⌘-C, ⌘-V approach), Javelin established themselves at the head of an expanding pack of artists whose idea of composition more closely resembled a ransom note cut-and-pasted together from an old stack of <i>XXL</i>, <i>Tiger Beat</i>, and <i>Wire</i> magazines. But instead of remaining content with merely kicking out more jamz, Langford and Van Buskirk set their sights frontier-ward, releasing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15367-canyon-candy-ep/"" target=""_blank"">cyber-Western 10"" EP</a> with an accompanying Kickstarter film. There was a very real chance that Javelin's interest would continue to splinter into deeper, stranger abysses, and for a time it seemed like a good thing. Though it's unlikely you've thrown <i>Canyon Candy</i> on much since it came out, it's hard to deny the fact that Javelin's smarts and the samples have made following their trajectory worthwhile.</p>
<p>But during the lead-up to their new album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/36-hi-beams/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hi Beams</i></a>, the winds changed direction. If you happened to catch them on tour in the last year or so, you were likely treated to favorites like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11371-vibrationz/"" target=""_blank"">""Vibrationz""</a>, but also some very awkward, <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/karmin-started-from-the-bottom-drake-remix-video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karmin-esque</a> covers of quasi-current rap radio hits, and of course the road testing of new material that, for all intents and purposes, you could also label as Karmin-esque. If this at all seemed disconcerting, there's little chance that <i>Hi Beams</i> in full is going to do much of anything to rectify those feelings. Doing away with their trademark samples, <i>Hi Beams</i> is Javelin's first real studio record, a slick-sounding genre-collision that feels somewhat congruent with the life-affirming focus of peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28255-tanlines/"" target=""_blank"">Tanlines</a>, only unrelentingly goofy. Despite its well-meaning disposition, you can't help but notice how frankly annoying <i>Hi Beams</i> can be: Cybernetic vocals rise and fall with the cadence of a plainspoken nursery rhyme over pop-informed hip-hop appropriations that come off as gratingly cutesy. In trying to write honest-to-goodness songs, Javelin have inexplicably lost their sense of musicality, ignoring their hookier impulses in favor of a sound that feels both plastic and a little soulless.</p>
<p>Much of<i> Hi Beams</i> is means to translate as outsized fun, but where it should elicit big, dumb grins, you'll likely feel an embarrassed surge of hot blood rush to your already reddened cheeks instead. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14751-nnormal/"" target=""_blank"">""Nnormal""</a> (a baffling choice for a first single) fancies itself as some sort of warped brand of robot rock but comes off like a companion piece to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxxmLuVF4MM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nothing Ever Happens On Mars""</a>. Worse is ""Judgement Night"", which interrupts a cheesed-out interpolation of Peter Gabriel gone ratchet with giant squalls of jock-metal guitar (to its credit, there are no vocals). Not everything is quite as glaring, but rather either unappealingly cheeky (""Friending"", ""Drummachines"") or blandly earnest (""Light Out"", ""The Stars"").</p>
<p>The takeaways here are slight, but still evident thanks to their years spent sample-mining. Langford and Van Buskirk have good ears, as a lot of the individual sounds on <i>Hi Beams</i>-- deep bass thuds, crisp hand claps, UFO-guided synths-- sound great on their own. It's too bad that they're implemented in ways that don't curry them much favor. In instances where things do come together-- like on the lite-disco of ""Airfield"", the Mark Mothersbaugh-checking snippet ""Garth Hudson"", or the piano-lead ""City Pals""-- there are inklings of potential, but in the end these songs still can't help sounding like a discount <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a> track, a suite from a Wes Anderson movie that hit the editing-room-floor, and a too-plucky TV show theme song, respectively. It's obvious that <i>Hi Beams</i> was meant to be a candy-colored experience, but instead of inducing a sugar rush, it results in little more than a fitful stomach ache. But the real disappointment lies in the sense that Javelin decided now was the time to quit horsing around and become a ""real band."" What they lost sight of in turn was the fact that they already had a pretty damn good one to begin with.</p></div>"|17674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17674-javelin-hi-beams/|4.8|Zach Kelly

Such rigorous circumstances haven't led to a work of great conceptual heft. Instead, <i>Needs Continuum</i> feels more like a gathering of sketches, a sense of letting loose ends stay loose just to see if the world can make sense of them. Gwyer might not be concerned with other people's opinions; her debut EP, released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27829-patten/"">Patten</a>'s Kaleidoscope label, was a cassette issued in an edition of 13 copies. (Though it's free to <a href=""http://www.k-is-for-kaleidoscope.com/*catalogue.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download</a> from the label.) The step up to <a href=""http://nopaininpop.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Pain in Pop</a> for the release of this debut LP draws the world in a little closer, even if it does feel like entering a deeply private realm.</p>
<p>Gwyer sometimes leaves her electronics dry and unprocessed; the percussion in ""Some of My Favourite Lotions"" even feels like a set of ancient Cubase presets set in motion, as do the handclaps in the opening ""Sugar Tots"". The rest of her sound palette feels thoroughly labored over, providing a depth that's easy to get lost in once Gwyer hits her stride. On ""Sugar Tots"" she triggers a soupy signature sound that hacks an appealing path through the track. She's at her best when setting repetitive rhythms in motion and layering ideas on top of them, occasionally approaching similar moods to the placid material <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> produced circa <i>Zuckerzeit</i>. When she diverts into pop her vision is less assured. ""Pikku Kokki"" harks back to the orange half-light of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"">Nite Jewel</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12888-good-evening/""><i>Good Evening</i></a>, a place so thoroughly mined for inspiration that returning there now feels redundant.</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>Needs Continuum</i> is shorn of traditional vocals, with hums and sighs occasionally buried in the mix. ""Pikku Kokki"" includes the album's only recognizable vocal, delivered in a series of whispered lines. Elsewhere, Gwyer uses her voice as an extra layer of instrumentation, simply letting spectral coos drift across tracks such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14913-night-nails/"">""Night Nails""</a> and ""Plan B"". It’s a trick that works reasonably well, but it adds to a sense of hesitance and, at times, a lack of confidence about the project, especially coming off the back of that debut EP released in an edition of 13 copies. It makes Gwyer’s work feel like a secret that she’s reluctant to share, constructed in a place so private that she’s wary of letting anyone in. Perhaps such reticence is understandable considering the circumstances in which the record was made, especially as she has <a href=""http://oohbrilliant.com/artist/karen-gwyer/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked</a> of wanting to make something that ""measured up to the significance of the start of a new life"". Occasionally she does approach such peaks. The coupling of the beautifully vacillating ""Waukon"" with the sobering ""Jajja Uses Ancestral Spirit"" is where the album reaches its apex.</p>
<p>This isn't a cohesive work by any means: There's a demo-y feeling to some of the pieces, coupled with a sense that this is an album with a decent amount of inspiration but just lacking in execution. Perhaps that's to be expected-- after all, Gwyer was working under extreme circumstances. It doesn't feel like it would take a great shift to give her work the kind of gravitas that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"">Julianna Barwick</a>'s music often possesses, and the two certainly share a fondness for diaphanous vocal pining. There's plenty of potential in the electronics here, too, particularly when they form into the kind of supple globules that Daniel Lopatin constructed under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> guise around the time of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/""><i>Returnal</i></a>.

<p>The cosmetic changes are obvious. If you've been paying attention to sonics over the past couple of years, you'll recognize the saturated, bottom-heavy production as that of Ben H. Allen. After hearing Allen give a subwoofer shape-up to previously brittle bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a>, the pairing seems almost inevitable. But while the production is an upgrade, the real growth is thematic. <i>Hibernation </i>obsessed over escape and became defined by its limitations, whether it was its meager recording budget or just the sense that Powers felt trapped by his surroundings in Boise. But <i>Bughouse </i>looks inward and discovers the endless possibilities of imagination and introspection.</p>
<p>Youth Lagoon is still very much an internally-focused project and, with its abundance of effect pedals and stereo panning tricks, <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>will likely be branded as a headphones album. Don't believe it. As with <i>Hibernation, </i>this is a record that's meant to be cranked as loud as possible; for one, volume decompresses these thick songs, amplifying the crucial addition of live drums on ""Raspberry Cane"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14905-mute/"" target=""_blank"">Mute</a>"". More importantly, <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>needs room to breathe from a songwriting standpoint. With Powers' lyrics and Allen's production striving to create a celestial whole, <i>Bughouse </i>is meant to conjure infinite space. </p>
<p>This much is conveyed by the sonar blips that take up the three-minute opener ""Through Mind and Back"" before fading into the spellbinding ""Mute"". Nearly every song on <i>Hibernation </i>began quietly, so it's jarring to hear Youth Lagoon take a more widescreen turn-- echoing drums, gleaming peals of delayed guitar, all washed by ocean spray reverb. This lasts for one minute before a detuned loop of bells recasts ""Mute"" as a juggernaut, a steady, booming drum beat framing a strident vocal performance from Powers, a guitar solo that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Martsch</a>'s expressive, longing leads, a minor-key piano loop that appears ready to take the song to a completely different plateau before cruelly cutting out. </p>
<p>These songs are all bigger and bolder without being unnecessarily complicated. While Powers' melodies are simple and immediately memorable like nursery rhymes, everything surrounding him is in flux. The songs on <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>are continually subjected to flange and phase effects, and it's not the gentle, headswimming ""whoosh"" that typified recent records such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lonerism </i></a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17726-mbv/"" target=""_blank""><i>mbv</i></a>. The cranked oscillation gives these songs a proper sense of danger and hyper-alertness. The combination of the processing and Powers' devious lyrics (""'I won't die easily'/ That's what they say when I erupt into laughter"") gives the calliope-like melody of ""Attic Doctor"" a fitting, monstrous overtone. The synth progression that emerges during the anthropomorphic grotesquerie ""Pelican Man"" would be a perfect evocation of Elephant 6's Beatles obsession, but the pulsing modulations turn into something closer to slasher-flick fare. </p>
<p>It's often scary stuff, more reminiscent of Syd Barrett's bad-trip fairy tales. Though Powers isn't dealing with death in a manner that conveys gravitas or experience, <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>is very much about mortality, albeit filtered through surrealism, parable, and metaphor. Rather than a simple longing for the past, Powers feels obsessed with human frailty and decay. Similarly, the songs of <i>Bughouse</i> aren't subject to tangents so much as following a dream logic working where any thought, regardless of how awesome or fearsome it is, doesn't end until it reaches a conclusion it sees fit. </p>
<p>Powers' choice to write most of these fanciful flights in waltz time gives everything a properly anachronistic feel. The hopscotch melody on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14776-dropla/"" target=""_blank"">""Dropla""</a> makes it sound like a playground chant and the lyrics see its narrator dealing with death in a selfish, forgivably childlike way, hanging on to faint hope (""you'll never die, you'll never die"") and lashing out when the prayers go unanswered (""you weren't there when I needed""). Between the threatening taunts of ""Attic Doctor"", we hear vast stretches of music for the <i>Peanuts </i>gang to ice skate to: ""Third Dystopia"" refracts a sea shanty through multiple funhouse mirrors; the submerged second half of ""The Bath"" places Powers somewhere between a baptism and a drowning. On ""Raspberry Cane"", Powers sees himself as irredeemable (""I'm polluted by my blood/ So help me cut it out and rinse it down the drain"") and while closer ""Daisyphobia"" views humanity as ""mortals on the run"" from an all-seeing God, <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>slinks towards an disturbing and unresolved conclusion, a slow fade of distant synth whinnies and stumbling, inexact beats.</p>
<p>Though unnerving, it <i>is </i>familiar, albeit in a style of indie rock that was prominent when Powers was, by his own admission, listening to Bad Boy records Allen might've played a part in. Think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">the Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Rev</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1773-grandaddy/"" target=""_blank"">Grandaddy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"" target=""_blank"">Sparklehorse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built To Spill</a>, all bands who in some way combined a projected naivety with grand designs: adolescent vocals picking at metaphysical mysteries, an insatiable curiosity with the capabilities of the studio. But Youth Lagoon is also a spiritual progeny in terms of geography. All these bands emerged far from media centers-- Oklahoma City, upstate New York, Modesto, central Virginia, Issaquah, Wash., and of course, Powers' own Boise. Listeners often try to discern something special about creating art in places like these, whether the scarcity of live shows and bands makes music more important or a lack of urban stimuli allows for deeper meditation on the big picture. Though the songs themselves are wonderful, that's the powerful source Powers taps into here: if you feel like the dark center of the universe or simply need a little space, <i>Wondrous Bughouse </i>obliges.</p></div>"|17672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17672-youth-lagoon-wondrous-bughouse/|8.7|Ian Cohen

As a statement of intent it sat comfortably with many of the preoccupations of the time, mixing hazy nostalgia with the dancefloor-referencing electronic pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a>. Even ignoring its timeliness, the project's debut is a gem, a stuttering, maximalist joy-overload, infectious in its naivety. A handful of further tracks followed, cementing an aesthetic that was placeless, both in its stylistic touchstones and its persistent use of non-Western samples, but also intimate in its homespun feel, its imperfections and its repeated references to loved ones and missed places. While far from ground-breaking-- the twin forks of his family tree stretch back at least as far as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>-- his dusty aesthetic was singular and tremendously easy to love.</p>
<p>An album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucky Shiner</i></a>, followed on Ghostly International in 2010. It was a solid if not stunning debut, falling short only next to the the considerable promise of Gold Panda's earliest output. Comparisons to the twinkly sample-scapes of Four Tet and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>'s gauzy techno became perhaps a little too pertinent, and in streamlining his sound Gold Panda seemed, slightly, to dull its charms. In the wake of the album the producer's momentum appeared to falter. His 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15991-gold-panda-dj-kicks/"" target=""_blank""><i>DJ Kicks</i></a> mix rummaged through an array of contemporary electronica but failed to come up with a statement of particular coherence. The original Gold Panda productions accompanying the mix, meanwhile, were among his most polished work to date, exploring glistening melodic techno in the Border Community vein. Looking back over the past four years, there's no doubt that he has refined his process. His shepherding of samples has become more assured, and their edges are often smoother these days, all the better to slot into a coherent whole. But with that refinement has come a<span> mounting sense that the mild anarchy of those early recordings was a large part of their appeal.</span></p>
<p>The <i>Trust </i>EP is a case in point. Across its four tracks, he explores familiar themes, but with diminishing returns. The intro, a foggy, submerged drone, is the most confrontational thing here, though at barely a minute long, it functions as little more than a palette-cleanser. The title track, meanwhile, sees him at his most relaxed, its melodies nestled snugly in a slow-mo house framework. ""Burnt Out Car In a Forest"" draws on much the same sonic toolbox-- particularly the bell-like tones, themselves dangerously reminiscent of Four Tet-- though in a more energetic setting. Flurries of claps and hi-hats give the impression of density, but where previously he might have inundated the track with melodic content, here his repitched sample-melodies do the bare minimum.</p>
<p>The downtempo ""Casyam_59#02"", finally, is the outlier. It's more melodically forthright than its companions, but there's still a disappointingly maudlin quality to the way it unfolds. The fact is that for music like Gold Panda's to function-- music that trades in a kind of heartfelt, familial warmth-- you need to believe it utterly, be swept up by its strength of feeling. It's all too easy, otherwise, to read it as a succession of empty platitudes, a sort of limp unending niceness that gestures at profundity without ever quite getting a grip on the heartstrings.</p></div>"|17701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17701-gold-panda-trust-ep/|7.0|Angus Finlayson

Of course, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17980-blue-hawaii/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Hawaii </a>was not the only band on the beach in 2010, but <i>Blooming Summer</i> managed to sound like something unique. Standell-Preston's voice moved through these songs like a jellyfish, tumbling with such grace that its sudden sting came as a surprise. ""I think about you thrusting into her,"" she sang on the best song ""Blue Gowns"", her voice full of anguished jealousy and self-reproach, ""And I ask myself, how stupid can you get?"" <i>Blooming Summer</i> captured the joys and fears of a new relationship (Standell-Preston and Cowan are a couple) with careful precision, but it also felt unassumingly excellent. <i>Blooming Summer</i> had a quiet release on then-very-niche label Arbutus; you can still <a href=""http://bluehawaii.bandcamp.com/album/blooming-summer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download it</a> on their Bandcamp for $1. Standell-Preston became better known for fronting the more guitar-driven band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29315-braids/"" target=""_blank"">Braids</a>, while Blue Hawaii seemed destined to be a side project little known to people outside the couple's friends in the Montreal DIY scene. Then, of course, that scene blew up.</p>
<p>Sudden, international attention is sometimes enough to make a tight-knit regional scene implode, but in the past few months a few other artists have risen to the occasion and started to fill out the spotlight that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> has shone on her home scene Montreal. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1126-doldrums/"" target=""_blank"">Doldrums</a>, the scrappy, sample-heavy project from junkyard dreamer Airick Woodhead, stepped up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lesser Evil</i></a>, a full-length debut full of soaring, dystopian party anthems, while brooding duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"" target=""_blank"">Majical Cloudz</a> recently made the leap from Arbutus to indie-giant Matador on the heels of a strong, idea-packed EP. But there's a downside to this kind of opportunity; people move on.  ""As friends grow past the Montreal scene and leave, there's a kind of falling apart there,” Cowan said in a <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2012/11/20/download-blue-hawaiis-fader-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent <i>FADER</i> interview</a>. When you listen to Blue Hawaii's first proper full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/39-untogether/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untogether</i></a>, this comment feels not like a diss to anybody in particular so much as a creative statement of purpose; it contextualizes the themes of disconnect, alienation and independence that coarse through <i>Untogether</i>. As Standell-Preston put it, ""I think [making the record] was an attempt to find the glue as everything was drifting apart.""</p>
<p>She was actually talking about her partnership with Cowan as much as her hometown. (Well, creatively speaking, not romantically-- they're still together.) In the three years since the cohesive <i>Blooming Summer</i>, they’ve ventured down slightly separate paths: Standell-Preston's taken a more new-agey route (experimenting with avant-garde make-up in performance; making small-talk about chakras in interviews) while Cowan spent some time absorbing EDM culture in Europe. But, true to its title, <i>Untogether</i> is less interested in blending all its competing enthusiasms together and more intent on emphasizing the space that separates them-- in that way at least, it's kind of the anti-<i>Visions</i>. Standell-Preston's vocals are routinely snipped, chopped and pasted back together like ransom notes, while Cowan steers the tracks with underlying trancelike rhythms. <i>Untogether</i> sometimes feels like a reaction against <i>Blooming Summer</i>'s easy, inviting pop pleasures-- which is not necessarily a bad thing. At its most evocative, <i>Untogether</i> creates the eerie feeling of being the only person in a cavernous, strobe-lit club. Take the awesome two-part highlight ""In Two""-- where the atmosphere's so diffuse and desolate that even a sudden intrusion of handclaps doesn't  feel like a moment of collectivity or unity. Instead, it only emphasizes the feeling of isolation: the claps sound distant, drifted in, and possibly made by ghosts.</p>
<p>""The other day, I had a beautiful thought,"" Standell-Preston sings on the closing track, ""The Other Day"", and then lets loose the most elegant-sounding DGAF in recent memory, ""What if I didn’t care at all?"" It's a freeing moment-- unclasping the pressures of the scene, the stress of communicating with another person, and all the other anxieties that have pulsed beneath the 10 songs that came before it. It's also a much-needed moment of repose. The problem with <i>Untogether</i> is that that Blue Hawaii occasionally get carried away with emphasizing and embracing disjointedness. Cowan's fingers are a little trigger happy, and so the subdued, gradually unfurling beauty of ""The Other Day"" hints at what might have happened had they given some of these songs a little more breathing room. Like the haunting single ""Try To Be"", ""Day"" feels like a moment of both restraint and unity-- Cowan's rippling arpeggios compliment (rather than interrupt) Standell-Preston's crystalline vocals. Blue Hawaii still bloom most vividly when they're working together.</p></div>"|17549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17549-blue-hawaii-untogether/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

Not just in its emotional content-- although there are plenty of allusions to shattered dreams and ruined love-- but also in the way it's executed. He's never really moved beyond a preference for dust-caked tape recordings, often causing him to come across as a doomed romantic slowly disappearing into his own reflection. It's an illusion, of course, but one that Meluch has become truly accomplished in executing. <i>Hymnal</i> sees him walking along a familiar faultline, but like his prior albums, particularly the exemplary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14735-lasted/""><i>Lasted</i></a>, there are a few new crevices to explore. In particular, this record was inspired by Meluch taking up residency in the southeast of England, and his resultant exploration of the religious iconography he discovered both there and on mainland Europe. It lends <i>Hymnal</i> a ceremonial air, culminating in an imposing instrumental drone piece that blackens the center of the album.</p>
<p>In 2011 Meluch put out a release for <a href=""http://www.desirepathrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Desire Path</a> titled <a href=""http://www.desirepathrecordings.com/releases/benoit-honore-pioulard-plays-thelma/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Plays Thelma</i></a>, mostly based around beatless drone pieces. It opened up a strain of thought this record occasionally capitalizes on, particularly when he dips into work such as the barely existent ""Censer"". But that's only half the story, as Meluch can't resist returning to the kind of fine-spun emoting he's better known for, splitting <i>Hymnal</i> somewhere between campfire warmth and ice-cold shivers. It's a combination that may sound jarring, but ends up working quite seamlessly with his firm hand moving all the parts into place. Meluch can even get away with tying a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5702-simon-garfunkel/"">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a> glow to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12498-robert-kirby/"">Robert Kirby</a>-inspired strings on ""Litiya"", and then segueing the whole composition into an actual recording of church bells on the following ""Knell"". The latter is his most literal nod toward the religious emblems that inspired him. Elsewhere it's deployed with greater subtlety, such as the ecclesiastical air that floods into the echoing passages of ""Florid"".</p>
<p>The air of disquiet that seeps in forms loose ties between <i>Hymnal</i> and other recent artists who've explored the inherent creepiness in the rolling hills of the English countryside. This album doesn't share many aesthetic ties with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6037-julian-house/"">Julian House</a>'s work in <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/artist/artist_thefocusgroup.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Focus Group</a>, but it does share a sense of things not quite being right, of an ostensibly idyllic place suddenly revealing danger. Pitchfork's Larry Fitzmaurice discussed the resemblance of Meluch's work to ""aged film footage"" in his review of <i>Lasted</i>; here it's often reminiscent of an old <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_information_film"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Public Information Film</a>, depicting the entire world as a place loaded with potentially lethal mishaps at every turn. It's there in the eerie piano runs of ""Homily"" and it's there in the wonky tape intros that beckon in ""Excave"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14820-margin/"">""Margin""</a>. Meluch heightens the tension by stacking these tracks up against sunnier fare like ""Hawkeye"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a> homage of ""Reliquary"", lulling you into a false sense of security before pockmarking you in goosebumps.</p>
<p><i>Hymnal</i> is most definitely the type of album that has a centerpiece around which the rest of the album flows, and when it comes-- titled ""Gospel"", strategically placed as the sixth out of 12 tracks-- it looms over everything that comes before and after. It's an instrumental work, and one that most deeply evokes the record's stated inspirations. ""Gospel"" again triggers strong visual cues, with drones stretching out like mist hugging the ground, decaying fingers prodding at keys to provide the track's brittle organ grind, a field recording of birds soaring into the sky to provide a form of release at its end. Certainly it's tempting to conclude that a whole album of this stuff would elevate <i>Hymnal</i> beyond Meluch's other works, although its rare power is at least partially derived from its standalone nature. Instead, it takes its place amid a spattering of welcome deviations that exist here, all lodged in a subtly different type of ruin.</p></div>"|17670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17670-benoit-pioulard-hymnal/|6.7|Nick Neyland

Active since 1993 and astonishingly prolific, Shatraug and his perennially shifting lineup of cohorts have settled into a comfortable standard of quality: save for 2007's one-off Bathory tribute, <i>Sotahuuto</i>, each Horna full-length has trodden the same path as its predecessor. </p>
<p>Shatraug is known as one of black metal's most creative and relentlessly busy musicians, and as Horna's massive discography attests, ""downtime"" is a dirty word to him. It's been five years since the release of their last full-length, 2008's <i>Sanojesi Äärelle</i>, but those years saw the band churn out a compilation, two EPs, a split with Hungarian black metallers Nefarious, and a live album. During that period, Horna also bid farewell to longtime vocalist Corvus and brought a new voice into the fold: Spellgoth made his first appearance on 2011's <i>Adventus Satanae</i> EP, replacing Corvus' piercing shrieks with a deeper, rougher croak.</p>
<p>On their new LP, Spellgoth seems to have settled into his role, and his vocals sound far more confident and dynamic. On first blush, the hoarse rasps are out of place; Horna's former vocalists favored a higher, more grating screech, and longtime fans may find that Spellgoth's low tone takes some getting used to. Once that wall is breached, though, his vocals become an obvious asset: harsh, commanding, and imbued with manic intensity. His masterful performance on ""Aamutähden Pyhimys"" alone makes it clear that, allegiances to Corvus or Nazgul notwithstanding, the proof is in the pudding, and this dude is one hell of a talented vocalist. The decision to bring him forward in the mix as a focal point proved to be a sound one, and any early reservations I'd had about Spellgoth's suitability vanished by the end of track two, the ominous ""Askel Lähempänä Saatanaa"".</p>
<p>Horna's twin trademarks are a reverence for black metal's Second Wave and deft utilization of melody within their pitch-black compositions. Shades of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10031-mayhem/"" target=""_blank"">Mayhem</a>, <i>A Blaze in the Northern Sky</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"" target=""_blank"">Darkthrone</a> (""Aamutähden Pyhimys"" is pure ""Kathaarian Life Code"" worship), and even Emperor peek through, as Shatraug makes no bones about his dedication to the early 90s' sound or his own roots therein. Buried beneath the jagged, bouncy riffs and apocalyptic blastbeats, sinister melodies slither and sway, crystal-clear and brazenly infectious. The album's standout track, ""Kärsimyksin Vuoltu Hänen Valittuna Äänenään"", offers a good example: It's constructed around an icy chord progression, graced by an especially unhinged vocal performance from Spellgoth, and rides out on one of those hypnotic mid-paced dirge Horna do so well. The production is as raw and ragged as one would hope-- buried by time and dust, without the wet cardboard drumming or lo-fi crackles.</p>
<p>All in all, Horna have once more delivered what they do best, a Horna record, and a solid one at that. They aren't rewriting the book, but Spellgoth's vocals are reason enough to give it a listen, and the very fact that black metal like this is still being written and released in 2013 is heartening.</p></div>"|17742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17742-horna-askel-lahempana-saatanaa/|6.5|Kim Kelly

<p>Rather than give his ears a rest, Moore, now 54, opted to start a louder, younger band. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30568-chelsea-light-moving/"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea Light Moving</a>, named for a moving company founded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Phillip Glass</a> that briefly employed his fellow composer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>, is a quartet featuring guitarist Keith Wood, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4840-hush-arbors/"" target=""_blank"">Hush Arbors</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3980-sunburned-hand-of-the-man/"" target=""_blank""><span class=""st"">Sunburned Hand of the Man </span></a>drummer John Moloney. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2618-samara-lubelski/"" target=""_blank"">Samara Lubelski</a>, who's released some great, retro-leaning psych-pop solo records, plays bass.</p>
<p>The band's self-titled debut record is the heaviest, most dissonant music that Moore has put together in recent memory, easily out-skronking Sonic Youth's 2009 LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13153-the-eternal/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Eternal</i></a>. The album opener, ""Heavenmetal"", is easy-going, jangling, business-as-usual, with Moore drawling out the cool, neo-hippie refrain, ""Be a warrior and love life."" But after that, they crank up the volume. The songs, which often stretch up to six-minutes, make frequent nods to metal and hardcore punk, genres that deeply informed Sonic Youth’s earlier records, but that the band has mostly shied away from over the last decade or so.</p>
<p>Moore is the principal songwriter here, but the record's best moments are its most inclusive-- the chugging meltdown that ends ""Alighted"" or the fuzzy free-for-all that closes ""Empires of Time""-- where the guitarist becomes anonymous and melds into the din with his bandmates. The new cast of musicians also helps to inch Moore's compositions away from the sound of his old band. Sonic Youth's drummer, Steve Shelley, played tight, metronomic rhythms. Moloney's rhythms are looser and heavier, buoying some of Chelsea Light's multi-movement zone-out. When they’re hitting hard, they evoke UK blues-prog band Groundhogs plowing through the SST catalog.</p>
<p>The record seems like a conscious attempt for Moore to get back to serious shredding, to move away from introspection and toward the immediate thrill of pummel and screech. Sometimes, Chelsea Light goes too far, stumbling past primal and towards boneheaded. On ""Lip"" and a cover of Germs' ""Communist Eyes"", Chelsea Light Moving pays homage to early 80s hardcore and punk. These were musical movements that were defined by freaked-out 18 year-olds and listening to a 54 year-old man echo the snotty tenor of their delivery induces a sort of music-nerd vertigo. Most of the time, though, he just seems like he's trying to get out of the way so that the band can plow back into atonal churn.</p>
<p>Like a lot of Moore's work, the songs on Chelsea Light Moving's debut are a carefully curated mash-up of the singer’s favorite strains of American subculture-- Beat poetry (see ""Burroughs""), New York poetry (see ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13933-frank-ohara-hit/"" target=""_blank"">Frank O'Hara Hit</a>""), Texas psych-rock, no wave, hardcore, and so on. And listening to the record, you can get a feeling similar to that of leafing through a really great rock-zine. Sometimes you land on a page that clues you into the mystical, prophetic weirdos of yesteryear. Other times, you get the gross, puking cartoon.</p></div>"|17766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17766-chelsea-light-moving-chelsea-light-moving/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

<p class=""p1""><i>Somewhere Else</i> isn't <i>quite </i>a departure from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5064-sally-shapiro/"" target=""_blank"">Sally Shapiro</a>'s last two albums, but in among the sequencers and identikit drums are instruments from a more muted palette: flute, saxophone, and beats that skitter rather than shimmer. The evolution was probably inevitable. The influence of Belle and Sebastian has long been palpable on Shapiro's work, and plying<i> </i>feathery vocals over disco is a gimmick that can't work forever; she and Agebjörn have often cited Italo divas Katy Gray and Valerie Dore as inspirations, but theirs is a genre is full of one-hit wonders. Gray, for instance, only had <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqz0iAUIS5Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the one song</a>. By Shapiro's second album, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13377-my-guilty-pleasure/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Guilty Pleasure</i></a>, people were calling Shapiro's formula samey; something had to give.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's enough here that sounds of a piece with her last two records. The effervescent ""All My Life"" and ""If it Doesn't Rain"" soar like lost <i>Disco Romance </i>tracks, and the title of ""This City's Local Italo Disco DJ Has a Crush on Me"" certainly fits. Those songs were done solo-- much of <i>Somewhere Else</i> is farmed out to outside producers, another new development. They're either artists reprising their roles from Agebjörn's solo-ish album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15394-casablanca-nights/"" target=""_blank""><i>Casablanca Nights</i></a> (which had enough Sally Shapiro tracks that it was basically <i>Disco Romance 2.5</i>), or pretty good outside bets, like the <i>Drive </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank"">soundtrack</a>-boosted Electric Youth.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As on <i>Casablanca Nights</i>, the returns vary. Lead track ""I Dream with an Angel Tonight"" seems like Shapiro's normal fare-- boy meets girl, girl comes to love boy, boy was never meant for girl, who realizes this on the dancefloor-- until the track concludes in the musical equivalent of a sigh. At least the quiet-breakup track ""Sundown"" brings a foregrounded sax solo out of nowhere, which eventually comes to mimic Shapiro's voice, a neat trick. ""What Can I Do"", meanwhile, is your common or garden twee pop song. If you heard it in isolation, you'd never guess its singer once put out an album called <i>Disco Romance</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Le Prix collaboration ""Architectured Love"" is fittingly titled, chilly and gorgeous as an ice palace. The New Wave-y ""Don't Be Afraid"" first appeared on French producer Anoraak's solo debut <i>Wherever the Sun Sets</i>, and has barely been changed here-- though it's charming enough that the cross-promotion can be forgiven. That's not the case with Electric Youth's ""Starman"", a passable-enough bit of hero worship that turns out not to have a hook. It's not terrible, just uninspired, and only goes to show that the disco romance formula is both harder to pull off and more singular than you'd think.</p></div>"|17648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17648-sally-shapiro-somewhere-else/|6.9|Katherine St Asaph

There's not one that really works. Where a Cyclops has just one eye, and therefore no stereoscopic vision, this music makes expansive use of the stereo field and the depth afforded by modern recording; where the cyclopean masonry of Mycenae is characterized by large, unwieldy stones organized in non-regular patterns, this is disciplined, orderly music with a steady pulse. Really, there's nothing big, unwieldy, lumbering, slow, fiery-tempered, or depthless about it. Perhaps they were referring to a cyclopean image, which is what the brain makes from the two inputs it receives from the eyes-- these four players do, after all, meld quite seamlessly into a unit.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The four in question, Irmin Schmidt, Jaki Liebezeit, Jono Podmore, and Burnt Friedman, have history together. Only Friedman and Podmore have never collaborated before, and Schmidt and Liebezeit are of course two of the founding members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>, one of the greatest art-rock bands ever. If there's a single, crucial thing they've brought with them from that band into this one, it'd be a general creed of no ego-- though each is established in his own right, none of the musicians here ever hogs the spotlight. Schmidt's keyboard washes in particular are a bit like air, something you hardly notice but that you wouldn't be able to breathe without; they're essentially the sonic glue of the record, providing an amorphous foil to Liebezeit's terse and crisply recorded drum patterns.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There was a time when instrumental music like this might have been called experimental, but these musicians are a bit past the experimenting, and have moved into a phase of sonic mastery. They use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prepared piano</a> for the main melody of ""Fingers"", but they do it without calling attention to it, and the rubber band guitar that pops up here and there is played a little like a Persian tar, providing little figures that swirl in the corners of the rhythm track like dust bunnies stirred by the breeze.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">These details and subtleties of sound are the main things that draw me back to <i>Cyclopean</i>-- these are songs that are far more about learning than feeling. They're played with skill and precision, and the sound is close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/572-bark-psychosis/"" target=""_blank"">Bark Psychosis</a>' <i>Hex</i> without the emotional anchor of the human voice-- it's that last part that keeps <i>Cyclopean</i> from being a record for more than just fans of the band members and their aesthetic vision. The overall effect of <i>EP</i> is like watching time-lapse video of weather systems or solar flares-- your awe at the complexity of it and the immense energy embodied in the events is tempered by the remoteness of what you're seeing.</p></div>"|17647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17647-cyclopean-cyclopean-ep/|7.1|Joe Tangari

The paint has barely dried on <i>Lauschen</i>, but another full-length album from Roedelius has already surfaced, this time in the form of a collaboration with bookish singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/791-lloyd-cole/"">Lloyd Cole</a>. Initially it feels like an absurd pairing, with little common ground to be found between Cole's snappy, literate guitar rock and his new partner's fondness for expansive electronic introspection. The duo have spent most of their careers orbiting completely different spheres. But in 2001 Cole released a solo album named <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lloyd+Cole/Plastic+Wood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Plastic Wood</i></a>, a record of delicately spun ambient tracks that owed a debt to Roedelius's output in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>. The pair subsequently corresponded, met in person, and plotted <i>Selected Studies Vol. 1</i> by exchanging files online. If you're an artist contemplating work within a discrete electronic framework, as Cole has been inclined, it helps to have one of the all-time greats on board as a collaborator.<br/><br/>This is an album firmly embedded in Roedelius's world. There are no vocals, nothing that resembles a guitar sound, no devotion to pop or rock structure. It's not clear who did what, although it's tempting to cast Cole as a student learning from a master of the genre. To do so wouldn't be entirely fair. <i>Plastic Wood</i> demonstrated Cole's understanding of this type of work, even if it did meander into aimless drift at times. That's a key difference between Cluster and many of the acts that use them as a starting point-- they never coasted, always looked for new sounds, constantly stretched at boundaries. There's a sense of adventure to Roedelius that he hasn't lost at the age of 78. Like <i>Lauschen</i>, this isn’t an essential document in his career, but it is a further example of him working in tandem with someone to help reshape his putty-like template. There's a sense of another mission accomplished by the time they reach the otherworldly music box feel of the closing ""Lullerby"", a sense that Roedelius has planted flags in some small new areas that were awaiting his discovery.<br/><br/>There are two types of mood that <i>Selected Studies</i> dips into, both carrying just enough thematic ties to make the album gel as a whole. The first type is full of sparse, hollowed-out corners, rendered with minimal instrumentation to maximize the feel of broody deliberation. These tracks take the form of the seasick ""Wandelbar"", the trickling piano runs of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-like ""Still Life With Kannyu"", and the barely-there ""Orschel"". It's the kind of overcast place you'd expect to find Roedelius, and also a place that will be familiar to anyone who has heard Cole's prior ambient work. The other type of mood has a little more meat on the bone, lending a sense of misery filling out and bubbling over. ""HIQS"" is all unsettling machine noise, resembling a creaky engine room dangerously sputtering to the end of its existence. ""Pastoral"" takes a less severe route, letting waves of serene sound simply overlap and fade away. Best of all is ""Fehmarn F/O,"" which is driven by piercing synth lines that sound like their maker is barely in control of the machinery, adding a welcome dose of bedlam that touches on the kind of anarchy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21-add-n-to-x/"">Add N to (X)</a> liked to set in motion.<br/><br/>It's hard to escape the feeling that this is a very self-referential album for Roedelius to make, especially as one of its tracks (""Selbstportrait-Reich"") partially takes its name from a <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Hans-Joachim+Roedelius/Selbstportrait+I+&amp;+II"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series</a> of solo albums he has put out over the years. Naturally, it's one of the best pieces on here, layering Moog twists over a minimalist backing that never really goes anywhere and never really needs to. It's particularly impressive that Cole can work so effectively in such an area, especially when his best work (""Perfect Skin"", ""Rattlesnakes"", ""Lost Weekend""-- his greatest hits, essentially) is so in thrall to coupling classic, sweeping pop moves with pithy wordplay. It leaves <i>Selected Studies</i> in an odd place, one that doesn't feel like any kind of stretch for one of its participants, but is quite the opposite for the other. Still, that sense of tension doesn't transpire in the recordings, which ultimately fall a little too far inside Roedelius's comfort zone to be truly remarkable. But he again shows a mastery over that space, where even the smaller steps in his journey end up pointing in the right direction despite not always taking the most logical turns.</p></div>"|17767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17767-lloyd-cole-hans-joachim-roedelius-selected-studies-vol-1/|6.3|Nick Neyland

It fits in a sense: <i>Die zauberhafte Welt der Anderen</i> is less the straightforward collection of minimal techno that you might expect from the pair's individual catalogs than an hour-long immersion into a universe that the Voigts have been building for ages, but only occasionally allow outsiders inside.</p>
<p>It's a world with its own unique dynamic. The tracks don't present themselves up front, but rather unspool without hurry, changing shape dramatically in the process. ""Intro König"" opens with droning, electronically generated textures, then layers on lush, spookily dissonant strings before suddenly transforming into a strangely psychedelic house track piled with backwards guitar loops, a barking dog, and weird, unidentifiable amusical sounds flickering across the spectrum. The ambiguous Eastern drone that makes up the two-minute-long ""Akira"" reappears at the end of the album in the form of the 26-minute ""Akira Mantra"".</p>
<p>Throughout the LP there are repeated vague hints that the Voigt brothers' world has some sort of storyline running through it, like we're hearing the score to a film that only exists in their shared imagination. Near its end, the Euroclubby ""Hotel Noki"" breaks down into twinkling piano and a recording of someone pulling up on a motorcycle, then pulling away again. If there's not a narrative element to the song, the Voigts are very cleverly messing with our heads by strongly implying that there is.</p>
<p>A narrative would help explain some of the odder choices that the pair makes throughout the album. Even after spending half the record making it clear that they intended to stretch outside of their usual aesthetic territoriy, with tracks that reference industrial music, hard rock, and even a little bit of blues, the mid-album detour into electronic smooth jazz on ""Sozial"" (complete with flute solo) is a jarring surprise. The dissonant drone that enters part-way through the song to add a hint of menace to the schmaltz makes it a weirdly discomfiting listen.</p>
<p>That discomfort, and wondering why the Voigts would want to unsettle their listeners with such a sinister track, are intriguing. ""Sozial"" would be perfect as the soundtrack to a particularly sleazy scene in a David Lynch movie, but otherwise I can't think of a good reason to spend several minutes listening to malefic electro smooth jazz. There are a few other missteps: A couple of tracks offer the tasteful, Germanic approach to house music that's generally associated with the lobbies of boutique hotels. And ""Akira Mantra"" is 26 minutes of just one loop that never seems to evolve in any way, which isn't meditative but maddening.</p>
<p>It's not all bad, though. ""Der Keil NRW"" has the glossy black sheen of an 80s John Carpenter soundtrack. The plump synthesizers and Teutonically rigid rhythm of ""Triplychon Nummer 7"" are pleasantly reminiscent of vintage European EBM. And ""Intro König"" is just fascinatingly weird. <i>Die zauberhafte Welt der Anderen</i> works best if you go ahead and make up the movie that you want it to be the soundtrack to. It's unlikely to be a magical one, but it's certainly got transportive potential.</p></div>"|17664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17664-voigt-voigt-die-zauberhafte-welt-der-anderen/|5.6|Miles Raymer

These ""zombies"" aren't grisly maniacs hungry for flesh, but humans in their pre-death state who return to their tiny community, a twin town to Twin Peaks nestled in the crook of some mountains and swaddled in perpetual night, as if they'd just popped out for air. The soundtrack album <i>Les Revenants</i> contains not a shred of the terror <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a> is capable of wreaking, and it works terrifically-- it rarely comes off overly dramatic or leading, and matches the unsettling feel of the show.</p>
<p>Mogwai had only seen a few English scripts for the drama before they started on the music. ""We were aware of trying to keep it not as a typical soundtrack, more just music that doesn't necessarily do anything that has a bit of presence,"" guitarist John Cummings told <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/10792-mogwai-les-revenants-soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Quietus</a>. That's underselling it a bit; there's no need to see the TV show (though I'd highly recommend it) to appreciate the subtlety of Mogwai's score. While the musical structures are often simple, continually recasting the motif featured in ""Whisky Time""-- which plays as a coach-load of school children crashes over the edge of a winding cliff road in the first episode-- in xylophone, piano, and guitar, they push individual sounds to disquieting levels; the xylophone nursery rhyme-like tinkling that opens ""Hungry Face"" is so concentrated and piercing that it's quite painful to listen to, trilling at an unholy pitch, and again on ""Fridge Magic"", where slab-like bass shifts act as the foil to the xylophone's wandering curiosity. The way the repeated motifs falter matches how the presence of the undead in ""Les Revenants"" makes the electricity fizzle and splutter.</p>
<p>Rather than any of their previous soundtracks, or the highly visual, macabre work of one time Rock Action artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29264-umberto/"" target=""_blank"">Umberto</a>, <i>Les Revenants</i> often sounds like Clint Mansell's haunting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lUgqeO1ZxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtrack</a> to Duncan Jones' (son of David Bowie) existential sci-fi film, <i>Moon--</i> on the heavy piano and clipped pulse of ""Jaguar"" in particular. In a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/feb/22/clint-mansell-stoker-soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>the Guardian</i></a>, Mansell said that his soundtrack work was initially heavily influenced by Mogwai, and emphasizes that, when he started, ""post-rock and film scoring were almost becoming interchangeable.""</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, post-rock has been usurped in the film sync stakes by arpeggiated synthesizer jams with an eye on the past; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5245-kavinsky/"" target=""_blank"">Kavinsky</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a>' work in <i>Drive</i> was a bellwether for the shift. The synthesizers on <i>Les Revenants</i> dominate like monoliths rather than dynamic forces or stylistic turns-- on ""This Messiah Needs Watching"", a heavy grind anchors the piano's skyward ascent, which reaches a hilt on the only shlocky track, the syrupy ""Special N"" with its annoyingly tentative, celestial optimism.</p>
<p>Closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14902-wizard-motor/"" target=""_blank"">""Wizard Motor""</a> is the only point where Mogwai even remotely approach their trademark crusty textures: It plays over the titles of ""Les Revenants"", where a butterfly pinned inside a case starts to tremble, breaks free of its stake, then smashes the glass, escaping with no clearly indicated destination. That question of what the returned undead do next is key to ""Les Revenants""; when a young girl who apparently died in the coach crash returns home, unmarked, her mother tries not to let on that they thought she was dead, and calls the girl's father, who's in the middle of a meeting to plan a memorial for the children.</p>
<p>The only vocal number is a cover of Washington Phillips' gospel standard ""What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?"" that was originally intended for a tribute album to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3669-jack-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Rose</a>. The cover has a slightly awkward, hymnal air, as if the words were sung by a secular community given rare cause to sing together. Stuart Braithwaite leads the chorus: ""What are they doing in heaven today/ Where sin and sorrow are all done away?"" Nobody knows what happens on the other side, but, Mogwai's uneasy, affecting soundtrack implies, what happens when they come back is an even more unnerving prospect. Hardcore will never die, and apparently you might not, either.</p></div>"|17764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17764-les-revenants/|7.6|Laura Snapes

Gates’ mixtapes peruse an emotive, melodic style that often gets him incorrectly lumped into the same milieu as introspective lady-killers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>. His similarities to those artists starts and ends with the fact that he’s a capable rapper and singer. He’s more technically gifted at both than Future, whose acerbic croak is often cloaked in a mist of Auto-Tune, and he’s more weathered and streetwise than Drake, whose background in soap opera acting undercuts his talk of hardship of its relatability. Gates has been at it at least as long as either of them, and his new mixtape <i>The Luca Brasi Story </i>imbues trap’s claustrophobic bleakness with an emotional nakedness, capable lyricism, and melodic certitude many of its recent breakout stars have lacked. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Gates openly plays off the complexity of his character in naming the mixtape after <i>The Godfather</i>’s Luca Brasi, a brutal but unerringly loyal contract killer whose first scene in the film adaptation shows him mulling over how best to present a gift to the don’s daughter at her wedding. Gates shares that devotion to matters of the heart and matters of the street, and <i>The Luca Brasi Story </i>oscillates wildly between the two poles. Street anthems like “Paper Chasers” and “Weight” hold court with tender tales of love under duress like “Arms of a Stranger” and “Twilight” (yes, that <i>Twilight</i>). That might sound like a strange brew, but <i>Luca Brasi</i>’s portraits of lonesome lotharios and traphouse paper chasers all teeter over the same the brink of collapse, and the intensity and break in Gates’ voice make it the perfect vehicle for these stories of desperation. He’s got his method down pat, so <i>The Luca Brasi Story </i>really lives or dies on the kinds of songs he chooses to apply it to. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Luca Brasi Story </i>soars on upbeat productions like Swiff D’s “Paper Chasers” and Nard &amp; B’s “Hero”, which apply Kevin Gates’ sing-song cadence to 808s and frenetic synth runs. Gates is also at home on the moodier stuff: the twinkling keys and trance vibes of “Hold Ya Head” and “Twilight”, and the ethereal, pulsating bass of “Neon Lights” and the spectral keys of “Arms of a Stranger” all provide the perfect space for him to examine his shortcomings and insecurities. The only real problems arrive when Gates gets more conventional trap sounds to work with. “Weight” and “Flex” both overlay ominous hood gothic beats with vocal performances that are a touch derivative. “Weight” proposes a clever nutrition metaphor, but Gates plainly approximates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"" target=""_blank"">Young Jeezy</a>’s asthmatic wheeze on the song’s guttural, multitracked chorus. “Flex” finds Gates co-opting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a>’s smooth but subversively verbose flow when guest Terrance Hines isn’t hammering away at the song’s grating chorus. 22 tracks is a few too many opportunities to flounder, and while <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i>’s misses are mercifully scant, there’s maybe just a little too much of it to go around.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kevin Gates is a gifted, pliable songwriter figuring out how to reconcile the cold embrace of street life with a longing for companionship. On <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i>, he mostly settles for ping pong, cordoning off its more contemplative fare from its tough talk and shifting radically in tone from one song to the next. It isn’t really until the mixtape’s closer “IHOP (True Story)” that we get a glimpse of what Gates can do without barriers. “IHOP” is a winding story-song rapped a capella with what sounds like Gates tapping out a rudimentary beat on his chest. It recounts a story of a man at wits end from relationship troubles who stumbles into a set-up and survives to coldly execute a revenge attack. It’s a chilling bit of dopeboy determinism that digs deeper than the self-aggrandizing boasts of invincibility that anyone who lived it would have every right to express, instead examining the outward stimuli that coerce us into losing control. You immediately get the sense that there’s more to Gates than he’s even letting on, that <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i>’s deft exercises in adjoining pop sensibilities to trap are just Gates working out the kinks, and that something special is just over the horizon.</p></div>"|17808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17808-the-luca-brasi-story/|8.0|Craig Jenkins

(How could you go for someone like her, she wonders, when ""you've got that look, and the whole world like you do?"") She delivers these lines with anguish, but like most of the feelings explored on the EP, the wallowing is short-lived. Throughout <i>Hello</i>, Thompson-Hannant flows through different tones, styles and emotions like an overactive mood ring. (""[I'm] always ripping through a new thought,"" she sings later on ""Contentedness,"" and on cue the song morphs into something else.) The bridge of ""Mozart's Sister"" feels like a turning point, and maybe even a personal liberation. ""Ah, but it's cool,"" she mutters a couple of times, quiet at first and then suddenly soaring, lighter than air. Her voice sounds like a kite riding the winds of the synth crescendo around it by the time she gets to the best line in the song, ""Knowing I'll never be king has set me free.""</p>
<p>The next 12 minutes make good on that revelation-- which is to say that things only get freer, looser, and a whole lot weirder from there. Over the span of this 14-minute, four-song EP, Thompson-Hannant will compare herself to ""dirt"" and ""poo,"" she will make baby sounds (""You got me crawling on my hands and knees like a baby/ Goin' goo goo ga goo""), she will sample what at least appears to be her actual voicemail message, she will give one of music's coolest-ever Simone de Beauvoir shout outs (""And I'll be rockin' <i>The Second Sex</i> famously""), she will mumble spoken-word dialogue that sounds like an agoraphobic practicing casual conversation in a mirror (""Hey/ Oh, hey friend/ How were your... holidays?""). But the miracle of the <i>Hello </i>EP is that these songs are never weighed down by her eccentricity; thanks to her keen ability to craft a featherlight pop hook, Thompson-Hannant makes even the clumsiest, most anxious feelings take flight. She's called her sound ""bedroom paranoia,"" a tongue-in-cheek double entendre that accounts for both her DIY aesthetic (the EP was self-recorded) as well as her lyrical preoccupation with the anxieties of crushing, dating, and intimacy. Though comparisons to some of her Montreal peers are inevitable, a lot of her emotionally candid, frayed-nerve lyrics (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13698-dont-leave-it-to-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Leave It To Me""</a>'s kinetic chant, ""Fear, fear, fear/ Sex, sex, sex"") wouldn't sound out of place in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a> song.</p>
<p>Thompson-Hannant has done time in a handful of bands, but outside of Montreal she's probably best known as one of two vocalists from the art pop band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4838-shapes-and-sizes/"">Shapes and Sizes</a>. Their three albums had exciting moments but were often overcrowded with ideas; without fail, Thompson-Hannant's vocals were the most memorable part of a Shapes and Sizes song. Her transition from co-vocalist to solo artist feels like a wise career move. Thompson-Hannant's voice is soulful, distinct and expressive enough to be the single focal point of a song, but she also has a knack for exploring (and occasionally finding offbeat humor in) isolation and loneliness. ""Sure I got friends, I've probably got more friends than you,"" she sings on ""Single Status"", a tossed-off boast that turns quickly to a self-deprecating punchline, ""I just don't ever see 'em/ They're probably busy doing/ Whatever it is that they do.""</p>
<p>Brief as it is, <i>Hello </i>does show a bit of range, moving from 80s-leaning bubblegum mysticism (her name isn't the only thing about the project that evokes the angsty British duo Shakespears Sister) to looser, DIY-funk-tinged numbers. The excellent ""Don't Leave It to Me"" is an electric, sub-three-minute pop song that perfectly captures the simultaneous joy and the terror of new love, while the next song, ""Contentedness"", is something else entirely: a guitar-driven, palm-muted meditation on the challenges of finding happiness (""Contentedness, you can come on in/ But I wouldn't take your shoes off"") that ambles its way towards the six-minute mark. But just as she finds liberation in imperfection on ""Mozart's Sister"", Thompson-Hannant (never one to brood for too long) comes to a similarly empowering conclusion here: ""I'm prone to flight, and I like it that way.""</p>
<p>Because of its brevity and rough edges, <i>Hello</i> feels more like an introductory handshake than a fully-realized debut, but it nonetheless hints at a promising future. It will be interesting to see if Mozart's Sister can strike a balance between grit and gloss: this EP's handmade, isolated feel is a big part of its charm, but it also hints that she's capable of something more ambitious. <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> is a decent comparison only because she's successfully found that particular balance, but in the end, she and Mozart's Sister are reappropriating pop in an attempt to do two different things. Grimes finds power in ambiguity-- the pop element of her music is about tapping into something universal but hard to pin down. The more lyric-driven Mozart's Sister finds power in the act of sharply articulating (and unabashedly celebrating) very specific feelings. For her, pop is the fairy godmother of everyday life, transforming imperfection into freedom, anxiety into ecstasy, and awkward moments into alternative-universe #1 hits.</p></div>"|17699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17699-hello-ep/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

As the song progresses, it accumulates parts that either support a melodic, even twee, pop side, or undercut it with a current of aggressive sonic weirdness. It's a fascinatingly unpredictable and completely enjoyable song. It also sounds remarkably like a collision between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>, which could be a coincidence if the rest of the album wasn't littered with seemingly deliberate references to a diverse cast of musicians who've straddled the border between electronic dance music and pop.</p>
<p>PVT was formerly a more cerebral, less pop-oriented group that collaborated with Scott Herren in both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3701-savath-y-savalas/"" target=""_blank"">Savath y Savalas</a>, and recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise</a>'s John McEntire. Their last record, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14551-church-with-no-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Church With No Magic</i></a>, whipsawed between dense, abrasive prog and ambient minimalism. While some of their past recordings have incorporated Pike's vocals, this is the first album where he sings on every track. His transition into the traditional frontman role is only one aspect of an extensive band overhaul that's made them substantially more accessible.</p>
<p>Like a lot of albums by artists who've ditched the constraints of ""serious"" music in order to indulge their taste for pop, <i>Homosapien</i> comes off as someone finally giving themselves permission to explore their basest pleasure points. This might explain the amount of homage going on, as well as the breadth of the influences they explore. Given the opportunity to make any kind of electronics-enhanced pop music they want, PVT seems to have tried to make all of them. Ironically, the most enjoyable songs on the album are the most challenging ones with the fewest references to familiar work. ""Vertigo"" builds from a skittering quasi-footwork beat into a lush, slowly shifting tangle of synth pads and polyrhythmic drumming. ""Homosapien"" has a weirdly lumbering beat and a lot of noise, with Pike's vocals processed in various ways past the point of intelligibility.</p>
<p><i>Homosapien</i>'s constant fluctuations between styles means it's a mercurial and somewhat uneven listen. After the warm introduction of ""Shiver"", the album suddenly turns icy and delivers two consecutive songs whose combination of cold-blooded roboticism and organic kinkiness shares a lot of similarities with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3075-gary-numan/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Numan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/61-marc-almond/"" target=""_blank"">Marc Almond</a>'s early work. ""Casual Success"" has a postpunk edginess that's less derivative of the subgenre's innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"" target=""_blank"">Gang of Four</a> than relatively recent revivalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">the Rapture</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>. The heavy INXS vibes emitted by ""Love &amp; Defeat"" give a sense of how pop the group's willing to go. Their occasional reliance on pastiche earns itself a sort of pass, however: Compared to their past work, it's almost as if <i>Homosapien</i> is some new band's debut album, and first albums have a tendency to be derivative.</p></div>"|17658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17658-homosapien/|5.9|Miles Raymer

It’s a character he sketches out in pithy shorthand on ""Sympathy For Spastics"": ""Blue-blood, well-hung, and just a touch too young."" Airy, arch, and literate, Pennington's persona is derived in part from Kevin Barnes' sex- positive-doctoral-candidate swagger and half from Morrissey's shuddering mortification at sex’s ickier, more embarrassing transactions. In the video for ""The Pornographer"", a track from <i>Privilege</i>, the Girls’ fourth album and first full-length since 2008,  the camera trains on Pennington's high cheek bones and fragile frame: he's staring into the camera, lip-syncing, while someone off-camera performs oral sex on him. Watching his face, we see everything without seeing anything; it is the most NSFW safe-for-work video I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Like a lot of <i>Privilege </i>itself, the video is both smartly executed and a little distractingly impressed with itself. <i>Privilege </i>is an assured, musically accomplished work, but all the aesthetic homework Pennington’s done to refine his persona is still visible, pointing directly back to the influences and forebears he’s inspired by. When he quotes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">The Smiths</a>' ""What Difference Does It Make"" (""But I'm still fond of you"") on ""The Pornographer"", it doesn’t feel like sly appropriation, as I'm sure he intended it; it feels, in the context of a song that already has a heavy Smiths air hanging over it, like he maybe forgot to rewrite the line for himself.</p>
<p>This slight over-eagerness is most evident in his lyrics. For every line that insightfully captures a moment of human frailty (""I know you think we failed at life/ But smile with your eyes like you're satisfied, and try to act polite,"" he instructs on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12621-a-note-to-self/"" target=""_blank"">A Note To Self</a>""), there are a dozen overwrought couplets that strain for sophistication and flail awkwardly: ""She's thick as shit, and pregnant with the myth of a noble proletariat,"" he sings on ""Sympathy for Spastics"", a line so misguided it feels like a pre-written McSweeney's parody. He moans ""I've never done one pure thing in my life/ Oh never mind, just guide these hollow hips of mine inside those equine thighs,"" on ""Weaknesses"", and on ""For All the Final Girls"", he purrs ""Could be cousin touched us too much?"" Beneath these lines, you can almost hear Pennington's eyebrows arching hopefully: ""Oh, have I shocked you? No? Hmm. Ok, how about <i>now</i>?""</p>
<p>Thankfully, he has a sure-footed gift for melody, one that is boosted by composer and songwriter Jherek Bischoff's rich, detailed arrangements. In the background of ""Weaknesses"", a wandering keyboard line with a faint samba flavor offers counterpoint to Pennington's vocals. On ""For All the Final Girls"", a fidgety groove coalesces from unlikely elements-- the dinner-club plucking of violins, scrubbing cellos, and trilling piano. Pennington's melody for ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11793-evelyn-mchale/"" target=""_blank"">Evelyn McHale</a>"" is so graceful and balanced that the words become mere roller-coaster cars to deliver its precision-tooled joy. Pennington and Bischoff have simpatico sensibilities, and could probably one day collaborate one day on a killer modern musical. Pennington might not have the depth to sell the part he's auditioning for just yet, but give him time: maybe he just hasn’t earned it yet, baby.</p></div>"|17631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17631-privilege/|6.5|Jayson Greene

His debut album <i>Lesser Evil</i> is in large part the product of those cities' DIY/noise scenes, where Woodhead came up throwing warehouse parties. His addictive single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13479-egypt/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""Egypt""</a>, however, nods toward earlier such scenes in Brooklyn (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Black Dice</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Gang Gang Dance</a>) and Baltimore (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5258-dan-deacon/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Dan Deacon</a>): It's cacophonous and polyrhythmic, continuously falling apart and putting itself back together. Just when it appears ready to implode from hyperactivity, the song erupts into an unearthly refrain, no doubt designed to link a mass of partiers into a temporary, euphoric community.</p>
<p>Yet the name ""Egypt"" signals that <i>Evil</i> is primarily rooted in Woodhead's active imagination. The Doldrums project started as pure science fiction, with Woodhead <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8972-doldrums/"">picturing</a> drugged patients in an experimental clinic who started sharing ""dream maps,"" which lead to ""this extremely fucked up, dystopic place in which everyone's wildest, darkest fantasies are being realized."" We're introduced to this scenario on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14768-anomaly/"" target=""_blank"">""Anomaly""</a>, as he asks: ""Are you living out your fantasy/ Or caught in someone else’s dreams?"" The track's gothic atmospheres and pulsating electronic rhythms link it to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Castles</a>, another Toronto duo similarly prone to creating soundworlds with no fixed address. ""Holographic Sandcastles"" takes this approach to its endpoint: Woodhead finds himself face-to-face with a fellow traveler ""10 miles underground, an ocean over our heads now"" amidst an echo-laden soundscape.</p>
<p><i>Evil</i> is equally borne of Woodhead's skill at channeling the infinite possibilities of digital production and the countless distractions of online life. That ""fucked up, dystopic"" site of wild, dark fantasies? Some of us call it ""the internet."" The most talked-about pre-release story surrounding <i>Evil</i> has been that Woodhead compiled it on a laptop borrowed from his pal Claire Boucher, then featured that laptop's busted monitor on the album cover. It's the perfect metaphor for Woodhead's brand of jittery maximalism; it's easy to imagine him climbing inside, pushing it to its absolute limit, then posing next to the rubble when he was done. Out of this scorched earth M.O. arises <i>Evil</i>'s most massive song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14374-she-is-the-wave/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14374-she-is-the-wave/"" target=""_blank"">""She Is the Wave""</a>. It's less than three minutes long, but every second is packed airtight with laser stabs, spiraling synth squeals, and dark sub-bass. (And yes, there is an internal organ-rearranging ""drop"" a few seconds in.) Bass is one of the album's most recommendable sonic traits: for all of Woodhead's tweaked-out, non-linear layering, he pays a lot of attention to low end.</p>
<p>Among the sensory overload, there's a strong sense of naïve romanticism unique to a kid in his early 20s. Much will likely be made of Woodhead's androgynous vocal style, but primarily, it just sounds <i>young</i>, the kind of wide-eyed enthusiasm perfect for a guy who named his musical project after a fantasy world. These songs sound complex, but lyrically they're mostly about simple things that we fixate on when we're young: love, identity, escape. On the title track, the album's highlight, Woodhead grabs a fellow traveler and splits from a world of his own creation-- because it's <i>boring</i>, like the Doldrums in in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Tollbooth#Plot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i></a> that gave his project its name. They don't know what they want to do, or where they want to go, they just want to get there quickly. As the squealing synth melody driving the song turns into a howl during its last third, Woodhead starts chanting a refrain that kids have relied upon for centuries, and which is axiomatic for <i>Evil</i> as a whole: ""If I don't see it, it's not there.""</p></div>"|17646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/|8.0|Eric Harvey

While it was written and released before <i>Drive</i> was filmed, the song's perfect placement in the film, and the recognition that it brought Kavinsky's way, seem to have inspired him to replicate it. His new album <i>Outrun</i> isn't attached to a picture, but it's meant to tell the story of a lovelorn young man in the mid-1980s who, through some magical auto accident, becomes some sort of zombie man/car hybrid... who makes electronic music.</p>
<p>The details of Kavinsky's intended narrative are blurry, and possibly nonsensical, but he succeeds in making an album that suggests that it's the soundtrack to something, and at least making it clear that it has to do with cars and the 1980s. Its title was taken from the 1986 Sega driving game of the same name (which puts the player in control of a Ferrari Testarossa). There's also a depressingly uninspired rap by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5481-havoc/"" target=""_blank"">Havoc</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a> that uses the word ""car"" dozens of times, as well as the presence of ""Nightcall"", which seems to have been included here because, why not?</p>
<p>But Kavinsky doesn't need words, or even his close association with <i>Drive</i>, to project an automobile air: <i>Outrun</i> is littered with musical allusions to speed. ""Testarossa Overdrive"", with its arpeggios, slow-motion chord changes, and a lead synth pitched somewhere between a wailing guitar solo and a wailing sax solo, provokes synesthetic flashbacks to bygone games of <i>F-Zero</i>. A childhood's worth of low-budget VHS action movies has trained my brain to interpret the ominous piano and digitally emulated strings on ""Rampage"" as cues for a shadowy stalker type driving the city streets at night in search of prey.</p>
<p>Because most of <i>Outrun</i>'s musical references are to non-musical media, it's kind of unclear what its purpose is. It's technically an electronic music album,, but while Kavinsky came out of the same French dance music scene as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a>, the album doesn't really work as dance music-- the beats are never the center of the production, and they're too rigid anyhow. A lot of the songs come off like synth-emulated rock, but the lack of vocals on any of them aside from ""First Blood""-- which has a high-pitched contribution from the British singer Tyson that would have sounded good over the end credits to any of the <i>American Ninja</i> movies-- gives them the feel of uncompleted demos by an age-old hair metal band.</p>
<p>Where <i>Outrun</i> unambiguously excels is in inducing a severe case of nostalgia in media consumers of a certain age. There's something in Kavinsky's evocation of 1986 that affects a primal part of my psyche. It took me a while to figure out that it has its finger right on the exact time where video games and movies taught me to lose myself in screens for days at a time.</p></div>"|17765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17765-kavinsky-outrun/|6.3|Miles Raymer

<p>Since 1986, <a href=""http://www.document-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Document Records</a> has been engaged in a vigorous hustle to reissue every pre-war blues song ever commercially recorded, while periodically doling out other forms of rural American music (gospel, old-time, country) recorded between 1900 and 1943. Many of Document's old LP pressings are expensive if not backbreaking to procure, but for anyone who discovered the country-blues that way, they represent a kind of sacred gateway-- those stark white covers, that black block type, a grainy photograph, some mystifying voice eeking out from the grooves. Still, Document's engineers are notorious for their overuse of noise reduction filters, which impose a shrill flatness on performances sourced from decaying 78rpm records, and in the 78 re-mastering community-- a terrifying micro-universe presided over by Yazoo Records' Richard Nevins-- Document remains a source of moderate derision. </p>
<p>Which is why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a>'s decision to reissue selections from the Document vault (beginning with Patton, Blind Willie McTell, and the Mississippi Sheiks) on his Third Man label can feel like the apotheosis of a very specific kind of fetishization. The blues, maybe more than any other American genre, is subject to endless mythologizing-- it is famously apocryphal, shrouded in crossroads-at-midnight mystery. Those romantic notions are, as <i>In Search of the Blues</i> author Marybeth Hamilton points out, ""enormously seductive."" It feels good to position the blues as a singularly raw, marginalized expression, to champion its so-called strangeness; the magnetism of those narratives can blind a listener to everything else. For White, those Document LPs led him directly to a well of source material that later fed an entire body of work (if not an identity), and these reissues feel like an expression of earnest gratitude to the label. What they don't always feel like is an appropriate paean to the music. </p>
<p>Charley Patton's <i>Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order, Vol. 1</i> collects all the sides from Patton's 1929 sessions for the Grafton, Wisc.-based Paramount Records. A Delta-born guitarist and singer, and widely considered the finest practitioner of pre-war, acoustic country-blues, Patton possesses a throaty, lawless voice, which he employs to staggering ends. Blues music can be spiritually crushing, but it can also be caddish, if not obscene: On ""Pony Blues"", listen to Patton's raunchy, snarled delivery of a line like ""Baby, saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare/ I'm gonna find a rider, baby, in the world somewhere."" Bluesmen knew torment, but they also knew the solace of sin. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The songs included here-- some of Patton's best-- are above reproach, and unsurprisingly, this material is not currently under-represented in record shops. If you're after an artifact, Revenant's comprehensive <i>Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton</i>, was a more deserving indulgence, containing seven CDs housed in reproductions of Paramount sleeves (there's also a gold-embossed box, pages of notes and annotations, and a short paperback book by John Fahey), though that is now out of print and terrifyingly expensive. If you're more compelled by fidelity (itself a dicey quantifier as it relates to gouged 78s), Yazoo's <i>Charlie Patton: </i><i>Founder of the Delta Blues 1929-34</i> is peerless, sourced from the cleanest discs and artfully re-mastered by Richard Nevins. If you're immovably devoted to long-playing vinyl, there are the gray-market European releases, including five (note- and source-less) LPs by the Italian label Monk, and the scads of reissues cooked up and released by various imprints since Patton was first deified by collectors in the 1940s. If you're less concerned with the material world, most of these songs are now instantaneously accessible via Spotify and iTunes. In 2013, there are many roads to 1929-- which makes the basic utility of White's mission dubious. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And at the risk of assuming the persnickety, exacting voice of a 78 collector-- that high, lonesome sound!-- the package itself is underwhelming. Patton's name is spelled both Charley and Charlie, depending on where you look (for whatever it's worth, it appears on the original Paramount 78s as ""Charley,"" although many believe Patton himself preferred ""Charlie""), and the accompanying essay, by the British critic Mick Middles, is not without grammatical blunders (Middles also quantifies Patton's influence by noting that he's been name-checked in song titles by Bob Dylan and the ""British indie band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1754-gomez/"" target=""_blank"">Gomez</a>,"" which seems like a deeply preposterous way to compute his legacy). There's also a mistake in the track-listing on my copy: ""Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues"" is the second song on Side B, not Side A, where it's been swapped with ""Shake It and Break It (But Don't Let It Fall Mama)"". (I will now attempt-- and fail-- to resist pointing out that the “But” should also be out of the parenthesis in the title of that track). In White's curated universe-- where the idiosyncratic and the analog are prized, aesthetics are multi-dimensional, and the presentation of art is as essential as the art itself-- it seems like a more exacting approach should have been applied. Or: if you’re gonna be precious about your shit, be precious about your shit.  </p>
<p>The other two records in the bundle fare better. Blind Willie McTell, a Piedmont-style fingerpicker from Georgia, came up as a street performer before he was recruited to record for Victor in 1927, and he enjoyed a relatively prolific career before his death in 1959. The tremble in his voice is echoed, often, in White's own vocals-- it's a stunning little wobble, an undulating admission of total vulnerability. White, like McTell, knows how effective it can be; it's nearly impossible to dislike McTell, even when he's opining the various women he's already bedded today (""One for in the morning, one for late at night/ I got one for noontime, to treat your old daddy right,"" he warbles in ""Three Women Blues""). Although McTell's work has been reissued before, his records aren't as rare as Patton's, and were rendered in better studios (ergo: they sound better), so the question of what gets obscured or highlighted in the re-mastering is less pressing. And while Middles could stand to stop using Bob Dylan as justification for liking blues music (he invokes Dylan's 1983 track, ""Blind Willie McTell"", in his opening line), the reissue feels more benign than egregious. Same goes for the Mississippi Sheiks, a guitar-and-fiddle family band from Bolton, Mississippi whose ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpR_iYo3CK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sitting on Top of the World</a>"", first recorded for Okeh in 1930, has since been covered by Bob Wills, Cream, the Grateful Dead, Frank Sinatra, Bill Monroe, Howlin' Wolf, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVeGTX573j8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a> (on the <i>Cold Mountain</i> soundtrack). For a Sheiks fan anxious to hear these songs on vinyl-- and who can't find the Monk records, or the Matchbox Records releases from the mid-1980s-- whatever new re-mastering current Document owner Gary Atkinson performed yielded worthwhile results: the singer Walter Vinson, performing ""Driving That Thing"", sounds close, clear. </p>
<p>In the spirit of the Folkways archive, White has pledged to keep these records in print (on vinyl) ""as long as Third Man Records exists."" His intentions seem pure, and any gesture that makes these songs more available to listeners should be appreciated, if not applauded (although in this particular case, White may have flubbed an opportunity to champion a more obscure artist, like Big Bill Broonzy or Johnnie Temple). But it's still imperative to remember that blues music-- its nuances and devastations, its cadences and riddles-- should be heard and appreciated beyond whatever personal or cultural subtexts we might choose to apply to it; that the sound is the thing. There are good reasons to reissue extant material, but it's hard to recognize any here.</p></div>"|17727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17727-the-mississippi-sheiks-blind-willie-mctell-charley-patton-the-complete-recorded-works-in-chronological-order-volume-1/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

The surrealist trad-rockers were last active back in the mid-2000s, when they generated a decent amount of buzz based on one EP (2004’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8535-the-concretes-always-grayer-on-the-other-side-of-the-street-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Concrete’s Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street</i></a>) and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9756-vietnam/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled full-length</a> released in 2007 featuring guest vocals from Jenny Lewis and production by Beachwood Sparks’ Dave Scher and (weirdly) Mickey Madden of Maroon 5. After that, VietNam just sort of faded away. Given how <i>VietNam </i>didn’t exactly set the world on fire commercially, it seemed safe to assume that these guys shaved off their beards and took office jobs somewhere.</p>
<p>But, alas, head ’Nammer Michael Gerner kept the faith, and after several years of focusing his creative energy on film soundtracks and his solo project DA, he has assembled a new version of VietNam and recorded the band’s first album in six years, <i>An</i> <i>A.merican D.ream. </i>The passage of time did nothing to dilute Gerner’s ambition: Just as <i>VietNam </i>was a sprawling mess of stoner poetry and extemporaneous jams, <i>An</i><i> A.merican D.ream </i>is a record thoroughly enamored with the thrilling possibilities and tired clichés of classic rock. For Gerner, each song is an opportunity to make a mind-blowing, motherfucking <i>statement-- </i>he pushes, stretches, elongates, and expounds every lyric and musical element, adding a couple of minutes of ambient noise to the bloat for good measure. Gerner’s best musical asset is unquestionably his conviction, as he speaks and performs utter bullshit with the fervor of a true believer. With his penchant for wordplay and the druggy, let-it-all-hang-out formlessness of Neil Young’s early 70s albums, he has the attitude and tastes of a great singer-songwriter. What he doesn’t have are the songs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Vietnam are not exactly understated or ideologically sophisticated. Gerner last checked out during the final throes of the Bush administration, and now that he’s back he’s not about to let the intervening years go without a chin-stroke-y remark or several. The one-minute piano dirge “1.20.09” memorializes Obama’s first inauguration by cursing out corporations picking through the “bones of human rights.” On the spacey “Blasphemy Blues”, Gerner plays a “dirty little devil” with a pitchfork and a “tail in my pocket” (we’re talking here about a <i>literal </i>devil, because of course) spying evil people lurking amid “mansions inside mansions inside mansions.” The campy would-be epic “W.orld W.ar W.orries” aspires to be “Desolation Row” and winds up somewhere closer to “Eve of Destruction”-- Gerner blares pseudo-profound gibberish (“I kill my wife/ I kill my brother/ For this trick/ Why do I bother”) for more than three minutes before anything resembling a song materializes, and then prattles on for several <i>more</i> minutes about post-modern confusion. “We’re all goin’ crazy from these visions in our heads,” he sings. Totally, dude. <i>Totally.</i></p>
<p>As silly as the songs on <i>an A.merican D.ream </i>are, it is Gerner’s wincingly theatrical vocals that really take the album into the realm of unintentional comedy. The ""self-serious hippie"" archetype is easy to make fun of, though Gerner’s passionate commitment to the material makes Vietnam oddly compelling. The amount of hyperbolic earnestness on display is bracing and, frankly, kind of refreshing given how aloofness is the default posture for so many indie bros these days. <i>An American Dream </i>was made by a guy drunk on delusions of grandeur-- even if Gerner whiffs more often than not, at least he’s swinging for the fences.</p></div>"|17635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17635-vietnam-an-american-dream/|4.7|Steven Hyden

Or at least he lives for the same yesterday as lots of his contemporaries. When Damage came up several years ago, his work-- solo and with frequent collaborators Venom and Doc Daneeka-- traced the move of UK producers to the sounds of early house music. Damage and Daneeka contemporized them by adding aspects of UK Funky and bass music, though last year's <i>They!Live</i> didn't live up to the promise of early single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNOhp-byxrQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Creeper""</a>. On <i>Heliosphere</i>, Damage's first solo album, he moves into the harsher, straightline realm of rave techno, a resurgent style invigorated by a flood of European producers returning to the industrial climes of UK thrashers like Surgeon and Female.</p>
<p>Damage's techno productions are a lot like his house tracks: good but a little generic. The album doesn't feel retro or modern, just careful and deliberate. Damage isn't an extremist; the 10 tracks on <i>Heliosphere</i> don't hurdle forward, storm noisily, or threaten. The malicious UK variety of techno that Damage borrows from was nihilistic, and had as much in common with noise or hardcore as funk and disco. (It even <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=33352"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looked like hardcore</a>, sometimes.) Damage's version is more orderly. Even when <i>Heliosphere</i> whips itself into a frenzy, like during the breakneck revving of ""Delirium Tremens"", it does so safely, never coercing.</p>
<p>Despite a couple of intriguing, spaced-out interludes that have much in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>'s inky psychedelia, the album carries on predictably, checking off boxes: punishing banger (""Extrusion""), acid workout (""Spirals""), piano-led stomper (""0I0x""). It's a techno buffet, a place where detail is sacrificed for variety. And that's the problem: there's little here that Damage could call his own, no characteristic drum treatments, few memorable snaps of melody. The sequences are short and compact; the whole album sounds like it was laid out with a protractor and graph paper. The album's best, most assured moments are those slower tracks. ""End Days"" is silky and assured, a twirling ribbon of synthesizers set atop tittering hi-hats. Moody table-setter ""Laika"" is menacing and foggy.</p>
<p>This kind of concrete, warehouse dance music demands grayness, but the tension on <i>Heliosphere</i> is like the tension during the opening scene of an action film: we know the principals can't die yet, so there's nothing at stake. And like an action flick, the cared-for, excellently produced content-- here, ashy noise for partying, there, people being shot and buildings blowing up-- masks the project's ultimate conservatism. Which is a shame, because Damage definitely has the ear for this music. It's his voice he needs to locate.</p></div>"|17652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17652-benjamin-damage-heliosphere/|6.0|Andrew Gaerig

By the time Arthur Ashin <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8992-autre-ne-veut"">revealed himself</a> in 2012, all of those characteristics had become basic tools of indie rock buzzmaking. Though prevailing trends have positioned Autre Ne Veut closer to the center of discussion, he remains quite outré on new album<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/35-anxiety/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Anxiety</i></a>. The cover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48994-autre-ne-veut-removes-image-of-edvard-munchs-the-scream-painting-from-album-cover/"" target=""_blank"">no longer bears a replication</a> of Edvard Munch's <i>The Scream</i>, but he kept <i>Anxiety </i>as the album title<i>; </i>you can't say he didn't warn you about him losing his cool time and time again on his marvelous and moving second LP.</p>
<p>While by far his most accessible work to date, Ashin's busy hands keep <i>Anxiety</i> off-kilter throughout. The touches of dissonance help convey the message of each song: brash sax honks evoke the morbid discomfort of ""Counting""; the yearning ""Don't Ever Look Back"" hitches on sharp feedback before giving into harmonized hair-metal guitars; as ""Play by Play"" restlessly prepares for its massive chorus, Ashin's voice is layered and deformed with sudden fits of pitch-shifting. While Ashin's past as a jingle writer manifests in focusing every song with a melody that sticks, they're not the kind of tunes I imagine being belted out by the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPGiJCzSK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kids chorus at PS 22</a>. His melodic sense feels more intuitive, looping and darting perilously. They can initially come off as harsh before the warmth courses through; repeat the experience four or five times and you might want to go hug someone.</p>
<p>That much is played out in <i>Anxiety's</i> bookends, songs that are structured to deliver tremendous codas with extremely different effects. Opener ""Play by Play"" has a ""Purple Rain""-like gospel build, as oddly juxtaposed harmonies rising and crashing with every round; it's conceivable that <i>Anxiety </i>could buckle under the weight of its impact after only five minutes.<i> </i>The comparatively sedate closer ""World War"" fizzles into electronic static mid-way through, easing out into a resigned duet that thematically connects with ""Play by Play"" to give <i>Anxiety </i>a sense of cycle. The message of ""Play by Play"" was ""don't ever leave me alone,"" on ""World War,"" he pleads, ""no way you'll ever be my baby.""</p>
<p>In between, that polarity of desire and disappointment is fully explored by Ashin's erratic and ecstatic voice. Describing its tone doesn't quite convey its appeal, nor does it demonstrate how much of an acquired taste it is. His glass-shattering falsetto runs and chesty bleats transform <i>Anxiety </i>from a great pop record into something powerfully therapeutic, more about casting off inhibitions than actually hitting those high notes.</p>
<p>It's the sort of performance typically ascribed to the hyper-emotive subgenres of rock, so it's no surprise it works splendidly on unhinged songs like ""Ego Free Sex Free"" and ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"". The latter doesn't quote Whitney Houston like his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49389-watch-autre-ne-veut-perform-counting-and-new-song-world-war-on-pitchforktv/"">recent solo rendition of ""World War""</a> did; he simply captures the unchecked desires conveyed in the title. The enduring surprise of <i>Anxiety </i>is that Ashin's nervy approach works just as well on the ballads, his voice lending an edge to songs that might otherwise slip into filler territory. His performance is toned down only somewhat on ""A Lie"", ""Gonna Die"", and ""World War"", the titles of which give you an idea of the phenomenal stakes Ashin can create vocally. There's sadness in these songs, certainly-- but while they sound like slow dances, they <i>feel</i> like the entire universe caving in on Ashin.</p>
<p>It could certainly be a turn-off, or at least criticized as ""oversinging."" But the demonstrative nature of Autre Ne Veut is pretty much the point, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9017-the-top-50-albums-of-2012/3/"">as with</a> collaborator and peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>, it has as much in common with Broadway as it does with R&amp;B; you imagine he's drawn to this style of music because it's a means to a kind of spiritual transcendence that most rock music isn't particularly interested in. So it's understandable that ""Ego Free Sex Free"" becomes something of a mantra for <i>Anxiety</i>. On its face, it's a curious slogan-- typically, we prefer pop stars to indulge in ego and certainly avail themselves of carnality. But judging from Ashin's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8992-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">explanation</a> regarding the song's inspiration, you can see what he means by it, how the neediness of the self can stand in the way of true and meaningful connection. Yes, it's completely corny and I'm pretty sure it's the reasoning behind every nudist colony. And yet, it fits within the context of <i>Anxiety</i>, an album where Ashin fearlessly reveals himself as a person and an artist and dares you to open up in the same way.</p></div>"|17645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17645-autre-ne-veut-anxiety/|8.5|Ian Cohen

It's a trip the now L.A.-based Dominick Fernow has been prolifically and prophetically plugging away at for well over a decade, carving out a reputation for ferociously uncompromising sonics with an inquisitive air. Having taken a pleasurable detour toward grinding synth pop on his 2011 releases <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bermuda Drain</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16006-times-arrow/"">Time's Arrow</a>,</i> with <i>Through the Window</i>, Fernow convincingly throws himself to the growling hounds of techno.</p>
<p><i>Through The Window</i> is an overtly theatrical body of work even by the standards of the worlds it straddles: the high camp of metal, the existential roar of noise, and techno's ritualism. Its three tracks even function like the three acts of the archetypal quest tale, spanning the journey, the obstacle, and the reward. ""Through the Window"" sets the scene for Prurient's techno rebirth before ""Terracotta Spine"" issues a blood-curdling screech of noisy resistance, which we're gratefully delivered from by the still-ominous yet tonally triumphant ""You Show Great Spirit"": our reward for endurance though, of course, there's joy to be found in the enduring itself. That final act builds seductively in waves, a delicious drowning that leaves the sharp tang of aluminum on the lips. While each track could be enjoyed on its own merits, the three tracks need one another, requiring the other's context and contrast.</p>
<p>Fernow's command of texture is in full, swaggering flow throughout. Underneath the pummeling rhythms of ""Through the Window"" lies a sea of writhing life-- adrenaline-laden breathing, static clicks, the prickling of erect hairs-- while, later, in the final moments of ""You Show Great Spirit"", we're left with the chip-chip-chink of metal against metal, fragments dropping to a stone floor. These are loose ends, sure, but all the more intriguing for it. There's a similar approach to melody too. It comes and goes, weaving in and out with a gently shifting intricacy yet refuses to submit to convention.</p>
<p>Unlike the aforementioned <i>Time's Arrow </i>and <i>Bermuda Drain</i>,<i> </i>which featured foregrounded vocals (somewhat controversially to noise purists), Fernow's voice drops to a barely discernible, deathly whisper on <i>Through the Window</i>. ""Big things grow much bigger/ And need bigger things inside them,"" he intones archly, which could be read as a clue to his own evolution, and that of the wider noise scene. When sonics themselves have lost their power to shock and excite-- or when we are too comfortable with the old ways of feeling uncomfortable-- we look elsewhere to revive the sensation. Little wonder contemporary techno's diametric binding of ritualistic rhythms and elastic form appealed.</p>
<p>""Noise used to be a place that was devoid of expectations,"" Fernow told <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/prurient"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Tiny Mix Tapes</a> in 2011. ""But there are people who have been working 24 hours a day to make it into a genre of music like any other with a set of rules and regulations, which to me is the antithesis of noise ideology. So I have no problems with not being categorized as such, because that word has come to mean the opposite of what it should."" Some 15 years on from his first Prurient album, it is thrilling to still hear the vigor in his searching; in his questioning of restrictions and extending of freedoms. This gripping chapter in his exploration might not quite be his definitive statement, but then definitive has never been of interest to Fernow.</p></div>"|17665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17665-prurient-through-the-window/|7.4|Ruth Saxelby

Recorded over a year and a half and produced by the band (with an assist from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4760-the-radio-dept/"" target=""_blank"">Radio Dept.</a> affiliate Johannes Berglund), <i>Optica</i> is warm, expansive, and swimming in strings. Judiciously paced, too: Clocking in just under an hour, there's not a hasty second to be found among these dozen tracks. The Shout Out Louds took their sweet time with <i>Optica</i>, and it shows: the production's richer, more inviting, their movements more deliberate. But the romantic desperation that carried this band's pre-Work output is hard to come by on <i>Optica</i>, an okay enough widescreen synth-pop record with some major urgency issues.</p>
<p>Matching the electroid strut of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Flaming Lips</a>' ""Fight Test"" to any major key Cure single, the rousing, skywritten melody under opener ""Sugar"" is easy to get lost in. Current single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14931-illusions/"" target=""_blank"">Illusions</a>"" follows, a glimmering New Order tribute destined to pad out dance night playlists in the months to come. Things start to slip around ""Blue Ice"", a swoony New Romantic puddle dripping with lousy puns (""Blue Ice"" becomes ""blue eyes"" that ""came out of the blue,"" which, well, yikes) and a limp, hushed-for-a-reason melody. Mercifully, Arcade Fire-y corker ""14th of July"" sweeps in to the blood going a bit, but it's only when Adam Olenius starts singing that you'll start seeing red. ""Take me to the room where you grew up,"" he requests, before adding ""I bet it's got a great view/ I bet no one loves you.""</p>
<p>It's a strange moment, maybe <i>Optica</i>'s strangest. And while it's not a great line on its own, the sheer abruptness of it all offers a brief but badly needed respite from the synth-dappled serenity that surrounds it. <i>Optica</i>'s a pleasant enough record on the whole, but it suffers from a kind of excessive competence: at this point in the game, the Shout Out Louds are seemingly incapable of penning a genuinely lousy tune, but as with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13805-work/"" target=""_blank"">Work</a>,</i> they're having some trouble settling on a truly inspiring one. What Pitchfork's Marc Hogan wrote about <i>Work</i>-- ""all innocuous midtempo thrum and vague yearning""-- seems every bit as applicable here; These songs tend to float along on sturdy but unspectacular melodies, agreeable enough not to send you across the room looking for the pause button but rarely so gripping you'll remember one song by the time the next one gets going.<br/><br/>The band's year-and-change in the studio wasn't for naught, and the mostly self-produced <i>Optica</i> proves the Shout Out Louds' worth behind the boards. Every surface on <i>Optica</i> shimmers, and every close listen turns up more spangles to dislodge from your earlobes. But <i>Optica</i>'s detail-oriented sonics can't quite make up for some of its big picture deficiencies, imprecise emotions and melodies that feel rounded off at the edges to discourage friction. The Shout Out Louds deserve their propers for bringing a little more color back into their sound in the wake of <i>Work</i>'s Dockers-clad drudgery. But, much like its predecessor, <i>Optica</i>'s pervasive mildness doesn't give you much to latch onto.</p></div>"|17644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17644-shout-out-louds-optica/|5.8|Paul Thompson

He uses cheap keyboards, chained pedals, field recordings, and knick-knacks to brew his blown-out, euphoric tunes, and records them on an ancient PC. The precarious setup translates into punchy instrumentals instilled with the raw energy of punk. This is noise pop that doesn't stint on either side of the bargain, striking a perfect balance between cataclysmic and catchy.</p>
<p>Friel does not remotely fuck around in getting <a href=""http://danfriel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Total Folklore</i></a> started: ""Ulysses"" is a beautiful bastard of a noise pop jam that lasts for almost 13 exhilarating minutes. From the filthy bass and shattering drums to his suspenseful squeals and wriggly neon accents, every part is vicious and volatile. Friel corrals all this unruliness with a heaving boom-clap beat that he keeps milling down to an earthquake-low rumble before rebuilding it differently, with audible allusions to prog, hair metal, trancy electro, and even 90s slacker rock.</p>
<p>Meting out earworms and explosive drops until the end, Friel earns every minute of ""Ulysses"". It fills a good third of the album, and you might imagine it would leave you worn out for the remainder. But ""Ulysses"" is so energizing that the shorter tracks seem to whiz by, with plenty of highlights among the desultory interstitials. There’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14089-valedictorian/"">""Valedictorian""</a>, a sweetly screaming anthem in the style of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>; ""Scavengers"", with its nasty groove and drunkenly weaving pitch, and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14829-thumper/"">""Thumper""</a>, where a touching melody ripples rapidly.</p>
<p>Still, no one could be expected to sustain the maniacal force of ""Ulysses"" for longer than Friel already does, and the following tracks can't help but pale a little in its shadow. They settle into slightly more prosaic electro pop proportions and cadences, becoming more reliant on distortion than structural instability. Long rows of evenly pulsing notes paired with streaming harmonies make for a low-stakes default mode. But when an album's mild downsides are all relative to its overwhelming strengths, it's hard to complain.</p></div>"|17622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17622-dan-friel-total-folklore/|7.7|Brian Howe

Their krautrock grooves are given menace with Rousseau's screams and the overpowering low-end of Rusty's bass. Each song is laced with sonic tinges that invoke an uneasy, dark haze of psychedelics (see titles ""Druglore"", ""Smoke Dreams""). In their delivery, there's an undercurrent of hostility and snarling anger (see titles ""Evil Man"", ""Exterminate"", <i>Void</i>). Nearly every song offers the aural equivalent of walking into a bar full of stereotypical biker toughs-- everything's muscular, intimidating, mean. Now might be a good time for a reminder: This band's name is ""Destruction Unit."" </p>
<p><i>Void</i>'s strengths are in the band's song structuring. On ""Evil Man"", the formula of ""simmering lead-in"" to ""drum crash"" to ""simmering verse"" to ""wall of sound,"" all backed by a melody marked by catchiness, is foolproof. In general, they've got ""the drop"" pretty well figured out. For a track that's eight minutes long, ""Smoke Dreams"" is consistently riveting. Their well-established sprawling kraut echo hangs above their more muscular leanings, continuously morphing over Flores' drum attack. And when a track features vocals, Rousseau's darkwave-tinted voice is perfectly suited to this sort of material. The strongest song by a mile, though, is ""Exterminate""-- three minutes of punk rock bite washed in synths and the band's signature kraut sonics. </p>
<p>But in its six tracks, the title <i>Void </i>proves to be an unfortunate one-- there's an unmistakable emptiness to the album. There are interesting guitar flourishes in the almost eight minutes of ""Druglore"", but mostly, it just sits there simmering while not really going anywhere. Even a song like ""Blame"", which benefits from bellowing vocals and crashing percussion at the midpoint, is made less interesting by its too-long simmer and overly repetitive elements.</p>
<p>With the complementary sounds they implement-- the ones that brings to mind the desert-- it's understandable that there's some desolation here. But that doesn't mean the album itself has to sag. Structurally speaking, <i>Void</i> is fairly similar to a recent LP from the other end of the United States: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16659-deep-thuds/""><i>Deep Thuds</i></a> by the Philadelphia band <a href=""http://spacin.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacin'</a>. Both feature lengthier atmospheric songs punctuated by tracks with firmer melodies. Here, the spaciness is just too spacey and the hooks aren't quite there. Even when you disregard ""hooks"" or ""catchiness"" and stack this album next to the recent work of Moon Duo/Wooden Shjips mastermind Ripley Johnson,<i> Void</i> feels thin by comparison. There are strong songs and moments, absolutely-- just not enough.</p></div>"|17745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17745-destruction-unit-void/|6.4|Evan Minsker

Atoms for Peace is likewise his attempt to liberate himself from the burden of being Thom Yorke, shirking the added psychoanalytical interpretations that solo releases inevitably attract by receding into an all-star cast (complete with a name-- cribbed from a Dwight Eisenhower <a href=""http://www.world-nuclear-university.org/about.aspx?id=8674&amp;terms=atoms%20for%20peace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">speech</a> and subsequent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms_for_Peace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">program</a> by way of an <i>Eraser</i> track-- that sounds like some one-off 1980s charity-single supergroup). From the similarly greyscale Stanley Donwood cover art on down, <i>AMOK</i> is essentially Yorke's follow-up to <i>The Eraser,</i> backed by the band that performed the album's songs during a handful of live dates over 2009-10: producer/multi-instrumentalist Nigel Godrich, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, David Byrne percussionist Mauro Refosco, and drummer Joey Waronker (a.k.a. the 21<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">st</span>-century <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keltner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Keltner</a>).</p>
<p>Actually, ""performed"" is a gross understatement—in the hands of Atoms for Peace, <i>The Eraser</i>'s songs were utterly transformed from skeletal synth sketches into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cOV6aVI3UY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">full-blooded, festival-rocking workouts</a> that gave Yorke occasion to test out the dance moves he would later flash in the ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lotus Flower</a>"" video. So there's good reason to believe that vibrant energy would spill over to <i>AMOK</i>. The new record is certainly a more colourful, layered work than <i>The Eraser</i>, and suggests all those late-night, Fela Kuti-soundtracked benders Yorke's <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/q-a-thom-yorke-on-atoms-for-peaces-mechanistic-new-album-20121105#ixzz2BNfrP7r2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about in interviews</a> were as much educational as they were recreational. But if the opening ""Before Your Very Eyes"" faithfully assumes the jittery cadence of 70s Afrobeat, it doesn't seem all that interested in acquiring the same force, preferring to skitter rather than swagger. And it sets the tentative tone for an album that's intricately assembled and rhythmically complex, but oddly inert. ""I made my bed, I'm lying in it,"" Yorke sings early on, a fitting advertisement for the unpredictable artistic course he's charted throughout his career. But over the entirety of <i>AMOK</i>, you get the overwhelming sense that, this time, his sheets are tucked in too tight.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, what this thing really needs is more Flea. While some Radiohead fans may view the union of Yorke's fragile, world-weary croon with Flea's cock-in-a-sock showboating as pure sacrilege, Mr. Slappeh De Bass commendably spends much of <i>AMOK</i> reminding us what a tastefully melodic player he can be when he keeps his right thumb in check. The album's most invigorating moments come when he takes the lead, like on the hypno-funk throb of ""Stuck Together Pieces"" and the mid-song ramp-up on ""Dropped"", whose accelerated, slippery groove indicates that Kevin Shields isn't the only 90s alt-rock icon currently getting mileage from his old drum'n'bass records.</p>
<p>But Flea can't carry the rhythm section alone. <i>AMOK</i> was <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/01/29/170581164/listen-thom-yorke-and-friends-talk-atoms-for-peace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reportedly</a> built through a process of Yorke and Godrich handing over their laptop demos to the rest of the band for their embellishment. But Waronker and Refosco seem more intent on studiously replicating every last click and cut than giving the songs extra width. Instead, <i>AMOK</i> subtly applies its intensity through textural density—like with the fuzzy synth oscillations on ""Before Your Very Eyes"" that threaten to vaporize Yorke's vocal, or the eerie post-apocalyptic drones that permeate the title track's dubstep strut. But in each case, they set you up for a climax that never comes, with the songs pulling back or fading out just as they seem ready to erupt into something more fierce. For all the rhythmic chicanery at play, <i>AMOK</i> feels strangely static and contained, giving a perpetual sense of jogging in place.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be such an issue if Yorke assumed a more commanding presence, but his diffident vocals here-- which favor the hushed, high-register end of his range-- suggest a desire to, if not disappear completely, at least dissolve into the clattering backdrops. For all the electronic abstraction heard on <i>The Eraser</i> and Radiohead's <i>King of Limbs</i>, Yorke's performances were for the most part assertive and forthright, making the songs more impactful than their brittle structures initially suggested. On <i>AMOK</i>, Yorke's lyrics tend to drift in and out of decipherability, his impressionistic protest songs hinging on appropriations of well-worn phrases (""the will is strong, but the flesh is weak"") or withering mantras (""care less, I couldn't care less""). And the more intimate the songs get, the more distant he becomes: the synth-swaddled soul ballad ""Ingenue"" counts as <i>AMOK</i>'s most humane, romantic turn, yet also its most inscrutable.</p>
<p>And that's ultimately the most frustrating thing about <i>AMOK</i>: the fact that you can hear the great potential in every song, and so easily imagine how the hand-clapped hook of ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner,"" the percussive breakdown of ""Unless,"" and the creeping exasperation of ""Reverse Running"" would absolutely pop with a more vigorous attack. No doubt, like <i>The Eraser</i>, these songs will go down a like a storm in a live setting. But, given the caliber of players Yorke has on hand this time around, it's disappointing that we still have to make that assumption.</p></div>"|17632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17632-atoms-for-peace-amok/|6.9|Stuart Berman

The band formed from a record counter friendship between singer Heather McEntire and guitarist Jenks Miller at the since-shuttered Schoolkids Records, on the University of North Carolina campus. On the band's rootsy, countrified second album (and Merge debut)<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/30-miracle-temple/"" target=""_blank""><i> Miracle Temple</i></a>, McEntire sings of a life in a town ruled by student seasons, where you stay after everyone goes, leaving summer wide open. Album opener ""Younger Days"" ends on a question: ""August is over so when are you coming back?"" McEntire sings it with resigned hope: when they're gone, they're gone.</p>
<p>The album is nostalgic for people and times that can't be had again, no matter what magic you attempt. ""You know I really tried, girl/ To lift your small town summer malaise,"" she sings, in ode to a wild girl who just couldn't hang. ""How I tried for years to return there,"" goes ""Union Street Bridge"", recalling misspent youth. Most of the songs are in the past tense and measure the chasm between the innocent spoils of then and the sadness of now by what's been lost in the interim: fearlessness, blind love, the ability to make someone weak in the knees. ""Go on, disappear,"" she sings on ""I Built a Town"", casting out this awful ghost of the perfect past. <i>Miracle Temple</i> orients itself from the knowledge that there is no being restored.</p>
<p>McEntire grew up on Southern Baptist hymns and Springsteen; the influence of both are evident here. The plaintive appeals in her lyrics and the soulful burr in her voice are church skills since refined for secular use. There is some <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> within <i>Miracle Temple</i>; dreams too big for a small town, highways beckoning getaway from all that conspires to keep you there. In lieu of Jersey, high school sweethearts, and Carter-era gloom, it's the Outer Banks, straight girls' drunken flirting, and cruel summers.</p>
<p>But McEntire could be singing about anything with lyrics deep or dumb, and it would hardly matter-- there is that voice of hers. The comparison to young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"" target=""_blank"">Dolly Parton</a> is not undue; the quiver as she gets to the song's emotional center, the way she reigns herself in right before you expect her to belt it. Like Parton, she reserves her big voice for when she needs to bring out the drama. McEntire often gets pegged as post-punk, due to her proximity to the DIY scene she came up in, but on ""White Sands"", she stretches ""kids"" to nearly four syllables (something like ""key-yuh-hid-s"" with a little hiccup in the middle)-- conclusive proof that girl is <i>country</i>.</p>
<p>Alas, the rest of the band is not. They are very much Southern, but that is not that same thing. They lay in and drift a bit between punctuating, shuffling rhythms-- their loose hooks mimicking a drawl. Jenks Miller, a guitarist with enough confidence to occasionally venture solo as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"" target=""_blank"">Horseback</a>, keeps his accompaniment spare; his long single note runs to accent McEntire's melody lines fill in the excited silence.</p>
<p>The album's stand out track is ""I Built a Town"", which is the sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23557-the-muscle-shoals/"" target=""_blank"">Muscle Shoals</a> throwback many attempt and few land. The strings swell, the organ whirrs, and you imagine a bouffanted McEntire, a la <i>Dusty</i> <i>in Memphis</i>, wiping her tears away as the back-up girls coo. She gave it all, and now, now there's nothing. It's easy to imagine that doing an entire record that straight would just be a showy genre exercise for them, but that can't keep a girl from wishing for more. The rest of the band obviously knows that McEntire is the showpiece-- songs like ""Those Girls"" show that they do, setting up her big moments with subtlety and understatement-- reminding us that the real power is in restraint.</p></div>"|17590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17590-mount-moriah-miracle-temple/|7.8|Jessica Hopper

The NOLA native had reason to be defensive, as he's long been written off by some as a weed-rapper and not much more. It's a conclusion drawn from his lyrics, of course, but also from his penchant for beats that ooze thick grooves and soul-rooted instrumentation similar in spirit to other sounds that have characterized druggy music for decades. Curren$y is nothing if not prolific, however, and while he's never made a hard left stylistically, he's tweaked his formula at least slightly each time out over the past couple years, taking on everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9658-hell-hath-no-fury"" target=""_blank""><i>Hell Hath No Fury</i></a>-aping crawl (<i>#The1st28</i> EP's ""Billions"") to prismatic boom-bap (the Alchemist-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/"" target=""_blank""><i>Covert Coup</i></a> EP) to live funk-rock (last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16384-muscle-car-chronicles/"" target=""_blank""><i>Muscle Car Chronicles</i></a>).</p>
<p>That willingness to shake things up is usually pretty subtle-- not the case with <i>New Jet City</i>. Structurally, the tape is similar to 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15820-curreny-verde-terrace/"" target=""_blank""><i>Verde Terrace</i></a>, totaling 45 minutes while split between full-length songs and briefer, chorus-free excursions. But it's more varied than any other Curren$y release, making stops for Stones Throw bricolage (""Living for the City""), Lex Luger ricochet (""Choosin'""), RZA-indebted rumble (""Moe Chettah""), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14160-kush-and-orange-juice"" target=""_blank""><i>Kush and Orange Juice</i></a> drift (""Three 60""). Obviously, pieces as disparate as these could never form a cohesive tape, but <i>New Jet City</i> doesn't really suffer from its lack of ebb and flow. Instead, it's a piecemeal unpacking of why we should continue to follow Curren$y even as he refuses to show up with anything truly new.</p>
<p>This starts, inevitably, with the guy's rapping. Nobody's mistaking Curren$y's for much of a technician, and nothing here will change that; as ever, he sounds like he's just barely trying out there. But while plenty of Curren$y releases have more savory lines than this one, the 31-year-old's charisma and vocal quirks are on full display here. He embeds that enervated, sticky voice of his no problem in all the beats that come his way, sounding great even if he's nowhere near the most quotable he's ever been. (Maybe the best bars on the whole tape: ""Gucci gloves on my fingers/ I'm pointing at the man and I see him in the mirror."" Not bad.)</p>
<p>Knowing that there is a minor shortage of Curren$y's linguistic gifts here, though, it would be reasonable to expect <i>New Jet City</i> to be lacking on the rapping front. Thankfully, the stocked guest selection is strong enough to redeem that and then some. In addition to big names like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a>, former stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss/"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2251-juvenile/"" target=""_blank"">Juvenile</a> appear alongside Curren$y's Jet Life copilots Trademark Da Skydiver and Young Roddy. None of these diverging personalities sticks out as unwelcome. Every last visitor trusts in his strengths to make things come together just right: Lloyd waxes euphoric for his hook on ""Purple Haze"", while Juicy choppily says things like ""I shine like a UV ray/ And I get head like a new toupee"" for ""Three 60"". Some of the collaborations work because of chemistry, some actually benefit from contrast; they all work one way or another, and that's the mark of both these guys as individual talents and of Curren$y's grasp of what will or won't mesh with him.</p>
<p><i>New Jet City</i> has already racked up more DatPiff downloads than Curren$y's last tape, the blaxploitation-based <i>Priest Andretti</i>. But even though there are moments here suggesting that Curren$y is switching up his style to appeal to a broader range of listeners (don't be surprised if the Wiz- and Ross-featuring ""Choosin'"", for instance, turns out to be his biggest song of the year), I'd like to think that he took a go at all these sounds in order to prove just how adaptable he is. For a guy who releases not particularly ambitious music as often as he does (three releases a year, minimum), the idea that he can still be hungry to do things a little different is a pleasing one.</p></div>"|17761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17761-curreny-new-jet-city/|6.9|Mike Madden

If you scoffed, guffawed, or simply disagreed, don't worry-- you're safely in the majority. The Norwegian band are best known, of course, for what their 1999 album labeled ""ravishing grimness""-- savage, belligerent, and unfiltered black metal, epitomized by a blitz of icy hot classics that started with 1992's <i>A Blaze in the Northern Sky</i> and end, depending upon your stance on Second Wave orthodoxy and eclecticism, sometime just before or after the turn of the millennium. They're the dudes that epitomized ghoulish corpsespaint covers, brandished the credo ""True Norwegian Black Metal,"" and fended off Aryan allegations as Varg Vikernes headed to jail. So, no, maybe fun isn't the first adjective Darkthrone conjures.</p>
<p>But it's hard to imagine two middle-aged men having more fun than Fenriz and Nocturno Culto-- the band's lone multi-instrumentalists, songwriters, and singers for two decades now-- do on <i>The Underground Resistance</i>, their inescapably enthusiastic 16th studio album. Darkthrone long ago gave up on black metal, turning instead to an open-ended and unmitigated interest in recombining the metal they loved as kids: thrash and crust punk, high-flying British metal and blustery hardcore. Those influences were always tucked within Darkthrone's most famous albums, but lately they've given over to them entirely. The simple joy of these influences is the thread that ties together <i>The Underground Resistance</i>, an album about unfit enemies and deserved death that nevertheless delights in its own music-making élan. Darkthrone's already been involved in a movement that revolutionized heavy metal both sonically and stylistically; <i>The Underground Resistance</i>, then, is simply the latest and most propulsive homage to the bands that sparked that revolution for them.</p>
<p>In the early days of Darkthrone, Fenriz didn't give many interviews, or at least he didn't say much in them. These days, though, he writes liner notes in which he conveys his influences and intentions. And <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bandoftheweekblog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Metal Band of the Week blog</a> advocates for young acts he likes and older acts he thinks went overlooked. He's made up for that early media quiet by seemingly giving interviews to most anyone who has asked. In doing so, he's often surprised journalists with his forthrightness and humor. ""Isn't it normal to want to communicate your life's work?” <a href=""http://thatshowkidsdie.com/2010/06/08/interview-darkthrone/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he asked That’s How Kids Die</a>, questioning those surprised by his newfound verbosity. For a guy who once posed in corpsepaint, he sure uses a lot of emoticons and <a href=""http://www.nocturnalcult.com/Fenrizdarkthrone2012int.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">knows a lot about <i>Pink Panther</i></a>.</p>
<p>But Fenriz rightly insists that there's not a lot of humor in Darkthrone's new music. (With a song sporting a name like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14867-leave-no-cross-unturned/"" target=""_blank"">""Leave No Cross Unturned""</a>, though, there is certainly some.) Still, <i>The Underground Resistance</i> flaunts the sort of vigor you'd expect from old friends out to have a good time: ""Dead Early"" is a menacing five-minute race that suggests Motörhead loaded on piss and vinegar, while the relentless chug of ""Lesser Men"" pogoes from circle-pit invocations to head-down, horns-up headbanging. ""Valkyrie"" begins with a classic doom feint, craggy acoustic guitars introducing a riff that unfurls over cascading drums. They return to that slow burn for the coda, but the middle is all blustery thrash, with Fenriz chasing himself in circles behind the drums while his falsetto peaks above the din. The album's real clincher, ""Come Warfare, the Entire Doom"", is a series of swivels and sprints, once again teasing doom before harnessing the band’s death metal past in an eight-minute anthem. The aforementioned ""Leave No Cross Unturned"", the disc's 14-minute finale and the longest song ever in the Darkthrone catalog, confirms the band’s gumption to simply go for anything. They hint at Saxon and Maiden with operatic vocals and an incredibly sharp hook and then at punk with the blissfully simple but successful outro. What’s more, Fenriz and Nocturnal Culto even circle back toward their weighty black metal reputation with the blanket of serrated guitars near the song’s start. A few minutes later, Fenriz howls from some deep abyss. In turn, they leave no relevant idea unturned.</p>
<p>Fenriz and Nocturno Culto own one of the great unimpeachable brands in all of heavy metal, and they've protected it not by limiting it but by letting it expand and fluctuate as need be. Rather than retread what's made them famous, Darkthrone have continually confirmed their status by refusing to kowtow to old expectations. They don't play live, and they don't depend on this band for their income; therefore, they don’t need this band to sound like it did it 1993 so they can cash in on the past rather than risk their image on the present. Amid tides of ceaseless band reunions and reissues that more often than not repeat what we already knew, Darkthrone in 2013 find themselves in an extremely enviable position because they have done exactly what they've wanted. Legends encumbered by being legends, they stick true to the title of <i>The Underground Resistance</i>-- they are two veterans having fun by continuing to play like they're carefree teenage rebels. </p></div>"|17642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17642-darkthrone-the-underground-resistance/|7.4|Grayson Currin

Now that Kevin Shields was ""back"" orchestrating perfect storms of ugliness and beauty, would it put dozens, if not hundreds, of ineffectual <i>faux­-</i>gazer outfits out of business? The answer is: not exactly. But it does put records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29336-dog-bite/"" target=""_blank"">Dog Bite</a>'s new <i>Velvet Changes </i>in a fresh, not-so-flattering perspective.</p>
<p>Dog Bite is an Atlanta-based group fronted by Phil Jones, an artist and musician whose most notable gig to date is playing keyboards in Washed Out's touring band. On his own in Dog Bite (which includes members of Mood Rings, Balkans, and Red Sea), Jones applies a chillwave sensibility to the late 80s/early 90s reverbed-out dream-pop template. The songs on <i>Velvet Changes </i>unfold more or less as expected: The tempos are languid, the guitars are chiming and luminous, the bass lines are melodic though not particularly forceful, and the drumming is tepid. Dog Bite fetishizes iconic sounds without investing them with any of the transcendent emotion-- be it fury, sorrow, exhilaration, or a mix of all three-- normally associated with those sounds. What <i>Velvet Changes </i>offers instead of genuine feeling is superficial prettiness that reads as callow once you venture an inch deep into the murk.</p>
<p>The album-opening ""Forever, Until"" putters forward on a moderately brisk rhythm guitar strum, which contrasts with Jones' expressionless, soporific vocal. The delivery of ""Forever, Until"" makes it impossible to discern what exactly Jones is warbling about, though by the next track, the vaguely danceable ""Supersoaker,"" this seems like a blessing. ""Hot dream/ Warm touch/ Cool bed/ You're tough,"" Jones sings with a boyish sigh-- a nonsensical line that's especially vacuous given the drowsy musical surroundings. At least ""Native America"" has an engaging, syncopated rhythm that briefly wipes the sleep out of Dog Bite's eyes. But like the rest of <i>Velvet Changes</i>, ""Native America"" doesn't build over five minutes so much as repeat itself to the point of tedium. A lack of musical sophistication or a dearth of good songwriting-- no matter the culprit for <i>Velvet Changes</i>' problems, Dog Bite has little to say and a severely limited vocabulary with which to say it.</p>
<p>Aside from the rare musical flourish, like the progged-out synth that squiggles its way into the back half of ""Prettiest Pills"", <i>Velvet Changes </i>is one long, predictable drone. The classic records that inspired Dog Bite specialize in creating an air of mystery that draws you deeper into the music and your own heart. All <i>Velvet Changes </i>creates is a disquieting malaise that deflects any attempt to penetrate its billowy, monochromatic, meaningless contours.</p></div>"|17704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17704-dog-bite-velvet-changes/|4.6|Steven Hyden

But he shines when he really pushes things, playing up the unpredictable smooth-yet-sharp timbre of his voice and pitting it against a deviation of R&amp;B that's not quite beholden to a specific style. When <i>Jamie Lidell</i>'s lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14574-what-a-shame/"" target=""_blank"">""What a Shame""</a> debuted last fall, it was an encouraging bellwether, a bristling fusion of current dance and R&amp;B trends that lurched and pulsed like crossover dubstep used to a few years before the EDM craze enlisted it in the loudness wars. ""What a Shame"" did what great alt pop should do: sound radio-friendly while not entirely sounding like much else on the radio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of <i>Jamie Lidell</i> sounds like everything else on the radio-- more specifically, those transmissions hanging 25 light years out in space that are still beaming signals from 1988. And while there are worse sins than aiming for a faithful recreation of every Reagan baby's favorite rollerskate jams and almost succeeding, there's also a failure to distinguish itself from the precedents it pays tribute to-- a simulation that's almost instantly forgettable, especially in the wake of adventurous oddity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14273-compass/"" target=""_blank""><i>Compass</i></a>. Everything that makes Lidell unique is buried under a fog of spot-the-reference touchstones, a predictable pop funk pastiche that points towards the obvious forerunners-- the Minneapolis sound of Prince and Jam/Lewis; <i>In Square Circle</i> Stevie; red codpiece-era Cameo-- but doesn't do much to expand on the form.</p>
<p>Not that this keeps him from cranking out a couple decent songs. ""So Cold"" has this spaced-out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Love Below </i></a>outtake feel to it that builds from a wounded, disoriented intro into a frost-covered sheen of hazy boogie funk, and its terse yet anxious keyboard solo is the liveliest moment on the record. The New Jack Swing mutation of ""In Your Mind"" is deconstructive without being smarmy about it; slightly off-kilter synths and burbly digital bass run interference, but energize the backbeat instead of derailing it. Sadly, there's little else that sticks in the compositions, which seem to play it safe compared to the borderline iconoclastic 80s funk homages like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4777-multiply/"" target=""_blank""><i>Multiply</i></a>'s ""When I Come Back Around"" or ""I Wanna Be Your Telephone"" from <i>Compass</i>. Most of this could remind veteran R&amp;B fans that they'd be better off listening to actual solo Roger Troutman (""Do Yourself a Faver"") or <i>Running Scared </i>soundtrack Michael McDonald (""Big Love"") than blurry Xeroxes. And considering how similar tributes to the same era from mainstream R&amp;B and pop figures ranging from Ne-Yo to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Timberlake</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">the-Dream</a> have been a standard ploy for years, it only stands out that much more just how risky this stuff <i>isn't</i>. Who's up for a po-faced version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>?</p>
<p>But that's only half of the problem. The other, inseparable half is Lidell's voice-- less taking an adventurous approach to the sincere self-awareness of his limitations than a workmanlike take on sub-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2165-jamiroquai/"" target=""_blank"">Jamiroquai</a> all-surface singing. Half the time, he's flat and affectless, like he's skimming the lyric sheet waiting for something interesting to sing. And three-quarters of <i>that </i>time, he's also inarticulate, pulling the mix over his voice like a muffler and enunciating like he's burned the roof of his mouth. The titular hook to ""Big Love"" becomes more indistinct as it goes on, ending up something like ""bee luh."" And while overdubs and multitracks draw some attention-getting melodic qualities from his voice, they also muddle it into distorted mush-- though it's not as ill-advised as the downpitched adenoidal Dixieland goof ""why_ya_why"", which is the cruelest parody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo</a> ever recorded whether it means to be or not. If there were deep personal insights trapped inside that garbled diction, it might be worth it, but given all the flat cliches (a typical example from ""Blaming Something"": ""There's always a price to pay/ For all that runnin' away""), it's not worth straining your ears.</p>
<p>The shame of it is that somewhere in here there's an album that could've done more to revive the mostly moribund idea of 80s pop tropes in contemporary music. As a producer and musician with an ear for what sounds good as pure timbre, Lidell has previously shown a gift for pulling all the updated sonic potential from decades-old ideas. That retrofitting occasionally gets over the novelty of dealing with the past here and there on this record, and sparsely draws on his history of IDM tinkering to give it some subtly strange qualities. But it's not enough to keep <i>Jamie Lidell</i> from disappointing anonymity. Most of the time I tried to remember a song 15 minutes after hearing it, I got the Whispers or Alexander O'Neal stuck inside my head instead. That's a nice thing for a mediocre album to do, but a letdown from someone who isn't a mediocre artist.</p></div>"|17628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17628-jamie-lidell-jamie-lidell/|5.6|Nate Patrin

Half the fun of any new Matmos album, in fact, is in discovering its motivational concept: examination of the sounds of an operating table, for example, or the folk music of the Civil War. And yet the conceit for <i>The Marriage of True Minds</i>, their ninth full-length, just might top them all; if its hypothesis were true, you would hardly need this review to tell you what to expect of it, because <i>you would already know</i>.</p>
<p>Briefly: The members of Matmos, Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt, conducted parapsychological experiments on a series of test subjects that sound oddly similar to those from the opening scene of <i>Ghostbusters:</i> They attempted to telepathically communicate their intentions for this record to their subjects, who then reported any images or sounds they thought they received. Their input is woven inventively throughout<i> True Minds</i>; On ""In Search of a Lost Faculty"", you can hear these participants struggling to describe visions of triangles (a startling number of them report having received images of triangles, actually) while Daniel and Schmidt surround them with ringing chimes. The concept seems designed for ethereal, mystical music, but Matmos doesn't really do ethereal or mystical: <i>The Marriage of True Minds</i> hits harder and feels more joyfully physical than anything Matmos has done in years.</p>
<p>Daniel and Schmidt sometimes give off the impression that they are eggheads, forensic scientists of sound, but Matmos' music, at its best, has always been <i>fun</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>Marriage of True Minds</i> is no exception. With some judicious excisions of its scary and disturbing parts, most of it would make an excellent soundtrack for a kindergarten classroom. ""Very Large Green Triangles"" starts out with some heavy, irregular stomping, transitions into some four-on-the-floor pummeling, and then lurches to an abrupt halt as if signaled by a cartoon traffic cop's hand. ""Mental Radio"", with its sploshing puddle sounds and clattering layers of percussion, sounds like a conga line sent across across a wet, dirty subway platform. ""Ross Transcript"" opens with the sound of a radio flitting between stations, landing briefly on a syrupy bit of Muzak before plowing forward, cycling through a menagerie of funny sounds, including baaing sheep and babbling, indignant chatter seemingly recorded on the planet Tatooine.</p>
<p>There are still occasional bursts of discomfort-- Daniel and Schmidt have cast-iron stomach for cringe-inducing sounds, and it wouldn't be a Matmos album if you didn't occasionally wince. The dry, squeaky violin that briefly saws away on ""You"" hits the ear like a dentist scraper touching an exposed nerve ending. ""Ross Transcript"", in addition to the funny noises described above, also samples a bit of what sounds a lot like choking and spluttering. Their music has always had an antic, morbid cast to it, like a Grimm's fairy tale with all the ghoulish aspects slightly accentuated, and <i>The </i><i>Marriage of True Minds</i> is maybe the most confident they've ever been at balancing the two sides of this equation.</p>
<p>There are many songs on this album, for instance, that you could actually dance to, rather than just think about doing so. The stomping, crunching, tactile feast of itching guitars, hand claps, and zooming interstellar synths that is ""Tunnel"", for instance, is an NYC no-wave disco done as a splatter painting. ""E.S.P."" starts out with a parodic, goofy recitation of the lyrics to the Buzzcocks' song ""E.S.P."" in growling, black-metal style. Then, after thrashing through some doomy down-tuned metal guitars, it lifts off into a fizzy, joyful coda, a hootenanny swarmed by genetically engineered fireflies. I didn't make the connection to the Buzzcocks song until the fourth or fifth listen, as I was too absorbed in the music itself. The best compliment you can pay Matmos' music, then and now, remains that in the moment, it didn't matter to me in the slightest.</p></div>"|17630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17630-matmos-the-marriage-of-true-minds/|7.5|Jayson Greene

I feel tones and textures often get overlooked, so I like to take my time finding the right sounds."" The approach is working for the unassuming 21-year-old musician, otherwise known as Harley Streten: In November, his self-titled debut album and its single ""Sleepless"" beat One Direction for the number one position on Australia's charts. Streten celebrated by posting screenshots of the ensuing Twitter <a href=""http://www.gigwise.com/news/77585/producer-flume-mocks-one-direction-fans-after-topping-australian-chart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outrage</a>.</p>
<p>He doesn't come off as a firestarter, though, or even all that different from other young electronic producers. He listens to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>, started tinkering with production when he was barely a teenager, and still makes music in his parents' basement. While his approach to warped sound owes much to Dilla, Flume's aesthetic can be compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"">SBTRKT</a>'s integration of R&amp;B's bedside intimacy with distant beats and silky voiced female singers.</p>
<p>Streten explores his sonic palette with varying degrees of success on <i>Flume. </i>It's a little long on instrumental filler (""Space Cadet"", ""Warm Thoughts"", ""Ezra""), highlighting the fact that at this point in his career, samples and singers are Streten's most effective asset. Those features mask the fact that most of his songs are structured around samey, distracting background swoops that introduce climactic moments.</p>
<p>On ""Sleepless"", singer/model Jezzabell Doran is Streten's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>, though he gives George Maple more of the spotlight on ""Bring You Down"". Her featherlight refrain ""Hush now, you're standing on a landmine"" is the centerpiece around which snares skitter and arpeggios twinkle, her voice soaring as Streten drops a judicious beat into the bridge. On ""Insane"", Streten distorts Australian singer Moon Holiday's lovely but affectless voice into a melodic foil to his throbbing builds and drops. Sometimes, neither the vocals nor backing can save the show: ""On Top"" features uninspired rapping from New York MC T.Shirt (""The night's forever young/ It's us that gets old"") that falls flat over offbeat thuds and simulated siren wails.</p>
<p>Now and then, Streten strikes an unusually potent streak: On ""Left Alone"", a chorus persists throughout as if dogging guest Chet Faker's slurred pleas for solitude. Preceding track ""Holdin' On"" juxtaposes an old-soul male vocal sample and gospel echoes (""Mama, I love you!"" ""Yes I do!"")  with muffled keyboard stabs and serious swing for an effect that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"" target=""_blank"">Gil Scott-Heron</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15140-were-new-here/"">remixes</a>. Sinuous opener ""Sintra"" chops up vocals like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>'s ""CMYK"", a foil for the calming, sweet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14617-star-eyes/"">""Star Eyes""</a>, which closes the album with a dream sequence made up of screwed bits of speech. On ""What You Need"", Streten makes a claim-- ""Been waiting to love you/ ... I've got what you need""-- shiver so that it sounds like she's slowly dissolving into tears. With that kind of control over his songs and performers, Flume could easily evolve into a sought-after producer.</p></div>"|17484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17484-flume-flume/|7.4|Harley Brown

Sometimes that despair is dressed up in the stories of other people or in a brittle sarcasm. Sometimes it's just lain bare over the track, raw as hell and occasionally downright uncomfortable.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Saal</i> was recorded early last year in Bonn, Germany and you can feel how the distance freed the Chicago native up to experiment with form as he moves from faux-bright folk songs into downbeat monologue. He's always straddled the boundary between rapping and spoken word poetry, but here he's part spoken word poet, part folk singer. He sings more often than he raps, and delivers loose, sloping verses when he's not singing. The shift isn't unpleasant-- 'Geti has a decent voice and he doesn't oversing or strain himself.</p>
<p>The production is unusually ornate, entirely supplied by Tobias ""Sicker Man"" Vethake, an experimental musician with a background in classical cello. In his own work, Vethake combines the structure of pop and the instrumention of classical music to create short, formalized studies in sound. (His cover of ""Party Rock Anthem"" is worth a listen.) On <i>Saal, </i>he uses violins, cellos, bells, and all other manner of classical instruments to construct unwieldy soundscapes for 'Geti to travel through. The beats are consistently surprising-- coherent and steady one moment, and filled with static the next-- and they complement Geti's off-kilter musings nicely.</p>
<p>The opener ""Karate,"" finds the two musicians working in perfect tandem. It's an expertly constructed folk song that layers spoken verses and a sung hook atop a mournful cello. The story focuses on two characters, Charles and an unnamed older woman, who are stuck with each other. Finely wrought details set the scene in the first verse: ""Coin collections, camcorders, and silverware/ Strangulations, police card on the au pair."" There's clearly been some kind of catastrophe in Charles' life, but the immediate tragedy soon gives way to something worse. The woman he's stuck with has lost her own son and she takes it out on Charles: the first line of the hook is ""and her strength overwhelmed his karate."" It's dark yet effective, using the image of a boy helplessly trying to use karate to drive home the idea of innocence lost in a hurry.</p>
<p>Some of the songs here are even more subtle. ""Accommodating"", on which Serengeti channels the Mark Oliver Everett of <i>Electro-Shock Blues,</i> starts off sounding like a cute little song about wanting to do something for someone who always does things for you. But as Geti rattles off some of the ways that he would like to accommodate the person in question, you notice a pattern. He wants to, amongst other things, help the anonymous ""lose some weight and learn to eat right,"" ""make cologne,"" and ""extract your own pheromones."" He's interested in making the person more sexually attractive, which, of course, would just be way of accommodating himself again.</p>
<p>These clever little songs, on which dark thoughts are given costumes and animated by wit, are the most enjoyable parts of <i>Saal</i>. Later in the record, 'Geti gets blunter, and the results can be unnerving. ""Divorce is the new wedding, stop is the new start,"" he claims on ""Glassell Park"". Following that train of thought, ""Wedding"" is a painfully sad dirge which finds him attending an ex's wedding, still trying to get her to sleep with him. The bonus track ""Queen Wasn't Content"" is clearest of all: ""Every now and then I can't stop crying/ If there's a God then he must not know me/ Hasn't even taken a glance this way."" There's nothing bad about these songs, but their unsparing melancholy leaves craft behind, the writing forsaking artistry in the name of clear expression.</p>
<p>All this darkness will serve as relief for listeners of a certain mindset. <i>Saal </i>isn't meant for a casual listen and is probably best played without any company around-- it's serious, overstated, and unavoidably heavy. But the album makes for an understanding companion if you're all alone and having a really terrible night.</p></div>"|17579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17579-serengeti-saal/|6.3|Jonah Bromwich

The acoustic quartet plays songs particular to the region they call home, the mountainous stretch that extends from North Carolina upward into West Virginia and Kentucky. They've learned their tunes by seeking out old-timers and their extant kin, by reading the histories and joining in song circles and all-night jams. Musicians regularly gather in their droves to do exactly that with many of these songs, but the Pickers are a thoroughly modern old-time band.</p>
<p>The Pickers' draw to these antediluvian songs seems simply to be the music itself, rather than its aesthetic. They've repudiated fellow acoustic travelers<a href=""http://awaitingtheflood.com/interview-the-black-twig-pickers-nothing-funny-about-days-gone-by/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> who dress in period costumes</a>, and they don't pretend to be genre purists, confessing in recent interviews to interests in Lil B and Terry Riley, Junior Kimbrough and the Fall. They backed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3669-jack-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Rose</a> on the monumental <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13950-luck-in-the-valley/"" target=""_blank""><i>Luck in the Valley</i></a>, while the group's young banjo player, Nathan Bowles, and their research-driven leader Mike Gangloff, play in Pelt, the brilliant Appalachia acoustic drone ensemble. They are also one of the rare string bands to work with a record label that's associated with indie rock; their relationship with Chicago's forever-interesting Thrill Jockey affords them access to new sets of listeners, but it also confirms their proclivity for breaking from their scene's often-cloistered ranks. Students and teachers, gatherers and conveyors, Black Twig Pickers know that the survival-- and especially vitality-- of this American folk form depends upon pushing it past its regional strongholds.</p>
<p><i>Rough Carpenters</i> is the latest in an impressive string of Black Twig Pickers full-lengths; it's the swiftest, too, as its 45 minutes feel much shorter thanks to the enthusiasm of the gamboling quartet. Excepting a two-song experiment from late last year, it is also the first to integrate fiddler and dancer Sally Anne Morgan. Appropriately, the band <a href=""http://www.uprootedmusicrevue.com/2011/07/conversation-with-black-twig-pickers.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">met Morgan</a> at a late-night house party of pickers and listeners in Virginia, later reconnecting with her at a political rally in the mountains of Kentucky. Her contribution is key here, as the Pickers spend almost half of <i>Carpenters</i> working through one instrumental configuration that hinges upon her addition-- fiddles in complementary tunings, accompanied by the quick flick of Bowles' rhythm-inclined banjo and guitarist Isak Howell's heavy and brisk strums. During ""Where the Whippoorwills are Whispering Goodnight"", for instance, she and Gangloff sing to one another with a fetchingly bittersweet tone, telling the tale of this Charlie Poole favorite without saying a word. During ""Charleston Girls"", they play with the intoxicated euphoria of two red-faced lovers cycling round and round on the dance floor, all excitable and lusty.</p>
<p>Morgan's second fiddle has added more flexibility to an already-versatile outfit, a characteristic that <i>Rough Carpenters</i> makes remarkably clear: As Gangloff bows the theme of ""Little Rose"", Bowles bangs across the fiddle's neck with chopsticks, eliciting the rhythmic melodies of a hammered dulcimer on a budget. Howell adds harmonica on ""Banks of the Arkansas"", lending a bit of depth to a thin song from the wings by countering the lithe melody of the twin fiddles and the steady banjo-guitar trot. It's the sort of smart textural addition you'll barely notice but that you'd certainly miss if it had never been there. The fiddles even take a turn for themselves on ""Old Christmas Morning"", their strings and bows emitting white-hot streaks of radiant abrasion when Gangloff and Morgan pull against the melody.</p>
<p>This time out, the Pickers-- a group whose vocals have generally functioned better live than on tape-- even connect by voice. Consecutive cuts ""Roll on John"" and ""Jack of Diamonds"" feature some of the band's best singing to date: Howell keens high and lonesome during the latter, while Morgan chases his words on the former with casual charm, as if she's the mockingbird teasing the poor man's lament. Howell does get swallowed a bit by the title cut, but the song finds its sparks in the banjo harmonies of Bowles and Gangloff. They put the tinny stereotype to rest at once, weaving a web that sounds somehow lush-- maybe not the first word that comes to mind when one considers the five-string punchline. The Black Twig Pickers, after all, continue to confound expectations for such ancestral acts, even as they expand their erudition within and embrace of the canon itself. <i>Rough Carpenters</i> sounds vibrant and enveloping, an old-time feat for these mercurial times.</p></div>"|17609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17609-black-twig-pickers-rough-carpenters/|7.4|Grayson Currin

Despite not being the ""official"" follow-up to <i>Electronic Dream </i>(there was also last year's collection of stray beats, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/""><i>Instrumental University</i></a><i>),</i> <i>For Professional Use Only</i> feels like it's trying to reflect Araab's current status: It's bigger, bolder, and more ambitious than its predecessor<i>. </i>But the impact works in reverse-- it's meant as a <i>souvenir </i>for Araab's live sets while having the unexpected effect of showing his range as a producer rather than a performer.</p>
<p>Of course, the obvious question is how <i>For Professional Use Only </i>can truly recreate the live experience without the visuals. There is undoubtedly a wow factor to seeing Araab perform, as he breaks down the last line of rockist defense against ""this music works better live,"" i.e., ""he's just pushing buttons."" Which, <a href=""http://youtu.be/lmEhCDRvQKA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>hell yes </i>he's pushing buttons.</a> But the guy is about moving bodies for an hour at a time, not just dropping jaws in one-minute stretches. Even without his ""you are listening to AraabMuzik"" tag, he does have audio tricks that let you know it's him. He hasn't altered his approach in any significant way here; it's still punishing beats that repeat every four bars and jagged, spazz-out synth lines that are loud as fuck, most things that people find either attractive or repulsive about the EDM kings that have welcomed Araab and vice versa. It's also cut with short passages of twinkly MDMA rap that evoke the moment your drug of choice kicks in and you get to enjoy the high rather than the increasing buzz. There's plenty of moments where Araab revisits such ideas from <i>Electronic Dream</i> (""Never Have To Worry"", ""Turn Tha Tide""), and it can still be powerful in proper doses.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, <i>Professional Use </i>feels more based in hip-hop than <i>Electronic Dream</i>, in tune with Araab's physical movements when he's not going hundred-hand slap on the MPC; it's typically him in an exaggerated, full-body headknock. It's interesting how much of it recalls late-90s Ruff Ryders considering that crew's willingness to act as a counterbalance to hip-hop's obsession with ecstasy and shiny suits; you hear the rudimentary tones of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"" target=""_blank"">Swizz Beatz</a> in ""Street Knock"", while ""G Riding"" comes close to quoting the chunky old-school drumbreak of ""I'm A Hustla"". Elsewhere, he tweaks existing templates for modern ears, as ""D.R.U.G.S"" and ""So Good"" respectively apply the stylistic tics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a> into something cloudier. Occasionally, he gets a little too overt in his beat-cribbing: ""Heaven"" could pass for any number of faux-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a> beats from 1999; ""Getting 2 The Point"" is standard issue Lex Luger/Young Chop and ""SUCCUBI"" is so blatant about its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"" target=""_blank"">TNGHT</a> envy that it <i>has </i>to be tongue-in-cheek.</p>
<p>Still, Araab's willingness to stretch keeps <i>For Professional Use Only </i>engaging throughout, which is no easy task;<i> </i>it's 67 minutes long, about 15 minutes longer than a typical festival set and probably 15 minutes more AraabMuzik than anyone needs in one sitting. I wouldn't say there are too many dead spots here-- it's just that <i>you </i>might not have the stamina to keep up. Araab's beats have enough melodic heft and substance that you can listen for 40 or so minutes without thinking, ""Man, it'd sure be nice if someone was rapping over this."" By the same token, his production doesn't have the same capacity for storytelling-- whenever a track goes past three minutes, there's a good chance it's overstaying its welcome.</p>
<p>As with <i>Electronic Dream</i>, <i>Professional Use Only </i>is ridiculously loud and will drive you insane on headphones. I can't think of too many acts besides <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Sleigh Bells</a> who make such explicit use of brickwalled mastering as a clear aesthetic choice, and it's worth noting that you <i>could</i> listen to both of their albums in the time it takes to finish <i>For Professional Use Only</i>. Beyond the physical weariness, it also limits Araab when he tries to make beats that require room to breathe, such as the mid-00s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> fluff of ""Beauty"". You don't need any background in trance music to appreciate these songs more deeply, nor do you need to be an audiophile beyond maintaining that, ""if it's too loud, you're too old."" If you hear <i>For Professional Use Only </i>and imagine it pumping out of gigantic bass bins, you ""get"" it.</p></div>"|17697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17697-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only/|7.2|Ian Cohen

For the latter, the clear striation of parts lends a certain momentum to the listening experience, goading the music toward a clear finishing line, and then repeating the process. But that 40-minute noise record might stuff as much sound as it can into that equivalent space, supplanting pop's rests and dynamics with a barrage of musical information. If you don't think intensity can warp your sense of time and space, remember the notion the next time you're at the gym.</p>
<p>Excepting their 2003 debut, <i>Vexovoid</i>-- the fourth and most recent album from Australian heavy metal abusers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30946-portal/"" target=""_blank"">Portal</a>-- is the band's shortest full-length to date and their first to fall just to seven songs. At 35 minutes, it is barely longer than your average primetime sitcom or less than a quarter of the music rock'n'roll votary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a> released last year alone. But parsing <i>Vexovoid</i>, Portal's first as a quintet and first since 2009's addled and diverse <i>Swarth</i>, should take you the better part of this calendar year. Initially forceful and ultimately complex, <i>Vexovoid</i> redirects the image of death metal through a dervish funhouse, where the expected shapes have been mutated and multiplied into orders so strange they seem surreal. Rhythms stay the course where you expect them to shift before finally switching without warning. Sharp-barbed riffs emerge from and climb above dins that once seemed irreparably unordered. Songs that, for the first minute, appeared to have but one aim and direction find a half-dozen new missions and vectors in a five-minute span. Hearing it all go by-- the forms flux, the pieces connect, the momentum volley-- provides an exhilarating, bewildering sort of audio whiplash. <i>Vexovoid</i> is a gauntlet that, to run again and again, is every bit as exhilarating as it is exhausting.</p>
<p>Portal has long tapped into sounds beyond death metal basics to warp their core, with traces of doom metal and stoner rock, black metal and noise rock trapped within their already-claustrophobic music. But <i>Vexovoid</i> eliminates the seams better than ever before, with alien sounds woven perfectly into the native space. ""Orbmorphia"" splices the kind of technically daunting sprints that canonized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2745-meshuggah/"" target=""_blank"">Meshuggah</a> into rote death metal blitzes. ""Plasm"" hammers away with similarly primal simplicity, but Portal perverts it via sly embellishments-- molten waves of repetition rather than riffs that slice and flee, or the slow quake of the bass rather than an ordinary game of four-string keep-up. When the drums disappear after three minutes, they give way to a corrosive drone. The transition is surprising but deserved and brilliant, a conclusion foreshadowed by the now-obvious maneuvers of the tune's first half. Likewise, the guitars of closer ""Oblotten"" radiate grimly with the lock-step tremolo of black metal, while drums boom in the distance, as though industrial samples have been slingshot randomly into the frame. Hidden behind each of those percussive quakes, there's a sad little riff shared between the bass and a guitar. When the cacophony finally chokes out, though, only that riff remains, creeping quietly into nothing.</p>
<p>Go back and trace its progression: It's the kind of detail that you might miss the first dozen times you hear <i>Vexovoid</i>, especially if you've persevered its meticulous and merciless 35 minutes in one sitting. Such intricacy is precisely what makes <i>Vexovoid</i>-- a trove of interconnected themes and variations, distractions and redirections, barbed by the one of the heaviest bands in the genre-- so rewarding. If these 35 minutes feel like twice that, it's because Portal thought through every step, packed all of its ideas as tightly as possible, and left it for you to decode. </p></div>"|17576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17576-portal-vexovoid/|8.0|Grayson Currin

It's of Andrew Field-Pickering, aka Maxmillion Dunbar, a balding, broad-shouldered, slightly round man who looks like someone capable of giving life-affirming hugs. By his own account, Field-Pickering spent a lot of time making <i>Woo</i> while lying in a recliner, looping its tracks for hours on end, while his girlfriend lay in a second recliner next to him. That I don't know what his girlfriend looks like doesn't matter. What's important is the image of <a href=""http://dublab.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Maxmillion_Dunbar.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this man</a>, in a recliner for hours on end, content with the sound of his own crisp, blissful music.</p>
<p>Like a lot of young instrumental electronic producers in 2013, Field-Pickering's style sounds cherrypicked from a series of fashionable pasts, never unfamiliar but not easily pigeonholed either. His love for house is obvious, as is his love for the oblong swing of early 90s R&amp;B. (He's also one half of Beautiful Swimmers, who have released a handful of oddball house tracks here and there, including a contribution to the Permanent Vacation label's wonderfully named <i>If This is House I Want My Money Back Zwei</i>.) But even at their most pounding, the rhythms of <i>Woo</i> feel secondary to its ambience, which is silvery and synthetic, but plays at being organic, like the weird waxy feel of a fake plant.</p>
<p>Field-Pickering's way with sound is <i>Woo</i>'s most enchanting feature: the pinched-balloon squeals of ""Ice Room Graffiti"", the cascade of synthesized bells on ""Coins for the Canopy"", the meditative refrain of ""Kangaroo""'s pale trumpets; sounds that lull the brain into some uncanny dead space where nothing quite seems real or imagined. It's tempting to write that <i>Woo</i> is an ambient album, but ambient music tends to interact with an existing environment instead of creating a new one entirely. <i>Woo</i> is like a pocket jungle for and by people who never leave the city.</p>
<p>In that sense, Field-Pickering's closest points of reference are guys like Wally Badarou and Jon Hassell, composers who got their start in the late 1970s making textured, polyethnic art music that blended live and synthesized instruments, guided more by the color of sound than structure. (Hassell once called it ""coffee-colored classical."") Field-Pickering, though, isn't nearly as accommodating as Hassell, either in sound or vibe. Despite the hours of recliner replayability, nothing on <i>Woo</i> is particularly plush or friendly-- instead, it pushes happily into the unfamiliar, hacking away at the brush, disappearing into CGI shadows.</p>
<p><i>Woo</i> is more or less an extension of-- and improvement on-- the ideas explored on Field-Pickering's debut, 2010's <i>Cool Water</i>. His curse is that he's making music in a field of alt-electronic bedroom producers both totally divorced from pop music and yet overcrowded with some of the most rote and uncreative musical minds imaginable. His gift is that he isn't one of them.</p></div>"|17698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17698-maxmillion-dunbar-house-of-woo/|7.8|Mike Powell

He's reportedly turned down multiple reunion tour offers, opted out of participating in Drag City's recent Trux reissue campaign, and declared his utter disinterest in the prospect whenever the question pops up in interviews. His recent choice of homes-- New Mexico and, currently, Colorado-- keep him well insulated from music-industry machinations; Rather than stage, say, a Royal Trux comeback at an ATP festival, Hagerty would sooner play <a href=""http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.ca/2012/10/jebus-presents-neil-hagerty-royal-trux.html?zx=4e72348f800feb29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sparsely attended weekly residencies in Denver dives</a>. All the while, he's been pushing his post-Trux outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2031-the-howling-hex/"" target=""_blank"">the Howling Hex</a> further and further away from his previous band's bell-bottomed boogie, favouring a scrappy, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte%C3%B1o_(music)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">norteño</a>-spiced tack that, since the release of 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10567-xi/"" target=""_blank""><i>XI</i></a>, has done away with drums altogether.</p>
<p>Given his strident don't-look-back ethos, it was something of a shock when, last December, Hagerty announced he would be performing Royal Trux's 1990 mind-fucking masterwork <i>Twin Infinitives</i> in its entirety at a New York City show, albeit with an unknown female vocalist filling the high-heeled cowboy boots of Hagerty's former foil and flame, Jennifer Herrema (currently of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30046-black-bananas/"" target=""_blank"">Black Bananas</a>). This news was soon followed by the announcement of a new Howling Hex album that, for the first time in six years, would employ the services of a drummer. Taken together, these developments prompted speculative hints that Hagerty was more eager this time out to, if not outright retrace his Trux tracks, at least recapture some of his old band's mystique and muscle.</p>
<p>But listening to <i>The Best of the Howling Hex</i>, you're reminded not so much of Royal Trux's music as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpzmoBniw_I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their second-most viewed YouTube video</a>. In the infamous bootlegged clip, the band -- fresh off from signing an ill-fated deal with Virgin Records in 1995-- are being subjected to one of the least glamorous aspects of major-label patronage: having to record a soul-destroying succession of station IDs for generically named local music video shows. But a funny thing happens on the way to Alternavision: while Herrema's disdain for the process intensifies with each cigarette puff, Hagerty gets really into it, and becomes increasingly obsessed with getting each take just right, giving his partner instructions with the fussy impatience of a movie director running over-budget. You get the same sense listening to <i>The Best of the Howling Hex</i>: the album is maddeningly repetitive to the point of seeming like some cruel joke, but there's something admirable and charming about Hagerty's determination to make it work.</p>
<p>The most hilarious thing about <i>The Best of the Howling Hex</i> isn't the faux greatest hits title-- the album features all new material, natch-- but the fact that Hagerty recruited a new drummer only to have him play the <i>exact same beats</i> throughout the entire record, as if he were a human Casio preset. The album cover may list eight tracks, but there are really only two songs here: The slow ones play out like some bizarro reggae/polka/acid rock fusion scraped from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a>'s old four-track; the fast ones keep double-time pace with cowpunk dust-ups of yore, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets/"" target=""_blank"">the Meat Puppets</a>' ""Lost"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">the Minutemen</a>'s ""Corona."" Atop both are Hagerty's circular, repetitive melodies and his furious fretwork, which can dazzle in any context. But rather than provide points of distinction, his brain-scrambling, six-string swirls are consistently mixed so low as to be overshadowed by the chintzy, clipped, one-note rhythm guitar accents. ""Variations on a theme"" is an understatement for what transpires here; choruses mostly follow the same patterns as the verses, time changes are practically non-existent.</p>
<p>But the album's title starts to make a little more sense if you view <i>The Best of the Howling Hex</i> as an ongoing process through which Hagerty is trying to refine and perfect a particular song form. As wearing as it is to hear the same arrangements over and over again, the songs do get better and more engaging as the album chugs along: In this unwavering setting, the subtle, soothing synth line that buttresses the congenial melody of ""The General Prologue"" hits with all the splendour of a meteor shower, and heralds the album's most ebullient guitar hook; by the time we reach ""Green Limousine"", the Hex's default oompa-oompa gait has acquired a more frantic energy and, in the process, goads Hagerty into his most urgent and spirited vocal performance. And if the closing ""Trashcan Bahamas"" starts out like yet another trip to the bionic hee-haw, it suddenly detours into an ascendant, arpeggiated grand finale that sees Hagerty achieve his own version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuj5toLeyY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beck's Bolero""</a>. But that sense of triumph is as much as ours as it is his-- a parting reward for those of us who manage to stay sane while the songs remain the same.</p></div>"|17629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17629-the-howling-hex-the-best-of-the-howling-hex/|6.1|Stuart Berman

It's been like this for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Marr</a> since before his 25th birthday, when he co-wrote a couple dozen perfect pop songs with Morrissey and then departed for a series of celebrity rocker odd jobs in other people's bands (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>, the Pretenders, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a>, and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Shop Boys</a>). To say Marr ran up the score on his legacy with the Smiths, and has been treading water ever since, would be reductive. But Marr has been playing with house money for as long as many of today's indie-poppers chasing ""Hand in Glove"" and ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" have been alive. Johnny Marr is an institution now-- and institutions are supposed to stay in the same place, right where we left them, until they topple over.</p>
<p>Marr (hopefully) has a long way to go before that happens. So, now that his extended tenure as a gun for hire appears to have been put on hold, he's set about making his first proper solo record, <i>The Messenger. </i>(Marr's 2003 album with the Healers, <i>Boomslang,</i> is apparently being passed off as an equal collaboration between Marr and whoever else was in the Healers.) If it seems like a strange time for Johnny Marr to finally make a record under his own name, that's because it is. <i>The Messenger </i>is precisely the big, bright, jangly guitar rock LP that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">Smiths</a> fans would have killed for in 1994. The record's immediately appealing ""Smiths plus 20 pounds of muscle"" sound would have fit in perfectly alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">Oasis</a>' <i>Definitely Maybe </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"" target=""_blank"">the Verve</a>'s <i>A Storm in Heaven </i>on a typical Anglophile's CD rack 20 years ago<i>. </i>In 2013, though, <i>The Messenger </i>exists in its own, hermetically sealed context.</p>
<p>As Marr recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9063-johnny-marr/"">told Pitchfork</a>, <i>The Messenger </i>was consciously crafted to appeal to his old fans. ""I wanted it to sound effortless, not like I was trying to reinvent the wheel,"" he said. ""I'm not interested in trying to have people who might like other kinds of music follow me. I don't want to please them."" Based on this criteria, <i>The Messenger </i>is a success. The guitar tones on this record are fantastic-- which is to say, they instantly bring to mind the dense, intricate, and yet lightly airy riffs that Marr strummed over Morrissey's asexual witticisms in the mid-1980s. ""European Me"" is manna for Marr obsessives, opening with a stuttering six-string barrage that quickly blossoms into a wondrous expanse of chiming Rickenbackers. The title track is another instant grabber, marrying disco rhythms with Marr's spidery guitar over a bed of mood-setting synths. Lead-off track ""The Right Thing Right"" is pretty awesomely Smiths-like, too, with Johnny throwing in some frisky Keith Richards licks in for good measure.</p>
<p><i>The Messenger </i>begs to be received on its own modest terms and its pleasures-- Marr's guitar playing, the no-frills production, those big and cavernous choruses-- wear off after prolonged exposure. Marr is still a top-flight musician, but he's not really a true solo artist. As a vocalist, he's a warm if unexceptional presence; he tends to get lost inside his own immaculately constructed guitar cathedrals, particularly when he has nothing to say in his lyrics. For ""I Want the Heartbeat"", Marr effectively grinds a metallic bass line against his own over-amped guitar, but the song's narrative about a man falling in love with a machine is a dopey metaphor for our culture's obsession with technology. In the latter half of <i>The Messenger</i>, even Marr's playing starts to lose some of its vigor; ""Say Demesne"" is draggy, late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> balladry for aging Gen-Xers.</p>
<p>The best parts of <i>The Messenger </i>have a sideman's sensibility; Marr is great at doodling in the margins but falters when it comes to filling up the center with substance. The result is a record that grabs your attention initially, but is unlikely to hold it in the long view. Not that it matters-- Marr was a legend before this record, and he'll still be one after it. <i>The Messenger </i>won't be included in the body of work that made Marr great, but it's a solid approximation of his strengths.</p></div>"|17643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17643-johnny-marr-the-messenger/|6.3|Steven Hyden

<p>By recording a full album of Everly covers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1621-faun-fables/"" target=""_blank"">Faun Fables</a>’ Dawn McCarthy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie “Prince” Billy</a> join a long line of musician-fans who've paid tribute. <i>What the Brothers Sang</i> isn’t their first collaboration. McCarthy played Oldham’s vocal foil on his 2006 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9419-the-letting-go/"" target=""_blank"">The Letting Go</a>,</i> and since then they’ve recorded an EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11656-wai-notes-wilding-in-the-west/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wai Notes</i></a>, as well as a gently demented Christmas-themed seven-inch, <a href=""http://vimeo.com/53181708"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Christmas Eve Can Kill You</i></a>. Of all of Billy’s many female co-vocalists, few such an easy rapport with him as McCarthy. Many, including Cheyenne Marie Mize and Angel Olsen, counter Oldham’s studied detachment with a warm engagement, which worked well on <i>Among the Gold </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wolfroy Goes to Town</i></a>, respectively. But McCarthy can sound just as out there as Oldham himself; he voice is dry and husky, with a subtle expressiveness very much like his. Rather than churning the kind of sexual energy that has driven so many duos from Parton/Wagoner to the Civil Wars, theirs is more of a Platonic tension.</p>
<p>In other words, McCarthy and Oldham haven’t re-gendered the Everlys’ songs for co-ed vocalists. Rather than two lovers having it out in songs, they sound like two friends drinking over shared memories and commiserating over separately broken hearts. Oldham is her “best unbeaten brother,” to quote his own song. With no driving interpretive concept here, the focus is largely on the Everlys’ adventurous taste in songs. Most of the tunes on <i>What the Brothers Sang </i>hail from the 60s, well after their heyday; hits are passed over in favor of deep catalogue cuts.  “Milk Train”, by Tony Romeo (most famous for writing the Partridge Family’s “Hey I Think I Love You”), is told from the point of view of a train switchman; “Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises”, by John Denver, could be a hippie anthem, which is about the furthest thing from the Everlys’ clean-cut image of the 50s. Still, all of the songs on <i>What the Brothers Sang</i> sound like they might have sprung from the same pen, bottling up all the complexities of broken hearts and presenting them with languid, sophisticated country-rock arrangements. </p>
<p>While it occasionally saps these songs of some of their tension, that sense of camaraderie enlivens the album and energizes the performers. Oldham hasn’t sounded quite so animated as he does on the cover of the Everlys’ cover of the Spencer Davis Group’s cover of Jackie Edwards’ “Somebody Help Me”, although even his invested, in-character vocals can’t quite sell the period piece “Milk Train”. Every bit his equal, McCarthy thrives in this austere setting. Without the distractions of the Faun Fables’ Americana drama, she displays a remarkable range, belting like the Heart sisters one minute, sounding indistinguishable from Oldham the next. Still, <i>What the Brothers Sang </i>is best when it’s simplest and most direct. “Devoted to You” and “So Sad” are all the more powerful for being so spare in their arrangements, as though illustrating the power of a small country bar band. On the other hand, “Omaha” has an exurban sprawl that sounds out of place among these more private meditations, and the rustic psychedelica of “My Little Yellow Bird” distracts from rather than reinforces the wistful melody and the lyrics’ immense longing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>What the Brothers Sang </i>is a tribute to what the brothers sang, not necessarily how they sang it. The album’s true subjects are the many songwriters behind the Everlys-- an incredibly wide and eclectic sampling. McCarthy and Oldham wear the weight of that history lightly-- perhaps too lightly. This is a spirited album, yet somehow slight. It’s a modest monument to their heroes, although perhaps that is the whole point: Perhaps <i>What the Brothers Sang </i>is specifically intended to leave you wanting more substantial, in order to inspire listeners to dig deeper into the Everlys’ catalog and beyond. </p></div>"|17797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17797-bonnie-prince-billy-dawn-mccarthy-what-the-brothers-sang/|7.0|Stephen M.

When his brother Malice found religion on a sabbatical from rap, Pusha’s alignment with Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music imprint redoubled his rap industry stock, earning him name recognition, chart successes, and award nominations that eluded him in the Clipse. His initial solo releases were shaky, though. His 2011 debut mixtape <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15277-fear-of-god/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fear of God </i></a>was brittle and half-baked, and while the album-length EP <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16010-fear-of-god-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fear of God II: Let Us Pray</i></a> fared better, it did so by cannibalizing the best songs from the mixtape and padding out its tracklist with appearances from famous guests. Nearly two years on, Pusha has bested the <i>Fear of God </i>series with <i>Wrath of Caine</i>, a stopgap mixtape of originals meant to tide us over until the release of his forthcoming solo album <i>My Name Is My Name</i>, whose title quotes Marlo Stanfield of HBO’s beloved cop drama <i>The Wire</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It makes sense that Pusha-T would fixate on Marlo, a ruthless drug dealer who kills his way into a higher tax bracket only to find himself at a loss for what to do with his newfound money and dominion. Pusha’s partnership with Kanye West brings stability, and more importantly, direct involvement in a hit parade steered by one of the best producers in the industry. For an underdog whose kingdom was built on a dealer’s twin thrusts of entrepreneurialism and danger, whose displays of wealth were couched in the hard luck stories of how it was acquired, to suddenly lose that underpinning of struggle is jarring. It makes for a lot of brazen talk of money. <i>Wrath of Caine </i>is Pusha-T coming to terms with his place in the rich asshole bracket he and Kanye detailed with “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12000-runaway-ft-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Runaway</a>.” “Peasants ain’t sittin’ with the kings, Goliath ain’t worried ‘bout your sling, and Cassius ain’t bothered by your swings”, he raps on “Doesn’t Matter”.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Wrath of Caine</i>’s caustic witticisms work in contrast to the gossamer production. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a> associate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8879-young-chop/"" target=""_blank"">Young Chop</a> imbues the larger-than-life kingpin posturing of “Blocka” with pillowy low end and spectral synths, with very little in between. Harry Fraud’s work on “Road Runner” and Boogz and Tapez’ “Only You Can Tell It” both warp vocal samples into massive, stately productions that sound like trap music rebuttals to the seraphic grandeur of Clams Casino. Jake One serves up sedate reggae for “Take My Life”, while SK and Arthur McArthur recreate the mood of reggae with swaying, oceanic synths on “Trust You”. Pusha seems pretty taken with Jamaican culture lately: “Blocka” features vocals from newly minted dancehall star Popcaan and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ5Ur6yezJc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video shot in Kingston</a>, and <i>Wrath of Caine</i> is peppered with spirited patois toasts from a gangster’s spoiled moll. (It’s also worth noting that “<a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/news/48143-listen-pusha-t-featuring-future-pain/"" target=""_blank"">Pain</a>”, <i>My Name Is My Name</i>’s lead single, samples the Nyabinghi drums of Rastafarian religious rituals.) It’s a fitting connection for Pusha, as his own history, insofar as rappers’ autobiographical tales are to be believed, is a kind of winding <i>Shottas</i>-esque story of drugs, shady business associates, and unbelievably good luck.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Pusha-T has navigated this improbable second act of his career with caution. His visibility is as great today as it has ever been, but he moves with an astute awareness of his peculiar place as both a seasoned rap veteran and a relatively untested commercial commodity. That means playing by the rap majors’ rules, keeping his buzz warm by giving away fully realized songs for free online and ceding lyrical real estate to feature artists <i>du jour</i> like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> and his Maybach Music Group henchmen. <i>Wrath of Caine</i>’s guests neither add to nor subtract from the proceedings, and where he can, Pusha wisely relegates them to hook duty. After <i>Fear of God</i>’s withering batch of middling freestyles and rangy originals and <i>Fear of God II</i>’s pervasive sense that the artist with top billing was a guest on his own album, <i>Wrath of Caine</i> is really the first hint of what Pusha-T is capable of as a solo artist. He’s not really relatable anymore, and hard times are distant memories rather than palpable realities, but he’s still got sharp wit and snarling lyrical intensity to fall back on, and <i>Wrath of Caine </i>thrives off of that gritty elan.</p></div>"|17758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17758-pusha-t-wrath-of-caine/|7.2|Craig Jenkins

Before then, Zeppelin was known as a bunch of knuckle-dragging lemon-squeezers who distorted the blues with consciousness-shifting levels of pure volume. But on <i>III, </i>they embraced acoustic instrumentation and more thoughtful songwriting. This bugged old fans, but it made the band more palatable for everybody else. Portland noise-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19359-eat-skull/"" target=""_blank"">Eat Skull</a> exist in a stranger, less shlong-y dimension than the mighty Zep, but its latest record <i>III </i>similarly departs from the cacophony that precedes it. The disembodied, screechy detritus floating amidst the sneakily catchy songs on the first two Eat Skull records has been pushed down low into a foreboding hum on <i>III-- </i>or removed altogether. It hardly seems accurate to describe <i>III </i>as noise-pop at all-- it’s just a straight-up pop record, and a very good one at that.</p>
<p>The first Eat Skull record in nearly four years, <i>III </i>almost sounds like the product of an entirely different band. Eat Skull’s full-length 2008 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11968-sick-to-death/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sick to Death </i></a>was among the least accessible records in a spate of tinnitus-inducing indie-pop releases from the period; any hummable moments on that record quickly had buckets of acid poured on them. Eat Skull dialed back considerably on the wincing-inducing treble on 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13051-wild-and-inside/"" target=""_blank"">Wild and Inside</a>, </i>veering instead toward loopy garage-rock and surprisingly sweet songcraft. But the relatively clarity of <i>Wild </i>is nothing compared with the fidelity upgrades made on <i>III. </i>With its brisk acoustic strum and angelic piano tinkling, “Amnesty Box” is a curveball in Eat Skull’s catalog: it’s a song made for slow dancing, and between normal people even (as opposed to Beatles-loving psychopaths). “Catch Em Before They Vanish” is another breath-taking beauty, with luminous guitars rubbing gently up against each other like prime-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a>.</p>
<p>Singer-guitarist Rob Enbom recently joked that Eat Skull listened to a lot of Phil Collins while making <i>III-- </i>comparing anything on this record to a <i>No Jacket Required </i>deep cut would be overstating things, but not <i>that </i>much. Listening to the album-opening guitar workout “Space Academy,” it’s not difficult to spot the departure points from Eat Skull’s previous records: Enbom’s vocals are audible and affecting, the song builds over the course of nearly five minutes to a killer climax, and the gently rolling beat acts as the primary hook. If Eat Skull truly was studying the book of Phil, it learned valuable lessons about how to build a pop song.</p>
<p>The easy-listening aspects of <i>III </i>are sure to disappoint those who love Eat Skull for its in-the-red side. Thankfully, the group hasn’t lost all of its weirdness. The bleary, free-form synth number “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14633-how-do-i-know-when-to-say-goodnight/"" target=""_blank"">How Do I Know When to Say Goodnight?</a>” sounds like elements of three different, equally strange songs bleeding in and out of each other. The fantastic “Dead Horse” intercuts the album’s bounciest melody-- which includes a recurring reference to Tommy James’ “Crimson and Clover”-- with stomach-churning imagery about “watching dead horses decompose.” Even creepier is the malevolent “Stupid Moon,” which lays a bluesy guitar lick over a low tide of dark, rolling feedback before easing into the deranged sound collage “Twin Sikk Moons”. But what was once alienating and difficult in Eat Skull’s music now reads as interesting quirks attached to pleasing packages. With <i>III, </i>Eat Skull is willing to be loved-- and be loveable, too.</p></div>"|17662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17662-eat-skull-iii/|7.4|Steven Hyden

When choosing her desert island discs, she wasn't exactly picky: <i>Island Universe</i> feeds off meandering <i>Strange Days </i>interludes, Sabbath sludge, and the loud, fast riffs of Black Lips and Davila 666, the band's one-time label Burger Records label mates. These disparate strands are tied together by Jones' distinctive voice, but only just.</p>
<p>Guitarist Louis Filliger writes most of the songs, though their many personalities could be attributed to the way Jones performs. ""I feel like I channel other people's emotions and different unseen entities,"" she <a href=""http://www.ocweekly.com/2012-10-18/music/locals-only-feeding-people-jessie-jones-louis-filliger-wyatt-blair-andrew-minter-tomas-dolas/full/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> the <i>OC Weekly</i>. ""I hear inside voices,"" she yowls on ""Inside Voices"", which shifts more traditionally between tight fills and loose comedowns. ""Everybody's sick and tired of being bored."" Thankfully, Feeding People don't match spiritual ennui with musical torpor; the band's volume and reckless rhythms take care of that.</p>
<p>That's likely down to <i>Island</i><i> Universe</i>'s two distinctive producers: Hanni El Khatib is known for his electroshocking blues, while Jonny Bell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5801-crystal-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Antlers</a> specializes in more lighthearted psychedelic pop. Both styles are present in the transitions between ""Other Side""-- which accesses its friends in the ether through a neat two minutes of interlocking guitar-- the tranquil ""Island Universe"" (allegedly inspired by the classic romanticism of ""My Girl""), and the momentum-powering ""Big Mother"", where Jones really unhinges her jaw, as if channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27878-screaming-females/"" target=""_blank"">Screaming Females</a>' Marissa Paternoster.</p>
<p>The first half is then sealed with ""Uranium Sea"" and ""Insane"", which respectively deal in pummeling riffs, and invocations of the Golden State (""Cali is calling me!""). The band seems to be having the most fun here: Jones takes her time enunciating each vowel and Filliger indulges in noisy tangents with gospel-like fervor. ""The Cat Song (Secrets of Luna)"", however, throws a wet blanket on the beginning of the second half, which struggles with an identity crisis.</p>
<p>Backed by violins and flutes, Jones' warbling on ""Cat Song"" comes off too serious, especially after the hair-raising tracks that precede it. The prosaically titled album closer ""Closer"" aims for an epic build but the attempt sounds contrived rather than anthemic. Getting weird in their own way sometimes suits Feeding People best. Though it doesn't fit the album's flow, ""Desert Song"" is still entertaining, like an exotic dancer turning up at the wrong party, although even then, Jones' spoken-word tangent about desert sand, cactus roses, and nothingness barely works. ""Red Queen"" is a demented dirge that aspires to Page and Bonham levels of burned-out one-upmanship between Filliger and drummer Mike Reinhart.</p>
<p>Feeding People's energy is abundant and undeniable, but all over the place on <i>Island Universe</i>. Despite abandoning any sense of sequencing on the second half, they're clearly aware of the power of a good album arc, but they couldn't quite pull it together and their psychedelic compulsions can seem out of place. As it is, Jones' idea about some shared emotional and spiritual paradise is lovely, but her band's directions don't make it easy to get there.</p></div>"|17759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17759-feeding-people-island-universe/|5.9|Harley Brown

All of those albums easily pass the one-hour hurdle; 2008's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11245-quaristice/"" target=""_blank""><i>Quaristice</i></a> comprised 20 relatively brief tracks cut from hours of extended jamming, but it still clocked in just shy of 74 minutes. In 2010, the two enthusiasts offered a <a href=""http://percussionlab.com/sets/autechre/12_hour_radio_broadcast"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">webcast</a> of an exhilarating 12-hour DJ set, pogoing from hip-hop and indie rock to industrial and electronica. (One short and emblematic sequence incorporated Eno and Byrne, RZA, Coil, and Boards of Canada.) A certain charm of Autechre has always been that they love music <i>and</i> they love making music; even at their most clinical, this zeal has remained an inherent premise.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the Manchester duo rewrote their own rules, leaning on the risks of their early works until, by their eighth LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/368-untilted/"" target=""_blank"">Untilted</a></i>, it was clear that their intention was no longer simply making bodies move, though that was sometimes a by-product. If Autechre's earliest records were typically classified as intelligent dance music, their later efforts might best be dubbed intelligence-enabled dance music-- with eclectic touchstones absorbed and dissolved, they did whatever they wanted. ""I think there's always this competitive freshness that we're trying to achieve,"" Brown <a href=""http://www.barcodezine.com/Autechre%20Interview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> around the time of <i>Quaristice</i>'s release. ""That's all there is in terms of statement or communication.""</p>
<p>But for all their influence, energy and innovation, Autechre have never been very good editors. Their EPs are the length of most bands' albums, while their albums run about as long as short feature films. If you hear an interesting sound or idea from Autechre, you're bound to hear it again and again before a track's end. Despite their creative restlessness, Brown and Booth have never been very good at moving on their music itself. These qualities dovetail to the detriment of <i>Exai</i>, the band's eleventh record-- and, by a margin of about 40 minutes, its longest. Though it's often interesting, <i>Exai </i>is insufferably exhausting, a record imprisoned by the obsessions of those who made it.</p>
<p>Five years ago, in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6788-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">interview with Pitchfork</a>, Brown said that the possibilities of technology had made music production intimidatingly infinite. A key to productivity, he implied, was setting limits and aims. ""You've got to be realistic,"" he said. ""You can sit in front of a computer and have a blank slate and be completely overwhelmed by the possibilities and not get anywhere."" Whereas 2010's wonderfully muted and warm <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14051-oversteps/"" target=""_blank""><i>Oversteps</i></a> found a path and followed it, <i>Exai </i>is a behemoth devoid of focus, an album on which the tough decisions about direction and, later, elimination have not been made. There are bass-heavy beaters that suggest the pair's earlier works, and amorphous drone numbers that don't; there are glitchy sprints that chirp, and menacing slogs that haunt. Just one of its 17 tracks doesn't break the four-minute mark, and many slingshot between various sounds and schemes, meaning that the transitions within the album and the songs themselves are weak, if not nonexistent. Pieces shift into bridges that lead nowhere (""T ess xi""), suddenly mix their metaphors and mechanics (the end of ""recks on"") and wallow in aesthetic indecision (tone-setting opener ""FLeure"").</p>
<p>There's nothing actually <i>wrong</i> with the sounds on <i>Exai</i>: Though they don't turn many new tricks, Autechre have once again proven to be top-notch sonic magpies and brilliant technicians. ""Irlite (get 0)"" makes a synthesizer sound like a church organ overrun by the ghosts in the graveyard, while ""T ess xi"" employs fluorescent soul keyboards as its basic building block. ""deco Loc"" turns someone's voice inside out, creating beautiful textures and themes from a sound salvaged and forcibly repurposed. The drums splashed over the surface of ""Runrepik"" suggest sun-warped crunk singles. Its chaser, ""spl9"", is an industrial crucible where the ruptures of power electronics and the force of dubstep are heated until they ricochet off one another. Brown and Booth are familiar with each other's habits, and wary of them, too. ""T ess xi"" showcases a sort of rhythmic volleyball between the pair, where several seemingly simple beats tease one another, shifting so as to avoid anything so obvious as a groove. Likewise, ""vekoS"" ends when its subaquatic beat surrenders slowly to a tide of overwhelming static. On an album of erratic shifts and very few segues, it's a moment of impossible tension.</p>
<p>Arguing that an album offers <i>too much</i> music seems passé at best, entirely irrelevant at worst. Aren't records just old-fashioned methods of assembling information, arbitrary holding tanks for material that could be released in online formats that don't adhere to time limitations or sequencing expectations? Possibly, and perhaps Autechre is once again ahead of a curve that we barely recognize. But that doesn't solve <i>Exai</i>'s fundamental problem: Some of its songs deserve to be cut into halves, while others should have been chopped wholesale. With those snips, <i>Exai</i> would be a really good Autechre album that summarizes the various successes of their career in an hour or so. As is, it's as much a frustrating obstacle course as it is a grueling marathon.</p></div>"|17691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17691-autechre-exai/|5.9|Grayson Currin

I don't fucking know. I was bored out of my fucking mind.""</p>
<p>That disappointment-- the unbridgeable rift between how you dream your life will go and how it actually turns out-- is the subject of Kozelek's most recent studio album, last year's harrowing, weirdly humorous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/"" target=""_blank""><i>Among the Leaves</i></a>. Song after song bemoans the fate of a cult musician in his 40s, a songwriter's songwriter who has put 20 years into a career that has leveled out, who has won glowing reviews but has very little to show for it except his name on a marquee. 7-11s in Melbourne look just like 7-11s everywhere else; a bag of nuts can be the highlight of your day. Expressing his extreme weariness with the touring life, Kozelek sounds better than he has in years-- more engaged, more personable, more observant, and more willing to describe the world around him, even if it tends to end at the stage lights.</p>
<p><i>Live at Phoenix Public House Melbourne</i> may be his most substantial live album in ages. It draws heavily from <i>Among the Leaves</i>, and makes a worthy addendum to the studio recording because it places these songs in what sounds like their natural setting: a small club sparsely filled with adoring fans clapping politely even after Kozelek laments the lop-sided male: female ratio. There's a sobering gravity here, a weird black humor accentuated by the relatively short run time: 12 tracks instead of <i>Among the Leaves</i>' 17, coming in at a reasonable 60 minutes instead of 80.</p>
<p>Kozelek's guitar playing is precise and lovely, especially during the solo on ""Heron Blue"", and his voice retains its hangdog eloquence, effortlessly evoking his workaday loneliness on ""Broken Wing"" and the brutally candid ""Track Number 8"". Perhaps the standout on <i>Phoenix</i>, however, is the stage banter. Several of his previous live albums, including last year's <i>On Tour</i>, have excised his between-song ramblings, but they sound crucial to this set, a revealing counterpart to the songs. He exercises a sly humor that's at once gracious (commiserating with the staff who will lose their jobs when the Phoenix Public House closes) and biting (dedicating ""The Moderately Talented Young Woman"" to an audience member who describes herself as a musician and waitress).</p>
<p>There's a great, weird, tense moment when Kozelek considers the irony of a fan who loves his music so much that he downloads it illegally. ""I'm trying to understand. So you live in Melbourne, Australia, and you bought my music off a Russian web site. Why? Why'd you do that?"" Kozelek sounds both touched and offended. That's the central conflict on <i>Among the Leaves</i>, but it's even more pronounced on <i>Live at Phoenix Public House</i>: Kozelek is grateful for his fans' dedication over the years, but on some level he resents them for leading him into such a lonely life.</p>
<p>So maybe <i>Like Rats</i> is a peace offering. His previous covers albums have been fan favorites, presenting his melancholy takes on songs by AC/DC, John Denver, Low, and Stephen Sondheim, but this new collection may be his most varied and adventurous. The tracklist portrays a man with broad listening habits, who not only translates these songs into his own particular style but erases the distinctions between genres. ""Time is Love"", a silly concept song by Josh Turner, has the same rhythmic thrust as Ted Nugent's ""Free-for-All"", and the Descendents' ""Silly Girl"" proves just as melodic as the snappy ""Right Back Where We Started From"", the 1976 hit by UK singer Maxine Nightingale.</p>
<p>Just as he brings these songs into his realm, they expand his realm, forcing him to rethink how he uses his voice and guitar. He opens Genesis' ""Carpet Crawlers"" in lush a cappella, layering his vocals in a way that expresses a profound, possibly narcotized wonder at the little creatures around him, and the one-two punch of Bad Brains' ""I"" and Godflesh's ""Like Rats"" redirects his signature low-key sound to express something like outrage and anger-- a wholly new mode for Kozelek. On the other hand, Bruno Mars' ""Young Girls"" wryly comments on all the tales of obsessive female fans on <i>Among the Leaves</i>, and Kozelek turns the hook into a wistfully descending melody.</p>
<p>Any record that emphasizes variety will have a few tracks that fall just outside the artist's reach; not everything works quite so well, although that has more to do with song choice than execution. Despite his attempts to alter the melody, Kozelek's version of Danzig's ""13"" recalls Johnny Cash's similarly acoustic yet superior version, and he awkwardly truncates the Dayglo Abortions' ""I Killed Mommy"", as if he can't bring himself to sing some of the more extreme lyrics. While it does sound like the ultraviolent companion to Kozelek's understated serial killer rumination ""Glenn Tipton"" (which he revives on <i>Live at Phoenix Public House)</i>, it ultimately sounds pointless and self-indulgent, intended perhaps to entertain himself more than his audience. But after so many bland hotels and anonymous convenience stores, who can blame him for making his own fun?</p></div>"|17626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17626-mark-kozelek-live-at-phoenix-public-house-melbournelike-rats/|6.7|Stephen Deusner

Two years later, they've found a much more appealing comfort zone. The Ageds are producers and session players first-- they've produced and played with a handful of big names in R&amp;B, soul, and pop music as well as lo-fi artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"">Nite Jewel</a>-- and this approach manifests itself clearly on <i>no world</i>, which feels like the work of studio hermits successfully dialing in on a sound. The atmospheres, textures, and melodies here feel drawn from a parallel universe where smooth Quiet Storm standards like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMyuP5S87_k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All This Love""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MprSh2fe3KE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Secret Lovers""</a> were made in the ProTools era of infinite layering.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Whether by plan, luck, or a combination of both, <i>no world</i> finds itself in good company. Over the past 12 months, sultry, slow jam R&amp;B has made an incredible comeback: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>'s ""Adorn"" borrowed from ""Sexual Healing"" and Gregory Abbott's ""Shake You Down"", and the sound found its cachet heightened with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>'s ""Thinkin' Bout You"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>'s ""Climax,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>'s <i>Devotion</i>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><span class=""s1""><i>Voodoo </i></span></a>reissue. inc. doesn't aim to duplicate the vocal abilities or striking personalities of their most skilled contemporaries, instead opting for distinct scene-setting. Opening cuts ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14271-the-place/"" target=""_blank"">The Place</a>"" and ""Black Wings"" are enveloping soundscapes cloaked in velvet, cut with a self-conscious air of mystery. When Andrew sings, ""I feel like you've been here before,"" it's the perfect piece of bedroom soul scene-setting: It's all about you, not him, wait... doesn't he know you from somewhere?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though the album is obsessed with the sound of the early 1980s, the Ageds incorporate nods toward R&amp;B's internet-fueled 21st century mutations; ""The Place"" and ""5 Days"" pull the flat, skittering drum patter from Atlanta's trap-rap production playbook. The last few years' indie/R&amp;B crossover resonates throughout the album, as well, with good reason. Legendary British independent 4AD is releasing <i>no world</i>, and the grey, slowly billowing guitars on ""black wings"" and the cavernous atmospherics of ""Angel"" feel like the Aged brothers' nod toward label godheads the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4217-this-mortal-coil/"">This Mortal Coil</a>. Andrew's muted vocals throughout the record, mixed to blend in with the production, have more in common with Toro y Moi's willowy retro soul than anything currently climbing the R&amp;B charts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Being perfectly of its time obviously doesn't mean that <i>no world</i> competes on the same level as their most successful contemporaries: the xx, Rhye's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/music/rhye-offers-a-warm-croon-wrapped-in-an-enigma.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">viral-era, gender-twisting Sade fixation</a>, even How to Dress Well's full-on smooth-soul deconstruction. There's the sense that the duo with the purposefully generic corporate moniker, the timid fixation on lower case letters, and the penchant for composing songs out of genres are comfortable with their whispery anonymity, which is fortunate: inc. is both faithful to its source material and clever enough to twist it into new shapes, but at least for the time being, <i>no world</i> is unlikely to bring the Ageds out of the shadows.</p></div>"|17625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17625-teen-inc-no-world/|7.0|Eric Harvey
