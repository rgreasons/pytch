    The AOR-ification of Gomez is now complete. Whereas the UK quintet's first three albums were loaded with experimental bits, feints toward dub and electronica, and a general air of eclecticism, their last studio effort and final Virgin album, 2004's <em>Split the Difference</em>, was a marked move into full-on trad-rock. They debuted on ATO last year with the 2xCD live album <em>Out West</em> (one album late according to the Foghat Principle), and their return to the studio produced their squeaky-cleanest album to date in <em>How We Operate</em>. Scraping out most of the experimental guck has focused the band's sound significantly, but the second edge of that sword cuts them into a much more boring group.</p><p>
    The songwriting centers on generally strong melodies, but this most American-sounding of British groups neither benefits from the additional attention called to the lyrics nor offers consistently interesting arrangements to support them. The band's triple-guitar lineup gets craziest on ""Cry on Demand"" (Opening line: ""I wish I could cry on demand boo hoo boo hoo""), turning some otherwise ho-hum verses about an ambiguous Las Vegas mishap into a weirdly see-sawing splatterfest; they also take the two most disjointed, non-rhyming lines and try to make them into a chorus, which doesn't work so well. ""Hamoa Beach"" gets the chorus home more effectively, backing up the vocal harmonies with fuzzy slide guitar and a bubbling wah riff that makes the song infinitely more memorable.</p><p>
    The band tries to air out its love for American blues on ""Charley Patton Songs"", which ironically has not a hint of blues in it. The introductory lyric about spending a lifetime trying to decipher Charley Patton songs feels disconnected from the rest of the song, which builds up to a just plain confounding chorus-y thing that goes ""I've been looking in New York/ I've been looking in Chicago/ I've been looking in New Orleans/ I can't find you."" It's weirdly literal, but I can't tell from the other lyrics who they're looking for-- if it's Patton, they might have tried checking rural Mississippi instead of just naming a bunch of big American cities. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's poorest entries in the Gomez songbook grate for other reasons--""See the World"" is just the epitome of bland, sounding barely a step removed from that Five For Fighting song that polluted MTV2 a couple of years ago, and ""All Too Much"" falls into the same territory, just with an added loud/soft dynamic for the chorus. It's tough to gauge what the average Gomez fan will think of this-enough of the band's spirit is still there that I imagine many will make the transition, but anyone who enjoyed Gomez for their more adventurous traits will be left in the cold by <em>How We Operate</em>.

    Unless the liner notes are lying, that really is
    Sufjan Stevens playing a dizzy, disjointed guitar solo on ""Springfield, or Bobby
    Got a Shadfly Caught in his Hair"".  When
    the man known for his gentle falsetto and baroque music fetish picks up an
    electric guitar, he stumbles and lurches like he's been hit in the head. Shambling and off-kilter, he coughs up odd phrases instead of weaving in
    countermelodies.</p><p>
    You'll find plenty of small but head-turning moments
    like that on <em>The Avalanche</em>. 
    You'll also find a disc full of stuff that sounds a lot like last year's
    <em>Illinois</em>-- and that's the point. 
    This is the outtakes and B-sides album from last year's magnum opus, and
    Stevens himself calls them also-rans. 
    In his recent <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/29535/Interview_Interview_Sufjan_Stevens""><strong>Pitchfork interview</strong></a>, Stevens said he considered just
    giving these songs away on the web, which wouldn't have been a bad idea;
    he could have dripped the best cuts to mp3 blogs and anthologies, like he's
    done for the past few months, to stay on the radar while he finishes his next
    proper album.</p><p>
    As it is, <em>The Avalanche </em>is not just a B-sides
    record; it's actually a mirror image, with 21 tracks that loosely follow <em>Illinois--
    </em>including the suspenseful intro, the fast, pulsing second track, the
    quizzical segues, the interminable song titles, and the gradual instrumental
    send-off.  The mood is gentler and more
    acoustic; the title track harkens back to the banjo-led introspection of <em>Seven
    Swans</em>, and the last ballad, ""Pittsfield"", has the cozy tunefulness of a
    chicken soup jingle.  But for most of
    the disc, Stevens brings back the statewide namechecks and the ""Illinoisemakers""
    marching band arrangements.
    </p>
<p>
    Call it burnout or backlash if you have to,
    but it's hard not to compare the two albums and find this one wanting; even the
    best songs, which are quite good, wouldn't bump anything off of <em>Illinois</em>.  (""The Mistress Witch From McClure"" comes
    closest, but ""Casimir Pulaski Day"" already took its slot.)  <em>The
    Avalanche </em>would have been engaging at half the length, but at 75 minutes,
    let's just say that if you have a saturation point for Stevens, you're gonna
    reach it.  
    </p>
<p>
    Still, <em>The Avalanche </em>isn't ""Sufjan's latest
    album"" so much as Sufjan's sketchbook: If you want to study how he operates and
    catch new facets of his work, you'll be satisfied.  We get that shambolic guitar, the spacy analog synth on ""For
    Clyde Tombaugh"" (named for the guy who discovered Pluto), and most of all,
    three new versions of ""Chicago"" (subtitled ""Acoustic Version"", ""Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version"", and best of all, the beats-and-jitters
    arrangement of ""Multiple Personality Disorder Version"").  By including three alternate arrangements of
    his biggest song to date (per the Last.fm charts, anyway), Sufjan shakes up his
    image as a new hero of adult contemporary songwriting.  
    </p>
<p>
    Stevens considers himself a serious composer and a
    craftsman who wants his songs to stand on their own with no autobiographical
    or sentimental crutches; personal stories litter the material, but he doesn't use
    the backstory to sell the songs.  Yet in
    spite of this, his voice and singer-songwriting tempt us to believe that every
    time we hear his falsetto crack, we're seeing into his soul.  People who emote like Stevens are supposed
    to be ""authentic."" Just like on Lifetime, everything has to be a true
    story, and you only write about a friend who dies of cancer if you've just come
    back from the funeral.  Some have even
    criticized <em>Illinois</em>, and now <em>The Avalanche</em>,<em> </em>because the
    whole thing was-- to quote Ryan Irvine at Goodhodgkins.com-- a ""cold and
    calculated research project."" 
    </p>
<p>
    On a gut level, I understand that reaction.  But critically, it
    doesn't make sense.  Stevens is less a Nick Drake than a maverick
    craftsman like John Fahey.  He'll never
    come to our houses and weep on our shoulders-- but he'll write songs
    about
    coming to our houses and weeping on our shoulders.  And this
    sensitive yet askew set is a reminder that great music
    comes from the head more than the heart-- and it leaves plenty of
    mistakes,
    strange jokes, near-misses, and useless flashes of brilliance along the
    way.

The Divine Comedy, a <em>nom de chamber pop</em> for Northern Ireland-born singer/songwriter Neil Hannon, has traipsed through several musical wardrobes since 1989-- jangle-pop, eccentric Britpop mini-orchestra, Nigel Godrich-guided introspection-- but despite sporadic UK chart appearances and a 2002 U.S. tour with Ben Folds, critical acclaim has yet to usher in popular acceptance. The Divine Comedy's constants are a Wildean wit with an apposite sense of style, and they persist on extravagant ninth album <em>Victory for the Comic Muse</em>.</p><p>
    After the home-and-hearth subject matter of 2004's <em>Absent Friends</em>, Hannon returns to eyebrow-arched character portraits. On the most elegant of these studies, ""A Lady of a Certain Age"", an upper-crust widow's lonely pub visit unfolds into a poignantly arranged, sumptuously detailed story of her life, carried by Hannon's baritone croon, acoustic guitar, and strings. Reportedly inspired by Noel Coward's diaries, the song shows Hannon's tender, unapologetically acute theatricality at its finest. Opener ""To Die a Virgin"" finds the 35-year-old songwriter playing the hormonally haywire young suitor, lusting after an extra-special birthday gift. This pop-operatic approach goes farthest on ""The Plough""-- a track as endearingly pretentious as early solo Scott Walker and nearly as sweepingly orchestrated-- in which a cynical bildungsroman takes a turn for theological discourse. These songs set lofty goals, and realize them.</p><p>
    Other songs tackle more pedestrian topics, but Hannon's decorous voice and generous accompaniment nevertheless lend them an aristocratic mien. Banjo-driven ""Mother Dear"" feints toward sickly sweet Mother's Day card before twisting a playful dagger: ""There but for the grace of God go I."" Tropicalia-sunned ""Diva Lady"" is an unfortunate choice of single, but still has some fun decimating the easy target of celebrity shenanigans: ""She makes him look hetero/ He helps her profile,"" stabs Hannon. Syrupy ballad ""The Light of Day"" casts memories of lost love aloft over fluttering woodwinds, though it pales beside the similar ""Songs of Love"", from 1996's <em>Casanova</em>. It's difficult to see the point of a capable, string-fettered cover of the Associates' lush 1982 single ""Party Fears Two"", but there's Hannon, role-playing once again, and dashingly so.
    </p><p>
    The album's title is taken from E.M. Forster's <em>A Room With a View</em>, but more significantly, it's a play on the name of the Divine Comedy's 1990 debut album, <em>Fanfare for the Comic Muse</em>. This bit of context lends <em>Victory for the Comic Muse</em> the air of a farewell, though quirkier excursions like three-piano instrumental ""Threesome"", verbose ""Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont"", or tender piano-traipsing finale ""Snowball in Negative"" suggest Hannon has new ideas in him yet. More likely-- or, at least, more optimistically-- it's the close of a chapter. As the earlier Wilde mention suggests, Hannon, like Morrissey or Jarvis Cocker, is most aptly compared to figures in the world of literature. It's a pity that such similarly sharp-minded social observers as Evelyn Waugh and Bernard Shaw don't have more platinum records. At least there are always MySpace friends.

    In the second half of the 1990s, Jan St. Werner of Mouse on
    Mars was active making solo tracks as Lithops. He released two albums and a
    number of singles under the name during this period, all with little promotion
    and to little notice. These records served as a bridge between Mouse on Mars'
    pop experiments and the randomized abstraction St. Werner created with Markus
    Popp of Oval in Microstoria. When Mouse on Mars leaned ambient, as on the <em>Instrumentals
    </em>and <em>Glam</em> records, it sounded a lot like what St. Werner was doing
    around the same time with Lithops.</p><p>
    The notion of computer folk was still a couple years away
    during the Lithops heyday, but returning to the singles and unreleased material
    collected here, the idea fits the music rather well. It's not that Lithops
    incorporates guitars or references ""folk"" proper in any way; it's
    that the music seems to bubble up from a similar organic place. It feels
    simultaneously earthy and disembodied, like it always existed in some form and
    it was St. Werner's charge to channel and shape it.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that the music is divorced from genre.
    Many of St. Werner's usual concerns are present. When the tempo shifts upward
    and percussion makes an appearance, tracks like ""Tubino See-Through"",
    ""Wackler"", and ""Blasphere"" make oblong reference to dub,
    keeping just behind the lilting beat as St. Werner moves weird bubbly noises
    around the space. The more open-ended excursions in mood and ambient extend
    naturally from Eno circa <em>On Land</em>, with St. Werner adding a distinctive
    industrial dirtiness to the sound. A fantastic title used for a Lithops track
    collected on Mille Plateaux's <em>Modulation and Transformation 4</em> (and not
    included here) sums up the aesthetic of ""Kahn"", ""Sequenced
    Twinset"", and ""Fi"" rather nicely: ""Between The Jolts Were
    Gritty Regions"". You can almost smell the solder and feel the greasy
    metallic residue on these droney pieces. And then the noisy slo-mo dissection
    of feedback ""Blasmusik"" points to the spoonful-weighs-a-ton density
    St. Werner would later explore on <em>Scrypt</em>, a record I'm still trying to
    get my head around three years after its release.
    </p>
<p>
    The world of technology was going crazy as the 20<sup>th</sup> century ended and no one really knew what was to come. It has accelerated
    further since, of course, but by now we're getting used to it. When Moore's Law
    was in full effect and a new paradigm was announced every couple of weeks, we
    had no idea where these silicon chips were going to take us. In this
    environment, Lithops singles seemed like the sort of pleasant, unassuming,
    natural, and open tracks that would emerge from computers in this new era. They
    sounded like machines making music independently and for their own
    amusement.

    There hasn't been much in Kid606's circuitous recording career that would suggest he'd have any interest in making a record like <em>Pretty Girls Make Raves</em>, which is likely the very reason that he has now decided to do so. The Kid (aka Miguel Depedro) has always been most readily defined by his stubborn refusal to be pigeonholed, even when it has come at the expense of a coherent and navigable discography. True to form, <em>Pretty Girls Make Raves</em> bears almost no relation to Depedro's impressionistic 2005 album <em>Resilience</em>, just as it is also unrecognizably distant from both the splintered breakbeat extremism of his early years and his periodic heart-tugging ambient interludes. Instead, <em>Pretty Girls</em> is a blunt instrument of gritty analog techno, on which Depedro displays an uncharacteristic degree of restraint and focus to craft some of his burliest, no-nonsense Tigerbeat6 productions yet.</p><p>
    Evidently the weak pun of the album's title is meant to be taken at face value, as the music here makes no direct reference to either the band Pretty Girls Make Graves or the Smiths' song-- for which we should be grateful. Though it's billed as a tribute to Baltimore club and bass-heavy techno, as with many of Kid606's releases the album courses with sneering punk energy-- all captured with the grainy B&amp;W imprecision of a Xeroxed concert flyer stapled to a lightpost. As such, it doesn't take much to imagine the sturdy, reductive near-riffs of tracks like ""Meet Me at the Bottom"" or ""Comeuppance"" transposed from the Kid's vintage electronic gear to traditional post-hardcore guitar structures.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, Kid606 makes minimal use of samples and hairpin edits, at least by the manic standards of his previous work. Here he shows patience, allowing his dense, thick-bottomed beats the space to expand and develop before jumping to the next idea, a practice that increases the monumental impact of each additional new sonic element. The locomotive opener ""Let It Rock"" is punctuated by pep-squad yells and deformed squeals that sound like an airliner's faulty landing gear, while ""Get Down Low"" builds its curious forward momentum via lurching steam-press rhythms. Simplest and most effective of all might be the hard-driving ""Chicken Fight"", a bleary, gimmick-free scorcher that doesn't allow its reverence for classic Jeff Mills/Laurent Garnier techno to sidestep or overwhelm its ruthless body-moving utility. 
    </p>
<p>
    With an attack this rudimentary, however, Kid606 has left himself little room for any missteps. Adornments like the distorted, DFA-friendly vocals on ""Meet Me at the Bottom"" or ""T.Y.T.R."" seem rather inconsequential, as Depedro takes easy lyrical potshots at ex-girlfriends and faux-hipsters with what sounds like Velcro taped over his mouth. And as with much of his recent music, <em>Pretty Girls Make Raves</em> only makes genuine sense when considered as an adjunct to Kid606's existing body of work, seeming to be another display of agile versatility rather than raw invention. Despite the album's massive and satisfying ephemeral force, as the lights come up and the floor empties out listeners may be left to wonder yet again where exactly Kid606's diffuse trail is leading and how we'll recognize him once we get there.

    Never less than wildly ambitious, <em>Floating World</em> is lavish enough for simple description to send most old-media typists careening over their word limits: glockenspiels, trumpets, trombones, flugelhorns, chains, harps, cellos, melodicas, bells, Velcro, feedback, ""We Will Rock You"" bleacher stomps, a cappella-group harmonies, Bible stories, Jeff Buckley balladic calisthenics, Ben Folds piano drama, a quick <em>Rain Dogs</em>-cum-Man Man hobo freakout, Appleseed Cast guitar sprawl, a surfeit of time-signature changes, one track with whirling drums that sound like ""Chicago"" (or really ""Clocks""), and, on modern-classical-informed ""The Bruised Reed"", plenty of ""love, love, love."" Adds lead singer Matt Joynt, in choirboy melisma that intermittently froths with emo-kid angst: ""See, all things are so bright and spiritual.""</p><p>
    Oh, are they? The band's name may be Greek for ""to renew"", but criticism comes from the Greek <em>krinein</em>, or ""to cut,"" and here on the world wide internet there's plenty of space for saber-baring. <em>Floating World</em>'s ostensible centerpiece is the song cycle from caroling, discordant ""Hanasakajijii One: The Angry Neighbor"" to the, yes, ""Chicago""-like ""Hanasakajijii Four: A Great Wind, More Ash""-- although naturally, the tracks are out of order and interspersed with the rest of the album. They're based on a Japanese folktale about a dog digging up gold in a neighbor's yard. Typical lyric: ""I, of wicked deeds, snarling mouth/ Wandered away, wandered by."" Clearly, none of this is Japan's fault.
    </p><p>
    But as the old saying goes, when you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit-- and Anathallo love clichés, too.  ""Out of sight, out of mind/ Someone said that to me, someone said that to me""-- but they've clearly taken the former advice to heart. <em>Floating World</em> is little more than a long list of insufferable pretensions that suggest some psychedelic aspirations. Complexity for complexity's sake is lame, and nothing inherently privileges music that tries to bring ""higher"" arts into plain ol' pop; you could fill shelves and shelves with bad art-rock, jazz-rock or classical-rock. <em>Floating World</em> makes Anathallo the Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer of fiction-workshop rock: All things go, all things go.

    No band of the last 15 years has seen its individual
    players revered to the same extent as Radiohead's. Whether or not you subscribe
    to the church of the blinking bear, it's hard to argue against the incredible good fortune that's seen them blossom from the nebbish and resoundingly
    ordinary young group On a Friday. While Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood will
    always stand at stage center, you barely need 10 minutes with a Radiohead
    record to understand how readily the band shifts its weight from one member to
    another; so strong are their individual voices as musicians that you can
    practically hear the pistons moving underneath their songs.</p><p>
    But we're coming up on seven albums now, each one of them
    (if you believe the soundbites) an utterly excruciating process. That, combined
    with Yorke's headstrong affinity for laptop music and his MP3 era-friendly
    motto of expediency, has pried the door open for a solo quickie. So, on the
    heels of the news that Radiohead's vaunted seventh full-length wouldn't be
    ready any time soon, Yorke carpet-bombed fans in May by announcing <em>The Eraser</em>.</p><p>
    That was a little over seven weeks ago, and you can be sure
    the window between name and release was purposely kept small so as to mitigate
    against the weight of expectation. We know this because, for all their <em>No Logo</em> sloganeering, Radiohead have
    never been afraid to deploy a marketing juggernaut to herald their imminent
    return. If the message being transmitted here is a modest one, it's because <em>The Eraser</em> is a modest record. Contrary
    to some of the band's prior releases (and, perhaps, their legacy), it's not an
    attempt to remake the wheel, but rather, pretty much exactly the kind of thing
    you'd expect Yorke to make in his bedroom-- glitchy, sour, feminine, brooding,
    imperfect. It's also strikingly beautiful and thuddingly boring in maddeningly
    equal measure.
    </p>
<p>
    Let's start with the good stuff: Opener ""The Eraser""  rests on a hiccuping piano sample, a bubblebath
    of bloops and some gently insistent vocal acrobatics. ""The more you try to
    erase me/ The more that I appear,"" sings Yorke, in the first of the album's
    many lines that could just as easily be about environmental crises as personal.
    Next up is the skittering ""Analyse"", which marries a twinkling piano lead to a breakbeat made of crushed glass. Lyrically, Yorke is in solid form, singing
    about algebra, candles in the city, and ""no light in the dark."" He's not nearly
    as sharp on the sleepy-eyed ""Atoms for Peace"" (how's this for a clanger: ""Peel
    all your layers off/ I want to eat your artichoke heart""), but it provides
    some of the album's most serene moments, wherein he sets his falsetto against a
    wall of discordant keyboard drones to gorgeously vertiginous effect. Better
    still is the closer ""Cymbal Rush"", which comes off as ""The Gloaming""'s
    moonstruck cousin. A wash of digital burbles and woozy drones, the song's second half
    relents to a set of galloping piano chords and complex rhythm tracks, making
    it, from a producerly standpoint, the most accomplished thing here.
    </p>
<p>
    Where <em>The Eraser</em>
    sags is in the middle, with tracks 3-5 falling particularly flat. Like
    too many of Radiohead's new songs, they contain a single weak idea dragged on
    interminably. ""The Clock"" is a tuneless clatter of insect noises and acoustic
    guitars that never changes course; ""Black Swan"" is a swampbucket ""I Might Be
    Wrong"" retread that barely even flaps its wings (nevermind gets off the ground);
    and the horrorshow talkie ""Skip Divided"", with its cursory arrangements and
    total absence of melody, feels like second-rate performance poetry. 
    </p>
<p>
    On a smaller scale, the problems afflicting these tracks
    afflict the album as a whole; even allowing for the better-crafted songs,
    there's little-to-no dynamic range on <em>The
    Eraser</em>.  As a listening experience,
    it's claustrophobic and compressed, and with rare exception, offers little in
    the way of wide open space. What little breathing room there is usually comes
    courtesy of Yorke's vocal, and while it's nice to see him once again testing
    the limits of what he can do naturally with his voice, it might not be enough
    to save the record for some.
    </p>
<p>
    The word 'gray' will be used to describe <em>The
    Eraser</em>, and with good reason-- unless you're predisposed to loving everything
    Yorke sets his voice against, you mind fight this an oppressively dreary
    affair. My totally catty suggestion: Don't bother with this unless you've
    already worn out the grooves on Jonny Greenwood's much less-heralded but
    completely brilliant <em>Bodysong</em> soundtrack. Or
    maybe, if you're really jonesing, set up two stereos and play both solo records
    at once, <em>Zaireeka</em>-style. I wouldn't
    be surprised at all if that worked.

    It's a curious thing when electronic artists raised in
    12-inch DJ culture opt for long-form composition. You can imagine, say, the
    force driving Goldie to create ""Mother"" had something to do with him
    wanting to be taken seriously as an artist and seeing how far the genre he was
    working with could be stretched. The same thoughts were surely running through Pete
    Townshend's head in the second half of the 60s. These impulses have led to some
    interesting music and boundaries being pushed a few feet; they've also led to large swaths of wasted time.</p><p>
    While Plaid's newest record <em>Greedy Baby</em>, a CD/DVD
    ""AV Album"" created in collaboration with video artist Bob Jaroc,
    isn't properly a single composition (there are gaps of silence between the nine
    tracks), it certainly feels like a long-form piece. It's partly how the music
    is presented and partly the uniform sound palette, but it has even more to do
    with tracks that don't want to stand on their own. All seem to exist in
    relation to one another, and nothing pops its head out to say, ""I'm a
    single, listen to me first."" This being the case, you have to judge <em>Greedy Baby</em> by how taking in its 51 minutes in a single sitting feels.</p><p>
    There's a marked prog vibe early on, evident on the second
    track ""I Citizen the Loathesome"". Twinkling synths that sound like a
    digital approximation of a harpsichord introduce a theme, which gradually
    builds in tempo until a faux-pipe organ and an actual chorus of wordless voices
    join in. The scales, chords, and tempo changes suggest widescreen pomp at every
    turn, building to a distorted guitar-like sound and the massed choir intoning
    apocalypse. Unfortunately, the grandiosity leads nowhere in particular, and
    when the music box intro of ""The Launching of Big Face"" comes next,
    we're back to the same low-level, vaguely anxious mood. That vibe continues
    with minor variations on ""ZN Zero"", which manages at least a neat
    Escheresqe trick whereby it seems to be constantly ascending. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""The Return of Super Barrio"" is where the record
    finally takes off, as humor and playfulness seep in. Steel drums, a loping
    acoustic bass integrated with programmed beats, and a reasonably catchy tune
    combine to suggest a mariachi band performing on one of Jupiter's moons. From
    there we go to ""E.M.R"", which stretches on for 10 minutes but feels
    considerably longer, with its indistinct bells and electronic percussion
    echoing endlessly into space. It's here that you begin to suspect that that the
    music isn't necessarily meant to stand on its own, and that the video is an
    essential part of the work. 
    </p>
<p>
    The visuals, then. ""War Dialer"" opens the DVD on a
    high note. The audio is a collage culled from a hacking program dialing random
    numbers in search of a vulnerable modem. As women answer and speak in
    puzzlement to the dialing machine, a circular array of graphics moves in time
    with the voices. There's nothing to it, really, but the piece is clever
    in its simplicity; same goes for the animated line drawing that accompanies
    ""The Launching of Big Face"", which dances and contorts itself into
    some beautiful shapes and makes the uninspired Philip Glassisms of the track
    seem worthwhile.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    A couple uninspiring videos are little more than edited assemblages of cities at night, hoping to evoke a sense of dread in slow pans and quick
    montages among graffiti-covered alleys and traffic streaming beneath lit
    buildings. To sit through the entirely of ""E.M.R."", a mostly dark
    screen with layers of dim light floating around, is to wish desperately for a
    temporary infusion of a heavily disorienting drug that might make it interesting.
    </p>
<p>
    So we're stuck with a few nice moments in a work that resists being pulled
    apart. The dull patches are particularly depressing when you realize how much
    work went into them for so little payoff. That's the risk with these big,
    long-form statements, with so much invested by both the artists and the
    audience. When you're sitting through them and they don't quite work, you
    become aware of how painfully short life really is.

    In the late 1970s, Scritti Politti were a post-punk band-- a clanging, abstract, Marxist mess. By the mid-1980s, they were a sweet synth-heavy soul dream, and singer Green Gartside was a genuine pop star. That’s not so surprising-- a lot of punks went pop in those days. What’s remarkable is the depth at which Gartside was able to absorb and recreate r&amp;b and soul. The music wasn’t just an influence on him; he became a part of it, and even exerted some small vanguard influence on it himself. His band became the test lab for soft, swooning, upwardly-mobile 1980s fern-bar soul-- you know, the kind of complex, jazz-inflected blue-eyed r&amp;b that strips out everything but the pure dreamy sweetness of the form. This was the sound of a certain type of adult in the 1980s; it sounded gorgeous on expensive hi-fis and promised something good and comfortable about the world. And now, 30 years later and unfathomably far from punk, there’s this pure dreamy sweetness of this album-- Gartside’s first in seven years.</p><p>
    So Gartside is important, but the stuff that makes <em>White Bread, Black Beer</em> so great has nothing to do with “importance” or “influence”-- it’s exactly the opposite. Gartside recorded these songs at home, and their biggest feature is just Green in the back room, harmonizing with himself, sweetly and gracefully, over home-computer synths and beats. Some critics will say that those harmonies have something in common with Brian Wilson’s and the Beach Boys’, and there’s some truth to that. But Wilson’s songs were always grander than this: They were “teenage symphonies to god.” Gartside’s vocal-jazz harmonies sound more like middle-aged symphonies to the cat on the windowsill, or a lover just on the other side of the blanket; they sound contented and domestic. There’s always been that kind of intimacy to his voice, beloved by many and surely loathed by some-- it’s so plush, so treacly! Prince is the Prince of Minnesota; Gartside is the Prince of Wales.</p><p>
    You could guess that these songs were recorded at home, too: It’s in the sound of the music itself. The production is ambitious-- soft, smooth, and spacious as ever-- and Gartside’s writing is consistently complex, always plotting out the classiest and most striking shifts in the chord structures and harmonies. But all this sophistication doesn’t feel like some grand, expensive endeavor, like pop-soul always did in the 80s; it sounds like something that spilled privately out of Gartside’s head. After all, it’s difficult to think of any place besides that head where all the constituent parts of this sound-- glittery soft rock, lush and quiet r&amp;b, vocal-jazz harmony, hip-hop love-- fit together naturally and unselfconsciously, sounding quite this simple and homespun. Those things are inseparable here, from the digital arrangements to the guitar playing. “Snow in the Sun” runs from laid-back pop twinkle through a series of a cappella harmonies and then into some computer-programmed funk-- and yet there’s never the trace of a feeling that anything about its style has shifted.
    </p>
<p>
    None of which quite gets at the endless softness and glamour and mature soul of the record. The thing is that this sort of music-- classy blue-eyed pop, adult in its lyrics and lush in its songwriting-- doesn’t get done much these days: It’s absolutely 1980s, only it’s an aspect of the decade hardly anyone bothers thinking about. Apart from Kelley Polar (and maybe Saint Etienne), I’d guess the last shot at this sound Pitchfork would have covered is XTC’s <em>Oranges and Lemons</em>, from 1989. That leaves this album sounding fresh, certainly-- and there’s another trick as well. The sweet pop-soul of the 1980s was for adults-- eloquent, sophisticated, and comfortable-- but it also aspired to glamour and wealth; it could primp and shine and get too slick for its own good. The pop coming from the back of Gartside’s apartment these days works better, because it’s adult in all honesty: unpretentiously adult, contented and domestic. It’s gorgeous, but it’s the opposite of grand, and those two things go wonderfully together-- there’s the feeling of something small, beautiful, and <em>personal</em>. It sounds good everywhere I’ve played it, but it sounds best when I’ve just finished cleaning the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
    There’s no doubt that this record won’t work for everyone. It’s a sophisticated, gloriously gentle thing in a time when lots of people need their music to bump or wail; it’ll be easy for some to call it cloying, saccharine, too unctuous. But either way, I’m beginning to think it’s one of the smartest records-- musically and lyrically-- we’ll hear all year.

Taylor was on has taken a turn for the worse.  Previous albums from the band found it mining the usual <em>No Depression</em> touchstones for fresh blood, and gradually mixing that extract with whatever's at hand.  More often than not , the group succeeded regardless of how far they decided to stray from the source text.  With <em>Hearts</em>, however, the confident, and blissed-out vibe of their previous work gives way to a confused burnt-out haze where the group's many influences collide and smear.</p><p>
    It kicks off (or, more fittingly, rolls over) with ""Let's Get High"", a meandering stumble of a song that lives up to every possible negative stereotype a track with such a title can engender.  After an atmospheric introductory minute, the track leads with stilted drumming and delay-pedaled guitar underpinning Taylor's listless singing.  His call to pass the dutchie, peppered with references to the Mercy Seat and getting turned on and swimming with his lady friend (""you have beautiful fins""), paint him as a narcoleptic Jim Morrison.  The between-verse interludes, featuring some tasteful slide guitar, almost rights the ship, but then the actual song, wearing a COLLEGE sweatshirt, comes back in and spills beer all over the couch.</p><p>
    Despite some moments that highlight the band's strengths, the album never recovers from this initial misstep.  Some of the faux pas are song-long, like ""Capaldi"", an attempt to squeeze some Crazy Horse jam into an Elmer's Glue bottle.  Some of the lowpoints are just odd moments and decisions that occur mid-song, like the switch from the sweet lowdown shuffle of the first half of ""High Life"" to some ill-conceived rave-up outro, or the use of corny voice distortion during the chorus of ""Ballad of Horselover Fat"". And if whatever the group's using to get high inspired them to insert synth trumpets in the middle of ""Smoke Signals"", their dealer should get a kick in the balls.
    </p><p>
    It's a shame, too, because when this album get its genre-splicing shit together, it's pretty nice.  The instrumental ""Milk White Flag"" (and its tape-looped reprisal, ""Gatesnakes"") offer a brief but enjoyable melodic shimmer.  Meanwhile, full-blown tracks like the laid-back ""We Were All Uptown Rulers"" and the playful ""Your Mother Was The Lightning"" provide a more appealing backdrop for Taylor's laconic vocal and lyrical stylings.  Moments like this get lost amidst the rest of the album, however, leading to a record that's trying too hard to be everything all at once.

    Repetition's key when it comes to pop music, but please boys, this is ridiculous. While made-for-Misshapes, UK indie-dancerockers Boy Kill Boy get A's for effort, debut <em>Civilian</em> is little more than overhyped, albeit danceable déjà vu-- repeating and threepeating ad infinitum, nauseum. Boy Kill Boy don't simply give nods to Killers, Maxïmo Park, Hot Hot Heat, Kaiser Chiefs, Interpol, and whatever slew of 1980s and 90s bands the aforementioned exalt, they're pulling John Travoltas à la <em>Face/Off</em>-- turning out near-spitting images of their precursors, contributing little else to a no longer cozy dancerock niche. What's more, Boy Kill Boy don't just replicate, songs recur even internally: ""Back Again"" needs no backup singers; Chris Peck might as well be four people, boldly echoing where few men have echoed before.</p><p>
    Fair warning came with 2005's Fierce Panda single ""Suzie"", a nightmarish carousel of a song, whining ""Countdown, countdown, countdown to the disappointment."" As track three on <em>Civilian</em>, it foreshadows the album's trajectory. Opener ""Back Again"" is Boy Kill Boy at their most listenable; from there, <em>Civilian</em> grows exponentially exhausting: Nearly all tracks bear identical starts and drum beats, and those that don't fall remarkably flat. ""Showdown"" meanders down a relatively snail-paced road that Boy Kill Boy should avoid; ""Ivy Parker"" falls victim to identical feeble, circular sluggishness; likewise, ""Shoot Me Down"" starts off mimicking an Interpol song, then turns into what's poised to be our generation's elevator muzak.</p><p>
    Then there's that voice: Peck's Paul Banks/Chris Martin pipes are exactly like the guy from Stellastarr and just as incredibly, irritatingly grating, affected, and peppy-- lyrically alluding to woes when they're better off embodying the happy-go-lucky. Case in point: It's hard to take Peck seriously while he's warbling, ""Close to madness/ So demanding, I can't breathe anymore/ I'll never be the same again/ Please forgive me, and forget me."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The forgetting's easy; the forgiving less so.<br/>

    Why this? Why now? <em>I'm Going to Tell You a Secret</em> packages a live album from Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour along with a DVD documentary directed by Jonas Akerlund and originally aired on MTV and VH1 last year (what, Madonna no longer commands a big-screen release?). Both discs are riddled with songs from her woebegone 2003 album, <em>American Life</em>, which was such a profound flop that her follow-up was labeled a comeback by simple virtue of its not sucking. The generally fabulous <em>Confessions on a Dance Floor</em>, despite its flaws, worked overtime to undo the damage perpetrated upon Madonna's career by <em>American Life</em>, and it proved she could still do stellar dance music and be, you know, fun. So why remind fans of something you've worked so hard to make them forget?</p><p>
    Maybe Madonna wants the last laugh at critics who panned her most ""personal"", ""substantial"", ""topical"", ""political"", and ""ambitious"" album to date. After all, Re-Invention was one of the highest-grossing tours of 2004. That makes it successful, but it doesn't necessarily make it any good, as the live disc-- Madonna's first ever-- handily proves. The show starts with Madonna reading from scripture, specifically the Book of Revelations, in a spaced-out but serious voice. The track is called ""The Beast Within"", and it's not exactly a welcoming start to a pop show. Describing a ""beast with ten horns and seven heads,"" she intones: ""And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder/And they worshipped the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast/It opened its mouth and uttered blasphemous words against God.""</p><p>
    As if the song itself weren't enough, ""The Beast Within"" segues smoothly into... wait for it... ""Vogue"". That progression, from revelation to rump-shaking, from religious doom to secular dance, is hilarious and utterly absurd. <em>I'm Going to Tell You a Secret</em> gains almost all of its entertainment value from such kitschy extremes and bizarre juxtapositions. The full minute of gunfire and explosions that kicks off ""American Life"" is the pinnacle of the show's oblivious excess, and that song's pro-Madonna metal-rap is the album's most ridiculous moment. But then there's her cover of ""Imagine"", written by a celebrity as out of touch with real life as Madonna herself. She even prefaces it with the solemn request, ""Please listen carefully to the words of this next song. We need to make the world a better place."" 
    </p>
<p>
    No wait, I've got it: The most absurd element is the bagpipes that kick off the ""hip-hop"" portion of the show. Bagpipes! 
    </p>
<p>
<em>I'm Going to Tell You a Secret</em> is all the funnier for the seriousness with which Madonna attacks such moments, which gives the proceedings a camp quality. Not good camp, like <em>Liza with a Z</em>, but good-bad camp, like <em>The Apple</em>. The show would be better if the songs were better, obviously. She highlights too many of the bad tracks off <em>American Life</em>, but even when she does dip into her impressive back catalog, the results are less than stellar. ""Vogue"" is the same version we've been hearing for sixteen years, and despite her introduction that ""this is a no-sitting-down song"", her tepid version of ""Like a Prayer"" doesn't give us any reason to stand up. It's the final set (well, most of it anyway) that reveals what the show might have been. Not only does she have some amazing songs in her canon (""Holiday"", ""Into the Groove"", ""Music""), she possesses the talent, power, and money to make them exciting and fun. 
    </p>
<p>
    The documentary fills in some of the head-scratching moments from the album: Madonna does a simple backbend during ""The Beast Within"", pathetic in her earnest but mistaken conviction that it is both erotically suggestive and gymnastically impressive; her dancers, dressed in fatigues, buck wildly to the explosions that begin ""American Life""; and while the bagpipes play, she and her posse sport a kind of hip-hop kilt that's one of the most unsexy articles of clothing ever designed. But the film is more noteworthy for the access director Akerlund has to the ""real"" Madonna. His camera follows her to dancer auditions, to her dressing room, to her hotel room, to her romps with her children (Rocco, by the way, steals every scene he's in, hilariously deflating the pretensions of everyone around him). 
    </p>
<p>
    While her show is empty spectacle-- which would be perfectly fine if she weren't so obviously desperate to say something substantial-- her life as portrayed in this documentary is cloistered and withdrawn, marked by hours of quiet Kabbalah study but very little self-reflection. Whether intentionally or not, Akerlund reveals Madonna's supreme lack of self-awareness, from her embarrassing attempts at poetry (it'd be cruel to quote her verse here) to the condescending tone she takes with her dancers to her incredibly irresponsible visit to Rachel's Tomb despite the warnings of her host country and her security team. 
    </p>
<p>
    But the real surprise on both the album and the documentary is that Madonna doesn't seem to be enjoying herself <em>at all</em>. ""I had some fun back then,"" she remarks to Akerlund's camera, referring to her wild days as a Material Girl and <em>Sex</em> goddess, ""but you know, fun's overrated."" No, it isn't-- <em>Confessions</em> taught us that much. On <em>I'm Going to Tell You a Secret</em>, Madonna is deadly serious about ""waking people up."" The secret she's going to tell us is the secret of life, the key to world peace and personal fulfillment. She'd pompously have us believe she's got it all figured out. Worse, clouded by her unwavering sense of mission, Madonna completely misses the fact that her songs have become a shared language among people who have very little common ground. Her music has been changing the world for more than two decades now, but sadly she seems unaware of this, her one true ""secret"" to pop cultural unity.

    A funny thing happened on the way from <em>The Wedding</em>: Oneida's triumphant 2005 release was ridiculously slept-on, the band's studio space was razed to make room for condos, and rumored plans for a sprawling three-disc follow-up called <em>Thank Your Parents</em> ended up as a measly 11 tracks. Tough year. But while the band is throwing up drywall at a new recording space, <em>Happy New Year</em> reflects the mixed blessings and emotions and makes the most of them.</p><p>
    Critics love to reach for multiple hyphens and obscure garage acts to namedrop when summing up Oneida's sound. <em>Happy New Year</em> lives up to both the band's own cross-genre daring and the critics' idea of Oneida more than any of their previous albums; accordingly, it's all over the place. Opener ""Distress"", a formless sketch of medieval choir-like vocals and toneless instrumental gurgling, could be another band entirely. ""Happy New Year"" is, if there's such a thing, Oneida-by-numbers, as a midtempo distorted organ tears through the fabric of the song while guitars jangle and wail around the corners. Singer Fat Bobby's plaintive lament anchors it all, moving from psychedelic phrases to concrete urban details of cups of coffee and bus rides home, all leading to a decision not to decide anything: ""The sun withheld its light from me/ I said a prayer, a 'We shall see.'""</p><p>
    ""The Adversary"" picks up the pace, spinning upwards on its deep and steady groove like a tilt-a-whirl broken free from its hinges, with a simple but glorious three-chord release. But it lifts listeners higher just so ""Up With People"" can pull them down towards hell: With nearly eight minutes of disco drums and grinding, percussive, filthy guitar and organ, it's one of Oneida's closest calls to recreating their live sound. Predictably, it's also a monster and the highlight of the record. 
    </p>
<p>
    The pinball plink of ""History's Great Navigators"" similarly stretches and comes close to that delirious peak, and closer ""Happy New Year"" weaves druggily to the album's finale on a two-finger piano part and half-speed drums-- one of the band's most successful mood pieces. The rest of <em>Happy New Year</em>'s second half, however, is heavy with melancholy and contains some pretty safe moves for such an adventurous band. ""Busy Little Bee"" buzzes with Eastern scales and humming drones, a pleasant but obvious psychedelic nod; same with the militant rhythm and droning vocals of ""You Never Can Tell"". ""Reckoning"" is a huge surprise just for being so gentle and earnest in its acoustic soft-rock update. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Chameleon"" artists get a lot of love, but that's often because we can find the thread that holds them together-- there's always some indelible section of their personalities that binds their eclecticism and makes each track distinctively theirs. But while Oneida is indisputably versatile and has cred for miles, perpetually tearing their way through disparate styles in sweaty dives across the globe, there's no unifying principal here-- just songs that are kinda psychedelic, kinda groove-oriented, and kinda long. While not exactly a disappointment, <em>Happy New Year</em> is a whole lot of ""kinda,"" a record built around hesitancy that clutches the payoff tight in its arms.

    It seems appropriate that California folkie Nick Castro has invitingly titled his new record <em>Come Into Our House</em>, since it's clear from the opening notes that he wants his listeners to feel comfortable. For his third album, Castro has again returned to the familiar climates of 1969-75 UK folk-rock, making certain not to allow any harsh outbursts or sudden movements that could disrupt his lush, classicist stride. Unlike other such fringe folk-related acts as Charalambides or Six Organs of Admittance, Castro seems disinterested in testing his music's improvisational boundaries, yet with the help of his talented supporting cast he is still generally able to work his affectionate folk recreations into something recognizably his own.</p><p>
    On 2005's <em>Further From Grace</em>, Castro was backed by the Poison Tree, a group comprised of musicians like Josephine Foster and various members of Espers. This time the Poison Tree has made way for the Young Elders, an even-looser ensemble that features contributions from former Cul De Sac drummer Chris Guttmacher, In Gowan Ring's enigmatic vocalist B'eirth, and Current 93's Joolie Wood, among others. But despite all this assembled talent, the Young Elders lack the easy chemistry of Castro's previous group, and too often sound like an anonymous collection of studio musicians rather than a full-fledged band. This effect is accentuated by the group's freewheeling instrumentation, as the musicians cycle restlessly through such exotic sounds as Celtic harp, tenor recorder, Turkish saz, and a wide assortment of Middle Eastern percussion.</p><p>
    Much to Castro's credit, however, everything on<em> Come Into Our House</em> sounds wonderful. The beatific ""Sleeping in a Dream"" cascades out from a simple Bert Jansch-like folk song into vibrant streams of mesmeric drone and percussion, drifting gracefully into extended pan-ethnic instrumentals like the North African-tinged ""Alter"" or the spacious Morricone interlude ""Voices From the Mountain"". Co-vocalist Wendy Watson takes the lead on the album's enchanting version of Jean Ritchie's ""One I Love"", while Castro's lively piano work underscores his further debts to progressive Irish folk-rockers Mellow Candle. The lengthy ""Lay Down Your Arms"" is laced through with a requisite dose of Avalon Ballroom acid guitar, its supple electricity helping to balance out some of the Young Elders' more florid New Age/medievalist tendencies. 
    </p>
<p>
    The main drawback to Castro's reverential approach, of course, is that the vintage underground folk-rock he celebrates is currently growing less obscure by the week. Archival labels like Sunbeam, Shadoks Music, and Radioactive have filled the shelves with an endless stream of handsome reissues, making available a bounty of previously obscure psych-folk rarities. Against this suddenly crowded field, Castro's tradition-steeped work-- lovely though it is--can seem downright conventional, and his clean, nondescript vocals and slushy post-hippie lyrics begin to look like sizable limitations. Still, there's more than enough on <em>Come Into Our House</em> that should comfortably satisfy devoted fans of the genre, as well as the occasional glimmer that suggests Nick Castro might someday be ready to match his skill with a healthier measure of reckless ambition.

    Canny artists have known for years the smart recipe for their leftovers.  Take one practice-tape, passably recorded, and lose it.  Rediscover, under the bed or, for a stronger vintage, in the basement.  Then hail the long-lost achievement, suitably shrouded in its new legend-- press and release. So goes the story of the Gersch, the practice- and rehearsal-only side/secret project of Red Sparowes auteur and Isis player Clifford Meyer.  Recorded throughout the latter half of the last decade, <em>The Gersch</em> now arrives in this one, presumably because, A) Red Sparowes had a pretty good year last year, and B) <em>Gersch</em> just so happens to be the type of gradual, post-metal art-sleep that pays the bills in 2006.</p><p>
    Pitched somewhere between Neurosis and <em>Another Green World</em>, Red Sparowes debuted in 2005 with <em>At The Soundless Dawn</em>, a wordless but moderately stirring piece of amplifier mood-setting.  In the Gersch, Meyer's more present, dozing less at the wheel: His guitars are louder, the riffs quicker to come and go, and there's a vocal-- an automaton's wail, pitched high and inexpressive. On the cover, a pig lies trussed on a table; on the back, a skeleton hangs.  Sometimes Meyer's music is that dark, that black-and-white: On ""''taker"", over a druidic minor key, a whole cast of reapers chant into the wind, formal like a church service.  And on ""Taekr""-- the Celtic version, I guess-- every time one vocal enters, so do eight or nine others; they howl like ghosts in the background, while Meyer mumbles over guitars that lurch just before the vocals do.</p><p>
    Fair enough.  The Gersch are, despite their heavy metal aptitude, best when they fuck up their own genre-al exercises.  According to their publicist, a cover of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's ""Ohio"" lurks on somewhere on <em>Gersch</em>-- my guess is the wanky, over-long closer, ""Your Lips Are No Man's But Mine"", which sounds vaguely like Neil Young, so close enough. Better still, and more accidental, is ""Listwish"", a wicked though accidental take on Boston's ""Foreplay/Long Time"" with a ""Communication Breakdown"" vamp thrown in for good measure.  And both ""Face"" and ""Face Pt. 2"" sound most like 90s emo stuff like Universal Order of Armageddon or Sleepytime Trio-- slashing chords, jittery snares, and on-then-off time vocals.  These inadvertent rock moments are, I suppose, happy accidents: Meyer's material, not surprisingly for a long dead side-project, is a little thin (hence the semi-recycled songs and song titles) and best when it's off course.  Which is about every other song.

    So now that he just did an art-jazz project, it's time for
    another rock record from Elvis
    Costello, right?  Alas,
    <em>The River in Reverse</em>, a collaboration with New Orleans r&amp;b legend Allen Toussaint, is another genre dalliance intended to showcase Costello's
    supposed versatility. Well, here he throws himself headlong into Toussaint's back catalog, naturally selecting more obscure cuts (the guy did write ""Working in a Coalmine""), backed by the Imposters and augmented by Toussaint himself and NOLA horn players.</p><p>
    Yes, that's New Orleans,
    but this isn't a cash-in on recent tragedy: Costello
    has worked with the legendary Toussaint more than once before (notably on the
    piano part for <em>Spike</em>'s ""Deep Dark Truthful Mirror""). And while there is some back and forth concerning
    songwriting, it's meant to be a ""Costello
    Sings the Songs of Toussaint"" songbook record-- a voice-meets-pen LP like those in vogue before
    the rock era.</p><p>
    Costello sings every song but
    one, Toussaint's ""Who's Gonna Help a Brother Get Further"". And that's actually sort of a shame: Costello's proven
    himself effective in plenty of contexts outside of rock, but all his vibratos and
    melismas and belted notes seem like so much flailing compared to Toussaint's
    effortless croon. He has a sharp ear for choosing songs that remain relevant,
    but this is one genre that eludes him as a performer. Granted, he's never seemed entirely at home on jazz and classical records, but the pairing has never been as
    jarring as it is here, with new Costello
    songs standing directly next to the traditionals. </p><p>
    While he belabors notes on the deep cuts from Toussaint's catalog, the Costello-sung covers that frontload
    the album fall short.
    Listen to the Costello-Toussaint
    collaboration ""Ascension Day"" to hear just how nimble Costello's voice can be, alternately skipping across and gluing together the fluid notes of the piano line. And looking past its crushing
    self-awareness as an anthem for Hurricane Katrina victims, ""The River In
    Reverse"" really works. Penned entirely by Costello, when it hits the line, ""There must be something better than this/ I don't see how it can get much worse,"" the song shifts from a percussive acoustic guitar pattern to a resigned sigh from the
    horns. Meanwhile, Toussaint's slightly dissonant piano dances low in the mix, Costello cramming in syllables with his
    usual verve-- all hinting at a range of frustration and discontent bubbling
    underneath.
    </p>
<p>
    These, however, are exceptions.  Most of these tracks merely feel professional or workmanlike, sincere recordings that sadly lack inspiration.  <em>The </em><em>River in Reverse</em> could have been vastly improved with more collaboration and fewer ostentatious performances, giving the two big names on the marquee more moments to shine than to strain.

    Johnny Cash is dead, and now that
    the body is no longer with us, all that's left is the public myth: the
    larger-than-life love affair with his wife, June Carter Cash; the thundering
    voice, which will resound now only from speakers; the unshakeable moral
    authority that derived from his hard childhood, hard living, populist outlook,
    and eventually his old age; the neurodegeneration that made it impossible for him
    to play guitar on his last records; the inspiring determination to write and
    record even in his frail final days. And most of all, that black wardrobe,
    which he once told us symbolized, among so may other things, ""the poor and the
    beaten down/ Living in the hopeless hungry side of town."" Cash may be dead, but
    his ghost haunts us publicly.</p><p>
    Perhaps more
    than any other album in the Rick Rubin-produced series, Cash's final work, <em>American Recordings V: A Hundred Highways,</em>
    tries to balance the man and the myth, addressing his life and career with
    a humor and a gravity that are unmistakably human and unmistakably Cash. Despite
    the fact that all but two of its tracks are covers, these dozen songs address his marriage to
    June, his determined Christianity, and his impending death with candor and
    insight. His covers of Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind"" and Hugh
    Moffatt's ""Rose of My Heart"" tenderly sum up the Cashs' loyalty more eloquently
    than any movie ever could, and ""On the 309"", the last song he wrote, is filled with wit and vigor. Cash also cracks jokes about his legacy
    on Don Gibson's ""A Legend in My Own Time"", finding it little more than
    meaningless as he prepares to meet his Maker. ""If they gave gold statuettes for
    tears and regret,"" he sings, ""I'd be a legend in my own time.""</p><p>
    The album is also notable for what's missing. There are no
    abstractly religious songs like ""The Man Comes Around"" or ""Redemption"", nor any
    poorly chosen covers like ""Rusty Cage"" or ""The Mercy Seat"". <em>A Hundred Highways</em>
    may be the most consistent entry in the series, although perhaps not the most
    exciting or even the most enduring. But after the middling <em>Solitary Man</em> and <em>The Man
    Comes Around</em>, both of which failed to capture the vitality that made <em>American Recordings</em> and <em>Unchained</em> so engaging, <em>A Hundred Highways</em> sounds surprisingly
    good-- a final uptick in the series' downward trajectory. It's a satisfying and
    often moving final chapter to Cash's life and career, one that rejects
    self-pity and remorse in favor of hopefulness and even celebration.
    </p>
<p>
    Rubin does insert some distracting production elements, like
    the ominous marching percussion that overwhelms Cash's vocals on ""God's Gonna
    Cut You Down"", but for the most part <em>A
    Hundred Highways</em> is bare-- just Cash and an acoustic guitar-- which makes it a
    nice complement to <em>Personal File</em>, a
    collection of recordings released earlier this year. The quality of Cash's singing
    fluctuates from song to song; he sounds positively youthful on Springsteen's ""Further
    on up the Road"" and sadly ravaged on ""Four Strong Winds"". 
    </p>
<p>
    But he makes better
    use of the wrinkles in his voice here than on <em>The Man Comes Around</em>, on which the quaver lent unearned gravity to several
    tracks. On the opening prayer, ""Help Me"", he exhaustedly exhales the word ""please""
    in the chorus, letting us know what's at stake in these songs and in his life.
    Nothing else on this album-- or likely on any other release this year-- so effortlessly and
    evocatively suggests the helplessness of old age, the comfort of mortal
    resignation, or the finality of death than Cash's delivery of that simple word.

    Now that Jamie Stewart's drama, if not his songcraft, seems to be mellowing an iota-- or maybe he's just showing his sense of humor-- Xiu Xiu fans hungry for the new nervousness would do well to seek out the work of former <em>Portland Mercury</em> music editor (and Slender Means label head) Zac Pennington's Parenthetical Girls for a strong dose of panic-pop.</p><p>
    The connections are abundant: Stewart remixed the Girls' debut EP, and Pennington is backed by two members of Stewart's self-professed favorite band, tour- and labelmates the Dead Science. The album contains Xiu-ian xylophones, somber organs, wind instruments, spidery guitars, and brittle electronica, as well as lovely androgynous vocals that tiptoe right up to the shrillness of an opera staged in a psychotherapist's lobby without ever goosing it. Just as Stewart hollered ""I won't rest until I forget about it,"" memory is a burden to Pennington's speakers; see his debut's ""Here's to Forgetting"" and this album's ""Forward to Forget.""</p><p>
    Both bands are also preoccupied with reconstructing nightmarish childworlds and treating gender like so much ideological Silly Putty. (Each PG release features artwork depicting Pennington as a pair of epicene cartoons on the verge of preadolescent makeout-- the London Suede meets Strawberry Shortcake.) Xiu Xiu plays songs about abused girls and is named after the film about a teen female lost in a rape-centric state apparatus, while <em>Safe as Houses</em> is a story-album about the abandonment and penetration of young women.
    </p>
<p>
    At points, portraying all of this emotional, physical and sexual damage seems less like empathy than it... should? To qualify: the ""misogyny"" on display here is sophisticated and interesting, way different from the incidental Travis-Bickle-isms of early Smog, and not like painter Francis Bacon referring to women as cows-- it's not even like that photo/fashion-happy gay male in every town who comments on women's appearances to the point that it seems vindictive or even jealous of their allure. It's closer to how the horror of the <em>Alien</em> movies is that the creatures squirt eggs in the mouths of, and impregnate the torsos of, men.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Safe as Houses</em> is a creepily pretty presentation of female reproductive power as a kind of monstrosity: its women are protuberant, seeping, layered apertures. Pennington's falsetto cracks as he references a purgatorial ""awkward stage."" Multiple songs begin by citing leaks and stains. This is not the commiserating world of Talib Kweli's ""Black Girl Pain""; this is the world of <em>Carrie</em> and <em>The Exorcist</em>, in which girl-puberty and menstruation are accursed, as opposed to how the onset of male sexuality is usually construed to be heroic (<em>Goonies</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, et cetera). These women dread themselves, and each other. The album's most devastating couplet comes when a mother tells her daughter: ""Curls round your cheeks, Christ you look just like me/ When you took nine months to destroy my body."" That song, ""I Was the Dancer"", plays like a fierce update of the Carter Family's ""Single Girl Married Girl"", another potential duet reduced to monologue.
    </p>
<p>
    The lyrical menace is relieved somewhat by an aesthetic that Parenthetical Girls and Xiu Xiu do not share: Several songs hearken to the innocent flirty teen-pop ballads of the late 50s and early 60s, suggesting that Phils Spector and Glass should have worked together, or at least deejayed an experimental prom. Sweeping tunes ""The Weight She Fell Under"" and ""Stolen Children"" both smell like teen Fallujah, and will cure anybody's womb envy, but they passionately want to know if you'll still love them tomorrow.

    So many labels have celebrated 10-year anniversaries in the
    past few years. Between Merge, Matador, Thrill Jockey, Warp, Suicide Squeeze, and Ninja Tune,
    the early and mid-1990s were apparently a good time to start an indie. Communication was accelerating and alternative culture was happening,
    but there wasn't yet a file-sharing infrastructure in place to siphon away CD
    sales.</p><p>
    Chicago's Hefty turned 10 this year and they've released
    three comps to celebrate. Two are filled with remixes and new tracks, and this 2xCD set
    contains a one-disc best-of-the-label along with another containing a mix
    selected and sequenced by Prefuse 73's Scott Herren.</p><p>
    Hefty has always had a lot in common with Thrill
    Jockey-- maybe too much. Both are based in Chicago. Various flavors of post-rock
    are the bread and butter for each. Both release a fair amount of IDM but no
    true dance music. Both dabble in the occasional jazz release or reissue. And
    both represent the musical taste and vision of a single founder. In Hefty's
    case, that's John Hughes III, scion of the godfather of 80s teen movies and
    leader of the band Bill Ding. 
    </p>
<p>
    Listening to the ""Favorites"" disc I'm reminded of
    how much Hefty values subtlety, as their artists generally reach for an
    atmosphere of studied remove. There's nothing spazzy or chaotic or humorous
    here; instead, Hefty artists like Telefon Tel Aviv, Euphone, and Prefuse side project Savath +
    Savalas opt for a cerebral vibe that's a click or two more intense than downtempo. The
    eternal cool of the jazz performer seems to be the spiritual inspiration; two
    tracks from Detroit trombonist Phil Ranelin (his funky original ""Vibes
    from the Tribe"" and a P73 remix of ""Wife"") reinforce the idea,
    as does the relaxed swing of the electronic jazz trio Samadha, who are like the
    American version of Triosk. There's nothing particularly inspiring here-- which
    is troubling since these are supposed to be ""Favorites""-- but it's
    still solid and listenable. And Hughes himself delivers with Slicker's
    ""Frustrache"", which is as simple and wonderful as ever. 
    </p>
<p>
    The P73 mix is better. By selecting shorter bits of 21
    tracks, varying the pace, and focusing on some of the oddball material in the
    catalog (speaking relatively here), Herren makes a case for the label as an
    encouraging place for experimentation. A slice of hip-hop from recent signee
    Eliot Lipp bumps up against some vocodered rapping and then Herren's groovy
    remix of Slicker's ""Dahm Foos"". The heavenly vocals on Telefon Tel
    Aviv's ""Map of What Is Effortless"" bloom like a time-lapse film of a
    flower from the soil of Some Water and Sun's ""Ah Oh"". Hints of Phil
    Ranelin are sprinkled here and there until the full version of ""Vibes From
    the Tribe"" is finally heard, which then fades noisily into an El-P remix
    of Ranelin's ""Black Destiny"". The mix is varied and unpredictable but
    it still flows. Herren is on it. Which tells me that John Hughes III knew what
    he was doing when he got that CD-R demo from somebody calling himself Savath +
    Savalas all those years ago.

    Meneguar's debut LP, <em>I Was Born at Night</em>, was originally released on Magic Bullet Records in spring 2005. As that original pressing sold out, Troubleman Unlimited picked up the album, remixing and remastering it with a little help from Nicolas Vernhes (who has worked with Fiery Furnaces, Les Savy Fav, and Animal Collective among others). The album features seven tracks of sharp, jangly guitars and sing-along choruses-- songs that are reminiscent of mid-1990s indie rock, as if its dirtier, noisier, younger self grew up, took a shower, and got its shit together.</p><p>
    When things sync up, the songs are great. ""Kids Get Cut"" is overflowing with post-punk energy, with harmonizing guitar leads near its close, solidifying its awesomeness. ""Hands Off"" features another anthemic moment, when the music falls away and the band chants in unison. There are many of these grin-inducing, fist-pumping instances, and they bridge what is at heart a very straightforward, catchy, guitar-driven record.</p><p>
    Choruses are definitely the band's strength-- pretty much every song features some sort of rallying cry after each verse. During those verses, however, vocalist Jarvis Taveniere wavers between being full of vigor and being completely disinterested. On ""A Few Minutes an Hour"", he's talking as much as singing, seemingly bored throughout the first verse. This sort of vocal nonchalance is part of his style, but thankfully it's drowned out by his stronger moments. 
    </p>
<p>
    There is a much bigger problem undercutting the entire disc, though: Containing only seven songs, the album isn't even 25 minutes long. You barely have time to settle in to the groove before it's wrapping up. It feels more like the appetizer before the main course, and maybe that's what Troubleman Unlimited has in mind. The band is apparently already working on a follow up, and if <em>I Was Born at Night</em> is meant to pique my interest, then consider it a success. It's a promising debut, and hopefully the band will deliver on that promise on future releases.

    A quick introduction: Towers of London are a 1980s hair-metal throwback popular in the pages of the NME for their public persona: They dress like assholes, talk reams of shit, and are intolerably obnoxious. If the Darkness copped from Mötley Crüe instead of Queen, had no ability to write or perform music, and released singles that were less ""More Than a Feeling"" than ""Your Mother's Got a Penis"", you'd have Towers of London: sub-Ali G character sketches not quite interesting enough to warrant a TV show.</p><p>
    And they haven't even got the genre right: Somehow, their pure-camp Poison cribbing emits an ethos more aligned with post-punk. For all their balls-out bacchanalia and Johnny Rotten attitude, the only characteristics they exhibit are possibly a repressed paranoia that nearly every band is better and more interesting than them, and a coping mechanism that decides they need to ""break shit"" to compensate (unless I'm missing some delicate hidden layers in songs like ""Fuck It Up"").</p><p>
    Freudian diagnostics aside, these clowns basically Anglicize Andrew W.K. Tipping their hats to Axl Rose, Rotten, and every asshole band who ever put their hometown in their bandname, this carefully hairsprayed foursome (whose mantra is ""drink, fight, fuck"") flips a self-assured bird. Aww, but no one's looking! 
    </p>
<p>
    Blame W.K. for already perfecting partying hard, or the Darkness setting the metal revival bar a tad high, but Towers' arena assault on mainstream pop and sweater-clad indie falls flat on its face, seeming way more contrived than the targets it aims to abominate. Lead singer Donny Tourette, for example, is actually very unlike someone truly afflicted by Tourette's-- we always know <em>exactly</em> what he's about to say. Even the exclamatory ""yeah's"" and ""ooh's"" feel labored over, intricately placed between masturbatory solos and dim power chords. In fact, the only mystery here at any given time is whether he'll shout ""fuck you, bitch,"" or opt for the simple elegance of the traditional ""fuck you."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Nothing reeks like punk-metal gone sour. Massive tom builds and searing solos just don't work when seguing into mind-numbing three-chord rants. Worse, these guys are gruellingly self-referential while they're at it, reminding us they're jerks (""I'm a Rat"", ""King""), trying to make their axes sound threatening on ""Kill the Popscene"" rather than actually slaying it, playing guitars on ""Air Guitar"". If you're seeking a legitimate metal revival, I think it goes without saying there are better places to start.

    Often when we say a record has ""atmosphere,"" we mean it as a
    put-down. From <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> to the present, a record's sonic
    appeal-- the effects, the mood, the spaces between the notes-- is inextricable
    from how it hits us. But when an artist pushes atmosphere in place of songs, it's frequently thought of as a crutch. Most listeners don't trust a
    mood to grab their hearts the way they trust, say, a human voice; nobody counts on
    production to deliver the ""money note.""</p><p>
    When I try to explain TV on the Radio to people who aren't into them, the
    first thing on the checklist is singer Tunde Adebimpe, a stoic romantic who
    falters but never whimpers. He's got about the best set of pipes in indie rock,
    yet on <em>Return to Cookie Mountain</em> his greatest strength lies in how well
    he stands back and blends in-- with the throatier Kyp Malone, guest singers
    including David Bowie, and, especially, with the atmosphere evoked by producer
    and noisemaker David Sitek. As the two founding members, Adebimpe and Sitek fit
    together like Jagger and Richards. But where the two Rolling Stones projected
    snarling sex, these guys express... what?</p><p>
    In the original version of <em>Return to Cookie Mountain </em>that leaked this
    spring-- the one that kicked off at full throttle with ""Wolf Like
    Me""-- they sounded like victory. With that cut up front, you knew this was
    the great leap forward for which their last two records paved the way-- and
    when I say three records, I'm counting their scattershot sketchbook <em>OK
    Calculator</em>, which caught the band at its most ""Hey, what can I do with
    this four-track?"" They always claim they'd rather keep messing around with
    new ideas than settle down and crank out the hits that are at their fingertips,
    which is one reason 2004's <em>Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes </em>felt more
    eclectic than excellent. (In retrospect, the other reason is that they were
    still using drum machines.) But this time, maybe they'd changed their minds. 
    </p>
<p>
    But before <em>Return to Cookie Mountain</em> became their major label debut, its tracklist was reshuffled. Now it leads off with the fascinating ""I Was a
    Lover"", a sympathy card that carries the most emotional sample on the
    record-- a bellow like the sound of a sad elephant, which fits right in with
    the defeated verse. It takes skill to craft a tone that people can feel
    sorry for; maybe there <em>is</em> a money note locked in that pedal
    crouching under Sitek's shoe. But other times, the noise evokes an orchestra,
    or a rockslide. Abstract and electronic textures roll over acoustic sources--
    bowed upright bass, sitars, flutes, backward wind chimes-- to reach a perfect consistency, all the way through to the closer,
    ""Wash the Day Away"", where white noise rises and swallows them all.
    But not a moment too soon: not only is the mix stellar (if a little too biased
    away from the vocals), but once you get used to the new setlist, the pacing is
    perfect as well. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band cycles up like a centrifuge. Vocals spin
    on ""Dirty Whirl"" like wooden figurines on a Swiss cuckoo clock, while
    a shimmering piano figure chimes across ""Province"". Like their first
    albums, the songs build on loops, grooves, and drones. They feel familiar,
    but they've never sounded this good-- or this thick. Even the voices cascade on
    top of each other, which obscures much of the lyrics. Nothing can cut through
    except the sharp and vigorous rhythm section. Check out the way the air catches
    in Adebimpe's throat on ""A Method"", then shakes loose when Jaleel
    Bunton bursts in like a drum corps waiting in the parking lot for the parade to
    start. 
    </p>
<p>
    But what's their message? They're not here to rock-- they use too many
    loops, too much repetition, and too little chaos. They can do the
    community-drum-circle thing, but they're too slick to try it more than once (""Let the Devil In""). And even Adebimpe's voice has never sunk
    this far into the music; we don't even get an a capella<em> </em>feature this
    time, because this isn't an album about standing out. He's still a failed
    romantic, a social conscience, a charmer, and a distant voyeur; but with every
    album he becomes less of a ""persona"" and more of a regular person. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe that's why this album has such an incredible pull: It doesn't make an atmosphere so much as a space to spend time in, and Adebimpe doesn't become a narrator so much as a
    witness. We sidle up into his head and watch through his eyes the tyrants, the
    druggies, the cocky lovers, the losers, and those beautiful fools who still
    surrender to lines like ""Love is the province of the brave."" And TV
    on the Radio are standing in the center, watching it all go by again, and
    again, and again.

    Muse epitomize pompous stadium rock in a technology-numbed, post-Radiohead
    era. Their tracks come loaded up with burbling synth arpeggios and other
    ""futuristic"" effects intended to announce the band's modernity. But
    the music is firmly ol' skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint.
    What Muse lack in chophouse showmanship on the prog side of the equation they attempt to make up for in volume--
    their songs use full-stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke god's
    footsteps. It's the kind of deep-fried, flash-frozen crud that can be
    ridiculously fun to listen to.</p><p>
<em>Black Holes and Revelations </em>is the band's<em> </em>fourth album<em>, </em>and if you thought
    by now they'd be getting tired of purveying the same old closet-geek space jams (or at
    least of critics accusing them of pillaging Radiohead), you'd be wrong: This<em> </em>is the band's most autopiloted effort yet, a hacked-up last-gen
    rehash of said space jams, only now with greater emphasis on glitz and glam.
    Somehow Muse, always loveably lame, have managed to
    take a turn for the lamer.</p><p>
    I've heard a number of people refer to Muse as The Best Live Band in the
    World-- even a few who aren't British (just Anglophiles). I've also never seen Muse
    live, but after hearing opener ""Take a Bow"", I wouldn't discount the
    claim: It's the kind of song that could level an arena. But on the stereo,
    lacking the colossal volume of amp towers, the song fizzles. 
    </p>
<p>
    A celestial arpeggio opens the track ""Baba O'Riley"" style,
    while singer Matthew Bellamy yawns something indecipherable in his best and
    brittlest Yorke yowl. When, after a few false starts and nearly three minutes, the
    curtain finally lifts, there isn't much to see-- just an ominous two-note
    bassline and flares of upper register guitar occasionally harmonizing with
    Bellamy's wallpapery vocal. Drummer Dominic Howard fills the wide gaps between
    guitar chords and plodding downbeats with flailing triplet rolls, the
    still-going arpeggio snapping everything neatly to grid. But damned if Muse
    aren't going to cause an earthquake with every downstroke.</p><p>
    ""Map of the Problematiqué"" is the chest-thumping espionage movie
    chase-scene cut that beverage mogul and <a href=""http://www.gawker.com/news/moby/the-treats-at-mobys-hot-tub-party-169156.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dope-ass
    party thrower</a> Moby tried to make with his <em>Bourne Identity</em> theme song
    ""Extreme Ways"". It's the album's eurotrashiest and best song.
    ""Invincible"", while beatific, rips Jeff Buckley's
    version of ""Hallelujah"", Bellamy mimicking that song's cadence pretty much turn
    for turn. Not even a lasershot Kravitzesque guitar solo can mask it. The album
    really starts to flag around ""Exo-Politics"", which figures it doesn't
    need a hook because it asks a tough question: ""When the Zetas fill the
    skies,"" Bellamy wonders aloud over Sabbathian guitar plod, ""will our
    leaders tell us why?"" </p><p>
    If the album opens with its best camp, perhaps it's no mistake that it ends
    with its worst. ""Knights of Cydonia"" begs to be taken off on a
    stretcher and sprayed down with liquid novocaine like a histrionic Italian
    midfielder. The song opens with stampeding stallions and laser blips before moving into a galloping 6/8 drumbeat slathered in mariachi trumpets.
    Bellamy buttresses his reedy falsetto with some crafty ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" double-tracking, belting, ""No one's gonna take
    me alive."" The climax? A nauseating barrel-rolling guitar solo, possibly ripped from
    the soundtrack to a bad teen movie involving a stolen jet fighter.
    </p>
    What's most difficult of all to look past is that <em>Black Holes</em> was
    created in all earnestness by three dudes in Hot Topic shirts advancing a
    vision of rock music that operates on three fundamental assumptions: 1)
    distortion is always better than no distortion; 2) every measure of music
    should contain at least one drum fill; and 3) the future will be dominated by
    robots. Muse leave no room for compromise on these points. So for peace of
    mind, call them retro, because they can't reasonably consider such a vision
    inventive or resonant in 2K6. Can they?</div>"|9168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9168-black-holes-and-revelations/|4.2|Sam Ubl

    If Baltimore indie bluesman Guy Blakeslee previously got his blues direct from the source, then on <em>Prayer of Death</em>, his third full-length as Entrance, he orders through a middleman-- namely, 60s psychedelia. Here, he electrifies his blues riffs with strong doses of Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones, which strengthens instead of dilutes them. By emphasizing this aspect of his music, Blakeslee is essentially trading his white blues jones-- which at best was a hard sell, at worst insufferable-- for a new set of pretensions, and whether he's taking a short detour or cutting a new trail for himself remains to be seen.</p><p>
    However, as a psychedelic shaman bringing us news from other planes of existence (dig that album cover), he sounds much more persuasive, and his tweaked aspirations keep the mix of blues and rock on <em>Prayer of Death</em> from sounding slick, calculated, or Eric Clapton. In fact, the tangles of guitar noise on these eight songs give Blakeslee more opportunities to emphasize his vocals. He peppers ""Pretty Baby"" and the eight-minute epic ""Lost in the Dark"" with feral grunts that are part mortal cough, part rock'n'roll yell, and his unhinged howl rises above the electrified din even as it becomes part of it.</p><p>
    It helps that Blakeslee has assembled an adventurous group of collaborators to back him up. Creating a maelstrom from which he can wail feverishly, the band-- which includes A Perfect Circle's Paz Lenchantin, filmmaker Maximilla Lukacs, and Derek James-- isn't just loud, it's intense. Lenchantin's string arrangements add unbearable tension to ""Silence on a Crowded Train"" and ""Pretty Baby"", and his downlow bass licks provide a densely melodic bottom end over which the guitars can twist and swirl and drone frantically. In this setting, even the lone acoustic blues number, ""Prayer of Death"", sounds better, more directed and controlled, a break from the bands' doomy force. 
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps most importantly, Entrance's combination of blues riffs and psychedelic drone reinforces the fears of mortality and annihilation that course through the lyrics and thread the songs into a powerful statement about deathly dread. ""Your head's in the grave"", he wails on ""Pretty Baby"", ""but you still don't know why."" Reportedly inspired by ""the daily death-vibrations of the Modern World"", <em>Prayer of Death</em> kicks off with the amped-up ""Grim Reaper Blues"", which rides a muddy blues riff and an effective call-and-response between singer and band, followed by ""Silence on a Crowded Train"", its paranoia offset by its immense, edge-of-the-precipice sound. And ""Requiem for Sandy Bull (R.I.P.)"" is noteworthy less for its sitar drone tribute to the late musician than for the fact that it's a memorial. For Blakeslee, death is the ultimate psychedelic, erasing the mind completely instead of expanding it-- and by the closing track, Blakeslee has made some sort of peace with the idea, which makes the album sound like a journey instead of a tract. His final words are ""When you think about death every morning, don't you ever be afraid!"" If only it were that easy.

    By the time David Dickenson founded Seattle-based Suicide Squeeze Records in 1996, grunge's imperial reign had ended. But the bands that sprang up in its wake still bore its most latent characteristics, however mutated. 764-HERO's ""Now You're Swimming"", the label's first release, made a perfect example: It featured less fuzzbox-stomping than most grunge singles, but the quiet verse/loud chorus dynamic remained intact. There was also a similar sense of fury and futility, though the emoting was limited to more personal, if not outright confessional, territory.</p><p>
    Ten years after that 7"" single, the label has cultivated a diverse roster of acts that might not have much in common musically, but all preserve a ""punk rock soul."" It's clear that when Suicide Squeeze uses a term like ""punk,"" it means it in the same way Kurt Cobain did: as an ethos of honesty and authenticity, not a unifying sonic aesthetic. But while the label's releases have always embodied that sensibility, the music on the commemorative 2xCD <em>Suicide Squeeze Records: Slaying Since 1996</em> somehow fails to pack much punch.</p><p>
    The collection's first disc charts a chronology of the label's releases, beginning with that first 764-HERO single and ending with ""Rock Weird (Weird Rock)"", a throwaway addition from last year's puzzling Goon Moon collaboration. Peppered with out-of-print material and weighed down by some weak inclusions, these 20 selections still boast some predictable winners. The fragmentary ""A Life of Arctic Sounds"" is hardly one of Modest Mouse's best songs, but it reminds just how amazingly visceral and rabid the band was in its early days. Elliott Smith's ""Division Day"" from 1997 sounds incredibly quaint in comparison to the lush arrangements of his later output, but the skin-and-bones production lets the strength of such a sing-song melody speak for itself. And ""2014"", from the Unicorns' swansong single, is one of the band's quirkiest compositions (which is saying a whole lot), moving from apocalyptic synth-pop to flat-out rocker in less than four minutes.
    </p>
<p>
    The second disc of <em>Slaying Since 1996</em> is appropriately devoted to the present. With previously unreleased tracks from the likes of Earlimart, Headphones, and Crystal Skulls, it's more consistent than the first disc. Of Montreal's ""Voltaic Crusher/Undrum to the Muted Da"", which finds Kevin Barnes pleading ""Please, please, please, God don't be a bastard,"" is typical of the band's oeuvre of bubbly non-sensical pop. But ""Voices"", a B-side taken from a recent Black Mountain seven-inch, is the second disc's highpoint. In yet another of Stephen McBean's paeans to the redemptive capacity of rock music, Black Mountain blend Velvets-y guitar, a leaden bassline, and Mellotron to create something far lighter and breezier than anything on last year's self-titled debut.
    </p>
<p>
    While <em>Slaying Since 1996</em> obviously succeeds in practical terms (yes, it provides an overview of the first 10 years of Suicide Squeeze's output), it suffers from inconsistency. It's the inescapable curse of any compilation: You can't please everyone all the time. But, in spite of that understandable shortcoming, there are several gems-- many out-of-print or previously unreleased-- to be mined here.

The husband/wife duo of Brett and Rennie Sparks have always sought to wrest as much mystery and romance as possible from their seemingly mundane modern surroundings, crafting an impressive, finely attuned catalog of urban ghost stories, death ballads, and fatalistic country narratives.</p><p>
    Steeped in Appalachian folk tradition, the Handsome Family's songs are forever shadowed by nature's hidden uncontrollable forces. Perhaps it's this deep-seated sense of impending doom that has lately discouraged the duo from making any far-reaching updates to their musical attack. <em>Last Days of Wonder</em> is the Handsome Family's first album since 2003's <em>Singing Bones</em>, and like the rest of their work its success depends entirely upon two assets: Rennie's keenly observed, fantasist lyrics and Brett's rich, oaken baritone. With a formula the duo settled upon somewhere around 1998's <em>Through the Trees</em>, Brett supplies nearly all of the music as well, digitally recording layers of guitar, banjo, autoharp, and electronic percussion. But while <em>Last Days of Wonder</em> does contain some typically absorbing performances, one can't help but feel that they've begun to repeat themselves, sounding at times like some talkative old-timer who can't always recall which of his crazy stories he's already told.</p><p>
    On earlier albums <em>Through the Trees</em> or 1996's <em>Milk and Scissors</em>, Rennie's lyrics revealed an exacting detail that helped to illuminate the duo's physical and personal geography. Songs like ""Lake Geneva"" and ""The Woman Downstairs"" were not only richly evocative of the duo's then-homebase Chicago, but also featured a fervent, diary-like intimacy that packed a powerful emotional wallop. Since that time the Sparks have relocated to Albuquerque, and subsequent albums have seen a gradual reduction in their lyrics' descriptive detail. Nearly all of the action on <em>Last Days of Wonder</em> takes place within the stale anonymity of airports, hotels, and interstates. Perhaps this is intended as a comment on the sterility of our soulless modern environments, but these impersonal settings lend the album an air of emotional detachment that makes it difficult to embrace. Likewise, songs like ""Beautiful William""-- in which a man inexplicably vanishes one day, leaving behind his beautiful home and perfect lawn-- are populated only by the sort of vague, unsubstantiated characters one might expect to find in any generic urban legend. </p><p>
    One trait that all Handsome Family albums share, however, is that they each contain two or three centerpiece songs that seem to have received special attention. One such example on <em>Last Days of Wonder</em> is ""Tesla's Hotel Room"", a brilliant track that lovingly depicts the enigmatic inventor Nikola Tesla nursing sick pigeons, dividing his time equally between science and spirituality. ""After We Shot the Grizzly"" matches Rennie's deadpan survival tale (""We shot and ate the horses... I found a human skull"") to a swanky Chet Atkins-style countrypolitan groove, while the pro-environment ""Our Blue Sky"" deftly skewers the Christian Right (""Would you love God if he didn't love you/ More than rivers, snakes or wind?"") over a sunny California jangle. </p><p>
    Rennie takes the lead on the lush, cello-driven ""Hunter Green"", delivering what is by far her most appealing vocal on record. Yet too often on <em>Last Days of Wonder</em> the Handsome Family settle readily into their standard roles and midtempo, clip-clop rhythms. Consequently tracks like ""Flapping Your Broken Wings"" or ""Bowling Alley Bar"" can feel rote, sounding like less-inspired versions of the duo's earlier material. On the amusing finale ""Somewhere Else to Be,"" Brett relays a wry tale of love lost due to a moment's inattention at drive-thru window, closing out an uneven album that unfortunately contains several such missed opportunities.</p></div>"|9135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9135-last-days-of-wonder/|6.7|Matthew Murphy

    United States of America, 1954: Senator Joseph McCarthy kicks off congressional hearings to determine whether or not the United States Army has been too lenient on Communists. North Vietnam cedes control to the Viet Mihn. The American government plops hydrogen bombs into the Pacific Ocean. Memphis' WDIA, the first American radio station programmed exclusively by and for African-Americans, plumps its signal up to a spectacular 50,000 watts, now accessible from southern Missouri all the way to the Gulf Coast-- reaching nearly 10% of the country's African-American population. Meanwhile, also in Memphis, a 19-year-old Elvis Presley worms his way into Sam Phillips' Sun Studios, recording his first Sun single, a cover of Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup's ""That's All Right, Mama"", inadvertently shifting the course of American music.</p><p>
    Two years earlier, Bill Haley released ""Rock the Joint""-- arguably the first rockabilly song. It wasn't until 1955 that ""Go Cat Go"" brainchild Bill Flagg spit out the word ""rockabilly"" to describe the gorgeously brash, hedonistic strain of youth music suddenly squirting out of radios everywhere. But rockabilly was really born in 1954, when Presley first eschewed white vocal tradition, inhaled, and caterwauled, deep and wild, into Sam Phillips' big silver microphone, agitating teenagers all over the world.  Presley eventually exploded, as did rock'n'roll, but in its wake, rockabilly-- rock's shifty-eyed, less commercial, more violent stepbrother-- kept on reacting to the tyranny of McCarthyism, the oppression of suburbia, the bite of racism, the threat of the big bomb.</p><p>
    Like any hybrid genre, rockabilly is groaningly tough to define without using broad and bulky terms, and its weird, disparate influences-- bluegrass, cowboys, pomade, Eisenhower, Levi's 501s, Betty Crocker, Delta blues, Hank Williams, R&amp;B, country music, white t-shirts, Texas, creeper shoes-- are as varied, serendipitous, and appalling as the songs themselves.  Given the now-clichéd repression of the classic nuclear 1950s household (think Donna Reed with one hand on an iron, pressing her husband's slacks, her other arm curled around a wooden spoon, churning up cake batter), the notion of affluent white teenagers rebelling-- hiding banned 45s under their canopied beds, moaning along to John and Jackie's orgasm-riddled ""Little Girl"", wiggling into black leather jackets, and unapologetically worshipping the most famed phallus of them all, the electric guitar-- seems both inevitable and revolutionary. Parents were horrified (their rage fueled, in many cases, by thinly veiled racism-- even though almost all rockabilly artists were white) by the sexually explicit and standard-balking songs their kids were suddenly making out to, incensed by their sneers and outfits, cigarettes and switchblades.</p><p>
    Each of <em>Rockin' Bones</em>' four discs celebrates and skewers the hilarious, red-faced anger of hollering parents, functioning as much as a testament to intense teenage defiance as to rockabilly's twang-filled, echo-heavy, vaguely-unhinged sound. Featuring 101 tracks recorded between 1954 and 1969 (35 of which are available here for the first time on CD), and interspersed with audio clips from the teen-exploitation movies of the era, <em>Rockin' Bones</em>, despite a few curious omissions (including, of all people, Bill Haley), is a gloriously comprehensive set, nodding to both the obvious Sun staples (Jerry Lee Lewis' ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"", Carl Perkins' ""Blue Suede Shoes"", Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two's ""Get Rhythm"") and plenty of more obscure tracks, many performed by people with names like ""Johnny Dollar"".  Packaged inside a faux-hardcover book (pulp fiction, naturally), <em>Rockin' Bones</em> offers loads of bonus reading, including song-by-song commentary from Colin Hawkins, author of the definitive guide to the Sun Records dynasty, <em>Good Rockin' Tonight</em>.</p><p>
    Rockabilly's finest sing like they're sneering, barely capable of squeezing the words out over bouncing, sinister, propulsive guitar. The incomparable Link Wray-- the North Carolina-born guitar hero ostensibly responsible for power chords, fuzz tone, and distortion-- appears with ""Rumble"", his immortal instrumental featuring what plenty (including Hawkins) have called the most groundbreaking D chord in history.  Buddy Holly pops up twice (solo on ""Rockin' Around with Ollie Vee"" and accompanied by high school buddy Bob Montgomery on ""Down the Line""). Jackie DeShannon roars through the Lieber and Stoller-penned ""Trouble"", transforming a relatively staid country song into something spectacularly sexy, all throat-rumbles and sharp shoulder twitches. Ronnie Hawkins, whose backing band, the Hawks, later became the Band (check the mind-blowing guitar solos here), growls Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"", his voice just creepy and predatory enough to make anyone get up and check their window locks. </p><p>
    Rockabilly had faded by the mid-1960s (plenty suggest it went down, in 1959, with Buddy Holly's plane), but its aesthetic is periodically revived, with varying degrees of success (see <em>Swingers</em>, Brian Setzer, and Quentin Tarantino soundtracks). Meanwhile, historians and critics are still squabbling over what, exactly, rockabilly signifies in the larger socio-political context of the 1950s, and to what extent its players were just snatching and re-appropriating black performance styles, or, maybe, recreating what they saw in Pentecostal church pews. Regardless, rockabilly endures as one of America's purest homegrown sounds, bolstered, as all good things are, by cascading hormones, a healthy dose of teen-insurgency, and just a little bit of terror. <br/>

    ""Everyone's a killer, drug dealer with a nine milla-- that's
    not sensible."" So says UK
    hip-hop upstart Sway on his debut album, <em>This Is My Demo</em>. By
    acknowledging reality and sounding pragmatic, the statement automatically puts Sway in the
    ""thinking"" lane. And like myriad backpacker drones before him, he could
    easily follow it up with the suggestion of an alternate path (that possibly
    involves veganism), or at least list a bunch of the same reasons why such common
    rap tropes are indeed ""not sensible."" Thankfully, he does neither. Instead,
    one of Britain's
    finest rhymers flashes a sense of hilarity and wit most ""sensible""
    rappers can merely allude to: ""And I can sense the bull/ That's why these
    rappers couldn't see me coming if they were vaginas with spectacles.""</p><p>
    As old-school Tribe fans drool in anticipation of Lupe
    Fiasco's official record and New York loyalists blast Papoose out of their Hondas and mix huts like he's the
    second coming of Biggie, Sway isn't even getting any Dizzee (or, for that
    matter, Kano) shine in the U.S. Though disappointing, it's not surprising-- as Sasha
    Frere-Jones recently wrote in <em>The New Yorker</em>, commenting on
    the U.S. vs. UK
    divide: ""If your songs are cynical, ironic, or misanthropic, and loaded
    with references to Tesco...Americans may simply turn the dial."" Sway's songs aren't straightforward in the simple sense and <em>This Is My Demo</em>
    punctures the gangstar image of rappers elevated by their own
    immoralities, but it accomplishes this with self-effacing cunning
    and dynamic technical dexterity. He may not be the answer to every rap fan
    disillusioned with the omnipotence of shameless hip-hop stigmata like Rick
    Ross, but he's a more than viable Okayplayer-friendly alternative who's spearheading indie
    originality in 2006.  <br/></p><p>
    With grime already being pushed to its logical sonic end,
    more UK artists like Sway-- who produced half of this LP-- are recalibrating
    their sound while warming up to various American styles. Tracks like
    ""Flo Fashion"" and ""Download"" get glitched with grime's nihilistic
    hyper-Sega blasts, but elsewhere, <em>Demo</em>'s production varies from
    the r&amp;b-tinged schmooveness of ""Little Derek"" to the Jazze Pha-style
    light-bounce of ""Sick World"" to vintage Kanye on ""Month in the
    Summer"". Such diversity goes lengths to ensure the album's listenability,
    and Sway matches the array with myriad flows, sincere autobiographical subject
    matter, and biting metaphor might.
    </p>
<p>
    As an MC, the 23-year-old British-born,
    Ghana-bred Derek Safo is probably too smart and honest for mass popularity yet still
    brilliant within his own knowing circle. When he says, ""Cause when you do UK
    rap, you're No. 2/ Cause the USA
    ain't givin' us space to break through,"" he's not necessarily bitter, just
    stating the facts. Sway's relatable ambiguities and self-doubt shade <em>Demo</em> with
    subtle depth. As on ""Download""-- probably the best, most entertaining song
    yet to grapple with an artist's internal struggle with illegal file-sharing-- he
    vents his frustrations before eventually acknowledging the lure of infinite
    spins. When he admits, ""I download too/ I'm a big hypocrite/ I'll download
    you/ But I don't want you to download me because I work very hard and a
    download's free,"" the sentiment may not push you to fork over import
    prices, but it's highly admirable. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though he's mostly dealing with worn-in-the-dirt hip-hop themes like personal prowess, industry bullshit, and a troubled upbringing, there's always a clear-headed twist. ""Loose Woose"", is the one about the promiscuous girl but it's hardly mean-spirited as it focuses on her
    conquests' stupidity. And while ""Flo Fashion"" is about an MC who
    buys all the gadgets, rims, and duds quick-fix advance checks can afford, it's a satirical
    role-play. He's ambitious in his influences, too; instead of lamely
    piggybacking Jay-Z,
    there's an impressive Eminem strain found in his musings like on the
    funk farce ""Sick World"", which finds him name dropping and goofing on
    his adolescence: ""My teeth wasn't exactly straight/ Know what I mean, guv?/ Like, me and the dentist wasn't exactly mates."" 
    </p>
<p>
    There are minor moments when <em>Demo</em>'s slight r&amp;b hooks
    miss and when Sway deviates too far from his good-natured strengths, but the
    lion's share is ace-- thoughtful but not pedantic, funny but not
    stupid, sincere but not treacly, realistic but not boring. In a critical
    paradise, the album would be huge on both sides of the Atlantic. Of course, it won't be. But, predictably, Sway even has a sly plan B with regards to Stateside failure, ""If I flop I'll come
    back in a disguise, tie a British flag over my face and no one will know it's
    me.""

<em>You Can't Break the Strings in Our Olympic Hearts</em> is the quixotic title to the Diableros' debut full-length, and at first glance it probably looks like a steaming mound of nonsense. I say ""probably"" because I forget exactly how I felt approaching this Toronto sextet, but skepticism definitely factored in.</p><p>
    The Diableros aren't a band you crack, at least not in a ""what's the password to this wireless network?"" way; but they do take some warming up to. First time I heard Pete Carmichael deliver ""Through the Foam""'s ultrabanal lyrics in his trembling, jaundiced voice, it was off-putting, obnoxious, not at all endearing. He seemed to be pleading the ages old neuroses-as-character defense to compensate for his lack of conventional vocal ability. Behind him, guitars running the gamut from thin and icy to fat and molten slug changes so unhurried and deliberate even Interpol could handle them. The drummer's happy enough to bash eighth notes into his new ride cymbal. Simple? Painfully so. Yet it adds up to a sound that's lush and inviting and rackety; like the best and strangest indie bands, the Diableros give the sense that they mean more than they play. And Carmichael's disheveled random firings thrive off the cooler-headed indie rock the band puts behind him.</p><p>
    Ryan Dombal described this band as a low-budget Interpol. Sonically, he observes correctly. The Diableros favor simple figures and big sounds: tidal waves of slow-strummed guitars, fat unflinching snare backbeats, and huge held-out organ drones. But humorless Interpol will never craft anything this tenacious. </p><p>
    If emotional eclecticism isn't your bag, steer clear. ""Sugar Laced Soul"" plows through more moods in three minutes than <em>Antics</em> did in 45. Carmichael is capable of delivering long streams of purple-faced bluster, but he almost whispers this one's precious opening salvo: ""Don't you know why people love one another?/ It's so they can feel their hearts beat together."" Then surging drums turn the song from smarting ballad to heart-loose anthem. Fast-picked, over-reverbed guitars and hugely swelling organs give the song a surf-rock energy, but Carmichael eventually ratchets back down to a teary croak. Two tracks later, ""Olympic Island"" starts up in like fashion, curtains of formless guitar jangle creating a washed-out ambience, but this song is more hedged. The intro plays ready-set-banana, building steam before recoiling into a drumless, two-note organ dirge. The dam only holds for a wink; ultimately more surging drums are needed to buttress the album's mantric lyric: ""You can't break the strings in our Olympic hearts."" </p><p>
    Carmichael's lyrics tend to pop out at you in spurts, when he gets uppity or when the Farfisa stops droning. On ""Push It to Monday"", we hear just enough to understand why the titular rescheduling. As the song filters into a short, ascending pre-chorus, panic sets on: ""My car won't start I don't know what to do,"" he sings, sounding as if a neck vein isn't the worst thing he's set to lose. </p><p>
    Plenty of bands do the hysterical singer/banal subjects thing these days, most of them Canadian; but none push the contrast farther than the Diableros. Carmichael plays the part of the withering, artfully disheveled, colossally fucked-up vocalist as popularized by Win Bulter (Arcade Fire), Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown), Alec Ounsworth (CYHSY), Hamilton Leithauser (Walkmen), and Paul Banks (Interpol). But he's less technically adroit than any of those bands' lead men-- less cool, too. Even Krug, crazed but always on his game, is just put-together enough to impress not distress us. Listening to Pete Carmichael sing, meanwhile, is profoundly uncomfortable. You feel embarrassed hearing him fidget and freak out at nothing, mainly because we all fidget and freak out at nothing sometimes-- some of us all the time. But even in an age of big-drama, high-romance, unabashed-to-be-abashed vocalists, indie rock rarely admits to that. The Diableros don't retreat from their flaws, they make them sing, and by doing so teach us to embrace ours.

    Micah P. Hinson’s <em>The Baby and the Satellite</em> is slathered with quote unquote <em>authenticity</em>, sounding like it sort of accidentally wandered into a studio with all of its possessions tied up in a handkerchief on a stick. (To drive the point home, many songs here are bracketed by field recordings of appropriately mundane and melancholic sounds-- hissing buses, ambient street chatter, crying babies.) The young Texas-based singer’s gloomy desert-country stays pragmatically simple enough to pluck out on the back of a trotting burro, and his voice has that creased and cracked, sun-baked quality that makes you imagine he plays a mean harmonica (thankfully, he refrains).</p><p>
    This verisimilitude is often chalked up to Hinson’s checkered, archetypal life story-- reared by wild-eyed snake handlers in the deep South; escaped into the arms of a noir vixen in the even deeper South; freebased rat-poison; did a stint in the bing; recorded on a busted reel-to-reel in an outhouse; whatever. The point is that Hinson’s just about one messy divorce short of an outlaw-country-cred royal flush. But in this day of James Freys, JT Leroys, and other assorted hyperauthors, who’s to say? For all we know, Hinson recorded <em>The Baby and the Satellite</em> in between shifts at the Dippin’ Dots stand in the waterpark on his summer break from UT. But even if this were true, it wouldn’t change the profound sorrow embedded in this album one iota. So it does us no good to dwell on derivation. Nor does it behoove us to focus on the plaintive lyrics, which, detailing the typical manifestations of despair and heartbreak, range from serviceably striking to harmlessly trite. What makes Hinson worthwhile is his knack for couching sumptuous melodies in stately, staid arrangements, and how his music tends to be solemn and catchy at once.</p><p>
    These songs predate Hinson’s 2005 debut, <em>The Gospel of Progress</em>; they’re re-recorded versions of his 2001 demo. That entire half-hour demo is included on <em>The Baby and the Satellite</em>'s final track, and while it’s nice to hear the songs in their embryonic stage, the eight studio knock-ups are the keepers. The album starts strong with “The Dreams You Left Behind” (and ends strong-- a starker version of “Dreams” closes the album, bending the song cycle into a purgatorial ring-shape), where an expressive acoustic guitar lead draws out a bright yet sorrowful phrase as Hinson, double-tracked Iron &amp; Wine style, shades his gently gruff moan with a weary falsetto. Hinson is at his best when he’s prayerful, cradling his melodies as gently as his rough voice will allow, which he does beautifully on “Dreams” and especially on “The Leading Guy”. Amid a hearty acoustic strum and a mist of mournful keyboards, Hinson swings between hoarsely barked verses and the hymn-like refrain of “He moved on to God knows where,"" arresting in its reverence and repetition. And “Wasted Away” burbles and wavers around a silvery lead, flowing like a lazy, frosty river. Whether Hinson's an honest-to-god desert maniac or not becomes sort of irrelevant when the music’s hanging dark and heavy on the air. <br/>

    Yes, summer 2006 is the summer of <em>Snakes on a Plane</em>. But it's also the season of the ""art-house monster movie""-- at least in the words of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> (I know!). Among the latest snob-spookers: South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho's <em>The Host</em>, Thai duo Oxide and Danny Pang's <em>Re-Cycle</em>, and <em>The Exorcist</em> guy's fresh Harry Connick Jr./Ashley Judd creep-out, <em>Bug</em>. All picked up Cannes plaudits, though probably fewer than Al Gore.</p><p>
    It's also ""the summer of Sound Team""-- at least in the words of one media outlet. As blog memes go, praise for the Austin sextet isn't as ubiquitous as your aforementioned forthcoming herpetological thriller, but in Hype Machine circles it's not that far off. As with the new arty fright flicks, Sound Team's first proper full-length <em>Movie Monster</em> tries hard to straddle between blockbuster and cult classic, flashing a dizzying array of instant-cred reference points like so much major-label bling and piling on rube-dazzling special effects. Most popcorn-thriller misfires lack the plot and character to match their sound and fury; <em>Movie Monster</em>'s adenoidal overemoting and Wall-of-the-Edge guitars can't hide a shortage of, like, actual decent songs.</p><p>
    To be sure, <em>Movie Monster</em> has plenty to offer Next Big Thing-spotters. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah last year, Sound Team open things with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it song fragment, though their ""Get Out"" is more U2 anthem-- particularly ""With or Without You""-- than CYHSY carny busk. Just as Tapes 'n Tapes endearingly name-checked Harvard Square on this year's <em>The Loon</em>, Sound Team drop in another real-life locale, Portland's Burnside Ave., amid the Wilco-esque Americana of organ-driven single ""Back in Town"". Then there's the hipster roll call of influences: Stereolab and <em>Low</em>-era Bowie (and thus Krautrock motorik) throughout, plus <em>Loveless</em> shimmer on ""Afterglow Years"", Gang of Rapturous Franz disco-punk on marble-mouthed ""TV Torso"", and singer/guitarist Matt Oliver's strangled Walkmen/Creed croak. Yes, they opened for Arcade Fire in Central Park. But Win was only returning a favor. 
    </p>
<p>
    Amid blurry soundscapes produced by Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Trail of Dead), Sound Team hack together <em>Yankee Kid A Foxtrot</em> nonsense lyrics and the kind of vague melodies sure to leave you humming the video. ""All of the bedrooms fold into the Perfect Chair"", Oliver repeats between Police-tinged verses on ""Born to Please"". Meanwhile, ""Your Eyes Are Liars"" is pretty much garden-variety post-Elefant 1980s nostalgia, substituting hoarse bravado for Mozzy croon. Extra points for working both Kafka and Trinitrons into the big, desolate ""No More Birthdays"". Finally, the ringing drone of lofty closer ""Handful of Billions"" unveils the Bono-sized ambitions lurking beneath the album's more fashionable style-shifting. ""Let the backlash begin,"" Oliver tries elsewhere, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's going to be a long summer. 
    </p>
<p>
    For all the cinematic sonic touches, Sound Team's eponymous ""monster"" is, like Sasquatch, pretty hard to follow. At last, on the sinister, electronics-laden title track, with ghostly harmonies out of a subpar TV on the Radio outtake, Oliver screamo-wails that ""the movie monster was mechanical""-- and he could easily be describing his band's rote reiteration of snazzy influences. Sometimes you meet the monster, and it is you. And sometimes there are motha-fuckin' snakes on this motha-fuckin' plane.

Writer?). Not because it lacks any thematic lucidity, bouncing from exhausting club tracks to overwrought narratives. Not even because Busta's image overhaul from manic puppeteer to grim-faced street soliloquist is preposterous beyond description. The reason this album is wrongheaded and selfish lies in the simple usage of resources.</p>
<p>Getting Dr. Dre to buckle down and get to work these days is like pulling a sword from a stone. It takes preordained royalty (*cough cough*) to do it, and sometimes even then, as in the case of Rakim, it's not enough. So Dre's attention paid to this album, along with the participation of producers Denaun Porter, Timbaland and (I can't believe I'm saying this) will.i.am, are a waste of the highest order. Each one brings varying degrees of excellence to Busta and he repays them with the turgid, unmemorable and insipid. By now the clanging daft chumpery of ""Touch It"" has infiltrated the masses and the less said about it the better. Likewise for the blindfold checklist ""New York Shit,"" a song so desperately transparent in false unity it sounds more like territorial denouement than celebration.</p>
<p>But the tracks that could have been, like Porter's frantic mid-tempo burner ""They're Out To <br/> Get Out Me,"" leave the worst taste. Built around Porter's aching chorus and windy funk guitar, the track should have been saved for Obie Trice or maybe Dr. Dre himself. The wrenching ""Been Through the Storm"" from Sha Money XL and Dre features a queasy, lilting chorus from Stevie Wonder (!) and Busta's best verses by far with the humane tale of his parents. Aside from that, I'm not sure I could quote any other song on the album. This isn't always the idea, as on Timbo's jungle-clunker ""Get Down,"" one of the most obvious tracks he's ever made. The drum programming is reliably astounding, but Tim appears to have left his trusty keyboard at the gym, leaving Busta hanging on the vine with nothing to say.</p>
<p>Like LL Cool J, another Paleolithic MC still chugging along with a release this year, a guest appears on nearly every song here, sapping the songs of the grit Busta seems to be aping and making it sound more like <i>Busta Rhymes Presents...Clusterfuck</i>. Songs better left to their guests, like Raekwon's backroom swaggerfest ""Goldmine"" and Nas' paranoid formalism (""My interest: your departure"") on ""Don't Get Carried Away,"" would sound better on their own forthcoming albums. What Busta Rhymes doesn't seem to realize is that all we want from him is unhinged energy and good humor. And good videos. The importance he (and his record label) seems to be placing on this release has clouded his memory of what made <i>The Coming</i> and <i>When Disaster Strikes</i> enjoyable, if non-classic, material. The fluidity of his vocal patterns is still impressive, but to what end? Does anyone buy it when he claims he'll ""kill a snitch for the feds?"" Is a posthumous Rick James guest spot actually that impressive? Lest we forget Rick James' standing in the world pre-Chappelle. It's just another example of the pomp that passes for poignant on <i>The Big Bang</i>.</p>
<p>Just thinking about how much money and energy was squandered on this album is maddening enough to make me want to start trying to justifying it. But there's no apology for ""The Legend of the Fall Offs,"" perhaps the least self-aware track of the year. On it Bus solemnly raps, ""Alone in the mirror you look at yourself and you smile/disregarding the fact that your run has been done for a while/refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child/continue fronting like it's nothing while you live in denial."" And with that, we bid farewell to the emperor's new clothes.</p></div>"|9123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9123-the-big-bang/|2.4|Sean Fennessey

    Lavishing Andre Young with praise is like getting worked up over filet mignon. You're not going to impress anybody with description and deification. Dr. Dre didn't just reconfigure rap music with <em>The Chronic</em>, he played perhaps the largest role in making it the most viable form of American popular music this century. What's gotten lost in the writing of his legacy is the slight devolution his most successful period marked. As much as G-Funk set the post-80s generation ablaze-- sidling up to the table less than a year after Nirvana's <em>Nevermind</em> began dominating the consciousness-- it leaned too heavily on George Clinton's two-decade old cosmic slop. And for all of Snoop Doggy Dogg's liquid cool (anyone else miss that Doggy?), there was always Dre's hyper-clunky delivery. Still, there's no denying the immensely decadent, trunk-rattling pseudo-reality of his best Death Row-era output.</p><p>
    This 15-song set is the second Dr. Dre compilation this decade, following 2002's similarly titled <em>Chronicles: Best of the Works</em>, and it struggles to match the comprehensive assemblage of 1996's <em>Death Row Greatest Hits</em>. This one, however, leans far more heavily on Snoop, eliciting four tracks from <em>Doggystyle</em> and one from the underestimated <em>Tha Doggfather</em>. Snoop's a cipher nowadays, awash in product placement's goop, but the armchair funk of ""Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)"" is as funny and flagrant as ever. Rank misogyny in hip-hop wasn't news at this point, but damn, did Nate Dogg take it to romantic extremes on that track. Elsewhere, ""Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')"" and Lady of Rage's ""Afro Puffs"" sound aggressive as ever, where Dre and the Lady spit invective over that signature West Coast ping and kicking-a-dead-body snare.</p><p>
    The major hits, especially ""Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"", hold up, but the Leon Haywood-sampling skeleton reveals a song that rode to prominence on the strength of Snoop's elegant discourse (""But, uhh, back to the lecture at hand/ Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand"") more than originality of production. Still, Dre has mastered so many styles over the years, from N.W.A.'s soul-laced nihilism to Eminem's carnival-barking circus themes to 50 Cent's megalomaniacal street semantics to the ultra-sheen of Gwen Stefani r&amp;b. His Death Row tracks are his most iconic, without question, but feel more about purpose and personality than sonic clarity. No one wants to rate Jesus' miracles, but I mean, c'mon, making the blind guy see was more meaningful than water-to-wine, wasn't it? 
    </p>
<p>
    Really, they're all gems, but two shine extra bright: Dre's reunion with Ice Cube, ""Natural Born Killaz"", actually foretold the chaotic slams of Dre's best album, the overwhelmingly precise <em>2001;</em> and the 2Pac collaboration ""California Love (Remix)"" features the little-heard, nearly two-minute vocoder solo from Roger Troutman, one of Dre's forebears. The solo is chill-inducing, stretched out longer than it has to be, punctuating one of rap's most extravagant songs with a finale full of grandeur and, dare I say, gravitas. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are only a handful of songs here that even the most casual fan of rap-- nay, popular music-- won't own. But as a playlist, <em>Chronicles</em> lacks any thematic connotations. It certainly works as <em>Gangsta Shit 101</em> and nudges everyone, again, about Death Row's frozen-in-time prominence. It also reminds listeners that the label didn't really have much going for it musically aside from Dre's (and later Dat Nigga Daz's) production. As Dre has aged and attempted to maintain his grasp on screw-faced gangsta lean, his output has taken a turn for the absent. It's been a struggle, as Dre the family man is clearly no longer Dre the ""I will kill Eazy-E if I see him in public"" thug. He may never have been. Take a peek at some pictures from his days in the electro-funk squad, the World Class Wreckin' Cru-- sometimes I wonder if he still tries on that shiny suit. So, as his long-rumored <em>Detox</em> angles with <em>Chinese Democracy</em> for most overhyped Neveruary arrival and heads get antsy, there will always be compilations like this to insist things are not like it was then.

Better to err on the side of charity, and anyway, the higher rating sticks because-- despite its almost satirical opacity-- it divulges just enough meaning to suggest the existence of a map, somewhere, that would impose scale and key upon this incoherent terrain. Bouchard forestalls this demystification simply by rendering a meaninglessly jumbled cipher. This sort of unsolvable cryptology is a well-worn trick of the postmodern sensibility, and if you find yourself annoyed by the phrase ""postmodern sensibility,"" (or ""meaninglessly jumbled cipher,"" for that matter) then this record is definitely not for you.</p><p>
    Even if Bouchard's totems are merely shades, they're various and finely wrought. A wispy catalog of fragmented obsessions, <em>Good World</em> is a hermetic space delimited by the Timex ticks and sprung-cuckoo-clock fugues. It features bleary, mechanical woodwind melodies, drums that mince and shamble, Bouchard's sweetly threatening sing-song vocals, and sinister elevator noir. For a record that wraps up in less than 30 minutes, it covers a lot of ground: There's the music box twinkle of ""Stone Giants"", spectral death marches and booby-hatch waltzes, peach-fuzzy twee, free-jazz wallpaper (twittering on ""The Hunter #2""; droning on ""Bloody Knife #3"") and comatose klezmer, coolly stylized mysticism; disquieting nursery songs (""One slice/ Two slice/ Three slice/ Four,"" Bouchard Dr. Seusses faux-innocuously on ""Bloody Knife #3""), and outsider-art kitsch. But the unrelenting falsetto and inchoate songs blur all this diversity into one indistinct image, as weirdly magnetic and ineffably off-seeming as a pinhole photograph.</p><p>
    This might be the rare case where the perennially abused ""schizophrenic"" is an acceptable synonym for ""eclectic."" Think Flaming Lips after ingesting some psychotropic agent so hardcore you have to take acid just to come down from it, or an Animal Collective more into blissful menace than menacing bliss. On second thought, don't-- <em>Good World</em> is <em>sui generis</em>. Bouchard is an auteur in the Lynchian tradition, imposing a semblance of order on vague significances in a psychologically loaded way that makes the audience feel more like voyeurs than invitees. It's easy to dismiss art that clamors for affection, harder when it seems indifferent. There's probably a German word capable of describing the complex response this album provokes, but in English, I can only say that while I can't profess to ""like"" <em>Good World</em>, I'm compelled to dwell upon it until I figure out exactly what it might want from me.</p></div>"|9132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9132-good-world/|6.1|Brian Howe

    underground cowpokes to sport plaid with pride. Not long after, the
    grunge explosion ushered in a new look, and chain stores passed off the
    hearty, low-maintenance wardrobe as designer ""grunge wear."" Nowadays,
    the outdoorsman thing's returned to those who actually work outdoors,
    so it seems folks who lived through the earlier period are reopening
    the closets, albeit conjuring a differently rustic, more classic rock
    sound.</p><p>
    Howlin' Rain do a good approximation of Southern (California or NJ) rock modernized with noise-guitar <em>Deus ex machina</em>
    and one particularly jazzy bramble. Not your average Coors Lite
    crackers, the trio consists of Comets on Fire vocalist and guitarist
    Ethan Miller, Sunburned Hand of the Man shaman John Maloney on drums,
    and Ian Gradek on bass and banjo. Outside of the core, Comets
    contributor Tim Daly adds blustery and homey alto-saxophone and the
    ever-ubiquitous Tim Green plays a bit of keyboard.</p><p>
    The Arik Roper cover art, great as usual, just about nails the vibe:
    Pot smoke wafting out of a rural cabin into blue skies. Outside the
    frame, though, there's likely a flock of storm clouds fast approaching. Noisier
    tendencies personalize the formula: Think of ""Truckin'"" with fried tube
    amps, Allman Brothers' harmonies sideswiped by Monoshock, or CCR
    infused with heavy doses of Blue Cheer. Wordy song titles (e.g. ""Death
    Prayer in Heaven's Orchard"") also point to an ominous vibe not
    immediately apparent in the good-time hay-baling white-boy squawk.
    </p><p>
    If only it were all as brilliant as ""Calling Lightning With a
    Scythe"", one of my favorite tracks of the year. The wheat-field
    dramaturgy begins with acoustic strums, twangy banjo, and suitably
    bummer lyrics: ""On Sunday I found your rotting bones/ Oh, my old
    friend, it's so hard to let you go."" Amid increased guitar doses, now
    electric, and some horns, the protagonist takes a train, ponders
    ghostly arms, legs, and graves (plus a ""picture of you smiling when you
    were young""), and finds himself ""laying around in the wreckage of this
    beautiful little world."" It's a jasmine-scented ""Sweet Home Alabama""
    until the banjo warps and the guitar swerves out of tune, producing a
    beautiful, noisome solo. Eventually, the guitar doubles, bleeding
    across channels to tear it up even more enormously. They
    don't try to mix the eruption lower or blend the ferocious tracks; as a
    result, the guts and
    scars remain after the song's ripped apart. 
    </p>
<p>
    Without such great structural interplay, ""The Firing of the Midnight
    Rain"", a nine-minute Steve Miller sorta thing, sweats decent whiskey beneath
    an old moon. As with a few of the tracks, there's precipitation, a
    solitary man, and days that ""slide away, like mud."" Olivia Tremor
    Control psych sighs go well with nostalgic imagery of wind breezing
    through the pines and sunburst characters drinking canned beer. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Death Prayer in Heaven's Orchard"" has its share of gooey rocker
    nougat and the closing trucker seance of ""The Hanging Heart"" strikes a
    good balance of ingredients, though on ""Roll on the Rusted Days"" or
    ""Show Business,"" for instance, the guitars may sound Southern rock
    authentic, but they feel more like homage than personal statement. This
    happens a few times: Beneath a charismatic coating, the stuff can drag.
    </p>
<p>
    Another problem: Miller possesses a good voice, but avoids shredding his
    throat as much as he does with Comets on Fire. The lack of vocal
    variety can lull. Also, that <em>Blue Cathedral</em>-style
    sound's fuller and more frantic, allowing him to mate his howls with
    snarls buzzing around him. This seems particularly important: Howlin'
    Rain
    occasionally feels small even though music like this begs for eternal
    Nuge largess. 
    </p>
<p>
    What's it all mean? The aesthetic's familiar and comforting, but not
    always compelling. The one great song and two or three good ones make
    for fine close listening. The rest, that more generic chaff, serve as
    a decent soundtrack for when you have the top down and find yourself
    driving nowhere in particular.

    In the U.S., Serge Gainsbourg’s reggae phase is rarely mentioned by anyone but rarities sluts and insatiable Francophones. Serge fans can’t figure out why the maestro abandoned his memorable melodies. Dub experts figure him for a lazy colonialist, abusing Jamaican rhythms for the sake of his lewd Parisian poetry. Everyone else regards it as an uninspired oddity. But the two most important recordings from this period, <em>Aux Armes et Caetera</em> and <em>Mauvaises Nouvelles des Étoiles</em>, arrived at a critical juncture for the French pop emblem. By 1979, Gainsbourg was celebrating his first No. 1 album at home, organizing a series of celebrated concerts, and orchestrating a national scandal by bastardizing the Marseillaise with the assistance of Rita Marley. Indeed, it was a last triumphant moment before his Elvis-caliber decline as a Whitney Houston-baiting Monsieur Hyde.</p><p>
    The atrociously titled <em>Gainsbourg…et Caetera </em>(subtitled as <em>Enregistrement public au Théâtre Le Palace</em>) captures that enthusiasm with excessive glee: Two discs of tarry reggae, interview rigmarole, and endless applause recorded on New Years’ Eve 1979, in Northern Paris. The recordings, culled from three major performances, feature Sly &amp; Robbie, the Revolutionaries, and the great Ansel Collins on keyboards and organ. Earlier editions suffered from mixing gaffes and butchered track lists, though the current release errors on the side of completists who demand multiple versions and extended banter. The songs are mostly from <em>Aux Armes</em>, a dense set of bubbling dread and Upsetters-quoting dub. In search of an ever-elusive authenticity, the back cover contains an unpersuasive motto: “Strictly roots. <em>A écouter fort.</em>”</p><p>
    The album is less about Gainsbourg’s insouciance than Collins’ spectral keyboards and Sticky Thompson’s meticulous percussion. For sheer consistency, they’re an unbeatable duo, confidently navigating through Serge’s snarls. Conversely, the band needs the singer’s unpredictable ejaculations to avoid tedium. The bizarre interaction produces an irresistible-- and inevitably comedic-- blend of liquid riffs and tropical smut. “Relax Baby Be Cool” enacts smooth circuits of electro-bass and honeyed keyboards while Serge laconically rants about the Klan and Yul Brynner. “Marilou Reggae Dub” mixes smooth strums and jagged breaks with ample shots of fairy-dust sprinkle effects. For all the cheery Caribbean romance, there’s no lack of foreboding atmospherics. On “Daisy Temple”, narcotic chord clusters, faltering organs, and rueful back-up girls lampoon Gainsbourg’s literate lechery, and “Brigade des Stups” rolls tubes of condensed reverb around stories of war and weed.
    </p>
<p>
    Outside of the <em>Aux Armes</em> tunes, Serge attempts to replicate shards of his old repertoire. Sure, there’s some initial excitement over the prospect of a roots-reggae “Bonnie and Clyde” or “Harley Davidson,” but the vocals are listless and tired, unable to compete with the group’s spirited funk. From the vantage of a jet-setting rasta prophet, he seems unsure of how to reconcile his seductive teenage anthems with more global tastes. (The revving keyboards and rattling drums on “Harley” seem like a particularly odious ploy for novelty value.) It’s a shame since it mars an otherwise spotless set. If you have a passion for Parisian reggae, <em>Enregistrement </em>is easily the most complete and skillful record of Gainsbourg’s latter-day escapades, with performances that usually surpass the studio versions. Still, if the album is viewed as one small component of Serge’s entire output, most of this material attests to his ambition and élan but not his musical talent. In this particular venue, he must cede his authority to the rhythm section.

    Some exposition: The first letter in Rjyan Kidwell's stage name is pronounced with a soft sound, like
    an ""s."" He started out just screwing around on the computer, making
    melodic Aphex Twin-inspired IDM, but he liked to have fun live. He used to rock
    fronts and freestyle and violate his onstage props in tawdry and unsavory ways.
    He started to rap on record. His records started to get a little darker. He
    went away for a while. Yes, that's a ring on his finger. He was in this other
    band with his wife, but now he's back as Cex again. What does his music sound
    like now? Well...it sounds like fucking.</p><p>
    Emphasis on <em>Actual</em>-- this isn't any airbrushed
    fantasy we're talking about. From the beats on the record to the titillating
    stories in the booklet and <em>Midnite Vultures</em>-goes-porn aesthetic of the
    cover, <em>Actual Fucking</em> is up front about its intentions. But more than
    just being forward, Cex knows that actual sex is unpredictable and, well,
    messy-- much like this record. (Sex can be awkward, too, but we'll get there in
    a moment.)</p><p>
    It's not terribly different from previous Cex records,
    and not even that far from <em>Maryland Mansions</em>, though he's dropped his B-boy affectations almost entirely. Kidwell has pulled Cex inside out, keeping
    the mood but quitting the parroting and finding a new and, dare I say, original
    sound. Yes, there are some obvious nods to Talking Heads' <em>Remain in Light</em>,
    especially on ""Los Angeles"", but <em>Actual Fucking</em> wipes the
    slate clean and builds from two pillars: Beats that are as sleazy and
    threatening as possible, and crescendos that are natural and intuitive. 
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, <em>Actual
    Fucking</em> is all start and no finish-- it's all downhill from the debased
    industrial slink of the opener ""Baltimore"". While the booklet
    promises guest stars like Jason Cadell (the Dismemberment Plan) and Tim
    Kinsella (who rap-sings over the grinding neighborhood-name-checking
    ""Chicago""), <em>Actual Fucking</em> was mostly culled from a series of
    jam sessions with Portland noise-rockers Nice Nice that were cut-up and
    reassembled by Kidwell. The slapdash assembly shows-- <em>Actual Fucking</em> is
    a series of fascinating vignettes that never quite gel. 
    </p>
<p>
    The vocal by Roby Newton (aka Ms. Kidwell, formerly
    of Milemarker) in the drifting, abstract soundscape of ""Denton"", a
    song built on little more than a muffled drum track, is unhinged and almost
    frightening in its carnality. ""Ybor City"" begins as a berating
    post-blind-date voicemail from an unimpressed mallrat over a subtle techno
    backdrop before becoming the kind of acoustic guitar breather you'd hear on a
    post-rock or Anticon record. The beat to ""Covington"" is hard and
    heavy, layered with organs and watery drones, but Kidwell's hyper-dramatic
    abstractions about cars and salad bars aren't enough to anchor the song. The
    record ends unceremoniously on ""Tucumcari"", a few more organs and
    sampled strings being all that's left to add. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a huge headfirst leap into the unknown for Kidwell,
    and more often than not, he sounds pretty lost. But it's an encouraging kind of
    lost, and the scenery is often breathtaking when it's not so jarring.
    It'd be a shame to never get another Cex record when he's finally tapping into
    his potential.

In 2005, Solter released his solo debut, <em>The Brief Light</em>, an eclectic composite of tribal percussion, exotic instrumentation, and ambient tones, and while it was different than most of the work he's recorded, its crisp production and layered arrangements marked it as the work of a studio wiz.</p><p>
    Solter's second foray into solo recording is <em>One River</em>. This time, the percussive aspects are gone and the layers are stripped away, leaving quiet, slowly evolving songs to ebb and flow. Whereas <em>The Brief Light</em>'s rhythm-heavy focus placed it alongside Meat Beat Manifesto's recent work, <em>One River</em> is a more straightforward ambient release-- a mixture of heavily processed guitars, field recordings, and manipulated voices (provided by Wendy Allen)-- more comparable to Brian Eno or the Wind-Up Bird. Seven songs run seamlessly together, each inhaling and exhaling tone after tone. There isn't much in the way of tune or melody; instead there is a deliberate growth as each moment surges and fades. The structures, hinted at by the album's title, recall waves lapping at the shore, or a current twisting and winding-- both alive and lifeless at once. At times the textures are dense, but there aren't really layers in the traditional sense. Since there are very few melodies in the songs, the sounds weave together to create single tones that spread out before the listener.</p><p>
    ""Desert Trains"" evokes the image of an eerie sunset with a slight, guitar-picked melody surrounded by a fabric of humming. It slowly transforms into ""The Great Cold"", which drops the melody and shifts to a more constant drone. It's difficult to say if the title reflects the music or if the music reflects the title, but the image of a barren, frozen landscape fits well regardless. In fact, landscape imagery comes to mind in every song, making listening to this record not so like hearing a story as taking a journey. </p></div>"|9120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9120-one-river/|7.1|Cory D.

    Big Star never enjoyed the
    fame or fortune that their name--  copped from a supermarket chain--  would
    suggest. But in the first half of the 1970s, ex-Box Top Alex Chilton and
    company cranked out three nearly flawless albums: The pure power-pop of
    <em>#1 Record</em>, the hook-laden <em>Radio City</em>, and the uncompromising and
    elegiac <em>Third/Sister Lovers</em>. A string of
    unlikely distribution snafus kept all three out of the hands of the
    record-buying public, so it's fitting then that an album paying belated
    homage to Big Star would suffer a similar fate.</p><p>
    In 1998, Big Star drummer Jody Stephens worked with Ignition Records to compile <em>Big Star, Small World</em>, but the label went belly up before
    it was released. Earlier this year, Koch Records bought
    the rights to the tapes and have belatedly issued the compilation. Unsurprisingly then, listening to <em>Big Star, Small World</em> is akin to
    digging up a time capsule. With a roster of contributors that includes
    Matthew Sweet, Juliana Hatfield, and the Gin Blossoms, the album's as
    embarrassingly dated as high school yearbook photos. Instead of
    showcasing a group of great songs, it triggers memories of mid-90s
    also-rans like Better Than Ezra or Letters to Cleo. Even the most
    relevant band of the bunch, Wilco, is vacuum-sealed in its earnest alt-country phase, liberally adding lap steel guitar to
    ""Thirteen"".</p><p>
    The compilation's biggest flaw, though, is how unimaginatively the
    bands approach the material. Reverence is one thing, but Sweet, for example, goes so far as to
    recreate specific guitar tones and perfectly preserve drum fills on
    ""The Ballad of El Goodo"". Only a couple of bands flex their creative
    muscles: Afghan Whigs transform the fragile ""Nightime"" by adding anthemic guitar
    riffs, organ, and Greg Dulli's elongated phrasing, while the Posies-- whose
    Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow have toured with Chilton as
    Big Star in recent years-- add heavy guitars and a little screeching
    feedback to an otherwise faithful rendition of ""What's Goin Ahn"". The rest of the contributors seem content to role-play as their heroes,
    offering something closer to impersonation than any thoughtful
    re-working of the material.
    </p>
<p>
    Oddly enough, a reformed Big Star contribute a new track to their own
    tribute album. The band sounds light years away from its golden era, getting in on the aforementioned impersonation act
    themselves. With a riff swiped from ""Wild Thing"" and Chilton still
    relying on the lexicon of high school love for lyrical fodder, ""Hot
    Thing"" sounds passionless and bored. Then again, that kind of phoned-in
    performance makes it a perfect fit among such an uninspired set.<br/>

Once crowned kings of the ultra-fast sweepstakes, their grindcore made their competition extinct by breaking the genre's essential rule: They canned their drummer and turned over the bpm to a drum machine. The Locust, Charles Bronson, even Discordance Axis-- helmed by the fastest living drummer, Dave Witte-- couldn't keep up. Then again: After a while, who really cared? Watching a needle skip, shake, and fly across full LP sides in seven minutes or less was an awesome but necessarily short-lived thrill. All that remains today of that era, for me anyway, is a ruined eBay account: I, er, a friend of mine, in those heady days, once totally ruined his online credibility by chasing (OK, bidding on) the original incarnation of <em>PCP Torpedo</em>-- a 6"" colored scrap of immediately out-of-print vinyl.</p><p>
    These days, without context, those who encounter Agoraphobic Nosebleed generally act like people on hidden camera shows: nervously laughing, half credulous, and half already figuring out the exact ironic distance to maintain from a band that names a track ""A Clown Pointing a Gun at a Small Dog (Reprise)"". And did I mention <em>PCP</em> does its 10 songs in 6:32, about the time it takes to get to the first chorus in ""Freebird?"" But the joke, if there is one, isn't on you.</p><p>
    Brainchild of Pig Destroyer's Scott Hull and the former Isis programmer J. Randall, Agoraphobic Nosebleed aren't hacks or comedians but dudes who know basic secrets like ""if it's fast, it might rip,"" and ""if we can write 17 three-second parts anytime we want, then why not put them all in the same song?"" <em>PCP Tornado</em> was the perfect length for Agoraphobic's exhausting calisthenics; at its best, as on ""Information Super Lost Highway"" and ""Thinning the Herd"", the record distilled a half-day's worth of breakdowns, cat-dog vocals, and whirring metal riffs down to the time it takes to snort a line of meth. In this respect, Agoraphobic acted as the exact opposite of the doom that's metal's current watchword: Where stoners take heaviness and mellow it enough to last the length of their high, Agoraphobic's grind condenses the experience, syncing it up to match, in feel anyway, the wealth of colorful pills that decorate their album art. </p><p>
    If there is a joke here, it's how laughable the idea is of reissuing a suite of songs that are about half the total length any given song on Southern Lord. Cue then the dubious decision by Hydra Head to include a second disc-- the drug-punning <em>ANBRX</em>-- of remixes of Agoraphobic originals by industrial noise types. Why bother? Agoraphobic's formal innovation, as far as they had one, was just that: mating industrial noise and pseudo-breaks played off a drum-machine with a not-so-dissimilar grind that was already getting both noisier and more techno. In effect, they were already remixing their metal tracks, just in first draft form. Why put amphetamine rock on amphetamines? </p><p>
    Nevertheless, Jansky Noise, Auek, Drokz &amp; Tails, Hells Army, and a phalanx of others lean on pretty much that exact principle, relentlessly working the drum machine as if somehow Agoraphobic Nosebleed hadn't already done the exact same thing. More palpable are takes by Merzbow and Vinda Obmana, who depart from the script and instead make menacing, dark cloudy factory junk out of the dregs of the source material's adrenaline. And the combo of Dev/Null and Xanopticon at least take the drum machine to its logical extreme, turning their track into more-or-less pure breakbeats that sound amusingly like battling rats. But for a band that made what one critic once called ""the <em>Paul's Boutique</em> of grindcore,"" shouldn't they be the ones crafting the remixes?<br/></p></div>"|11878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11878-pcp-torpedoanbrx/|6.0|Zach Baron

But for a little while there-- whether as the result of media hype, mere youthful exuberance, or some perfect confluence of cultural and technological trends-- the humble disc jockey did indeed take on near-celestial significance. ""Are DJs musicians?"" thinkpiecers mused, late and cringe-worthy as usual, and you know only something pretty big-- a beat, say-- could get them even to consider the possibility. Right about 1997. A former bassist for an 80s indie-pop group. Check it out, now.</p><p>
    The new Fatboy Slim compilation, <em>The Greatest Hits: Why Try Harder</em>, shows that the DJ who originally named himself Norman Cook was, as his detractors alleged, a product of his time. Sure, the erstwhile Housemartins member's formula-- eclectic samples, sloganistic vocal snippets, and an all-around drunken good-time spirit-- was just that, a formula, but it befit an era of peace, blowjobs, and <em>Men in Black</em>. Yes, it was a cheap trick to slow vocal tracks down until they crumble like a worn-out robot, then accelerate them until they blare like a police siren. But the formula was deadly effective, the trick frequently worked.</p><p>
    Slim's best original tracks on <em>Why Try Harder</em> are as universally recognizable as pop gets these days, familiar through films and commercials as much as dance clubs. Favoring mass appeal over chronology, naturally, the latest disc opens with ""The Rockafella Skank"", an international smash featuring a surf-tinged 60s guitar lick nipped from the John Barry Seven and an incessant spoken-word hook from the Just Brothers' Northern Soul song ""Sliced Tomatoes"". Next up, and also culled from 1998 sophomore LP <em>You've Come a Long Way Baby</em>, piano-driven love song  ""Praise You"" reworks Camille Yarbrough's soulful 1975 ""Take Yo' Praise"". Breakthrough single ""Going Out of My Head"", from 1996 debut <em>Better Living Through Chemistry</em>, introduced a new generation to the Who's ""I Can't Explain"".
    </p>
<p>
    Slim was older than his big-beat contemporaries, the Chemical Brothers, and had been spinning records under various guises since the late 80s; his vast collection and his colorful, unlikely juxtapositions help set him apart. More recently, the Avalanches, the Go! Team, and Rjd2 are among the few acts taking a similarly broad-minded, fun-oriented approach to sample-based compositions.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite its enigmatic title, <em>Why Try Harder</em> doesn't stop at the obvious hits. The strongest elements in Slim's own work-- pace, rhythm, stupidly catchy samples-- aren't so different from the makings of a fine remix, so it's no surprise he excels at the latter. His free-wheeling, uptempo take on Cornershop's whimsical ""Brimful of Asha"" far surpasses even the 1997 original. Slim also improves upon Groove Armada's 1999 groove ""I See You Baby"", though he can't make it less annoying. (Slim's posthumous remix of Wildchild's 1995 ""Renegade Master"" is sadly absent.) Other unexpected inclusions are less engaging, such as the cerveza-splashed wah-wah and whistles of ""Everybody Loves a Carnival"", itself a tepid remix of Slim's excellent own ""Everybody Loves a 303"".  Anyway, where's early B-side ""Michael Jackson"", which appears as a bonus track on the U.S. version of the debut?
    </p>
<p>
    As the world has gotten shittier and the shtick has gotten staler, Slim's visibility has diminished. That's in part with good reason: ""Weapon of Choice"", the hit from 2000's <em>Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars</em>, was half-futuristic lounge-funk, half-""Mambo #5"", saved only by Christopher Walken (in the video), while that album's Jim Morrison-sampling ""Sunset (Bird of Prey)"" and Macy Gray gospel ""Demons"" are fucking <em>dire</em>. 2004's <em>Palookaville</em> was even more disappointing, and it's represented here by tracks like past-date Internet joke ""Slash Dot Dash"". An execrable, Bootsy Collins-fronted cover of Steve Miller Band's ""The Joker"" is mercifully left off the compilation, but then so is beachy-keen ""Put It Back Together"", with Damon Albarn. The two new tracks here don't change Slim's downward trajectory, either. Single ""That Old Pair of Jeans"" lopes along with organ groove and a chorus akin to ""Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye), while faster-paced ""Champion Sounds"" bounces on squishy synths, and both feature sing-songy, awkwardly worded rapping by Lateef the Truthspeaker.
    </p>
<p>
    While the party may be over, much of Slim's catalogue meets a critical standard which, like his music, updates an old cliché. It's got a good beat, and you can dance to it. And drive to it. And watch commercials to it. And cook pasta to it. And work out to it. And, well, I wouldn't recommend making love to it (how would you do that?), but some of this stuff <em>was</em> pretty ubiquitous for a while there. Why try harder, indeed.

For the most part, the word referred to the
    sound of the stuff, the way the guitars were blurred and echoed till
    they sounded woozy and dreamlike. But there was also something dreamy
    about Halstead's songwriting-- something quaint, streamlined, and simple,
    like the Platonic ideal of the guitar-pop song. The chords came in
    slow-strummed batches of twos and fours; the melodies lilted over them
    in gentle, even patterns; the whole thing had the simple, comfortable
    feel of old country songs. The group's most notable cover even turned
    out to come from a Platonic-ideal country guy: Lee Hazlewood's
    slow-motion ""Some Velvet Morning"". And country's exactly where Halstead
    went when Slowdive split up and regrouped into Mojave 3:
    slow-motion English country music, lap-steel and all.</p><p>
<em>Puzzles Like You</em> is another shift in sound and style, and
    another staying-the-same for the way Halstead writes (and presumably
    always will write) his songs. These tunes are as upbeat as anything the
    guy's ever recorded; some of them (like ""Ghostship Waiting"") even work
    up little heads of steam before racing out to an energetic finish. By
    Mojave 3 standards, they're positively rocking. But they're still
    Halstead songs-- still pop songs in the most idealized and dreamlike
    sense. They do slick English pop and sunshiney Americana, handclaps and
    rock'n'roll guitar bits, some bounce, some ballads, and all those pop
    staples: the earnest jangle, the starry-eyed harmonies, the innocent
    melodies. (The one thing the album never for a second backs off from is
    Halstead's constant stream of hooks.) It's the old guitar-pop
    dream-- guitar pop that's <em>trying</em> to be guitar pop, rather than
    thinking it's big, bad rock. People have been trying to make us swoon
    this way ever since the Beatles, who took acid and made their music
    ""trippy"" mostly by throwing in a bunch of quaint old backward-looking
    flourishes from the pre-war music hall. This music fits right in with
    that bouyant ""perfect pop"" crowd: Swoony whitebread from the Monkees to
    Teenage Fanclub (Halstead borrows one of their harmonies on ""Big Star
    Baby""), from the Lightning Seeds and XTC to Fountains of Wayne. Ween do
    it all the time, and people give them a pass because it seems like
    they're kidding.</p><p>
    Yes, lots of bands attempt this, and the problem is that it involves
    walking a really fine line-- the line between sounding like you're
    offering up a comfy pop dream (on purpose) and sounding like you're
    offering toothless, wimpy, whitebread retro (because you don't know any
    better). Lucky for Halstead, he's spent most of his career on the right
    side of that line. The better part of this record is certainly
    charming, even more likeable than the folk that came before it; the
    group sounds like it's shed some kind of weight and finally feels free
    to go loose and happy. The first chorus appears within 30 seconds;
    the title track seems to be trying to rewrite ""Different Drum"" with
    even <em>more</em>
    melody; then there are a couple great songs about girls whose names
    start with the letter J. They're fuzzy-blanket comforting, totally
    doe-eyed, and surprisingly satisfying, especially if you're just drunk
    enough to want something sweet and pouty.</p><p>
    The only problem is that the magic fades. Through the first half of the
    record, it really is a dream. By the time you get to the second half,
    though, we start to toe the danger line. Halstead's ear for pop begins
    to sound rote, almost mechanical, and the weaker tracks-- say, ""Kill the
    Lights""-- reveal themselves as simple 1960s retro, complete with
    by-the-numbers fills on bass and organ. Perfectly good hooks on ""You've
    Said It Before"" seem wimpy and cloying, too eager to please. It's as if
    enjoying the first half wears you out: By the time you hit the middle,
    all that suspension-of-disbelief starts to evaporate, and you just
    might start to remember exactly why people got tired of this sort of
    thing in the first place.<br/></p></div>"|9118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9118-puzzles-like-you/|7.2|Nitsuh Abebe

We know he likes tribal percussion, ethereal female voices, lush western classical, and the repetition of the minimalists. The proportions vary from album to album and his large discography has a surprising amount of variety, but at least a few of these favored elements are always present.</p><p>
    Yokota's latest album draws from several styles without focusing on any one. Opener ""1000 Wing Beats Per Second"", a looped clip of chirpy woodwinds references the obsession with European classical he displayed on last year's <em>Symbol</em>. A woman's voice offers a dreamy incantation, and then a lazy (in every sense) trip-hop beat sets the pace. It's classic Yokota-- all glittery surfaces and sugary frosting and gushy prettiness-- and it develops an odd sense of depth despite its severe lack of complexity. ""Capital of Daisy"" is in a similar vein, adding some Middle Eastern chants, vocoder bits, and a grinding music box to the mix. The use of voice to suggest songs as opposed to the rhythmic punctuation of Meredith Monk is a new twist, but <em>Wonder Waltz</em> doesn't stay in any one place long. Instead, it follows a lot of blind alleys.</p><p>
    ""Pegasus 150"" is nothing more than a stiff loop of hand drums and a wailing voice-- third-tier Dead Can Dance for a coffee shop WorldBeat comp, something to be slotted next to the Afro Celt Sound System. ""Robed Heart"" adds some violin to the same formula and tries for something more lilting, but the melody is MIA and the singer has difficulty staying on key. ""L'etranger"" seems to have wandered in from a bad new wave album, with a tight synth loop and spoken French run through a delay bringing zero emotional content. And ""Rainbow Dust"" references the Orb and other classic early 1990s ambient house, but does little to develop its spacey synths.
    </p><p>
    You get the sense that Yokota works too quickly, cutting and pasting ideas as they come without much thought to how their impact could be maximized. You also get the sense that this is how he prefers to operate, since he's been prolific for the past dozen years and has managed a small handful of sublime records. <em>Wonder Waltz</em> feels mostly like a collection of duff experiments-- fun to explore but with little staying power.

You could hear his love of the Impulse!     catalog in the samples he used well before he channeled the sound in     collaboration with drummer Steve Reid. He understands hip-hop and has a natural     feel for the rhythms and textures of techno. He digs Warp-school IDM, near     which his own records are usually slotted, but only as one type of electronic music     among many. A pop/rock lineage stands out in his work with early Fridge     material and various remixes since. No single genre hems him in.</p>
<p>And so it goes when it comes time to assemble a mix. In late     2004 he put one together for the <i>Late Night Tales</i> series and forced     Fairport Convention to mingle with Terry Riley, Madvillain, and Sun Ra, and now     he returns with a set for the <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series that's almost (but not     quite) as varied. Anyone who turns to mix CDs for a unity will hear these sets     as obnoxiously eclectic show-offs. Zimbabwean mbira jams sandwiched between     Model 500 and Quickspace Supersport? Who does this dude think he is?</p>
<p>A guy who listens beyond category. Or, more accurately, a     guy able to select and sequence disparate tracks in a way that highlights what     they share rather than what keeps them apart. That's the real trick with this <i>DJ-Kicks</i>-- that the sensibility underlying it all is clearly audible. All of     it, somehow, convincingly becomes ""Four Tet-ish Music."" This happens     in part because the tracks as presented function as a sonic experience rather     than a cultural one. The threads that stream through have to do with structure     and timbre rather than the identity of the individual artists or their     respective milieus. They're pried completely from their original settings to     fit wholly in this one.</p>
<p>So the opening electronic drones and trumpet of David     Behrman's ""Leapday Night"" could have come from any time in the past     35 years; the actual time (1990) and context (improv with Rhys Chatham, Ben     Neill, and Takeisha Kosugi) are not important. What matters is the texture of     the electronics, the simple warm harmonics, and prickly edge of a trumpet bleat     that'll make some sense when Hebden moves into the spacious electro of the Syclops     2005 12-inch ""Mom, the Video Broke"". The live drums of that track are anything     but stiff and robotic, which means that when Hebden follows with Curtis     Mayfield's funky ""If I Were Only a Child Again"" the move is not too     jarring, and in fact the sense of space surrounding the beats feels of a piece.</p>
<p>Perhaps because <i>Late Night Tales</i> steered toward the     somnolent, <i>DJ-Kicks</i> is mostly upbeat and moving. Leftfield selections     are eased into gradually with short snippets to dislodge the mix from where     it's been. Two minute-long fragments-- of So Solid Crew's ""Dilemma""     and Akufen's ""Psychometry 3.2""-- lead into Animal Collective's tribal     beach-blanket B-side singalong ""Baby Day""; with its xylophone, Gong's     ""Love Is How Ya Make It"" shares a sonic affinity with the Shona     People of Rhodesia track from the Nonesuch comp three cuts earlier, but Hebden     gets to it via Quickspace Supersport's ""Superspace""-- here sounding     like an overlooked influence on Caribou-- and 35 seconds of Cabaret Voltaire's     ""Kneel to the Boss"".</p>
<p>The technical skill is nothing special-- there are some     jarring transitions and mostly the songs just bump one against another. But     that doesn't seem particularly important for what Hebden is trying to do. It     still flows, even though it's not a ""journey in sound"". By the time     he closes with Group Home's ""Up Against the Wall"" and Autechre's     ""Flutter"" you get the sense that he hasn't really gone anywhere,     actually, preferring instead to bring the music in to him.</p></div>"|9147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9147-dj-kicks/|8.1|Mark Richardson

    Contrary to what you may see written about them, Asobi Seksu aren't
    gazing at their shoes on their second album-- they're looking skyward the whole
    time. Yes, the guitar overload, massive reverb, and deceptively
    sweet vocals are all there, but this New
    York quartet is anything but a My Bloody Valentine
    retread.</p><p>
    Frontwoman Yuki Chikudate gives the band a charismatic
    focus, and her vocals range from a soulful croon to a delicate wisp. Whether she's singing in
    Japanese or English (she does both in about equal measure), she always keeps it
    catchy, and that squishing sound you hear when she sings ""put your tongue up to
    my battery"" on ""Nefi+Girly"" is indie boys melting across the country.</p><p>
    If the singer/keyboardist was the only member of the
    band who had anything going on, you wouldn't have much to work with, but
    guitarist James Hanna offers some great backing harmonies-- especially on the
    chorus of ""Goodbye"", with its twanging hook and subdued tone. The new rhythm section of drummer Mitch Spivak and bassist Haji moves things along with no fuss, no muss,  which is all the
    better for Hanna to spill guitar guts all over the place. ""Red
    Sea"" is the most egregious instance of string abuse, as sparkling
    noise overwhelms the basic pop song it begins with like a humpback consuming
    krill.
    </p>
<p>
    Hanna switches to slide for ""Strings"", which favors
    space to density, at least for its first couple of minutes. Still, even when
    the crunch does come, the vibe is decidedly astral. It's one of many songs
    that drive home just how perfect Sean McCabe's cover art is: Yuki at the center
    of the swirl, bathed in bright colors, with big swaths of melody slathered
    liberally across the proceedings.
    </p>
<p>
    And that's about as good a description as you'll get of <em>Citrus</em>. This is electric music in every
    sense of the word-- amplified, processed, and imbued with a neon glow. Comparisons
    to shoegazers of yore have their uses, as they're clearly influences, but I'd
    class Asobi Seksu nearer to Mahogany as a band that takes those influences and
    spins them into something special and unique.

Look at just a smattering of who's went and done it: Cobra Verde, Xiu Xiu, Crooked Fingers, Bob Dylan, Guns n' Roses, Will Oldham, Cat Power, the Autumns, Yo La Tengo, Alasdair Roberts, Duran Duran, Paul Anka, Metallica, the Soft Pink Truth, Rage Against The Machine, Golden Smog, Los Lobos, Fairburn Royals, Ivy, Everything But the Girl, Neko Case, Dave Pajo, Guster, Twilight Singers, and David Bowie. Then you have covers-only bands such as Iron Horse and Nouvelle Vague that constantly risk relocation to the Kidz Bop/String Quartet ghetto.</p><p>
    For an outfit to truly justify such an endeavor for non-fans and not seem like they're dropping covers career-strategically (show of hands if your interest in M. Ward was piqued via his Bowie torch-vamp), they'd better have an angle, or personality, or unmistakable idiom. Well, can't nobody else trudge on DeVotchKa's self-staked turf; a Spanish/gypsy sound, except the caravans are done up in velvet, and the singer's tux could fit either <em>Achtung Baby</em>-era Bono or non-electro Patrick Wolf. The largeness can't help but come across as cinematic, and I'd like to think that even dullards envision all manner of lightings and mises-en-scène to this music. (The band is named, of course, after <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>'s slang for female, and that book's narrative is most popularly experienced in the form of Stanley Kubrick's film.)</p><p>
    ""I Cried Like a Silly Boy"" is credited to Ted Thacker, who must be DeVotchKa's fellow Colorodoan who was in Baldo Rex and Veronica. The band performs this song in the mode of Caetano Veloso-versus-Chris Isaak on the set of an Elvis beach movie, and it's a swooner. The lone original composition, ""Curse Your Little Heart"", features irresistible thrash cowbell and seems designed to dare Calexico and the tango excursions of Tom Waits into a dark alley, right down to the guitar tone.  </p><p>
    From here things really take off: ""The Last Beat of My Heart"", is, I'll say it, a better listen than Siouxsie's original, featuring the most confident cavernous self-production that I've encountered since the Walkmen's debut. DeVotchKa owns this song, and grafts such elegant and tasteful wings onto its carcass that even secular humanists might be inspired to go on an epic quest for a subconscious, unicorn-plagued dreamworld beyond this realm of fiberglass and Goo Gone. This band must know how close to Hallmark they are prancing; few mortal passions could earn such sincere camp. Which is why, reckon, they offer the goofy Sinatra classic and then the antsy Velvet Undergound classic in an (almost comically) exotic manner that would drive Lou Dobbs bonkers-- DeVotchKa maintains a menacing deadpan.<br/></p></div>"|9117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9117-curse-your-little-heart-ep/|7.9|William Bowers

Compiled by Tim Robbins, who directed the movie, this collection of songs inspired by a rough cut of <em>Dead Man Walking</em>-- only a few of which were actually used in the film-- is an earnest look at the death penalty, a worthy and endlessly complex issue regardless of your feelings about it. However, even 11 years later, the songs sound surprisingly scattershot. Robbins chose the ""songwriters whose music tells stories, artists that do not write songs with hooks or tricks,"" he writes in the liner notes, but placing them all together only shows the strengths in some and the weaknesses in others.</p><p>
    Tom Waits contributes two very different tracks that tackle seemingly opposite sides of a crime: ""The Fall of Troy"" is a sad lament about a family broken by tragedy, one crime leading to many others; ""Walk Away"" is a sprint-paced tale of would-be robbers. The former is all slumped shoulders and weighted sighs: ""It's hard to say grace and sit in the place of someone missing at the table,"" Waits sings, as if summoning the strength for each next note. By contrast, ""Walk Away""-- propelled by hand claps and smoky reed instruments-- is agile and motional, speeding through details like ""William Ray shot Corabell Lee"" as if driving a getaway car. No other artist reaches this level of empathy-- Waits has the temerity to tell these tales, but the integrity to suggest he can't possibly know how such upheaval truly feels.</p><p>
    Johnny Cash probably does. His song ""In Your Mind"" has a breezy authority that makes capital punishment seem like a cosmic joke: ""Eternity is down the hall and you sit there bending spoons,"" he sings authoritatively. Sounding like the Texas cousin to Springsteen's <em>Nebraska</em>, Steve Earle's literal story-song ""Ellis Unit One"" makes death row sound like a nightmare to anyone who steps foot there, guards and prisoners alike. Suzanne Vega's ""Woman on the Tier (I'll See You Through)"" uses clattering beats to suggest the moral turmoil of those final minutes-- no rest for the weary or the wicked. </p><p>
    Too many of these well-meaning songs sound overly sanctimonious, with results that are too timid to assert a humane point about death and murder. Bruce Springsteen's title track sounds like a summary of crime and punishment rather than an invested story; Lyle Lovett's ""Promises"" is deadly dull; and Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""Dead Man Walking (A Dream Like This)"" portrays mortal fear with Hallmark card sentimentality. At the time of its original release, the soundtrack's most distinctive tracks were two duets between Eddie Vedder and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the late qawwali vocalist. But it's an awkward pairing: Vedder sounds like a tourist, and Ali Khan sounds entirely too large and transcendent for such a modest song.</p><p>
    At least Lovett redeems himself on the DVD, titled <em>""Not in Our Name"": Dead Man Walking-- The Concert</em>. Either playing alone on stage or with fellow Texan Earle, Lovett knows that first and foremost he's putting on a show, so he plays to the audience rather than to posterity. By contrast, Ani diFranco looks completely overwhelmed, and Vedder just looks blissfully stoned. For this they cut Waits and Michelle Shocked?

    If we're defining an album as a unified statement, a collection of songs grouped together to form a singular whole, <em>New Joc City</em> is a spectacular failure-- it's just a hit single and an assload of filler. I'm guessing Bad Boy didn't expect the single to take off, and when it happened, they slapped together everything this kid had recorded in order to get something into stores. The album has no hit producers, no guests more famous than ex-WB star Marques Houston, and no visible identity or purpose. All it has is one hit single.</p><p>
    But then, the single in question, ""It's Goin' Down"" is basically filler itself. Even by the minimal standards of snap music, it barely exists. It's just a clicking drumbeat, a maddeningly repetitive synth line, and a swaggery brag-rap from Joc. The main reason for the single's ubiquity is the dance Joc does in the video: He holds his arms out in front of him and pretends to rev a motorcycle while frantically jerking off to the side. On ""106 &amp; Park"", Tom Cruise managed a painfully inept version of said dance and lit up a million YouTube screens. At Hot 97's Summer Jam, thousands of kids revved their imaginary motorcycles while the Diplomats' Jim Jones, who had brought Joc onstage, looked on impassively. I haven't seen mobs of kids doing the motorcycle dance on the subway the way they did with the lean wit it, rock wit it, but maybe it's only a matter of time. You can't keep a good dance down.</p><p>
    The rest of the album barely merits comment. The beats are bargain-basement minimal snap stuff with none of the frantic energy of Dem Franchize Boyz or the sidelong melodicism of D4L: itchy synth blips on ""Patron"", staggeringly awful steel drums on ""Flip Flop"", soft-focus slow-jam guitars on ""1st Time"". Joc's persona is an attempt to capitalize on the T.I./Jeezy coke-rap trend; he raps a lot about dealing drugs, though he never shows any of the cavalier ease or the painstakingly detailed storytelling sense that sometimes makes those other rappers great. When he tries sneering nihilism, he's nowhere near convincing: ""Babies crying, niggas dying all over the place/ Your mama crying cause blood all over her face."" The last third of the album is given over to sex-jams, and that's where things really get laughable: ""I'ma keep going and going, the Energizer Bunny,"" ""She love to call me Tyson when I nibble on her ear."" If Bad Boy really expected to make any money off this album, they would've at least found Joc a decent ghostwriter.</p><p>
    The album has a couple of OK moments, like the tense and urgent windy beat on ""Dope Boy Magic"", which would've fit on the incomparably better Boyz N Da Hood album, or the blaring horns on ""Hear Me Coming"". But if you really need a copy of ""It's Goin' Down"" so you can better practice your motorcycle-dance in front of the mirror, well, the iTunes music store is a click away.<br/>

    Despite sylvan genuflections and hippy
    naturalism, the shaggy Alabama-born, Northern California-based core of
    Brightblack Morning Light are surprisingly redolent of Royal Trux. It's partially
    the Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema thrift style, tight ""best
    friend"" relationship, and the harmonizing between guitar-toting Nathan
    ""Nabob"" Shineywater and Rhodes-massaging Rachel ""Rabob"" Hughes. But
    also take stock of the slow-mo blues, languid guitarscapes, and druggy
    atmospherics: Instead of smack, it's peyote, and a scrubby squat's been
    replaced by a tent beneath the stars. The obvious
    non-Trux dealbreaker? Brightblack supports sundry environmental
    causes, including Friends of the Eel. Nope, can't imagine <em>Twin
    Infinitives</em>' ma and pa getting too into that.</p><p>
    The comparison's stretched so I can make a point: Despite
    the Quiet Quiet Ocean Spell festivals Brightblack curates and the
    Joanna Newsom and Devendra entries in their hand-sewn address book, the
    troupe's doing something very different than what's been shoved under
    the ""freak folk"" family tree. As in many cases, it's pretty obvious
    they're linked due to hair length and back story-- the ho-hum
    tangentials. Textually, Shineywater
    and Hughes' hobo dispatches border on farce. For instance, a letter
    accompanying the press release notes: ""Our mixed blood holds some
    American Indian somewhere, but we have no reservation to live."" When I
    was a kid, my father signed me up for this group called Indian Guides,
    which featured suburban fathers and sons pretending to go back to
    nature on the weekends. I haven't traced their blood lines, but somehow
    that sorta faux-poetic hokum stinks of that same ""going-native"" vibe.
    The lyrics feature some pretty images, but are basically tossed off
    variations on rainbows, rain, crystals, smoke, and rivers.</p><p>
    Thankfully,
    on Brightblack Morning Light's excellent second full-length, their first
    for Matador, it hardly matters what the band's saying. (There's a reason Slint invited them to play at All Tomorrow's Parties
    and Rachel Grimes of the Rachel's helps them out.) Prior to this collection, they released the
    Paul Oldham-produced 2004 debut, <em>Ala.Cali.Tucky</em> and a 2002 split 7""
    with Bonnie Prince Billy as Rainywood, none of which could have
    prepared us for the absolute depth of sound smeared across these 10
    tracks. It's all fleshed-out gorgeously by a cast of characters that
    includes Gojogo percussionist Elias Reitz, White Magic's Andy Macleod,
    ex-Zwan and A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin (also a touring
    member for post-Royal Trux crew, RTX-- see, my musings aren't so
    hair-brained), and magical vocal harmonizers Gail West and Ann McCrary,
    among others. The most spectacular ingredients? R&amp;B style flute,
    trombone, and clarinet. Big ups there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The pine-cone orchestra's recorded wonderfully by Thom Monahan, the ex-Monsterland rocker and Pernice
    Brother who also turned knobs for <em>Cripple Crow</em>. And like on certain albums by pre-Kinks Lilys or My Bloody Valentine, a
    single level's maintained for the duration. The word ""Hypnotic""'s overused, but
    the band's spatial know-how and rigorously muted flourishes are more than
    deserving of the accolade. It's well-deep, blossoming ambiance. The
    repetitions feel like minimalism, but it unfurls like the sleepiest
    loner psych.
    </p>
<p>
    With swirling Rhodes and wind-wraith vocals,
    opener ""Everybody Daylight"" is half-frozen rock that catches
    heat with a warm rhythm-and-blues ground cover. Percussion is a major
    ingredient of each track. Here, conga, acorn glave, and dry-wall trap
    kit are embellished with flute and gemstone guitars. These campfire
    songs will make you contort your face like Mick Jagger and nod your
    head in slow motion. The sound's so bottomless, when a flute starts up,
    it sounds like it's echoing from 12 trees deep into a grotto. 
    </p>
<p>
    Those
    exquisite repetitions curl into ""Friend of Time"", which feels like a
    harvest moon, seed capsules, and gourds shaking out textural beats.
    Cymbals catch air like a waterfall and a trombone moves over
    the looping, lapping backdrop and the male/female vocals.
    The brief, more upbeat instrumental ""Fry Bread"" shifts the pace a tad,
    before opening up to the most shimmering evidence of the band's
    compositional brilliance, the 10-minute ""Star Blanket River Child"". Hashier vocals and louder percussion stamp ""Black Feather Wishes
    Rise"";  ""A River Could Be Loved"", dedicated to those eel folks,
    showcases a stripped-down, piano-driven, guitar-free sound.
    </p>
<p>
    The first few weeks I listened to Brightblack
    Morning Light, I was working on a longish project: It nestled into the
    background like one perfect, melancholic deep-woods quilt. Listening more closely, the lullabies
    keep showing new angles while getting livelier and livelier. That
    sort of compositional ruggedness is a treat: Brightblack Morning Light
    offers a clear-cut differentiation between run-of-the-mill indie-rock
    bar bands hiding out in folksy wardrobes and those doing something
    nuanced and complex. Hell, not even a song called ""We Share Our Blanket
    With the Owl"" could fuck up this shape-shifting slumber party.

<em>Loose</em> is the best and worst
    pop album of the year, scattershot in every respect, crippling in its
    inconsistencies, and just a regular pain in the ass if you're the kind of
    person who values listening to albums all the way through. Which is basically
    nobody these days-- so <em>Loose</em> is great! Except when it's not. Its
    post-new wave/slink-funk/pseudo-reggaetón/drippy ballads template signifies a few things, but most especially that Nelly
    needed a hit badly.</p><p>
    After
    the failure of her second album, <em>Folklore</em>, an adventurous-if-sappy
    globo-handjob, Furtado's been paired with rhythmic savant Timbaland and his protégé
    Danja Handz for all but two songs on <em>Loose</em>. And they've already provided
    international hits with ""Promiscuous"" and ""Maneater"", two
    doses of buzzbeater bass and clomping hi-hats right out of Tim's standard
    playbook. The songs fit snugly into Tim's oeuvre, but not Furtado's, who's best
    known for ""I'm Like a Bird"" and the manic Tim-produced remix of Missy
    Elliott's ""Get Ur Freak On"". They sound unlike Furtado not because
    they're danceable or sexy-- her first two albums were those things-- but
    because they're <em>about</em> dancing and fucking.</p><p>
    It's hard to tell who is most responsible for the odd execution of this
    album, Timbaland, Interscope poobah Jimmy Iovine (as Pitchforker Julianne
    Shepherd has opined), or Furtado herself. But it's all over the place musically.
    The two singles come early and are surrounded by the album's other
    interesting songs, like the Madonna-aping swirler ""Glow"", which rises
    and falls under the swell of some stop-start keyboards. After ""Glow""
    is ""Showtime"", a midtempo ballad that comes so close to Aaliyah's
    understated grace, vocally and emotionally, it's terrifying. Hearing Furtado--
    usually a vocal berserker-- rein things in is gratifying for that moment, even
    when linked with Danja's Timbo4cheap production. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""No Hay Igual"", which has presumably been called reggaetón because
    it's sung in Spanish and isn't salsa, is an aerial assault. But it never wears
    down the listener and actually uses a few vocal change-ups, unlike the
    much-maligned genre it's been compared to. Directly after that, everything goes
    to hell. With a series of groan-worthy, poorly sung ballads mixed with far
    inferior grasps at pop, the album fades hard down the stretch. If
    ""Promiscuous"" is one of the fiercest songs of lust in recent memory,
    ""In God's Hands"" is one of the limpest. It sounds like Paula Cole on
    Paxil singing Rob Thomas' throwaways. ""Our love's floating up in the sky in
    heaven/ Where it began, back in God's hands"". That's the chorus. The Chris
    Martin-penned ""All Good Things (Come to an End)"" is less painful, but
    not by much. 
    </p>
<p>
    The strangest thing about <em>Loose</em> isn't its irregularity, but the simple
    fact that this doesn't sound like Nelly Furtado at all. Listening to her first
    two albums, Furtado developed a bizarre speed-slur in her hooks, one of the
    most unique singing styles in modern music. She digs melisma, but avoids showing
    off. It seemed like her voice just couldn't stop doing that bob-and-weave.
    Here, she coos and caws and crows, but she never lets, um, loose. Even the
    kinetic singles are sing-rapped or delivered in crisp turns. This makes for a
    very cold album, fatalistic in its sexiness but soporific in its
    soul-searching. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's been much made of Furtado's referencing of NBA MVP Steve Nash and
    the knowing nod to Hall &amp; Oates, but those are just pop-cult placeholders:
    Look! She's hip <em>and</em> Canadian! If anything, these feel like the most
    corporate moves on the record, a kowtowing to which Furtado never seemed to
    stoop. The only thing that speaks to the proposed offhandedness is the ghastly
    between-song banter between Furtado, her band, and Timbaland. Rather than the
    warm, strident girl that once sang, ""I don't want ambivalence no
    more"", the crush of sex and power and chart potential has got her
    chirping, ""Move your body around like a nympho."" It's not the worst
    outcome in the world, and as nearly all of Timbaland's music does, it makes you
    move. But maybe at the expense of a thoughtful songwriter.

    The London-based, Brazilian-born Cibelle turned to singing after an early acting career in commercials and on MTV Brazil, and she retains a dramatic polish in her sultry voice. After debuting on the late DJ Suba's <em>São Paulo Confessions</em> compilation, she released her loungey samba-pop debut in 2003 and followed it with an electronically tinged 2004 EP that prefigured the adventurous <em>The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves</em>. Working with producers Mike Lindsay, Apollo Nove, and former Air house-engineer Yann Arnaud-- as well as with a variety of covers (from Tom Waits to Caetano Veloso) and guest stars (from Devendra Banhart to Seu Jorge)-- Cibelle has crafted a sophisticated trilingual pop record, spinning twitchy electronics, American freak-folk, and Brazilian traditions into a glittering tableau. It actually has more in common with samba offshoots than first-order, rhythmically ostentatious samba: Samba-canção, a sort of soft and dreamy Brazilian tango; the finger-picked classical guitars and cool-jazzy sway of bossa nova; and the breezy plink of tropicalia all lay the foundation for Cibelle's stylish divagations.</p><p>
    The covers delight: Cibelle couches Waits's ""Green Grass"" in spooky twinkles of guitar, ice-blue arpeggios coalescing into a glassy lilt rounded out by tiny chimes. Waits' gruff drawl appears in the middle section, an earthy clod contrasting Cibelle's high, cold aether. Antonio Carlos Jobim's Portuguese-language ""Por Toda a Minha Vida"" is reborn as a torch-song simmering in a field of plosive bass tones and cool digital twitters. And her take on Caetano Veloso's exile lament ""London, London"" lightly swings from a tropical bounce to a vampy, busy-city crescendo; Banhart's guest turn is understated and suitably suave and naturalistic.</p><p>
    Most songs are embryonic at the outset, but Cibelle's stay that way by design. Listening to <em>The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves</em>, it's easy to imagine her sketching out ideas for full-bodied samba-based pop songs, then realizing how lovely the sketches were and deciding to develop their subtleties with sculpted electronics and creative cut'n'pasting instead of completing them in a more traditional sense. All the more radiant for their partial construction, Cibelle's songs are marked by a billowing drift, with pliant, meandering melodies and progressions that seem less linear than mutational, evolving toward realization by gradual degrees.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Mad Man Song"" features a guest appearance from Spleen, who's beat-boxed with CocoRosie; the song is constructed from the sounds of human voices and coffee accoutrements-- spoons, saucers, mugs-- establishing a deep and complex rhythmic field for the singer to riff on. On ""Instante de Dois"", svelte backwards-guitar loops lap at Cibelle's voice like a river at its banks, placid and abstract. ""Phoenix"" gathers gentle, glitchy force as clicky percussion snaps like scissors and watery chimes waver. The ticking ""City People"" is a weird little contraption with lots of tiny moving parts, a rich and organic first half moving toward a breezy swagger with big, squelchy downbeats in the second, and on ""Minha Neguinha"", folksy guitar, rattling percussion, and the trill of swelling keys comprise an edifice from which Cibelle's voice takes flight again and again, gracefully trailing feathers.<br/>

    Henry Barnes is enough of a misfit that, according to him anyway, his one-night stand in Brooklyn last August was his first time in New York City.<span> </span>Taking the stage, he was a big man with a hermit’s wild grey beard and burnt-out eyes, who, when audible, spoke with a gentle, high-pitched voice-- mostly against the war.<span> </span>His performance was a disaster: handmade instruments, toys, and noiseboxes broke, or didn’t; all anyone could hear was furious, high-pitched squealing.<span> </span>By the time he and his cohort had finished, they’d pretty much cleared the loft, banishing formerly bright-eyed kids back to their PBR on the porch outside.<span> </span>If there was ever a left-coast soul who didn’t belong in New York’s city limits, it was this dude.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Barnes builds instruments for a living in Claremont, Calif., and Amps for Christ grew in part out of his lifelong interest in electronics and vintage gear.<span> </span>That he played in two of the most depressive acts of the last decade-- Man Is the Bastard and Bastard Noise-- might’ve helped spawn AFC as well: nothing like twee Scottish dirges to counteract a deep hatred of the species.<span> </span>As artfully weird as those two bands, Amps for Christ lasted by diversifying where Barnes' old bands had zoned into one-track, obsessive cultivation of a very singular and brooding sound-- AFC’s own only constant, over the past 10 years, has been Barnes’ handcrafted sound.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Not to say that Amps for Christ weren’t a great noise band-- <em>Thorny Path</em>-era in particular, they were-- and though they do it less and less, still are.<span> </span>Bastard dudes Nelson and Wood are still around, for one thing, and guest on “I Hate This Dumpster”, which is less BN cold and more deeply wooden, vacuum-tube scree-- beneath the power‘tronics, Barnes’ tubes bump low and even tones, to keep the fire lit.<span> </span>Later Hartford, of Noise Nomads, does his best Eric Wood <em>impression</em> on “The Crossing”, bellowing and howling like the master himself, down to the signature sound of thunderclaps and static.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But Amps for Christ are mostly great cuz, though the instruments don’t always work, they’re formally masterful.<span> </span>At this point you could compile a best-of comprised entirely of fuzzy paeans to Scotland, just from the last three albums-- let's say the two versions of “Scotland the Brave” and “She’s With Me” from <em>The Oak in the Ashes</em>, the two takes of “Old Lang Syne” and “Prince Charlie Stuart” from <em>The People At Large</em>, and now yet another “Scotland the Brave”, plus “Sweet Dove”, from <em>Every Eleven Seconds</em>-- or one, equally rich, of the sitaresque Eastern stuff.<span> </span>The spoken word (the new one contains the usual three-or-so poems) well, that’s for cultists, completists, and people who can vibe to Barnes’ high-toned, old-man voice and beat poetics. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Every Eleven Seconds</em> is, for neither better nor worse, the most dark and downtrodden of the last three-- more noise, less vocals, less tracks-- and this probably relates to Barnes’ well-documented horror with our President and his various wars, real and imagined.<span> </span>But <em>Eleven Seconds </em>also has moments as incandescent and joyful as parting clouds.<span> </span>“Cock o’ the North” is another beautiful line-dancing hobbit song, all flowing skirts, springtime, and hay; the track leads perfectly into the more broken-down, shaken balladry of “Out on the Moon”.<span> </span>Vintage AFC, it’s just guys with beards on the porch in the afternoon, getting slowly drunk, mad, and profound.

    Amanda and Joe Ziemba are committed: At the
    indie rock level, quitting your day job to focus on music fulltime is as
    financially risky as it gets, but the couple sold their house to do just that
    a few years ago. The stress of creating art to make money for room and board must be almost unbearable, but, under these circumstances, the Like Young have become a better band.</p><p>
<em>Last Secrets</em> is their third album as a duo (they married
    while playing together in Wolfie), and it's easily the most robust. The songs
    are longer and more developed, the sound is tougher, and the musicianship has
    solidified substantially. Such are the benefits of tons of touring, including
    stints with fellow married duos Mates of State and Viva Voce.</p><p>
    About the only thing holding the Like Young back at this point is
    a lack of memorable melodies. While they've become great at layering and vocal
    interplay-- at times, this album sounds like the work of six people-- hooks are still elusive
    in their songs. ""Some Closure"" has a great chugging rhythm section, well-placed
    organ, and an interesting ambient reprise of the album's lonely organ intro ""The
    Hell with This Whole Affair"", but I can't remember a thing about what those
    nice two-part harmonies were doing on the chorus-- even after a dozen
    spins.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Dead Eyes"" does quite a bit better, crafting a brief, spiky
    synth-pop song around Amanda's spunky multi-tracked voice. The thing is that
    Joe, when singing opposite her, will often set up her more melodic vocal part
    with a gritty shout that doesn't have the same hooky contours. He can sing just
    fine-- as quieter moments, such as the odd proggy coda
    of ""Obviously Desperate"", bear this out-- but when he barks over the louder bits
    it doesn't come off as well.
    </p>
<p>
    The Like Young keep getting better by degrees, but while <em>Last Secrets</em> shows off some new
    strengths, there's still room to grow compositionally. The band's longtime
    devotees will find plenty to love here, but the album isn't memorable enough to make
    its way into most people's heavy rotation.

    The cover of<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> Dedication 2</span><span> shows Lil Wayne, eyes closed, the words ""Fear God"" inked on his lids. Take
    it as a particularly gruesome example of the repentant gangster cliché, or, considering
    Wayne christens himself ""The God"" just minutes into this mixtape, a
    blasphemous warning. Self-deification is nothing new in hip-hop, but-- whether </span><span>Rakim Allah's humble
    expression or Jayhova's hyperbolic swagger-- </span><span>it tends to be
    a New York thing. So New Orleans' Lil' Wayne not only proclaiming god status but ""best
    rapper alive""-- instead of merely ""King of the South""-- is significant both for his
    rebuke of the prevalent trapper-before-rapper conceit of his Southern peers and
    his direct challenge to the NYC lyrical throne. Just a few years ago, Wayne
    making these claims would have been laughable, but with each significant release,
    he's proving himself to be the most imminent eminence post Jay-Z.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In his praise of Wayne's performance on ""The Tonight Show"" <em><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span></em><span>earlier this year, Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester wrote, ""it's one
    of those black-and-white-to-technicolor moments after which, if you still don't
    believe in Wayne, you're just lying to yourself""; </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dedication 2 </span><span>is the aural equivalent. More than anything Wayne's done, it's evidence of his virtuosity as a rapper and MC, showman and
    lyricist. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tha Carter II</span><span> was one
    of last year's best hip-hop albums, but its clean lines hemmed Wayne. He crafted too
    much, measured his movements instead of letting fly, as he
    does here.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>The track that will convert most naysayers, ""Georgia
    Bush"", borrows the instrumental from <em>Disturbing Tha Peace</em>'s state-repping anthem; Wayne adds one word to the hook and
    transforms the hoedown into a stinging protest. But, never one to eschew form
    for function, he mocks the styles of the original song's participants, Ludacris
    and Field Mob. It is, at once, a vicious uppercut at the U.S. president, the media,
    New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, racism, neglect, an embrace of his city and its populace, and a
    fearsome display of skill and intelligence. ""So what happened to the levees/ Why
    wasn't they steady?/ Why wasn't they able to control this?/ I know some folk that
    live by the levee that keep on tellin' me they heard some explosions/ Same shit
    happened back with Hurricane Betsy 1965/ I ain't too young to know this/ That was
    President Johnson/ This is President [Georgia] Bush,"" Wayne raps in breathless
    double-time, folding history, conspiracy, anger, and confusion over each other
    with style and venom</span>.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Does this one song, at the end of a mixtape, justify the
    sex, drugs, and violence of nearly every other? It doesn't mean to. It only
    makes the thoughts, emotions, and motivations behind his more objectionable
    lyrics more explicit and literal, but it's not as
    if the same conclusions cannot be drawn from his other material. Wayne is no
    fool; he's built a mountainous persona of myth and some truth and coerces the
    listener to burrow into it through the tiny holes he's left in the façade.
    Whether you choose to dig is up to you, but Wayne is just beginning his ascent.
    He is 23 years old, 11 years in, and working on a level most need more time to
    reach. His confidence and charisma overwhelms, and on this mixtape
    he's doing more than wresting beats from contemporaries-- he's invading their
    songs and conquering their styles and cadences. Rick Ross, Dem Franchize Boyz,
    Three 6 Mafia: Wayne's merciless, claiming Southern anthems for himself and
    spitting Northern verses over them.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For his part, DJ Drama provides another example of why he's
    killing the mixtape game right now. Whether he's putting Pharrell over Wu-Tang
    or Little Brother over Pharrell, Drama is a magician. What might look like a
    dullard's handful from the top 10 is actually a platform for Wayne and a notable departure from the first <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dedication</span><span>'s East Coast larceny and </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tha Carter II</span><span>'s ambiguous production. ""Poppin' My Collar"", ""What
    You Know"", ""Kryptonite,""<span>
</span>""Hustlin'"", and ""I Think They Like Me"" all get the royal treatment, and
    it's exhilarating to hear Wayne bring his best to these regional-gone-national
    hits.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Much has been made of Lil' Wayne's growth from album to
    mixtape to album and so forth, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dedication 2 </span><span>is no exception. He seems more ambitious, and more capable of
    fulfilling ambitions with every release. Wayne clearly believes he's the ""best
    rapper alive."" What remains to be seen is whether he can convince the rest of
    us.</span>

<em><font color=""#001001""><font face=""verdana,arial,san-serif"">H</font></font>allelujah Sirens</em>, a record that begins with things that won’t last-- a rising sun, a couple in a car, love-- gets to its close in a hurry: By the second track, the sun has set, the trip has ended, and the narrator’s alone. Later, the girl who looked beautiful in her summer dress will leave; at night, they’ll fight some more, and she’ll leave again; they’ll both take long drives and feel lousy and nostalgic under the stars but euphoric when the sun rises again.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Dirty on Purpose create their moments out of little contradictions, in which hearts break to “Shiny Happy People” and the builds end up with guest vocalist Jaymay doing “Heart of Glass” instead of “Cattle and Cane”-- these things help them. Were they happy, they’d be insufferable; were they always as dark as the roads they travel, they wouldn’t have the will to make it through even one song. Their daytime-nighttime, on-off cycles sustain neither highs nor lows: They are as giddy and occasionally deadening as their subject matter.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    “Marfa Lights”, the best song on <em>Hallelujah Sirens</em>, is about flickering, colorful ghost lights in Texas, proved by skeptics to be generic automobile taillights from the nearby U.S. 67. In the song, the four bandmates chase the mystery lights off course and into the cold desert, while the guitars move from slow-motion delay to a grindingly bright, headlong four chords. On their other “light” song, single “Light Pollution”, they head out of town yet again but don’t get anywhere. The worst track here, they take the thinnest build you could find-- somebody banging on a snare-drum, basically-- and issue commands (“Take the long way home”) as if people wanted to be told what to do that late in the evening. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It’s worth nothing that Dirty on Purpose come from Brooklyn, a place not known for appreciating a straightforward, genuine narrative or unadulterated hook-- where, for instance, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to assassinate their ironclad brand with a few acoustic guitar strums and a little harmony. You’d never know from all the talk of seasons and driving that Dirty on Purpose live in a city with little of either. One song, “Car No Driver”, starts like Jawbreaker’s “Kiss the Bottle” (another song about love getting ruined at nighttime and then getting the fuck out of town by the morning), then makes all the driving into a metaphor for growing up and not quite knowing what you’re about. You break down, the car breaks down: It’s the most, er, Williamsburg moment on <em>Sirens</em>-- feeling young and passed-by. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But that’s not the story here (except, maybe, only the young-and-passed-by get this melodramatic when the clock strikes 4 a.m. in Texas). Blurry, constantly in motion, Dirty on Purpose look to make sense of whatever drama that can be found in between coming down in the morning and waking up to it.

By its 1967 debut, the Red Krayola had already mastered the formula for faultless out-rock: free jazz, locked grooves, psychedelic pop blips, and a sense of humor somewhere between Burroughs and Borscht Belt. Listeners weren't sure whether the racket was the result of sharp intellectualism, sheer incompetence, or buzzed-out substance abuse. As a result, Thompson and his cohorts were typecast as avant-garde experts who spit out stacks of difficult song cycles. The myths piled up: Texan teenagers threw fast food at the band in shopping malls, John Fahey's promoters paid Thompson to stop performing, and amplified frequencies caused a dog to lose its mind. The Krayola became synonymous with strange-for-its-own-sake abstruseness and earned a reputation as a group that was easy to like but difficult to follow.</p><p>
<em>Introduction</em> is being hailed as the Krayola's most accessible album to date, but that's backhanded praise. As 2004's excellent <em>Singles 1968-2002</em> demonstrated, Thompson tends to wear his early rock influences on his sleeve. Growing up as a Houston arts student, he developed a distinctly American repertoire, referencing 1970s honky-tonk, piano blues, fried folk, and cabaret. By the time he was producing the Raincoats and the Fall, his music presaged-- and commented upon-- everything from synth rock to hair metal. Thompson's best songs are uncommercial responses to huge catalogs of commercial music. Despite its pronouncement of new beginnings, <em>Introduction</em> doesn't deviate from that tradition.</p><p>
    Coming after the tepid psych bursts and put-the-opium-down theremin of 2004's <em>Japan in Paris in L.A.</em>, the new album is Top of the Pops material, revealing that Thompson is virtually unrivalled as an unkempt chronicler of pop history (only Zappa and Van Dyke Parks come to mind). Observe ""Breakout"", a rendition of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken?"" which quietly connects Appalachian sashays and zydeco squeals. Thompson, a personable Pasadena professor, lectures on Leibniz, dialectical materialism, and ""electrical surrealism"", but his voice is far too conversational to seem pretentious. Other songs riff on the Indochina Wars and German Idealism, Chechnya and Israel, remote viewing and OPEC.
    </p><p>
    If these are gimmicks, they're effective ones, and Thompson's performance is memorably excessive. The lyrics are profound in their blunt dumbness: ""Things come/ There's nothing sometimes"" or ""There are questions and opinions/ About what anyone can do/ About the situation here"". Stylistically, the Krayola is typically diverse, unloading spazz-rock contractions over piano-bar lounge. But the most impressive tunes are the ones with minimal genre splicing. ""Greasy Street"" is anchored by raspy blues grit and ""Elegy"" spins coiled strums around faint harpsichord hums. The centerpiece of the album may be ""Vexations"", in which Thompson seeks euphoria while a bunch of guilty guitars wander around reluctantly, dragging their strings behind them. Overall, <em>Introduction</em> is less a primer on the Krayola's recent past than a return to Thompson's mid-70s work, without the blemished production. He sounds reinvigorated and flexible, open to far too many ideas for a 50-minute album. There's a fair share of undeveloped sequences and meandering noodling, but that's the price you pay for the effortless pop collages. It's a testament to Thompson's durable legacy that those flaws are merely quirks and that they sometimes feel more necessary than the songs themselves.

    I'm admittedly perplexed as to the meaning of the title of South's third album. Are the adventures in the underground themselves journeying to the stars, or has an important comma simply gone missing? Anyway, based on the sound effects at the beginning of album opener ""Shallow"", the Underground in question is London's subway system, and if ""A Place in Displacement"" is any indication, the stars are New Order.</p><p>
    ""A Place"" is a near-perfect distillation of the <em>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</em> aesthetic-- vocalist James Cadbury even sounds like Bernard Sumner on the chorus. Derivative though it may be, it's a hell of a song, one of several standouts on the album. The fact that there are several standouts is important, because South's previous records have seemed more like a cohesive mass of sound.</p><p>
    Part of this relative eclecticism may stem from the fact that, after working with James Lavelle and Dave Eringa, respectively, on their first two albums, South produced this themselves with an occasional assist from Eringa. Their penchant for exploring texture is well-established (it was established a little too well on their debut), and it seems that being at the boards gave them more opportunity to roam, while also forcing them to closely scrutinize their work. The result is more dynamic structures, more tempo changes (often within songs), and an enjoyable album that's strangely slightly less satisfying than their last one, <em>With the Tides</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The reason for this may simply be the songwriting, which is good but only distinctive in patches. ""Shallow"" works more on the strength of its production and constantly shifting drum grooves than the melody itself, which is merely serviceable. ""You Are One"" has a chorus that feels like it's part of a different song from the verse, while the interesting backing vocals on ""Safety in Numbers"" swallow the lead instead of complementing it. But there's also ""Up Close &amp; Personal"", which makes the most of its bipolar path through verses that alternate between quiet strumming and big harmonies borne on drums and glockenspiel.
    </p>
<p>
    Overall, South are in roughly the same place they've always been, making good post-Britpop music that sounds fantastic and sometimes erupts in a moment of unadulterated brilliance. They're still figuring out how to harness those moments and make them really last. We'll be in for a treat if they ever do.

But in 2K6, mixtapes reign supreme, and rock's curiosity-stirring, gluttonous-musical-appetite-sating answer can only be the slipshod remixes and rarities comp. The shoe fits here, rest assured, but amid geysers of thinkpieces praising Papoose's prolificacy and Purple City's anti-establishment ethos, 40 minutes of odds'n'sods from Austin's little-heard Single Frame seems somehow more acceptable.</p><p>
    Of course, rap tapes are all economics-- dudes circumventing their labels' highway robbery by selling out of trunks and pocketing quick, untaxed bucks. Rock bands' compilations of<br/>
    remixes/demos/B-sides/covers? Not so much. Million-selling DJ Drama's ""fuck you"" is Volcom Entertainment's ""fuck us,"" really, because (let's be real) no one gives a shit. Typically, 99 out of a 100 are built around a couple of album-caliber castaways the band can't find a home for elsewhere; the rest is filler or worse.</p><p>
    Content to commingle its wheat with its chaff, <em>Everything Wants to Be...</em> constitutes no appreciable challenge to that status quo. Full-stacked gutterpunk greyhound race ""Taken For a Walk (Unreleased Dimeshot)"" combats suburban ennui right alongside the flimsier, quasi-industrial ""Silver Crime Lining (Abandoned Demo)"". Then, like a surly goth kid sheepishly phoning in his second middle school bomb threat, ""Exact Copy (Witch Dr. Remix)"" does the industrial thing again, this time atop a chord progression totally stolen from <em>Doom II</em>.
    </p><p>
    ""Floral Design in a Straight Line"" was the first song I ever heard from these guys, and it remains their most exciting moment. But J-Mprint's remix treads with caution, opting for a bland, vocal-free continuation instead of blowing the thing open. An acousticized ""Post Daydream (First Day Demo)"", meanwhile, sacrifices the explosive album version's quarter-life-crisis emotional depletion (""Reality sticks and your dreams fade away,"" ""The people are deceitful and mean,"" ""You're 23 today, happy birthday,"" etc.) for bedroom tears. There's a Nick Zinner remix of ""People Are Germs"", which thoughtlessly weds garbled zombie moans to a grimy trance beat. And then (lo!) there's this collection's one truly awesome song. Sounding like a realist M83, ""Digital Witness (Protection Remix)"" smears Belong's dewey guitar drone over a crouton of SOP house thumps and cathected vocals (""Nothing to say/ Nowhere to be/ This time""). I mean, yeah, we can go on about the disappointment inherent to ""these things,"" but does a good song ever really need an excuse to be heard?

Rock (said the punks) had gotten too pompous and expensive, and the best solution they could come up with was to rewind-- this is why they borrowed fashion tips from 1950s greasers, guitar licks from Chuck Berry, and three-chord song structures from back when <em>all</em> rock struck people as cheap and loud. Part of this weird Maoist purge involved a strict prohibition on ambitious production-- you know, any fancy plans for how music could actually <em>sound</em>. “Production aesthetics” were exactly the kind of crap Pink Floyd were interested in: Out the window it went.</p><p>
    Thing is, you can only glory in destruction for so long before it’s time to rebuild; you rip it up and <em>start again</em>. We always talk about how musicians started again with post-punk and new wave; we talk less about how their producers got to do the same. Plenty of the producers who cut their teeth on punk went on to share in that rebuilding, and these days it’s easy to miss the work they did; we take it for granted that what they built would be, well, the 1980s. But it’s worth singling out Martin “Zero” Hannett-- producer, musician, and co-founder of Factory Records-- as one of the more interesting architects of what rock could sound like next.</p><p>
<em>Zero</em> is the third and longest compilation showcasing Hannett’s work, with 21 tracks stretching from 1977 to his death in 1991. For a sense of the guy’s signature aesthetic, though, skip straight to Joy Division’s “Transmission”, and listen very carefully. Hannett, like many post-punk producers, was influenced by dub and interested in space, and you can hear it in the first 15 seconds. There’s a soft synthesizer hum, just marking out the size of the room. When the drums come in, they pop crisp and clean, like machines, but each individual piece is given a system of echo and reverb; the floor toms thump ominously far to the left and right. By the song’s end, we feel like the band’s reaching incredible levels of nervy energy, but half of it is just Hannett: That synth hum has expanded to fill more and more space, it’s been joined by an insistent one-note plink, and the guitar chords have been stretched and blurred until the whole thing’s a drone. If Ian Curtis sounds trapped and paranoid, it’s because he has to bark harder and louder just to fight through the mix.
    </p><p>
    It’s that sound-- dark, full of space, clean to the point of sterility, vaguely mechanical-- that Hannett’s most remembered for, and we get plenty of it here: It’s in an early New Order track, where the synthesizers Hannett pushed on Joy Division find their payoff, and it hits a peak with Section 25’s bitter, insistent “Friendly Fires”. This is the Factory Records sound, and it’s part of what makes this anthology possible at all: Hannett’s as integral to the sound of post-punk as Phil Spector is to the sound of girl groups, and plenty of these songs make fine compilation-mates even without bringing Hannett into the picture.
    </p>
<p>
    Less often noted, though, is Hannett’s role in pushing new wave into existence. You can almost sense it in the first-wave punk that starts the disc: His treatment of the Buzzcocks’ “Boredom” leans toward clean, crisp, orderly pop, and he even finishes it off with a neat echoing flourish, as if he were itching all along to be allowed to do something interesting. He can’t make Slaughter and the Dogs sound good-- that would take a bigger genius than this world knows-- but the tracks that follow edge along toward new-wave’s shine and novelty: Jilted John’s bratty self-titled single, John Cooper Clarke’s oddball strut, or the sunny bounce of Hannett’s own band, Invisible Girls. That streak gets its payoff later, too, with a chart-smash new wave classic: the Psychedelic Furs’ “Pretty in Pink”.
    </p>
<p>
    Other acts seem to get particular benefit from Hannett’s treatment. Back when U2 were just scrappy contemporaries of Joy Division and the Bunnymen, the Edge made up for his guitar-playing deficiencies with excellent use of delay and echo; he and Hannett develop some of those trademark chiming tones while Bono goes on about hearing children cry. The Durutti Column’s Vini Reilly, another delay-pedal enthusiast, gets every drop of warmth eked out of his guitar. After pushing technology on punks who wanted the past, not the future, Hannett got to record OMD: “Electricity” comes from 1980, before synth-pop became “synth-pop,” and the guys-in-a-room-playing-keyboards presentation is so pure and spot-on that it’s aged better than almost anything else here. Just as canny is a 1990 pairing with Kitchens of Distinction, who would counter the boyish inarticulance of shoegazing with an eloquent, upscale maturity.
    </p>
<p>
    As a collection of Hannett’s work, it’s hard to ask for too much more here: These songs are full of lively sonics, and the liners give a good sense of Hannett’s own story. (He had all of the mad-genius qualities people love in producers; he was weird, fussy, difficult to work with; he did lots of drugs and one point weighed a staggering amount; he was played by Gollum in a major motion picture.) The truth, though, is that most of that brilliant production will be lost on today’s ears-- even when we don’t take it for granted, our sense of sonic possibilities, and the sounds we get from today’s high-tech auteurs, make Hannett’s advances seem indescribably subtle. (When punk has thrown production out the window, it’s a feat just to get it back in the room, let alone blow minds with it.) And for those without a particular interest in such things-- I do not kid myself that production techniques are foremost on that many people’s minds-- this will remain just a fair-to-middling collection of songs, as is probably the inevitable fate of any compilation featuring World of Twist.<br/>

Skream's 'Request Line"", fluttery and propulsive, was the sub-genre's most enchanting love letter to grime yet. Pitch's ""Qawalli"" went in the other direction, its distant low-end tribal thud and ghostly shards of accordion rejecting rigor mortis futurism in favour of necromantic fluidity. And then there's Burial, whose music is somewhere between these two poles, and also somewhere else entirely.</p><p>
    The most immediately striking aspect of this heretofore unknown producer's eponymous debut is that its beats are reminiscent of ""proper"" 2-step's frisky agility; except Burial's rhythms are nervous not joyous, their fleet-footed insubstantiality evoking the fear and dread of dubstep. It's not the delectably programmed beats that stick in your head, however-- else Burial would simply be Horsepower Productions redux. Instead, the success of this music lies almost entirely in its unexpected and unabashed emotionalism. Above the edgy beats hover layers of lugubrious synths, passing over one another like successive waves of blue and purple rainclouds. (The beatless ""Night Bus"" actually samples rainfall to heighten the effect.) Combined with its tense, busy rhythmic arrangements, the effect is reminiscent of the more cinematic late-90s techstep of Hidden Agenda or Dom &amp; Roland.</p><p>
    Burial also sporadically resurrects the 2-step practice of sampling and fucking with female vocalists: On album opener ""Distant Lights"", a bleated ""Now that I meet you..."" drifts from the swirl like Brandy caught on the other side of the looking glass. This is Burial's best trump card: The handful of tracks with sampled vocals stand well above their brethren, possessing an almost manipulative quality of quivering emotional directness. Far from speaking of final resting places, the overriding vibe is one of homelessness and rootlessness, and the nagging feeling that something important has been mislaid. Thematically and sonically, the closest reference point is Tricky's eerie, foreboding ""Broken Homes"" (ironically, Burial's own ""Broken Home"" is perhaps the album's most upbeat moment, sampling a winsome reggae crooner); I'm also reminded of the black eyeliner melodrama of parts of DJ Shadow's <em>The Private Press</em>. Some may scoff at such middlebrow reference points, but it's these resemblances, rather than any fidelity to inner-London dance music, which makes Burial's music such a viable crossover candidate. </p><p>
    If anything, <em>Burial</em> is weakest when he conforms to the undemonstrative grimness of dubstep proper: The Spartan, assymetrical groove of ""Spaceape"" (featuring the MC of the same name) might sound impressively muscular over a soundsystem, but it's also the album's only genuinely unlikeable moment, and some otherwise interesting tracks such as the brooding ""Southern Comfort"" are dragged down by an air of tight-eyed stiffness, as if afraid of the open expressiveness which the album's highlights revel in. More generally, what prevents <em>Burial</em> from being quite as spectacular as its strongest moments promise is simply its inconsistency-- what we have here is a brilliant EP padded out with sketches and noble failures.</p><p>
    For the future, Burial would do well to concentrate on deploying these amassed secret weapons simultaneously, as he does on the astonishing ""You Hurt Me"", where a spiralling 2-step rhythm, foreboding Middle-Eastern drones, a disembodied diva plaintively moaning the title and a too-fleeting but essential sampled ""Drop!"" coalesce into a groove that's unnerving, mournful, and compulsively physical. Shepherding together so many familiar musical impulses, it's how Burial spins them into webs of torturous beauty that can make this music so compelling.<br/></p></div>"|9138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9138-burial/|8.0|Tim Finney

Presentation is now an essential part of the package-- apparently we need more theatrics, more mascara, and more ""Brecht-punk."" But if turning teen angst into class-A artifice is the name of the game, then the pAper chAse are in the accelerated class. Maybe dead playwrights do direct the Dresden Dolls, but the pAper chAse look to Eli Roth for inspiration. Their personal demons are actual demons. Their broken relationships are literally a matter of life and death.</p><p>
    If you thought them too indulgent and inward-looking before, this record is by no means a concession. The pAper chAse once reached for a faux-gothic atmosphere, mostly materialized by singer/principal songwriter/engineer John Congleton, to elevate their overwrought emo-pop. On <em>Now You Are One of Us</em>, those affectations have swallowed Congleton whole, and the melodies are ground out on guitars and detuned pianos like they're lucky to get out alive. It's so gleefully over-the-top that even the most absurd and token-tortured lyrics neatly circumvent being taken at face value. The only course of action left is to listen to the songs, and maybe pop some popcorn.</p><p>
    And if you're not buying any of that (hey, no hard feelings), know that <em>Now You Are One of Us</em> is relentlessly hooky. A little open space and a lot of ghostly wailing builds to something suspenseful on ""Wait Until I Get My Hands on You"", and ""You Will Never Take Me Alive"" is ""Eleanor Rigby"" sung by Charles Manson. The guitars are sparser but twice as effective, twisting over songs like ""The Kids Will Grow Up to Be Assholes"" as if they're impaled on a spike. Congleton wails through water-damaged microphones over splintered rhythms about (what else) women, pain, a bearhug from an armless brother, slow comfy screwing, and, like, ghosts and shit.</p><p>
    ""At the End of the Leash"" ends with one telling line: ""I'll spend 40 more years moving the thermostat around."" It could mean another half-feasible specter chilling Congleton's house, or maybe an apt detail of perpetual loneliness and boredom. It doesn't need to be sung three times, but it is, and it's nearly the perfect summation of the record: surprisingly evocative and delivered with a total, delectable lack of restraint.<br/></p></div>"|9036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9036-now-you-are-one-of-us/|7.7|Jason Crock

    Please, please, please: No mistaking precocious sister act Smoosh for notorious twin duo Prussian Blue. It's easy enough-- what, with both pairs resembling Hanson minus its manliest member.  But neo-Nazis these girls aren't. Where 13-year-olds Lynx and Lamb allude to Rudolph Hess as a ""man of peace"" and wear tees emblazoned with matching Hitler smileys, Smoosh-- similarly blonde sisters Chloe and Asya, 12 and 14 respectively-- eschew white supremacist agendas to instead preach the gospel of nothing in particular: They write 100% of their songs, and their subject matter spans a spectrum of puppy love, vicarious insecurity, and purposely vague pop-song claptrap.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
    Pre-teen at the time of their much-buzzed-about 2004 debut<em> She Like Electric</em>, Smoosh were rooted on by, among others, Cat Power, Eddie Vedder, and Chloe's drum teacher Jason McGerr of Death Cab for Cutie. The live show is reportedly a thing of pure joy: Here's where leggy blonde fountains of youth show up men and moody singer-songwriting chicks two and three times older. Chloe and Asya are in music-- they've said in countless interviews-- for the sheer fun of it, and the sincerity shows.
    </div>
<div>
     
    </div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<span>Asya's roughly the age of Hilary Duff-circa-""Lizzie McGuire""-- old enough to have her heart shattered by Aaron Carter, too old to croon <em>Kidz Bop</em> Modest Mouse covers. <em>She Like Electric</em> is a grab bag of styles and ultimately missteps (e.g., Asya rapping), but bull's-eyes include supremely catchy indie pop ditties pertaining to boy hairdos like ""But Now I Know"". <em>Free To Stay</em>, for the most part-- and most successfully-- sticks to inlaid heartachey piano strains transmitting delight and distress, in that order.</span>
</div>
<div>
     
    </div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
    There are shortcomings: ""Rock Song"" and ""Organ Talk"" are as irksome as <em>She Like Electric</em>'s more exasperating trial-errors; Asya frequently gets carried away with ""ohhhhs"" and ""whoaaas."" <em>Free to Stay</em>'s main difficulty is that songs aren't packaged like they should be.  Catchy as they are (or aspire to be), they still don't stick-- unfurling sometimes sloppily out of perfect pop shells.
    </div>
<div>
     
    </div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
    When Smoosh are good, though, they're really good. Even the second time around, Asya's voice surprises. It's tremulous and poignant as usual, if a little deeper nowadays. On slowed-down sad song ""Waiting for Something"", Asya sounds sweet, even near tears, sighing, ""I don't know why I do these things/ I always regret them/ In the end."" This both is and isn't kid stuff: Whatever lyrical deficiencies exist aren't just pardonable, they're more valuable than ""Alright already we'll all float on OK""-- that is to say, grown-up turns of phrase from the mouths of babes. And even if the girls are parroting adult themes, at least <em>they're </em>the ones doing the parroting.

    It's not uncommon for a has-been band to reunite without its original frontman (Doors of the 21<sup>st</sup> century), not even when that frontman is still alive (Creedence Clearwater Revisited, <em>No Talking Just Head</em>). Sure, reunion tours rarely follow a few years after the death of the band's other, equally integral vocalist, but everybody's gotta put food on the table, right? So while the Cars' latest incarnation-- which follows the passing of former co-leader Benjamin Orr-- doesn't break ground for nostalgia-vendor shamelessness, the mostly live jawn <em>It's Alive</em> is still an unusual project with sadly predictable results.</p><p>
    Rock'n'roll rehashes make strange bedfellows. New Cars vocalist and venerable pop/rock eccentric Todd Rundgren was making arena fare both alone and with his band Utopia when the original Cars rose to jittery, synth-spiked prominence in the late 1970s and early 80s. So it's not like New Cars' old Cars holdovers Elliot Easton (guitar) and Greg Hawkes (keyboards) are pulling a Fuel and signing up some ""American Idol"" also-ran. Rundgren, knowing his role as a hired gun, neatly adopts Ric Ocasek's hiccuping delivery, and his longtime collaborators Kasim Sulton and Praire Prince show up for bass and drums, respectively.</p><p>
    The first hour or so of <em>It's Alive</em> is perfect for Cars fans so diehard they'd not only pay for a live album of songs they mostly already own, but a live album 20 years after the fact with only two original members and a different lead singer. The New Cars have no time to waste on showmanlike build-up, opening with a straightforward ""Just What I Needed"" before cruising through some other hits: ""Candy-O"" with particularly candied-up guitar wanks, ""Good Times Roll"" with its ""Good Day Sunshine""-ripping hook, and ""Moving in Stereo"" for those of you who haven't seen <em>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</em>. Yes, ""My Best Friend's Girl"" and ""You're All I've Got Tonight"", too. But there's something unsavory about the false-innocent backing harmonies-- think Mike Love's Beach Boys.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a form of live-band karaoke, sure, but the setlist isn't all stage-worthy, let alone ""Idol""-able. Rundgren also contributes two of his own compositions. He Tom Joneses daftly through 1972 soft-rocker ""I Saw the Light"", while Nazz nugget ""Open My Eyes"" still isn't as good as the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" no matter how hard it cops the riff (plus, this version is sadly lacking in the original's wah-wah psychedelia). Meanwhile, on 1980s supermodel ballad ""Drive"", Sulton fills in for Orr's velvety vocal.
    </p>
<p>
    Did I mention there are three new songs? Recorded in a studio? Single ""Not Tonight""-- the one with awkward attempts at Blackberry humor-- also appears in live form. Rundgren's trembling vocal here falls somewhere between Ocasek and Roy Orbison, and while the jerky arrangement is vintage Cars, didn't the Strokes and others do this better a few years ago? Slow, ponderous ""Warm"" sounds like Dream Theater covering ""Stairway to Heaven"" with outerspace sound effects and lyrics (about seasons!) that lack rhyme and reason and make you insane. Then, like the conclusion of a Hollywood blockbluster with a prewritten sequel, Cars-by-numbers closer ""More"" confirms our worst fears-- they think they've left us wanting, um, more.

    his career where, having carried his weight as an innovator, he tours the 
    world playing his old band's greatest hits and hangs out with fellow royalty 
    like Steve Cropper, Spooner Oldham, P.F. Sloan, and Levon Helm. With them and 
    other studio demi-gods, he's gone from making bar band music with the Catholics to crafting sepia-toned visions of Americana and Stax/Volt 45s.</p><p>
    Last year's <em>Honeycomb</em> established this new passage in Black's career, and it sounded tentative. On <em>Fast Man Raider Man</em>, Black seems 
    more confident and brings better material to the table but the rock'n'soul approach 
    still sometimes doesn't gel with his songs and voice-- especially when he reaches for a falsetto. Part of what keeps it from coming together is veteran Jon Tiven's 
    production, which is flat and arid-- there's little sense of atmosphere or 
    people playing together in a room. This is ironic:  The record came together through near-spontaneous collaboration, but 
    that communal sensibility only comes through on a handful of songs.</p><p>
    Black's duet with country singer Marty Brown on a cover of Ewan MacColl's 
    ""Dirty Old Town"" is one of those, and here you get the feel of skilled 
    musicians having their way with an old chestnut. The song 
    has the natural build and dynamics of a group in its groove and it sounds like 
    a lot of fun, which I think makes it a glimpse into what was going through Black's mind as he made this album.
    </p><p>
    Fun is fun, but it's possible to have too much of it, and the 2xCD <em>Fast Man Raider Man</em> certainly does. Lacking an editor, Black includes everything 
    from several Nashville sessions and an L.A. session-- even dusting off 
    four tracks that were (correctly) left off of <em>Honeycomb</em>. You can insert the 
    near-obligatory double album critique here: If you kept the best 
    tracks, you'd have a great single disc. Hard rocker ""Elijah"", Tom 
    Waits-inspired ""If Your Poison Gets You"", and ""The End of the Summer""-- which 
    benefits from the actual use of reverb-- are all great, but then you also get 
    ""Raider Man"", a story-song about a laid-off Polish coal miner that's 
    clumsy and awkwardly sung.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Dog Sleep"" veers from a vague New Orleans vibe into a strange, off-kilter 
    section that struggles to find real musicality in its rambling phrases. 
    ""Highway to Lowdown"", left over from the <em>Honeycomb</em> sessions, just doesn't 
    take off down the road its lyrics describe, derailing completely when Black 
    and the lead guitar leave the rhythm section behind for a painfully stilted 
    passage. ""My Terrible Ways"" 
    is a well-intentioned post-Katrina ballad of self-redemption,  but the song 
    could have used a rewrite or three-- or perhaps just some rigorous 
    rehearsal, as the sax solo, brushed drums, and rhythm guitar are its only 
    parts that work well.
    </p>
<p>
    I hate to focus on the negative because Black seems genuinely pleased with 
    this work. But you get the feeling 
    that if this material had been road-tested and honed a bit 
    it could have been stronger. That said, there is a very good album 
    here-- you just have to work for it. If you enjoyed <em>Honeycomb</em>, this improves on it, 
    but not to the point where those who didn't like that album are apt to come 
    around to Black's latest direction.

    Despite one of the healthiest and most interesting
    bodies of work of anyone in Berlin’s electropop circuit, Barbara Morgenstern
    has never been a name. Even when compared against the relative successes of
    artists like, say, Lali Puna or The Notwist, Morgenstern has always flown under
    the radar, content to make thoughtful and often brilliant records destined to be
    namechecked by everyone from Ellen Allien to the Mountain Goats’ John Darnielle,
    but ultimately bought and heard by a pathetic few.</p><p>
    Seven years on, there’s new cause for hope. While <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Grass Is Always
    Greener</span><span> marks her fifth full-length album,
    it arrives at a time unlike any other in Berlin’s last decade. Gone, seemingly,
    is the rigid ideology that once stratified Berlin’s verdant electronic output
    into self-contained parking zones. The ensuant conflation and interbreeding of once
    closed gardens like Tresor house, minimal, sleaze techno, Morr Music electropop,
    post-IDM, neo-kraut, sound design and whatever else had its own subsection in
    your favorite electronic record store once upon a time has left those barriers
    decimated; now, everyone’s a dilettante with a clear field of vision --
    greatness practically demands it.</span></p><p>
    Berlin’s increasing predilection toward formal pop structure is another
    development working in Morgenstern’s favor. Though she’s certainly made
    overtures to pop conventions on prior outings, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Grass Is Always
    Greener</span><span> finds her working more assuredly
    within the form. As proof she’s thinking as much about melody as she is
    texture, piano features heavily this time around. Set mostly against backdrops
    of burbling synths and minor-key choruses, it provides Morgenstern with a clear
    melodic anchor and a warm counterpoint to her brittle rhythms. Its classical
    connotations have the added bonus of sparking off the album’s otherwise
    forward-looking sounds, something that serves its theme well.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For clues on that theme, we need look no further than the
    title track, which, despite its name, is sung primarily in German. The conceit
    is one of many on the record to allude to the notion of in-betweenness
    (culturally, spiritually, musically) that dominates throughout. Conceived while
    Morgenstern travelled countries as disparate as Japan and India on her
    Goethe-Institut-backed 2005 world tour, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Grass Is Always Greener</span><span> has a wistful, almost punchdrunk quality to it, its
    chord progressions always hairpinning somewhere unlikely.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Also worth mentioning: the punchy and sorta sideways lead single
    “The Operator”, which has a whiff of Devo to it; the turbulent key changes of
    the gorgeous “Polar”;<span> </span>the simple
    piano balladry of “Das Schöne Einheitsbild”. But really, there’s barely a dud
    to be found, not even as the album takes on a busier and slightly more
    industrial aesthetic near the end. Confident, crafted and feminine, this is
    Morgenstern’s finest record yet-- let’s hope she gets the audience she
    deserves.

Tindersticks, his long-running band, are one of those rare, seemingly egoless entities that make music devoid of posturing, and his voice allows them to plumb emotional depths few bands ever approach. When he and his previously neglected middle initial go solo for the second time on <em>Leaving Songs</em>, the presence of those amazing pipes automatically marries the record to Tindersticks, and fans of the band will be able to dig right past the post-expressionist portrait of the Gorton's fisherman on the cover to marinate in Staples' signature elegant melancholy.</p><p>I've heard nothing of a Tindersticks breakup (two of the band's other members, keyboardist Dave Boulter and guitarist Neil Fraser, appear on this album), but you could be forgiven for reading opener ""Old Friends, No. 1"" as a post-implosion song, with lines like, ""I catch myself in the mirror and I remember that I've got to do something with my life"" and ""we flattened everything that stood in our path/ Now I wake up and have to find myself through all the shit that once told me who I was."" The music is fairly close to the rich oddball soul Tindersticks have pursued since 1999's <em>Simple Pleasure</em>, with ramshackle horns provided by long-time collaborator Terry Edwards and intricate string arrangements that add substance rather than merely color.</p><p>Given the style, the choice to hop the Atlantic and record at the Nashville studio of Lambchop's Mark Nevers seems natural, given that Nevers and Lambchop are about the closest American analog to Tindersticks. Little bits of country seep in at the album's edges, from the bright piano and wandering slide guitar of ""This Old Town"" to the pedal steel that graces ""This Road Is Long"", a duet with Maria McKee. The most stunning track is ""Already Gone"", a song that recalls the inky ambience of the second <em>Tindersticks</em> LP, beginning with just fluttering acoustic guitar and Staples' trembling moan. As it creeps along, a flurry of strings rises from below, while Boulter's unmistakable organ drops blotches of color across the song. Edwards intrudes with honking baritone sax and the song builds to a weird, unsettled conclusion.</p>
<p>The world Staples addresses in his songs is almost never settled. Uncertainly lurks in every line, kept company by disaster, despair, and occasional malevolence. That tendency holds true on <em>Leaving Songs</em>, which any Tindersticks fan definitely must hear. As a solo record, it's no declaration of independence, but by sticking to what he does best, Staples makes it ring with sadness and sophistication.</p></div>"|9041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9041-leaving-songs/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Fast-forward just two years and, at least on the surface, the Fever has a new bag.</p><p>
<em>In the City of Sleep</em> abjures its predecessor's straightlaced dance-rock angling in favor of an ambitious hodgepodge of chintzy musical styles that can only be described as 21st century indie vaudeville. But while Tom Waits, Cheap Trick, and Captain Beefheart now factor more prominently than Talking Heads or Gang of Four, the band still drips with the same stiff-upper-lipped austerity. Produced by Steve Revitte (Liars, Black Dice), this nearly hour-long mock-epic of rumbling synths and dinosaur arena rock should be much more fun than it actually is. Instead, the LP suffers from a lackadaisical track selection and tiresome layers of sonic effects.</p><p>
    At its best, the band nails down massive AOR anthems that'd kill at Budokan. Back-to-back highlights ""The Secret"" and ""Crying Wolf"" initially rear an ugly head, all plodding reverberated riffs and brooding vocals, before launching into sing-along choruses of 1960s teeny bop that only want you to want them, Rick Nielsen style. Unfortunately, frontman Geremy Jasper too often succumbs to his stormy petrel shtick, and it spills over into tracks otherwise calling for a lighter, less ham-handed delivery. On shuffling dirges like ""Do the Tramp"" and ""Pink Smoke"", Jasper concerns himself more with sounding cool while whining and growling than actually emitting any plausible pathos.
    </p><p>
    When Jasper's not hogging the limelight, the band reverts to a breakneck pace unaccommodating for vocals. While amphetamine-juiced rocker ""Redhead"" leaves space for a melody, many tracks suffer from gratuitous layers of synth and studio glitz that render songs cartoonish (quite literally on ""Eyes on the Road"", whose beginning is uncannily similar to the X-Men animated show theme). Yes, <em>In the City of Sleep</em> shows a marked improvement over <em>Red Bedroom</em>'s equally fallible, self-conscious post-punk meandering. Still, the Fever has over-compensated, and such lofty attempts should be kept on ice until the band's chops are up to par.

    So, Australian duo the Presets came together because each dug how the other dressed. It musta been kinda like your favorite direct-to-Trio sitcom pilot: Keyboardist/yelper Julian Hamilton was the baggy-pants raver, while drummer/programmer Kim Moyes' grandpa-chic proved the Cardigans aren't just a band (what no laugh track?). Anyway, when they get together, dirrty electro-punk ensues. After all, the only trend trendier than apparel is pop music.</p><p>
    ""Steamworks"" opens the Presets' debut full-length, <em>Beams</em>, with nifty ""Billie Jean"" nods and hella somethin' Gwen Stefani pantwork, but keep your distressed denim on. The Presets are also in an avant-garde instrumental band called Props, but when your pop is as tuneless as ""Are You the One""-- all hoovering bass and forgettable lyrics-- I'm not gonna be impressed just because it's also got handclaps.</p><p>
    A.R.E. we having fun yet? No? More lame sex puns and sub-sub-sub-LCD Soundsystem beats, then, starting with ""Down Down Down"", another shout-along future Gap ad that whips it good on the verses and slyly ends with ""I wanna go down down down-- on you!"" Doubling that entendre isn't doubling anybody's fun, especially since ""Girl (You Chew My Mind Up)"" puts the same bass line through a different distortion pedal, beneath different inane yelps.</p><p>
    It's not just pop songs, though, because while Moyes wore sweaters, our Jules wore Pumas. This is important, people. So instrumentals like dark plinky ""Black Background"" and sweaty squelchy ""Worms"" and tuba-topped ""Hill Stuck"" remind us that the guy we knew in college who loved to play with synths and tracker programs should've had a record deal. But then the closing, title track shows even more versatility by going organic: Former Silverchair (!!!) frontman Daniel Johns plays guitar while strings sigh and a mournful keyboard tinks exactly like Carter Burwell's score at the end of <em>Being John Malkovich</em>. Oh no, trapped <em>forever</em>-ever?!</p><p>
    Still, by far the most frustrating thing about <em>Beams</em> is that Moyes and Hamilton both know better. Geez, they even studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Until they dropped out to pursue a career in fashion.<br/>

Turns out the second verse doesn't sound much different than the first. What we get on <em>Under the Iron Sea</em> is nearly 60 minutes of mid-tempo AAA ROM (that's Adult Album Alternative Radiohead-Oriented Music), lots of piano, lots of measured drumming, lots of portentous clichés, earnest singing, and a sound big enough to fill a corporately-sponsored arena. It's the aural equivalent of these bon mots from Keane's first album: ""I'm getting old and I need something to rely on."" No alarms and no surprises here, folks.</p><p>
    There are some exceptions to Keane's particular rule: The Edge-y, attention-grabbing intro to ""Is It Any Wonder"", this album's barnburner (relatively speaking, of course). ""Leaving So Soon"" shows that Tom Chaplin can mimic his back-up vocal buddy Rufus Wainwright just as well as he can cling to Thom Yorke's jock. Speaking of good ol' Thom, if there's a more blatant nod to ""Pyramid Song"" than ""Broken Toy"", someone's lawyers are going to be very happy. As for the instrumental (""The Iron Sea"") and the token ballad/show bathroom break (""Hamburg Song""), they're as turgid and narcoleptic as the all-too-regular stabs at willowy bombast. To Keane's credit, they're getting better at these stabs. Give your brain a well-earned siesta, and you'll probably find yourself doing the Patrick Bateman to toe-tapping ditties like ""Put It Behind You"" and ""Crystal Ball"".</p><p>
    But don't let all this talk about the music lead you to believe that the lyrical content is lacking. No, Keane make sure that <em>Iron Sea</em> is filled with the sort of greeting-card poetry that would even give Bono pause. If you want to sound like an asshole, quote this couplet from ""Nothing In My Way""-- ""For a lonely soul, you're having such a nice time."" If you're feeling put-upon and a little obvious, just follow Chaplin's lead and sing, ""I'm not a stone; I'm just a man,"" like you really mean it. And in case you forgot, ""Atlantic"" reminds you in the most ponderous manner possible that being old and alone is totally lame.
    </p><p>
    All this being said, <em>Iron Sea</em> isn't unlistenable. Would that it were, if just a little bit: Andy Green's rich, Corinthian production pulls out all the stops to make this a painfully pleasant experience. Some roughage mixed in with these hollow calories would go a long way towards being able to keep this disc down. No, <em>Under the Iron Sea</em> is just another exchange of the same perfunctory, self-centered pleasantries offered the first time around.

After seven studio albums, a handful of lineup shifts, and numerous tours, founder Dean Wareham and his band agreed to split following a farewell tour. That was a couple of years ago, and now we get full closure with a <em>Best of Luna</em> disc, as well as a DVD documenting the group's final trek. The unassuming title is fitting for a group that counted subtlety as one of its key charms.</p><p>
    Following in the wake of Wareham's previous band, Galaxie 500, Luna became the early 1990s archetype for spacey indie pop. Their music was full of cosmic guitar interplay between Wareham and Sean Eden, but the rhythm section-- at first ex-Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski and bassist Justin Harwood, later Lee Wall and Britta Phillips-- was always solid and down-to-earth. Wareham remained the deadpan, lovesick guy at the heart of it all, and his liners for this compilation offer <em>de facto</em> justification for every track, regardless of which deserved ones may have been left out (*cough* ""Bobby Peru"" *cough*).</p><p>
<em>Best of</em> opens with ""Moon Palace"", the first of five tracks from <em>Penthouse</em> and Wareham's personal favorite Luna song. ""You were stuck in a dream/ And you wanted to scream/ But it's nothing at all/ No, it's nothing at all,"" he sings as guitars move between stoned country and a 14-hour Technicolor dream. <em>Penthouse</em>'s top billing in the tracklist is fortuitous-- it's their best album, and anyone who likes this comp should seek it out-- but what's remarkable is how well the rest of Luna's material stands up to it. Solid to their final days, ""Astronaut""-- from the band's 2004 swan song <em>Rendezvous</em>-- is one of Luna's best songs, with a drumbeat about four times brisker than anything else here and one of Wareham's strongest vocal performances.
    </p><p>
    This comp doesn't offer fans anything new aside from Wareham's booklet anecdotes, but it's an ideal intro for newcomers. What longtime fans will want to check out, though, is the DVD. <em>Tell Me Do You Miss Me</em>, directed by Matthew Buzzell, is one of those rare tour documentaries that manages to put a band's history-- particularly its demise-- in deeply humane perspective. When you see Wareham spending time with his son in Central Park, you know why he was no longer interested in the touring life of a working band.
    </p>
<p>
    The DVD also features some great performances, including footage of the band's final show, at the Bowery Ballroom. Buzzell also captures moments of tedium and good humor, such as Eden and Wareham amending one another's stories. In the end, it comes off as an honest portrait of honest people trying to make a living playing music and barely cresting out of the red into the black.
    </p>
<p>
    Taken together, the disc and DVD offer a succinct portrait of Luna. The credits-- including two appearances on the comp by Tom Verlaine, one by Sterling Morrison-- are eye-popping, the music is great, and you're left with a clear picture of the group, something you don't always get with career wraps.

    The Black Keys are now well beyond obvious blues-rock duo comparisons, having carved out three of the best head-in-the-past, riffs-in-the-future albums of the past decade. Before ditching the only home they'd known, blues staple Fat Possum, for the NPRarified air of Nonesuch, Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney threw together this fitting farewell, saluting deceased labelmate Junior Kimbrough. In the process, they avoid the hammy recreations that cover albums often bring: This is no <em>Encomium</em> or <em>Radiodread</em>, but rather an acknowledgement of a hero and a simple cap-tip.</p><p>
    Working from the same modal electric blues that Kimbrough plied for decades, Black Keys take these songs and apply the swinging rollick and bended notes for which they've become known. Each track is a yearning, often flagellating ballad of sorts (titles: ""Have Mercy On Me"", ""Work Me"", ""My Mind Is Ramblin'"", etc.), and that's what Auerbach seems to have in common with Kimbrough-- a desperate wail coupled with subtly sophisticated guitar playing. But the songs sound completely different from the originals, sometimes distorting lyrical structure but mostly throwing a hazy, almost psychedelic trip onto what were once melodically downtuned blues arrangements.</p><p>
    The Keys have covered Kimbrough twice before and each of those other approaches was more straightforward and amped. ""Do the Rump"", from their debut <em>The Big Come Up</em>, is pretty ferocious rawk stuff. The aching ""Meet Me in the City""-- perhaps Kimbrough's best ever-- is a nice contrast to some of the liberties they take elsewhere. For a guy who sired 36 kids and died with a common-law wife, Kimbrough seems pretty screwed romantically, yowling ""Please don't leave me right now, girl, right now, oh no..."" Like his inspiration, Auerbach sings in an unclear mumble that adds a lived-in weight to the music. The white-boy imitators from Ohio jacking a Mississippi Delta shaman's style is an idea fraught with unmanageable questions. The Black Keys, however, have been graceful and more than honoring in the past about their muses, so there doesn't seem to be a lot of culture-transmogrification, other than the occasional ripped-off riff. That much is testified to by Kimbrough's widow, Mildred, on the last track via answering machine, where she notes that Auerbach and Carney are ""the only ones that really really played like Junior played his records."" The track is a bit of a shameless pat-on-the-back to round out a classy six-song affair, but I doubt Kimbrough would have a hard time jamming with these two.

Difficult as it is to imagine, these rarities actually further degenerate the band's already vestigial albeit effective take on punk rock. Some studio scraps, combined with eclectic covers ranging from the Kinks to the Velvet Underground to Adam and the Ants, nicely eulogize a career that burned bright, short, and most importantly, ass-kickingly.</p><p>
    A half-dozen tracks of blues napalm kick off the album, which otherwise consists of blunter junkyard debris. From ""Mr. Hyde""'s spiky organ alarum to John Dwyer's whiney interrogation on ""ATM"", the tenuous garage-rock revival comparisons ring true. Yet, unlike the White Stripes or the Hives, the Coachwhips deploy hissy, brain-dead stomps out of necessity, not aesthetic angling; they <em>can't</em> sound any cleaner or better. Take ""The Witch"", a Sonics cover, for example. Gratuitously sped up, the mix inundated with cymbal crashes, the Coachwhips render the original wholesome and Ed Sullivan-ready by comparison.</p><p>
    Even in the album's homogenous middle third a short-lived riff or occasional Dwyer one-liner salvages momentum. ""Ringing the Chowbell"" monstrously mashes garish 1960s camp rock with Dwyer's nihilist, post-punked blues croon, here sounding more mischievous than malefic. Feedback-ballad ""Death Machine"" finds the band farthest from their piss-and-vinegar MO, with a disintegrated Lou Reed lullaby slowed seemingly for the sole purpose of hearing overdriven guitars drowning the singsong melody in metallic squall.
    </p><p>
    Funny thing is, <em>Double Death</em>-- like any Coachwhips album-- remains entertaining and action-packed throughout, despite each song's over-the-top, shoot-'em-up formula. If nothing else in this world, I know two things without a doubt: Schwarzenegger will defeat an army of robot-soldiers before a final showdown with their creator, and the Coachwhips will initiate a harmless blues shuffle before immediately pulverizing it to exhilarating smithereens.

    SCSI-9's debut album from 2002 is one of the better-kept secrets of the first wave of microhouse. Released on Force Tracks at the precise moment when its powers-that-be were talking up ""digital disco"" and rediscovering pop, <em>Digital Russian</em> instead opted for an almost purist take on dubby tech-house, emphasising hypnotic, endless grooves, carefully programmed house rhythms, deep dub bass, and simple, mnemonic melodies-- again, purist, but frequently perfect. It was also surprisingly energetic, and this unexpected physicality gave a sense of purpose to its anti-eclectic, anti-song formalism. The contrast between each groove's hard core and soft surfaces generated a dancefloor intensity that overrode charges of sameyness, not to mention making it a great housework album.</p><p>
    On 2004's <em>Mini</em> 12""-- their first for Kompakt-- SCSI-9 gave the impression that they'd finally caught the digital disco bug, or at least some closely related strain: ""Autumn Love""'s juxtaposition of a sunny breakbeat disco rhythm and majestic strings verged on Balearic, while ""Mini""'s skipping, stuttering, stereo-panning groove was positively blessed-out, recalling Orbital's ""Belfast"" or ""Halcyon"".</p><p>
    On <em>The Line of Nine</em>, SCSI-9 return to the dreamy, longform grooves of their first album, with little of the rainbow-colored pop immediacy that the <em>Mini</em> single implied. What SCSI-9 have retained from <em>Mini</em> is a certain warm gentleness: with its cheerful basslines and glittering trebly melodies, <em>The Line of Nine</em> is mostly relaxed and unhurried. Many of the songs feature percussion that mimics the crackle of vinyl, perhaps in homage to Farben's supremely sluggish microhouse of yore. Despite this, the album still feels ""of a piece"" with its predecessor-- if anything the shift is one of perspective. While <em>Digital Russian</em> concentrated on propulsive rhythms which gradually accumulated lush atmospherics, like a stylus picking up dust from the grooves in a record, <em>The Line of Nine</em> favors glistening arrangements which slowly coalesce into a groove. 
    </p>
<p>
    This gear change from throb to drift ultimately renders <em>The Line of Nine</em> the lesser album, if only slightly. While its supine shimmer allows the duo to focus on sculpting even more scintillating textures than before, in the absence of an obviously pop sensibility, its accommodating glow occasionally encourages the mind to wander. 
    </p>
<p>
    What's more, I can't help but feel that these albums would make more sense if the chronology was reversed: <em>Digital Russian</em>'s long stretches of driving, multi-layered percussive grooves-- putting the tech back into the tech-house-- would fit comfortably into many current DJ sets, while <em>The Line of Nine</em>'s tic-toc rhythms and spacey keyboard work would have made perfect sense on Force Tracks <em>or</em> Kompakt in 2002. 
    </p>
<p>
    Putting all this to one side, it's very difficult to fault this album in any significant way: SCSI-9 are blessed (or cursed) with such sturdy consistency that it's tempting to wish for just one terrible track, if only to hear what a terrible SCSI-9 track would sound like. Instead, the most one can say is that some tracks are more memorable than others, cautious variations on the formula resulting in ""the one with the graceful piano"" or ""the one with the eerily woozy chimes."" 
    </p>
<p>
    It's these little touches that frequently make <em>The Line of Nine</em> a joy to listen to, albeit a quiet and unassuming one. While never courting outright weirdness or hippie abstraction, the album finds SCSI-9 at their most intricate, and the interplay of bouncing, rattling percussion and spiralling synth tones is enough to carry tunes that might otherwise seem insubstantial. 
    </p>
<p>
    Towards the end of the album, SCSI-9 wander into some darker corners: The keyboard riffs become more foreboding than soothing, and the sparkling surfaces begin to feel icy. These culminate in ""Morskaya"" and ""Ne Contsom a Coltsom"", two gorgeous but dark-hearted widescreen epics reminiscent of Luciano at his best. It's these tentative gestures towards other sounds and other emotions that confirm the creeping feeling that producers as consummately talented as SCSI-9 should be pushing themselves further outside their own creative margins. One or two duff tracks would be a small price to pay.

    From 1984 to 1995, writer Mike McGonigal published his influential fanzine <em>Chemical Imbalance</em>. Within its dense pages, McGonigal ably demonstrated how an essentially punk-centered zine could expand into wider realms of experimental music, transgressive literature, and visual arts to become a vivid personal and broad-based cultural statement. In addition to being a generally engaging read, <em>C.I.</em> was also one of the first zines to release a 7-inch single-- not just some flimsy flexidisc-- with every issue, making available previously unreleased tracks by Big Black, Sonic Youth, Pavement, and Yo La Tengo, among others. And though <em>Chemical Imbalance</em> is now just a memory, McGonigal has maintained and furthered its multimedia traditions with <em>Yeti</em>, his current, even-thicker arts and music journal.</p><p>
    The third and most recent volume of <em>Yeti </em>is an impressive 244-page behemoth that contains interviews with William S. Burroughs, Neko Case, and Devendra Banhart in addition to a truckload of diverse writings and handsome illustrations. As if all that was not enough, <em>Yeti #3</em> also includes a massive 27-track companion CD that features three demo tracks by Banhart as well as contributions from Colin Meloy, Iron and Wine, and the Postal Service. While the inclusion of an accompanying CD is not uncommon in today's magazine market, most such compilations are a dreary dumping ground of outtakes, cast-offs, and/or widely available album cuts. Such is not the case with <em>Yeti #3</em>, however, as everything here is either previously unreleased or otherwise suitably rare, and with a few notable exceptions each of these tracks proves to be a worthy addition to its creator's discography.</p><p>
    If nothing else, the songs collected on <em>Yeti #3</em> can serve as a useful barometer to gauge the prevailing tendencies in a certain corner of the DIY musical landscape. Though it includes pieces by such noteworthy underground figures as Henry Flynt and Steffen Basho-Junghans, the collection does not feature anything fiercely avant-garde or experimental. Neither does it include anything that owes any particular debt to punk rock, which is certainly a far cry from <em>Chemical Imbalance</em>'s noisier post-hardcore trajectory. Instead, <em>Yeti #3</em> concentrates its attention largely on more folk and roots-based material, along with a healthy smattering of electronic bedroom pop. As such, it's hardly the most adventurous compilation that McGonigal has ever assembled, nor is it free from the pesky continuity glitches that naturally plague multi-artist compilations. 
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, this set is a surprisingly solid listen from start to finish, with few outright duds to spoil its cautious momentum. The idea of Banhart demo tapes might seem rather redundant for those familiar with his <em>Oh Me Oh My...</em>album, but his three brief solo contributions each compare favorably to the material on his debut. Jolie Holland shines on her vibrant live reading of the traditional ""Don't Get Trouble On Your Mind,"" as does Sam Beam on Iron and Wine's typically lustrous ""John's Glass Eye."" The Brooklyn-based combo Timesbold give their track ""Fencepost"" a wicked Tom Waits-like carnival lurch, while relatively unknown acts the Dream Lovers, Nov. 16<sup>th</sup>, and World each work fruitfully with avant-folk/pop of varying hues and textures.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's biggest revelation, however, is ""Hillbilly Jive (Version)"", a short, previously unheard solo fiddle nugget from composer/performer Henry Flynt. As with much of Flynt's trad-inspired work, this potent track sounds like something that Alan Lomax might've recorded had he stumbled across Tony Conrad practicing violin on the front porch of some West Virginian cabin. Also not to be missed is Washington Phillips' ""What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?"", an irresistible slice of pre-war gospel blues that closes the album. Alongside powerhouse performances like these, tracks like Colin Meloy's live take on Morrissey's ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"" or the Robot Ate Me's clunky ""We Were Human"" seem featherweight and ultimately inconsequential in comparison. 
    </p>
<p>
    It should be noted that the above rating reflects only the musical portion of <em>Yeti #3's</em> presentation. When taken in conjunction with the book-length sprawl of the accompanying zine, <em>Yeti #3</em> should prove to be a tantalizing document for any true scholar of marginal pop culture, a package that easily meets McGonigal's stated intention that ""Healthy confusion is always the goal."" I've seen reports that McGonigal is already at work assembling the contents for <em>Yeti #4</em>, so you had better start reading soon if don't want to risk falling behind.

Over the past five years, I've heard music nerds-- mostly soul fanatics-- unload crazy amounts of bile on that record, but their most propagated criticisms (""soul with all the black parts removed,"" ""music for lattes"") strike me as having too much in common with the rockist's critique of pop to take seriously. Even calling Zero 7 a bad soul outfit would be to miss the point; if anything, with its revolving cast of lead vocalists and electro-acousticisms, this stuff was meant to fill the space left by trip-hop's demise. (That the only people who felt that loss happened to be Starbucks drinkers was a total and utter coincidence.)</p><p>
    Oh man, see? This is such an easy band to mock. They're earnest and conservative and heavy-handed and swim in such deeply unfashionable waters, they have only cod for company-- cod-jazz, cod-soul, cod-funk. But in a strange way, their painful sincerity and abiding uncoolness is what keeps me defending that first record; because it's good despite those things, and on a larger scale, it's a heartening reminder that nothing merits pre-emptive dismissal. So yeah, for a short spell back in 2001, Zero 7 was a three-legged chihuahua that had just won a dog show, and that endeared me to them. But not anymore guys, I'm sorry. So: I'm going to open the car door now, and you're going to awkwardly hop out and maybe go see what's behind that wheatfield over there while I drive away.</p><p>
    Actually, there's one song here I really like. That's ""Futures"", one of a handful featuring José González on vocals. On its own, González's dry, folksy vocal is 1970s enough, so it's no surprise it should be so well-suited to Henry Binn and Sam Hardaker's buttoned-up production style. With its spiralling acoustic riff and appropriately burbly sonics, its gorgeously languid sheen makes you wonder if, next time out, Zero 7 wouldn't be wise to acknowledge their inner-Gerry Rafferty and head straight for the punchbowl marked ""MOR"".
    </p><p>
    That would, without question, be better than what we get here, which-- barring two other González tracks, ""Left Behind"" and ""Today""-- is a warmed-over stew of scrubbed-up psychedelia, scrubbed-up sunshine pop, scrubbed-up soundtrack music, electrofunk, and lounge that's all produced immaculately, right down to the ""messy"" parts. In addition to González, <em>The Garden</em>'s other major guest is Sia Furler, who contributes songwriting credits and vocals to six of its 12 tracks. While I like Sia-- even despite her affected vocal and her nagging tendency to oversing-- this is not her finest hour. ""Catch a falling star/ You'll go far/ In the pageant of the bizarre/ And tonight I give you my heart,"" goes the cloying fairground pop of ""Pageant of the Bizarre"", before spinning off into an ill-advised Beach Boys vocal outro.
    </p>
<p>
    Even worse are the perfunctory instrumental tracks-- the pseudo-broken beat of ""Seeing Things"" and the midnight jazz of ""Your Place""-- which only further mottle the record's intent and give the impression that, if left to their own devices, Zero 7's principles would rather be making a Ninja Tune record. I don't know what I'd rather they were doing, but I do know that this is so tasteful I'm going to need about six hours with Boris to get right again.

    Since the dissolution of the pioneering free-folk collective Tower Recordings, former TR guitarist Matthew Valentine (MV) and vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Erika Elder (EE) have been making strange rural magic together deep in the Vermont hinterlands. Their music is a distinctive blend of astral blues, creaky backwoods ragas, and ecstatic post-Arkestral navigation. Alongside a revolving cast of collaborators, the duo have issued a torrent of small-batch recordings, most of which have been released on their own Child of Microtones imprint. Their massive and overgrown back catalog has been crying out for a defining benchmark, and the new Time-Lag 2xCD set <em>Mother of Thousands</em> appears specially designed to meet that demand.</p><p>
    Valentine and Elder are joined here by the Bummer Road, a talented quintet of musicians that includes Moses Jiggs on harmonica, Samara Lubelski on strings, and Quakebasket's prolific Tim Barnes on percussion. While I don't typically hold the harmonica in high esteem, Jiggs' work on <em>Mother of Thousands</em> is consistently spellbinding. His shivering, disembodied tones perfectly complement Valentine's lead guitar figures, casting obscure signals skyward like heatwaves off a parched stretch of Mississippi blacktop. Valentine and Elder share the vocal duties equally, although nearly every track is eventually allowed to shake loose from its front-porch moorings and be carried away by the Bummer Road's communal tides.</p><p>
<em>Mother of Thousands</em> is split into two distinct halves, the first of which consists largely of shorter, acoustic-based originals. With a firm grounding in country-blues tradition, much of Valentine and Elder's material can serve as a reminder that rural life isn't necessarily all green meadows and bucolic escapism. ""Trying to move to the country/ Where the cold rain kept on falling/ Some of the people I love/ Are six feet under the ground"", the duo sing on ""Cold Rain"", their harmonies sounding worn and fragile above Valentine's nimble 12-string guitar. On ""Canned Heat Blues"" they transmit their alien hobo laments over a gauzy web of hand percussion and sitar, while the despondent ""C.C. Pills"" makes its bleary way through an assemblage of mutated flute and analog drones. The set also leavens these darker moods with the sunny folk of ""Beautiful Mountain"" and numinous, nearly wordless abstractions like ""The Joyous Within"" or ""Sunshine on Us All"", allowing the album's first half to achieve an enthralling cross-textual symmetry.
    </p>
<p>
    On the second disc the Bummer Road applies the power of its arsenal towards the reconstruction of such traditional folk-blues songs as Mississippi John Hurt's ""Payday"" and the Rev. Gary Davis' ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"". On their expansive ""Meditations on Payday,"" the group breaks Hurt's song down at a molecular level, causing isolated shards of guitar, voice, and harp to float apart like slow-moving, honey-colored clouds. Elder adds a narcotic take on Charley Patton's ""Banty Rooster Blues"" before the whole company again moves into their jaw-dropping, 24-minute version of ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"". Here the group makes the album's most potent use of electricity, improvising in a manner that recalls both 1970-71 vintage Grateful Dead and electric-era Miles Davis. Over the course of the song's duration, Valentine's guitar slowly gains in tube-melting distortion until it suddenly drops away beneath Elder's crystalline, eerily placid vocal.
    </p>
<p>
    As with the rest of <em>Mother of Thousands</em>, ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"" makes clear that Valentine and Elder remain at the center of their own singular cosmology. But it's also evident that this particular incarnation of the Bummer Road provides the duo with an unusually cohesive and sympathetic supporting cast, and one can only hope that this album is the first of many such masterstrokes.

    There's something about Swedish pop music that strikes me as clinical. Chalk it up to a relentless sense of perfectionism-- this is a country that not only produced ""Dancing Queen"" but also the exquisite engineering of Saab and the precision of Björn Borg's backhand. The dream pop of Malmo's Radio Dept. is cut from the same cloth. Their second album, <em>Pet Grief</em>, is stacked with syrupy pop songs, as Johan Duncanson's effortless vocals ride the crest of soft-focus synths and programmed drums. But too often, the songs come off like the sonic equivalent of IKEA furniture: highly functional, sleekly designed, and sterile.</p><p>
    That might sound harsh, but it doesn't mean that <em>Pet Grief</em> is lacking. Part of these songs' charm is their love affair with sounds from the 1980s and early 90s-- like a more ethereal, Quaalude-doped version of the Pet Shop Boys or New Order's energetic electro-pop. But the ingredients are there, from dancefloor beats and big piano chords to layers of majestic, string-aping synths. ""Every Time"", the album's catchiest song, even cops the flat, treble-drenched distortion of My Bloody Valentine's guitars, and Duncanson's half-whispered delivery decorates with a fragile and compulsive melody. Between the band's production choices and lovely (if understated) vocals, <em>Pet Grief</em> is built to be instantly pleasing and, as a result, sometimes smacks of déjá vu.</p><p>
    This lack of originality is echoed in Duncanson's musings on relationships, which are often trite to the point of unfeeling. On ""Tell"", for instance, he simply announces, ""Betrayal is always sad"". It would be an insufferable moment if his no-brainer observation wasn't packaged with easily loveable music. Elsewhere, his naïveté is more amusing. Concerning a girlfriend that has moved on, he takes comfort in knowing that her new boyfriend has ""the worst taste in music,"" explaining, ""If I didn't know this, I'd lose it."" It's a line at once juvenile and touching, illustrating the little ways we negotiate pain.
    </p>
<p>
    The songs on <em>Pet Grief</em> are easy to fall in love with; the facile melodies and slick production eliminate any barriers to enjoyment. But the lack of challenge-- few surprises, scant diversity-- means you won't want to put the album on for repeat listens, even if you're never compelled to turn it off while it's playing. Radio Dept. could sacrifice a little polish for a few more rough edges.

    Philadelphia's Bardo Pond have created distinctive space rock for 13 years, and while vocalist/flutist/violinist Isobel Sollenberger has frequently brought out her flute for contributions on previous albums such as <em>On the Ellipse</em> and <em>Dilate</em>, it always seemed to work better when used sparingly. Yet on Bardo Pond's sixth full length, <em>Ticket Crystals</em>, the flute makes an almost overwhelming appearance. And while it is a successful continuation of Bardo Pond's extensive catalogue of material, this album seems to flutter between beautiful, dense soundscapes and almost cloying prog mayhem.</p><p>
    One of <em>Ticket Crystals</em>' highlights is a take on John Lennon's ""Cry Baby Cry"", originally on the Beatles' ""White Album"", which brings Sollenberger's cool, elegiac vocals to the foreground with sweeping richness. While the main body of the song is a standard rendition composed of repetitive chords from electric and acoustic guitars, it suddenly breaks halfway through to reveal a mass of howling distortion and fuzzy vocal mumbling before filtering into waves of crackling harmonium.</p><p>
    Bardo Pond have always been at their best when they allow themselves to collapse into their non-linear, highly improvised drone rock rather than put too much focus on compositional structure. In most cases, their songs tend to gather organically at an intriguing, natural pace-- helped by the shared intuition that comes from playing together for more than a decade. ""FC 11"" is a perfect example of Bardo Pond's all-encompassing space rock psychedelia, and helps to ruffle up the more restrained and tiresome moments of <em>Ticket Crystals</em>. Beginning with what sounds like a ship sending out desperate warning signals, the track eventually develops into a heady-- virtually fluteless!-- expanse of heavily layered violin and finicky drumbeats that titter and splutter with impulsive, rollicking energy.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Ticket Crystals</em> lacks the brutal guitar roar of the band's <em>Lapsed</em>, or the weirdly hypnotic embrace of its <em>Amanita</em>, but doesn't stray far enough to exclude the elements that made those records so great. The opening track, ""Destroying Angel"", is a promising start if you like Bardo Pond when they plunge into Kinski style freakouts and play guitar like Sleep on a (even heavier) cocktail of drugs. But moments like the tedious, flute-laden ""Isle"" let the side down. Nearer the end of the album, on tracks such as ""Moonshine"", Bardo Pond return to their dream-like drone and reverb-drenched vocals that envelop and echo as though Sollenberger is whispering serenades from across the widest of canyons.

    On its surface <em>Mo' Mega</em> appears to be more of the same renegade rap on which Definitive Jux has built its reputation.  All the Jukie generals are lined up behind a battery of El-P's thunderous howitzers, barking commands, but this time something is different. In the past a Lif/El-P collusion meant mayhem and doomsday, but <em>Mo' Mega </em>is, once the smoke clears, a personal, and, in its own neurotic way, ultimately optimistic album. Lif's realizing there is no revolution and no winnable wars. He's spent years calculating his dissension, and the woes of the world have only gotten worse. So, finally, he makes a record that expresses universal frustrations instead of weirding everyone out with labyrinthine rants about things we already know, and, in the process, finds a way to live a little.</p><p>
    Let me say up front that I've always had a soft spot for Lif's robo-Rakim monotone, but often enjoyed his albums the same way I enjoy crack music-- by reveling in the syntax and ignoring the contents. Only with Lif, it was because he was shirking responsibility by abstracting it instead of ignoring it altogether like, say, Cam'ron. From <em>Enters the Colossus</em> to <em>I, Phantom</em>, Lif distanced himself through elaborate conspiracy theories and album-length allegories. Technically interesting, but hardly an attempt to connect. He revealed a bit more of himself on last year's Perceptionists album with songs like ""Love Letters"" and ""Breathe in the Sun"", yet nothing that really indicated the revelations on <em>Mo' Mega</em>.</p><p>
    Lif claims this is his most sincere album, but stacked against the mechanical rhetoric of his priors, it's his only sincere album. He's not yet the rap James Taylor, but he is relatively vulnerable, saying, ""I wish I could ring the blood outta your clothes/ Give back your afros and your strong black nose...And I yawn and grow weary/ Succumb to old theory that strips my wits of thoughts I used to hold dearly,"" on ""Take , Hold, Fire!"". And he actually sounds angry on ""Brothaz"": ""The Bush Administration's worth nothin' Just fuck em!/ Throw ‘em in a barrel Buck ‘em!...Fuck Clinton too!/ You ain't really down because you live Uptown, bitch/ Rwanda!"" It may not look that emotional on paper, but it's the equivalent of Al Gore 2006 vs. Al Gore 2000. It's both frustrating and energizing that someone with Lif's ability is finally being himself after years of cryptic bullshit. And that's before he gets to the songs about cunnilingus.</p><p>
    Where Lif really succeeds here is in taking things personally. The pronouns are now ""I"" and ""my,"" and his problems with the government are now the missed moments with his lady because he has to make a check. He's articulating the prospect of having a family when you're getting older and can barely provide for yourself, and the daily frustration of feeling like your country has failed you. None of these are musical or artistic epiphanies, but it's Lif's realization that his problems are commonplace that makes <em>Mo' Mega</em> more interesting than his other stuff.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    El-P continues paring down his signature maelstroms to focused goth-funk. The guitars now riff, the keyboards stab. His drums pummel harder given more space, and odd little bits of nostalgia surface from the rubble with a sampled piano roll or horn blast. And when El-P gives up the controls, things even threaten to get fun (shhh). Edan contributes another seamless fast rap rumbler on the absurd ""Murs Iz My Manager"", Lif himself flips a dancehall riddim on ""Washitup!"" (the aforementioned ode to going downtown), and Nick Toth channels Boston progenitor Ed O.G with his plinks and strums on ""For You"", Lif's letter to his future seed. Not to be left out of the good times, El-P uses the musique concrete of enthusiastic sex for percussion on ""Long Distance"". It's almost like Def Jux is lightening up, and <em>Mo' Mega</em> is the new mission statement. If that's the case, it's about time.<br/>

Some of you are already grinding your teeth as you jump on the nearest forum to bitch that Pitchfork's getting as shamelessly obsessed with Villalobos as we are (were?) with Kompakt, to the exclusion of all of Detroit's True Greats, or the UK's Unheralded Heroes of Hardcore, or perhaps simply those bedroom producers toiling away on limited-run CDRs that will surely show us all how it's truly done. That's ok. We're used to it, and none of that makes talking about Villalobos any less interesting, or indeed necessary. You'd be wise to soak up everything you can get your hands on by the prolific and mildly infamous Chilean/German producer and DJ, because for more than a decade he's been subtly (and sometimes not-so-subtly) redefining what dance music, minimal house, and techno can do and be. Part of the reason there's so much crap ""minimal"" out there is because Villalobos has been making such absolutely original releases for so long. People want to cop that shit, because it's one of the few newly blazed trails in electronic music. Despite the minimal backlash, there's still plenty of room to swing a machete through the leftover underbrush. But in the meantime, chasing Villalobos' prints through the fetid swamp is more than enough to occupy our time.</p><p>
    All of which makes <em>Salvador</em> a particularly interesting Villalobos release, since it compiles recordings that date back five to eight years, when they originally appeared on Frankfurt's Frisbee Tracks label. This isn't the Villalobos of 2006, veering off into electro-acoustic free techno across a slew of 20-minute-plus drum tracks burned to CD-R and intended for his own DJ sets only. (He played me a few of them in Berlin and at MUTEK, and while they're more floor-oriented than the mind-melting <em>Achso</em>, they're hardly less freaky; indeed, in may ways, they're the rawest snapshot of Villalobos' creative progress yet, as they sound mostly improvised and unedited, full of toggling downbeats, seasick modulations, and unresolved rhythmic collisions. Each one feels like coming up and coming down all at once, which given Ricardo's recreational proclivities might make sense. According to Villalobos, he's including at least one of his private-edition drum tracks in his upcoming Fabric mix, so fear not: You'll hear 'em eventually.) No, this is Villalobos finding his way out of the classic minimal techno of a decade ago, and forging towards the voice that has increasingly become unmistakably his own.</p><p>
    When I asked him why he chose to release <em>Salvador</em>, he explained that Frisbee owns the copyright on all his tracks for the label, released between 1998 and 2001. ""There was no possibility of me saying no,"" he said. ""I asked them to send me the finished tracklisting, and in the end I found it to be a kind of snapshot of what I had done, of where I come from. That music was much more obvious, much easier to understand."" His music today, he went on, reveals itself more slowly, over time. ""But when I was younger, I received a stimulus, an input, and I directly routed it to the track itself. And that stimulus was nightlife, the party.""</p><p>
<em>Salvador</em> is Villalobos' most straightforward release in many years. (""Que Belle Epoque 2006"" has been remastered, but the other tracks are in their original versions.) But this hardly makes it less engaging. ""Que Belle Epoque"" is a 13-minute churn built on bizarrely syncopated synthetic congas and a hypnotic ostinato synth. As it evolves, a heart-rending vocal melody comes up like the sun over the Atacama Desert, with little flute riffs following like vapor trails. In many ways, the track isn't at all different from Villalobos' current DJ tools; it's meant to be mixed, above all, creating a trance state in which off-beat handclaps continually yank you deeper into the vortex.</p><p>
    The CD's seven remaining tracks proceed in a similar manner; ""Tempura"" is a clattering, percussive workout that really would only come to life in the context of a DJ set (though it still makes for pretty gripping listening at home). The spacious ""Suesse Cheques"" finds him holding back on the boom-tick til over halfway through its seven-minute length, instead exploring pure drum sound and room tone. ""Unflug"" and ""Lugom-IX"" hear him attempting to graft Detroit synthesizers to his characteristic, Latin polyrhythms; where they sound crude, the minimal house groover ""Lazer@Present"" absolutely triumphs, a miracle of shoomping two-note chords, ever-morphing drum patterns, and a kick that drops out and sneaks back in when you least expect it.</p><p>
    For good measure, the CD also contains Villalobos' mix of Señor Coconut's ""Electrolatino"" (originally released on the Frisbee sister imprint Multicolor), and it's something else entirely. Well, yes and no: The synthesizers do something you've never quite heard in a Villalobos track, bleeding like Rorschach spots all over the low end, while a metronomic cowbell nags like a guilty conscience. In between those two poles, though, Villalobos' nimble patterns go soaring once again, exploring every angle of flight and pocket of air, where all that is solid melts into rhythm, and all that is rhythm melts into infinity.<br/></p></div>"|9105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9105-salvador/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

    It's one of thousands of vacant lots that pockmark Detroit, but the former site of the McCoy Recording Company once housed a mind-boggling array of businesses. It was a women's clothing store before Ed ""Big Mack"" McCoy used his father's backing and turned it into a recording studio that doubled as a performance and assembly space. In the time McCoy owned it, the building housed a succession of other income-generating companies, and at one point served as an ice cream truck distribution center.</p><p>
    Before opening his offices, McCoy had already released a few tracks by local musicians. As a DJ at a suburban Detroit radio station, he was introduced to a singer named Edd Henry. For his first recording session, he went all out, renting the professional United Sound studio and putting together a gigantic band complete with a horn section. The resulting songs, ""Your Replacement Is Here"" and ""Crooked Woman"", sound fantastic-- the latter shifts from a great Memphis blues intro to a charged piece of tough Detroit proto-soul with blazing horns-- but McCoy's business plan hadn't taken into account the distribution of a record, and it accordingly tanked. The next time he set up a recording session, it took place in a garage.</p><p>
    The group in question was the Manhattens (sic), a doo-wop outfit that would also record for him as the Grand Prix's. Cut in 1962, their ""The Feeling Is Mutual"" is sublime, with a soaring lead vocal and a Latin rhythm considerably muddied by the less-than-ideal recording arrangement. Good music was being made, but by the early to mid-60s, Big Mack was left in the dust by Detroit soul labels Fortune and Revilot, while Motown was gearing up to take over the world. McCoy's operation limped along with no real distribution, no reliable stable of artists, and little to show for the effort apart from some great tunes no one was ever going to hear.
    </p>
<p>
    When he moved into his new facility, McCoy hit on a novel way to build a talent pool and make money doing it: He offered anyone the chance to record in his studio for $15. You could show up on a Monday, sing your song, and have your record by the end of the week. Lord knows what happened to most of these recordings-- or what some of them sounded like-- but the sides Numero Group have resurrected all deserve a proper airing. Easily the most notable is Bob &amp; Fred's ""I'll Be on My Way"". McCoy rightly saw something in the song and had them rehearse it for weeks. The final recording comes complete with a gorgeous string arrangement, which is still no match for the simple, amazing two-part harmony that tops it. It's the definition of a lost classic.
    </p>
<p>
    Adding to the scattershot nature of this compilation are songs like the Perfomers' great post-doo-wop version of ""Mini Skirt"", featuring backing by a white Detroit garage band called the Sleepwalkers, whose guitarist Maury Dean served as the recording company's vice president until the 1968 riots. You also get a couple of go-go spy-jazz cuts from L. Hollis &amp; the Mackadoos that would make Henry Mancini blush, as well as two songs by Soul President, a Bay Area act whose single ""Got to Have It"" b/w ""Get It Right"" was reissued by Big Mack in the Detroit area despite being a failure in its original domicile. Listening to the killer beat, psychedelic guitar, and enthusiastic vocals, it's hard to fault McCoy for taking the risk. As the calendar ticked over into the 1970s, McCoy switched from male to female acts, bringing aboard a trio called Essence and two singers named Mae Young and Ms. Tyree ""Sugar"" Jones.
    </p>
<p>
    The songs McCoy recorded with them represent a fantastic last gasp for Big Mack. Essence do an incredible take on ""Fever"" (yes, <em>that</em> ""Fever"") spiked with clavinet and funky backbeat. The song is so radically altered that I had to listen carefully to the chorus to correlate the lyric to what I'm accustomed to hearing. On top of that, McCoy delivers an eye-popping Isaac Hayes monologue at the beginning. Jones stops about an inch short of outright pornography on the spooky, wah-drenched ""If You Feel It"", bumping up against the bongos and bubbling bassline like a dancer ready to go home with a stranger. Mae Young's songs blend garage rock and funk for a tough, barnstorming sound that shows McCoy may have been on to something if he'd been able to sustain it.
    </p>
<p>
    As it was, he couldn't, and it took 30 years for a dedicated reissue label to put the pieces back together and present the Big Mack story. The resulting disc is remarkably solid, and full of music that was otherwise entirely lost to the ages. As usual, the sound is incredible, and considering the sources, unbelievably full, with excellent separation and balanced levels. If you're into soul music and haven't discovered this series yet, do it now.

<em>Comments of the Inner Chorus</em> is the second full-length album from the British digital-folk collective Tunng, and as with all proper folktales it immediately plunges its audience deep into the phantasmal wilderness. Led by the duo of Mike Lindsay and Sam Genders, Tunng operate in a world where women can be transformed into hares, mysterious wind-up birds make front-page news, and true love inevitably leads to total doom. It soon becomes apparent, however, that what might appear to be an untouched stretch of primitive forest is in fact Tunng's well-manicured English garden, a genteel place where every microscopic detail has been carefully spaced and cultivated for maximum dramatic effect.</p><p>
    As on Tunng's 2005 debut <em>Mother's Daughter...and Other Songs</em>-- reissued in the U.S. earlier this year on Ace Fu-- this album is a well-crafted blend of grainy electronics, organic percussion (which evidently includes such instruments as twigs, teeth and seashells), snatches of sampled dialogue, and traditional British folk. Although Tunng's style owes much to folk ancestors the Incredible String Band and Nick Drake, each track on <em>Comments of the Inner Chorus</em> is so packed with variant instrumental textures that the album can more often resemble the pastoral interludes of Four Tet or the Notwist. The sheer density of the group's fractured, ever-shifting productions places heavy demands on its song structures, causing the over-chirpy ""Red and Green"" or the ill-conceived pastiche ""Stories"" to crumble under their own clunky weight.</p><p>
    Instead, Tunng are most in their element on tradition-steeped material like the wry, refracted murder ballads ""Jenny Again"" and ""Sweet William"". Over a vibrant bed of acoustic guitar and clacking typewriter keys, ""Jenny Again"" finds its murdered narrator placidly imagining his killer's new life. (""Change your name and find a job/ Marry Jenny in the spring/ Think about me now and then."") This same calm resignation is also reflected on the album's effervescent first single, ""Woodcat"". Here the singer learns that his girlfriend has been turned into a hare as punishment for some unnamed crime, and decides to undergo the same procedure himself so that they can be reunited, quietly repeating ""we're in for a lovely time"" with a contented sigh.
    </p>
<p>
    Throughout the album Tunng show as much interest in the storytelling process as in the stories themselves. In the middle of ""The Wind-Up Bird"" they interrupt their own choppy, mechanical flow to remind the narrator, ""Tell me stories inside/ Lie if you like/ But make the details true in our minds."" Heeding their own advice, Tunng frequently use their backing arrangements to mirror the lyrical action almost in the manner of a radio theater troupe. On ""Sweet William"" they rustle the pines with clattering sound effects and plaintive cello strains, while on the Tom Waits-like miniature ""Man in the Box"" they use banjo and an assortment of front porch percussion to rattle their coffin lids. And on the closing stowaway epic ""Engine Room"", the group's gentle folk is gradually overtaken by strange audio samples and a swelling, machinelike noise that mimics the patient grind of a submarine's engine, driving Tunng stealthily away in search of their next fictive adventure.

    With its smoky speakeasy atmosphere, old-timey instrumentation, and pre-rock aesthetic, Jolie Holland's third album, <em>Springtime Can Kill You</em>, is a record-collection album that seems more interested in acetate than vinyl-- her sound reaches back to Prohibition, and these dozen songs seem soaked in hooch and hung out to dry with last night's flapper dress. On one hand, she occasionally seems torn between the past and the present, but in a noncommittal way-- for ""Moonshiner"" she pointedly gives ""props to Memphis Minnie and Freakwater"" in the liner notes. On the other, she plays to her audience rather than trying to impress them, which makes <em>Springtime</em> surprisingly accessible-- at its best it surpasses costume drama and formal exercise to become a kind of one-woman subgenre.</p><p>
    Musically, <em>Springtime</em> is decidedly low-key. The homemade jazz, often reeking of bathtub gin, creates a noir moodiness that pervades the album. The pace alternates between an amiable, low-key jaunt and a low simmer that perfectly suits the lyrics (written by Holland and collaborator Brian Miller) but creates longueurs during the middle and second half of the album. The title track and ""Please Don't"" bow under their slow momentum and overly subdued melodies, and ""Ghostly Girl"" threatens to dissipate into mist at any moment-- a neat trick, but the song never quite solidifies either.</p><p>
    Every element on <em>Springtime</em>-- the relaxed tempos, fluid arrangements, dark moods, unobtrusive instrumentation-- is deployed in service to Holland's decidedly eccentric voice. She overforms her syllables sleepily, rolling her vowels and accentuating various consonants so that her phrasing rubs up against the rhythms of the songs. Like fellow Texan Willie Nelson, she dances around the beat but never breaks meter, and the result creates a mood of playfulness and emotional investment that redeems the otherwise dour ""Crazy Dreams"" and ""Mehitabel's Blues"" (which, sadly, is not about Don Marquis's cat).
    </p>
<p>
    The singer and the album are at their best when the music escapes that simmer and boils over. ""Stubborn Beast"" is a powerful ode to self-delusion (""like a stubborn beast when the barn is on fire/ I might resist you when you try to save my life"") featuring one of Holland's fieriest performances. ""Nothing to Do But Dream"" and ""Adieu False Heart"" are each C&amp;W melody and momentum, mirroring the confessional intensity of the lyrics as they build to crescendos. But these songs are just lead-ins to the album's climax, ""Mexican Blue"", purportedly an ode to Holland's former band, the Be-Good Tanyas. Rather than relying on decades-old tropes, it creates something new and personal from these elements, revealing the range and reach of Holland's voice and songwriting.

    Callahan's mellow baritone a credible estimate of how John Darnielle's
    reedy keen would sound slowed to a chopped-and-screwed crawl. Lyrically, each
    musician sharpens the raw stuff of physical and emotional experience
    against his perception like a blade on a whetstone until only the
    essential edges-- furniture, streams and mountains; bitterness,
    pettiness, rage and redemption-- remain. But while Darnielle has
    slanted fuller and more direct over the years, Callahan has become
    smaller and more enigmatic. His most recent LP, <em>A River Ain't Too Much to Love</em>,
    found him settled deeply into a languid folk-waltz mode, his voice like
    something falling down a well, his once-convulsive exploratory
    sensibility turned calm and shamanistic.</p><p>
    Given the mossy inevitability that grows on Callahan's rock-steady voice, it seems only right that the <em>Rock Bottom Riser</em>
    EP-- featuring two tracks from the aforementioned album, two new songs,
    and two videos-- stays the course. Callahan's songs feel worn-in and
    effortless; his voice coasting across guitars so languid they sound
    wet, and his focus has turned from damnation to redemption. The songs
    are easy to summarize but difficult to concisely illuminate; they're
    like parachutes-- complex folds of family history, abstruse wisdom, and
    reverent naturalism packed tightly beneath plain, simple integuments.
    Always handy with aphorisms, Callahan by now is less the provocateur
    than the sage to whom abstractions like ""God is a word/ And the
    argument ends there"" and ""Humiliation is good/ It means you believe in
    something"" have become so transparent that they require no
    amplification.</p><p>
    No song on the album or this EP embodied redemption more fully than
    ""Rock Bottom Riser"", a glassy waltz dappled with Joanna Newsom's piano.
    Callahan conjures up subtle onomatopoeias: His voice sinks with a heavy
    plunk on the first half of the line ""I am a rock/ Bottom riser,"" gently
    rises on the second; it dives as it intones the word ""diving."" The
    corporeal squeak of calluses on nylon strings asserts the body; the
    tight spidery arpeggio loosens and lightly opens; a voice that
    initially sounds like a weight trying to carry itself begins to drift
    buoyantly; and Callahan's body is pulled from ""this mighty river."" The
    ""Rock Bottom Riser"" video features trippy animation that's actually
    pretty mesmerizing, a swirling slideshow of vaguely Japanese brushwork
    flowing lithely over rice paper. ""I Feel like the Mother of the World""
    is a long, sparkly exhalation, a shifty parable about empathy and
    responsibility. Its video finds Callahan playing a TV newscaster,
    arms-crossed and cocky in front of disaster footage, to Chloe Sevigny's
    harried and eye-patched maid. The juxtaposition of Sevigny's pathetic
    plight and Callahan's droll detachment is evocative of the cruel streak
    latent in his music, still haunted by a univocal and remote
    talking-head quality.
    </p><p>
    If the videos are compelling but inessential, the two new songs are far
    from toss-offs. ""Bowery"", where Callahan's voice blows in lovely gusts
    through silky guitars and small chimes, is whittled down to a white-hot
    emotional point: In beatific tones, Callahan watches his father try to
    find his bowery-bum grandfather's bones (""And to his trials I added my
    own,"" he admits), a multigenerational saga welling up tacitly between
    the sparsely rendered lines. And the easy hitch and roll of ""Fool's
    Lament"" finds Callahan in a slyly instructive mode, Aesop without the
    animals: As emerges through boasts like ""I'm already ready/ For my
    great reward"" and ""I see things clearly/ Or not at all,"" Callahan's
    fool is exactly the kind he'll never be: The one who thinks the world
    is here to be mastered and suborned, rather than poked, prodded,
    caressed and observed.

This same theatrical obscurity extends to the darkened, spacious lullabies on the pair's debut album <em>Desert Doughnuts</em>. Although the duo has termed their creations ""soft metal,"" this open-ended descriptor is insufficient to prepare the listener for entrance into the Falcons' vast and cryptic hemisphere. A luminous construction of blurred Medieval whispers, narcotic guitar figures, and thunderous percussion that reverberates like hoofbeats across the mesa, <em>Desert Doughnuts</em> appears above the dashboard like a mirage, the music's vaporous structure ready at any moment to dissolve into the twilight.</p><p>
    The album was conceived as a songcycle during the duo's shared travels across the American desert, at which time Cassady and Baim claim to have been ""transspecied"" from desert falcons into their current form. The ramifications of this transformation are unclear, since there is no distinct linear narrative that I can make out. Yet each of these 14 solitary tracks are so much of a piece that the album seems almost to be one single prolonged arpeggio, the Metallic Falcons tracing their hypnotic shadowy arcs like a Sonora-bound Sigur Rós. To listeners familiar with her work in CocoRosie, Cassady is virtually unrecognizable in this expansive landscape-- and not just because of the bird costume. The Falcons' ambitious art-rock gives her much more room to experiment with her impressive, opera-trained vocal range, and the results bear little relation to CocoRosie's insular freak-folk romanticism.</p><p>
<em>Desert Doughnuts</em> also features appearances by Antony Hegarty, Devendra Banhart, Jana Hunter, and Tarantula A.D. drummer Greg Cosgrove. Despite this amassed firepower, however, the album has a gauzy, distanced production that often sounds as though the musicians and their recording equipment had been purposefully isolated in separate desert canyons. This diffuse recording method lends an appropriate sense of wide-open grandeur to airy tracks like ""Desert Cathedral"" or ""Misty Song"", but it does leave one to wonder exactly how many background details might have gotten lost in the wash.</p><p>
    Cosgrove's agile drumming is crucial to the design of complex pieces like ""Airships"" or the churning ""Snakes and Tea"", and most often his prog-inspired work is the only element here that makes any direct reference to actual metal techniques. The skeletal guitar on ""Berry Metal"" or the Hunter-sung ""Pale Dog"" flashes closer to the post-rock of Flying Saucer Attack than it does to any metal, and the spectral ""A Heart of Birdsong"" utilizes Banhart's electric guitar in what seems an almost direct homage to Loren Connors' minimalist duets with Suzanne Langille.</p><p>
    On tracks like ""Disparu"" or the opening processional ""Journey"", Cassady and Baim's vocals are often a lovely but impenetrable mass of layered whispers, their indistinct enunciation causing many of their lyrics to remain stubbornly elusive. Yet throughout the album the Falcons add subtle, unexpected flourishes-- e.g. the fluttering percussion of ""After Metal (Sound of Stars)"", or the ambient field recordings of ""Ocean""-- to reward the listener's close attention, allowing the duo to wordlessly cast their evocative spells. Mysterious and enrapturing, <em>Desert Doughnuts</em> will leave you eager to learn what other secrets might remain hidden behind the Metallic Falcons' curious disguises.<br/></p></div>"|9001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9001-desert-doughnuts/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

    Version albums not to be undertaken lightly. Versioning-- laying new vocals, effects, and/or instruments over a backing track-- is nearly as old as the Jamaican recording industry and an integral part of reggae and its attendant subgenres, so it makes sense that individual tracks have been made the subjects of entire records. Indeed, version albums have existed since the 1970s. They can be an illuminating listening experience when done properly. If not done well, however, a whole disc-- much less two, as on <em>Fisherman Style</em>-- can be a draining, monolithic listen.</p><p>
    The first trick is selecting a great backing track, and it's difficult to think of a better one than ""Fisherman"", from the Congos' landmark 1977 album <em>Heart of the Congos</em>. Lee Perry's hypnotic production is sumptuous-- densely layered and full of detail, yet subtle and drifting enough to not overpower the vocals on top. With so many elements in its mix, it's possible to manipulate the existing track and make it sound quite different from song to song, and the producers of this record, Congos members Roydel Johnson and Cedric Myton, freely do away with or rebalance each element based on what best suits each new performance.</p><p>
    The set is roughly divided in two, with most of the veteran contributors on Disc 1 and relative newcomers on Disc 2. (Longtime star Gregory Isaacs-- who actually contributed backing vocals to <em>Heart of the Congos</em>-- is oddly on the second disc.) The record kicks off with the original 1977 version, on which the three-part harmonies of Johnson, Myton, and Watty Burnett haunt Perry's vast echo chamber. This really isn't fair-- there was no way anyone else would come close to the original's sheer power. Big Youth, who has the unenviable task of following on its heels, at least provides a decent buffer with his toasting.
    </p>
<p>
    A list of huge names follows, including Max Romeo, Horace Andy, U-Roy, Dillinger, Sugar Minott, and Prince Jazzbo. Max Romeo does an especially great job of working out a completely original melody to fit the track, while Prince Jazzbo gets a boost from new vocals sung by Johnson and Myton. Saxophonist Dean Fraser provides an instrumental version, only to have Freddie McGregor swipe some of his horn arrangement to rejigger the backing track for his gritty ""Man Should Know"". Disc 2 also features an instrumental version in Mr. Raggamonica's melodica-drenched ""Fisherman Melody"".
    </p>
<p>
    The other younger artists on Disc 2 are naturally heavily influenced by dancehall. MacLaw's torrent of melodic toasting on ""Nuh Worry Your Mind"" works especially well, while Lutan Fyah, who will be huge if he plays his cards correctly, delivers the second disc's highlight on ""Whitewash Walls"", a dazzling display of vocal virtuosity that slips effortlessly from dense raps to drawn-out melodic phrases. The set ends with the original dub version of the song, a fitting bookend that puts Perry's warped genius on full display.
    </p>
<p>
    As good as most of the tracks are, though, the underlying fact is that these songs share the same backing track and the album can't help suffering as a whole for that fact. Your enjoyment of it will likely be rooted in your approach. Personally, I can't imagine often wanting to hear the whole thing straight through. Instead, I prefer to listen to a track or two at a time. But even if it's not something you're going to play end-to-end every time, this is a fitting tribute to a phenomenal song.

The set was compiled with the implicit design of uniting these separate generations along a single unbroken ancestral timeline, with each musician drawing upon a common pool of American Primitive traditions to create his own innovative and highly personalized work. In the short time since its release, the number of musicians working within these traditions has seemed to multiply both in the United States and abroad. So it's little surprise that Tompkins Square has assembled <em>Imaginational Anthem Vol. 2</em>, a sequel that once again pairs some of the leading lights of the current avant-folk subculture (James Blackshaw, Christina Carter, Sharron Kraus) with unearthed vintage folk rarities.</p><p>
    It's difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for the protracted boom in folk-based, fingerpicked guitar music, but one important factor is the ongoing re-discovery of John Fahey and his Takoma label's extended family tree. Since his death in 2001, Fahey's influence has come to dominate the American underground folk landscape. His extraordinary back catalog has undergone a series of renovations and additions, and his work continues to gather new disciples to the cause. And though Fahey himself does not appear on <em>Imaginational Anthem Vol. 2</em>, he remains a tangible presence throughout the album. Most of the old guard performers here-- Peter Lang, Fred Gerlach, Billy Faier-- recorded for Takoma at one time or another, and nearly all of the newcomers exhibit the direct influence of Fahey's syncretic style.</p><p>
    The real prize find among <em>Vol. 2</em>'s dozen tracks is a previously unreleased live performance of ""Kowaka d'Amour"" by Robbie Basho. Aside from Fahey, Basho was the most distinctive technician to emerge from the Takoma roster, and this pristine live recording finds him in top form. The dense, Eastern-tinged ""Kowaka d'Amour"" originally appeared on Basho's 1969 album <em>Venus in Cancer</em>, and here he navigates its intricate melodic corridors with a self-assured grace. Also revelatory are ""Devil's Brew"", a 1975 home recording by 12-string guitarist Fred Gerlach that blazes forth with an almost punk-like physical intensity, and ""New World Coming"", a new recording that finds veteran banjo player Billy Faier pushing his instrument to its percussive limits.
    </p><p>
    Alongside the work of these more established performers, some of the younger artists have to struggle a bit harder to differentiate themselves. Nevertheless, Rose and Blackshaw deliver typically jaw-dropping performances, while Carter contributes the hypnotic ""Ascend Mem"" with her trademark spirit-channeling minimalism. England's Kraus charts a similarly patient course on her solo banjo work ""Looking for the Hermit's Cave"", a captivating track that moves with the single-minded persistence of a bloodhound following a scent through the underbrush.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, such as on Peter Lang's circular, overlong ""Future Shot at the Rainbow"", <em>Imaginational Anthem Vol. 2</em> moves a little too close to the New Age climates that Fahey spent the latter stages of his career deriding. Tracks from younger guitarists like Jesse Sparhawk and Sweden's JosÈ Gonz·lez are exceedingly lovely, but lack the distinguishing characteristics necessary to immediately identify their authorship. Too much of the action still takes place within boundaries established by Fahey in the 1960s. One can't help but think that many of these voices might eventually be better off working in more collaborative formats, as Rose has with his group Pelt and Carter has with Charalambides. Until, that is, they're able to find as-yet-undiscovered new ways to wring true invention from their acoustic guitars.

While negative space can be deployed to great effect, too much of it will take the oomph out of a promising record, leaving sounds and ideas unexplored. When I first saw Young People in concert, I was floored by how much noise they could make with such little sound. The band's three members poked, plucked, and bowed their instruments, each miniscule articulation given enough room to speak volumes. Katie Eastburn's voice showed a hint of cultivated calm-- a whiff of impenetrability that somehow made the whole thing that much more interesting.</p><p>
    At their best, Young People understand that good negative space is dynamic negative space. The best songs on the band's previous full-length <em>War Prayers</em> and this January's F<em>ive Sunsets in Four Days</em> EP struck a fragile, tenuous balance between silence and cacophony. On <em>All at Once</em>, the group's first album as a two-piece, much of that tension is missing-- Young People still find their way to some incredible moments, but the paths that take them there are a good deal less inviting.</p><p>
    Opener ""R and R"" is promising: A piano figure plays as Eastburn repeats gravely, ""I do not want these flowers to/ But the flowers want to bloom."" Booming, regular percussion and a distant squeaking sound fill out the mix as the song progresses, subtly heightening its sense of claustrophobia. ""Forget"" boasts one of the album's strongest melodies, but never really develops it. In many ways, the transparency that can make Young People's music so moving stifles <em>All at Once</em>; every little addition and subtraction seems too evident, too obvious, and too detached from the ebbs and flows of the songs themselves.</p><p>
    The second half of the album is more rewarding. ""Reapers"" sounds like it was recorded inside a storm cloud, all brooding ambiance and ominous beauty. The song's coda, in which muffled cymbal crashed cradle Eastburn's ""We'll never know/ How it goes,"" is the most affecting and memorable moment on <em>All at Once</em>. ""F"" is upbeat and deeply enchanting, save for a dissonant, rumbling interlude toward its end. Young People have always excelled at these grand textural changes, and while <em>All at Once</em> doesn't contain many of them, the few that remain are stunning.</p><p>
    It's easy to criticize a two-piece band for being overly minimal, but Young People are one of the few that could have pulled off a record like this. I keep revisiting the album in the hopes that there's more to it than first meets the ear, but Young People have never been the kind of band to keep things hidden. <em>All at Once</em> is exactly what it seems, and at times it feels pretty flimsy.<br/></p></div>"|9002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9002-all-at-once/|6.6|Matt LeMay

Whether it was cultivated by the band or foisted upon them by journalists, the ""Beautiful Loser"" archetype was made for these guys, and it's been an inseparable part of their persona since the first shipment of <em>Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash</em> left the Twin-Tone offices.</p><p>
    The Replacements were the perfect band for a certain breed of American rock critic. They started out vaguely punk, but nothing about them was threatening, political, or arty; they were regular guys-- scruffy, Midwestern, anti-fashion and anti-pop; they hid an emotional vulnerability beneath cases of beer and fuck-up hijinks; they should've been huge, but the record-buying public and the New York suits never figured out what they had. Etc.</p><p>
    You can sense that the myth is starting to fade a bit. A slew of spotty Paul Westerberg solo albums, generally shoddy treatment of the back catalog, and indie rock's trending away from their trad brand of rock have caused the Replacements to slip from view relative to many of the bands they came up with in the 1980s. Of the bands in Michael Azzerad's essential <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life,</em> the Replacements seem particularly distant from what's happening now.</p><p>
    In some quarters fans are trying to shore up The Replacements position by talking about influence. Nirvana is often mentioned, which makes some sense at first because they played loud rock and Kurt Cobain had a scratchy voice. The Replacements even had a song called ""Nevermind"". But the comparison doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Cobain was enamored of capital-a Art and all its pretensions; he thought of himself as a feminist and obsessed over childhood. Westerberg thought ""art"" was short for ""Arthur"" and values in his songs were traditional. Now Goo Goo Dolls and Ryan Adams, on the other hand...</p><p>
    So if the myth is fading and the influence is questionable, all we're left with are the records. And Westerberg's best songs still resonate. This set collects 18 from the Replacements' original days and adds two recent songs cut with the surviving members. It's the first compilation to include tracks from both Twin-Tone (84 and before, indie) and Sire (85 and after, major), and is thus fated to replace the Sire-only singles and rarities two-fer <em>All for Nothing/Nothing for All</em>.</p><p>
    The selection and sequencing of <em>Don't You Know Who I Think I Was</em> is generally smart, hitting most of the agreed-upon highs. The various albums are represented in their proper proportions based on quality, with <em>Tim</em> getting the most songs (four) and <em>Stink</em> and <em>All Shook Down</em> getting the fewest (one each). It's set up more like a mix-tape than a survey, leading to a couple of strange juxtapositions. Leading off the <em>Tim</em> selections with ""Here Comes a Regular"" is jarring; if any song was meant to be an album closer, it's this. With its crawling pace and downcast mood, it throws up a huge speedbump when listening to this comp straight through.</p><p>
    Something else happens when ""Alex Chilton"" introduces the Pleased to Meet Me selections, as the booming drums seem to come from another world than the dinky snare of the Tommy Ramone-produced <em>Tim.</em> The Replacements never could figure out what sort of production worked with Westerberg's songs. <em>Tim</em> was a thin and trebly disaster, which was most apparent on rockers like ""Bastards of Young"", while <em>Pleased to Meet Me</em> and <em>Don't Tell a Soul </em>were overproduced in different ways. Their best-sounding stuff by far is the Twin-Tone material, which is too bad since Westerberg generally improved as a songwriter with each record. ""Skyway"" is one of the sharpest and most affecting ballads of the college rock era, and ""I'll Be You"" might be Westerberg's peak, with an entire world of feeling held inside the opening word ""If"".</p><p>
    Oh yeah, two new songs. ""Message to the Boys"" essentially finishes writing the music to Westerberg's skeletal solo debut ""Waiting for Somebody"" from the <em>Singles</em> soundtrack. Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal described it as a loyal farewell rather than a new beginning, and that seems exactly right. It's warm and nostalgic and not trying too hard. ""Pool and Dive"" is almost as good, sounding more like a channeling of the Big Star influence, the brash power-pop side of the Replacements given room to breathe. Bands reuniting for new songs to stick on a best-of always puts fans on the edge of their seats, braced for embarrassment. But the Replacements get out quickly with dignity intact.</p><p>
    Hearing the 18 songs from the band's original run, the consistency of Westerberg's themes stands out. He built his own little world brick-by-brick, populated it with original characters, and wrote some very catchy tunes about what goes on there. He was like an indie-rock Springsteen, relentlessly chronicling adolescence and early adulthood. In his world everyone is 17, 18, 19 or 20, the grown-ups sound like Charlie Brown's teacher, people gossip, the jobs stink, boredom is rampant, and escape is possible through music and love. Given the aching familiarity of this landscape and Westerberg's eye for detail, the Replacements will always be around.</p></div>"|9037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9037-dont-you-know-who-i-think-i-was-the-best-of-the-replacements/|8.8|Mark Richardson

    I'm pretty sure Evangelicals aren't actual evangelicals, but their debut album seems bound to blind faith, a fearless lack of direction or discretion. It figures that they come from Oklahoma, the buckle of the Bible Belt and an unlikely wellspring for freakazoid pop bands like the Flaming Lips. There must be something in the water. But where Wayne Coyne can now afford a proper filtration system, the Evangelicals are lapping up whatever non-purified, mystical elixir flows through the town by the trough-load, and they seem gleefully unconcerned if they piss their pants doing it.</p><p>
    Evangelicals don't have beards, but sound like they should. On their scruffy surface, they're a trio of cosmic cowboys following a  path laid down by Grandaddy and currently trod-upon by Band of Horses-- artists making music that evokes open skies and horizons stretching for moonlit miles. What sets Evangelicals apart is a refreshing lack of preciousness. Singer and guitarist Josh Jones may possess a fidgety, helium-high quiver endemic to sensitive guys in indie rock bands, but the tone of his voice has more to do with agility than fragility.</p><p>
    The tracks on <em>So Gone</em> don't rock and roll, twist and shout, or perform any of the standard motor functions we expect of pop songs. Instead, they accelerate, crash, reboot, reformat: ""Another Day (And Yoor Still Knocked Out)"" sucks you into a whirling dervish of early Dino Jr. guitar-screech and vacuum-cleaner squall that quickly corrects itself in time for Jones' languid verses. These songs are restless and often literally breathless-- ""Here Comes Trouble"" actually stops its galloping opening riff for a quick open-mouth gasp of air. Even more assured turns like the jingle-jangle morning glory of ""Diving"" or the Stuart Murdoch-worthy jaunt ""What An Actress Does Best"" give way to light-headedness and eventually lose their equilibrium through jarring rave-ups, stuttering drum beats, left-field distorto-guitar solos, or the emergence of ghostly hums from the shadows. <em>So Gone</em> is spacious and expansive, but also oddly tactile-- the sonic details aren't purposefully introduced, they just intrude when they feel like it.

    Like the Lips, it'd be easy to attribute Evangelicals' apparent instability to chemical concerns, but doing so would discount the graceful gait of ""My Headache"", a swooning ballroom waltz that ponders the inverse relationship between love and insanity. To secular observers, religion strikes a similarly precarious balance between faith and foolishness, and that's what ultimately ties Evangelicals to their small-e namesakes: The fine line between speaking the truth and speaking in tongues.

    The Old Haunts are a guitar-based indie rock band. From Washington State. With a yowly-voiced singer. Technically, we shouldn't be able to pick the group out of a lineup if they'd mugged us. But the Old Haunts aren't completely indistinguishable from all the rest. While they take cues from common influences-- a bit from hardcore, a bit more from 80s college rock, a pinch from early-90s alternative and late-90s indie-- they take very different cues from these sources, emphasizing moody tension over catchy drama.</p><p>
    The band has developed their sound over three years and three EPs, which in 2005 were collected on disk as <em>Fallow Field</em>, a hit-or-miss assemblage that showed them toying and tinkering with their approach as they ran through a succession of drummers. The band's first proper full-length, <em>Fuel on Fire</em>, introduces a fourth drummer, Curtis James, whose pounding anchors the band's scrappy swamp-punk assault. Once again, Craig Extine pits his guitar against Scott Seckington's bass (which sounds like another guitar most of the time) in a ""Beat It""-style knife fight. Their noise bursts forth suddenly on ""Death on the Sickbed"", creating an intense finale, and simmers tensely on ""Wasted Day"", as if likely to explode at any moment. On a few songs, Seckington brings in a piano or organ to referee, but generally the spare, elemental sound bolsters the album's testy paranoia and Extine's eloquent disaffection. His lyrics balance a gut-reaction disgust at the world with a precarious optimism. He's too outraged to stand idly by and watch the world destroy itself, but his anxieties prevent action. This insoluble conflict instills <em>Fuel on Fire</em> with a prickly rage that makes those guitars sound even more menacing.</p><p>
    So <em>Fuel on Fire</em> represents a great stride for the Old Haunts, even if it sounds limited. Especially on the second half, the tracks begin to bleed into one another, with the same sparring guitars and the same spastic drumming. Partly this is because Extine seems to write only verses-- choruses are absent and bridges exceptionally rare on these songs-- and partly because the niche the band carved for itself proves too small and cramped. While it considerably lessens the songs' impact, this strict consistency is mostly a minor flaw on an otherwise distinguished album.

    Man, the Lightning Bolt guys are everywhere. Beyond participating in real-deal art exhibitions (we're talking <em>Artforum</em> reviews) and publishing day-glo comics, the two Brians are showcasing their musical skills in various extracurricular projects. Along with rocking it in Mindflayer, Brian Chippendale also maintains his one-man band, Black Pus, releasing hand-screened CD-R's on his diarreahRama label. His bass-toting partner, Brian Gibson, is equally restless. Load recently put out his Sponge Bob-cum-Harry Pussy cartoon bonanza, <em>Barkley's Barnyard Critters: A Mystery Tail</em> DVD, which Gibson soundtracked with his two-man side-project, Wizardzz, who have concurrently dropped their debut full-length, <em>Hidden City of Taurmond</em>.</p><p>
    In Wizardzz, Gibson forgoes his bass duties and gives drums a go-- not surprisingly, this jack of every trade has skills. His break-beats, open-ended jazzercise inflections, and fucked-up disco hits combine with Bug Sized Mind's Rich Porter, whose crystal-cave synth lines flesh out the band's sound.</p><p>
    Despite the heavy pounding, this is <em>not</em> a noise record. Wizardzz's fairy-tale waltzes and fun-house soundtracks are genuinely poppy, and even when things implode, the dust is often glittery. There's a sci-fi feel á la Dr. Who; occasionally, I hear a bit of, well, <em>the</em> Who. Or at least Pete Townshend's synthesizer. Trust me: One of the trills on ""Diamond Mirror"" pays homage to ""Baba O'Riley"". Maybe ""Wizardzz"" is a riff on the Pinball Wizard-- why not? It makes sense, considering the arcade-game sounds this Providence duo create.
    </p>
<p>
    Then comes the progressive rock. ""Sailship"" could be re-titled ""Starship""-- it sounds like some old dude on the organ at your local church playing ELO. ""Chasing Our Shadow"" gets crunkier in the drum department; the keys, though, are a Tangerine Dream of a guy riffing Steve Vai. ""Do Come in (Tea And Chulliwigs)"" could be a prog'n'Bach-lovin' dandy set loose during the seventh-inning stretch at Shea.
    </p>
<p>
    The album has a number of sugary/catchy up-tempo pieces-- some start to wear thin in their fucking cheeriness. <em>Hidden City of Taurmond</em> 's most enjoyable moments occur when things freak out-- the circus drops back and the palette get overloaded, cracking into Art Blakey spasmodic: the clattering, sweaty ""Sea Battle At Orkusk"" or the synthy, post-jazz apocalypse of ""Ambushed By Time Quagga"". ""Lady Dragons"" is a few minutes of radio static and tiny rock swirls before it blows up into a skin-rattling workout. When Gibson gets entropic, his swampy drum loops are undeniable.
    </p>
<p>
    There aren't enough of these, though, and at 44 minutes <em>Hidden City of Taurmond</em> is too long. Eventually, what started out as frenetic feels listless. That said, pay attention to closer ""Mimi Vivian Sunrise (Live)"". In a club or practice space setting, the mix is stunning, focusing on all of Wizardzz's best elements: the vibe becomes acid-house/psychedelic/shoegaze fuzz, the synths approximate distorted guitars, the drums overwhelm, and the sugary sunbursts are toppled with grime. You can see masked Gibson and Porter play somewhere on the <em>Barkley</em> DVD. In that footage, a dude with stylish hair attempts to bite one of the cymbals, as if it's candy, or better yet, some drug that'll take him straight to Taurmond. So while these 14 tracks offer a few stunners, Wizardzz seem to be an especially ecstatic live band. Wonder if they can fit a concert album into the busy schedule; either that, or Steve Albini needs to remix this fucker.

    In 2005, the Melvins were approached by the folks behind the All Tomorrow's Parties festival to take part in what was dubbed their ""Don't Look Back"" series. The idea was simple enough; legendary bands, including Gang of Four, Dinosaur Jr., and Mudhoney, performed one of their classic records live, in its entirety. The Melvins selected their 1993 major-label breakthrough, <em>Houdini</em>, arguably the band's most direct and concise statement. To play the show, Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover filled the band's revolving bass position with Trevor Dunn (Mr. Bungle, Fantômas), then had to re-learn and update songs Osborne admits the band ""never intended to play live."" Pleased with the performance, they realized after the fact that it would've made a nice live record.</p><p>
    What to do? The band could've played more dates, treating fans on this side of the pond to the special rendition of the album. But, instead, they rented a warehouse, set up their equipment, rehearsed, and then recorded the set twice to an ""invitation only"" crowd. And that's Problem No. 1 with the disc: While it's technically live, it lacks the crowd-fueled energy of a proper concert album. The band is there, playing together, and it's certainly looser  than the studio recording, but there is no crowd noise; instead of capturing a freewheeling mood, it just sounds like the band rehearsing in a warehouse-- which is, of course, exactly what it is.</p><p>
    The track order is rearranged slightly, giving the impression that this is a re-imagining of the classic album. The first track here is ""Pearl Bomb"", transformed from a mechanical throb with meandering, repetitive bass and paranoid vocals into a frantic assault of rapid-fire drumming and heavy guitar riffing. The rest of the way, things fall into more straightforward renditions. ""Hooch"" is sped up, but in the same way any band plays their material faster on stage. After glancing at the song's length, I was expecting something new from ""Night Goat"", which now clocks in at over seven minutes where it once was a shade under five. But instead of offering anything new and engaging, it simply begins with a couple of minutes of droning feedback.
    </p>
<p>
    There are surprises sprinkled throughout, but they're few and far between. This incarnation of ""Set Me Straight"" now transforms into the upbeat punk of ""DCH"" about a minute in, for example. And though the differences are subtle, the disc-closing ""Spread Eagle Beagle"" breathes with new life. The original's sprawling, warped percussion is accentuated here by the addition of digital noise and static, and the band used the studio to distort and pan what was played live. But while it is a little interesting to hear the band revisit some of these songs, ultimately these louder, slightly faster versions pale in comparison to the originals, leaving <em>A Live History of Gluttony and Lust</em> far from essential.

    The title of Sonic Youth's newest album references a defunct Berkeley, Calif., record store, but it's also a fitting description for the band's tautest set in 25 years. As the militaristic stencils on the cover suggest, these 12 tracks add up to one super chiseled physique; critics needn't exaggerate <em>Rather Ripped</em>'s concision, though, Sonic Youth manage to sneak in all sorts of noisy accents, oddball tunings, and crescendo transitions into their so-called pop record.</p><p>
    That, and it's a grower. After my initial runs through, I appreciated the pristine guitar sound, but the majority of the songs felt boring (over time hooks bloomed). Yet it also proves that New York's premier avant-garde group can write catchy tunes without dipping too deeply into its bag of cracked guitar tricks. Doused with sleek and slippery riffs, the album's early succession of propulsive, three-minute art-pop songs is especially strong.</p><p>
    The other most striking aspect of the album is that there are more Kim Gordon tracks than on most recent outings. She makes good use of the face time, turning in her best work since ""Kissibility"" and ""Kool Thing"". On ""Reena"" she reminds someone, presumably husband/bandmate Thurston Moore, that ""you keep me coming home again,"" despite her, uh, intense friendship with another woman. Both it and her ""Turquoise Boy"" feature brief Glenn Branca-like breakdowns before returning to Lee Ranaldo and Moore's shiny guitar playing. On the slinky ""Jams Run Free"", Gordon breathily intones, ""We love the jams."" <em>Rather Ripped</em> has plenty of those.
    </p>
<p>
    Moore's first vocal turn comes on the catchy slip'n'slide single ""Incinerate."" Not an update of Big Black's ""Kerosene"", it may be a love song with over-cooked metaphors or perhaps some actual immolation: ""I ripped your heart of your chest/ Replaced it with a grenade blast...you dosed my soul with gasoline/ You flicked a match into my brain.""
    </p>
<p>
    The strongest track is ""Do You Believe in Rapture"". Set against a backwash of noise, 16-carat ""Bull in the Heather"" strums, and the coupling of a lightly thumping drum machine with Steve Shelley on the real deal, it feels like <em>Daydream Nation</em>'s piano burning ""Providence"" turned inside out by Yo La Tengo. Out of nowhere (or maybe out of one guitar strand), it shifts into pop prettiness.
    </p>
<p>
    Somewhere just after the middle of the album, things loose a little oomph, especially on ho-hum tour-diary closer ""Or"". (Though some of its spare sound does echo ""Do You Believe in Rapture"".) On it, Moore begins by describing a girl with ""canisters of whipped cream"" in her ""sweater pockets"" and ends recounting various fan questions, culminating with the queries: ""What comes first? The music or the words?"" On this one, it was hopefully the music. There are a couple late-stage keepers: ""The Neutral""'s crystalline guitar parts drop like snow (again, it's a Kim track) and the longer ""Pink Steam"", a slow-build Moore lust song, is gorgeously windswept and violently romantic.
    </p>
<p>
    The latter brings up something important: ""Pink Steam""'s named after a great collection of diaristic essays, confessional memoirs, and literary tidbits by San Francisco author Dodie Bellamy. I didn't need to look that one up but as a kid, I used Sonic Youth lyrics and liner notes as reading lists-- they led me to Gerhard Richter, Mike Kelley, Richard Kern, Raymond Carver, d.a. levy, and more. They've always been important for bringing downtown NYC's overlapping traditions of art/music/literature to punk kids. Go back to those early records to check out who did the art work for them and read the thank you's. Pre-internet, this was the way to get an underground education.
    </p>
<p>
    Talking to Moore recently for Pitchfork, he said noise's popularity and accessibility seems as a good reason as any to create a relatively noise-free album. He's right: Sonic Youth needn't bother impressing folks at this point. That history can also work against them, but it's boring to parade out each classic and see just how <em>Rather Ripped</em> stacks up to it. So, hey, let's just say it's great to hear Kim, Lee, Steve, and Thurston making an album that sounds beautifully invigorated and goes down smoothly.

    It's no secret that Regina Spektor has some quirks. As a songwriter and performer, she hoards eccentricities like the Collyer brothers (Google it). She hiccups and yawps, breaks syllables against their grain, beatboxes unself-consciously, belts like Ethel Merman, recites like Patti Smith, coos like Tori Amos, shrieks like a Kate Bush for the <em>McSweeney’s</em> set. And her songwriting, in addition to occasionally folding in snippets of “Hava Nagila”, makes frequent, often humorous use of pop culture references, anachronisms, dream imagery, even made-up words. And yet, these eccentricities allow unfriendly listeners to keep Spektor at a distance, dismissing her feminine presence as cutesily affected while indulging the endless costume changes of Gnarls Barkley and the sniping whine of Conor Oberst.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But eccentricity isn’t her defining characteristic. That would be her native intelligence, which shows through in every note. Spektor is a street-smart songwriter masquerading as a book-smart one, with a self-awareness that can be endearingly goofy. Spektor can profess her love for “November Rain” and paraphrase the Madame de Pompadour without stretching, showboating, or seeming academic.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This quality-- her smarts-- is present in every aspect of her new album, <em>Begin to Hope,</em> except perhaps in its made-for-TV-movie title. Her third full-length and first recorded under her major-label contract, the record was produced by Dave Kahne, who has turned knobs for the Bangles, Paul McCartney, and, um, Sugar Ray. Under his direction, <em>Begin to Hope</em> sounds expensive: There’s a hermetic studio quality to the tones, a studied three dimensionality in the interplay of instruments, and a perfectionism in the mix that suggests a bigger budget and a nicer studio. Elegant beats sculpted from orchestral samples adorn opener “Fidelity” and “On the Radio”, while precisely calibrated synths enter and exit on cue. “Hotel Song” trips along on a snappy drumbeat and a spritely chorus that has the professional bearing of Brill Building pop. On “Lady”, a paean to Billie Holiday, Spektor duets with a mournful jazz band that cuts in and out abruptly like a staticky transmission from the past.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    One downside to this crisp production is the loss of place: 2001’s <em>11:11</em> and 2003’s <em>Soviet Kitsch</em> both sounded like they could have been recorded in some smoky Bronx bar or in a friend’s living room, but <em>Begin to Hope</em> evokes no particular setting or venue. Nevertheless, Spektor sounds confident and comfortable. Her songwriting remains as testy and idiosyncratic as ever-- as well as ambitious. With all the fanfare and bombast of a battle hymn, “Apres Moi” is a Spektorian epic about the weight of mortality and heritage. She sings from the perspective of a statue, perhaps the one she sung about in “Us”. She rewrites the Beatitudes to instill a little paranoia: “Be afraid of the lame, they’ll inherit your legs/ Be afraid of the old, they’ll inherit your soul”. Then there’s that Madame de Pompadour reference: “Apres moi le deluge/ After me comes the flood,” she sings defiantly, as if the Russians have just defeated her very own Franco-Austrian armies. Spektor sings a verse in Russian, then leads the song to an stirring finale featuring a small symphony led by a rickety drum set. The song would sound like a stunt if it didn’t make so much sense and have so much feeling behind it.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Occasionally, though, Spektor can overdo it. On “That Time”, she recounts a string of friendly reminiscences: “Remember that time I ate only tangerines for a month,” she asks some unnamed companion before intoning, “So cheap and JUI-cy!” At the end she turns the song on its head with the sudden memory, “Remember that time you OD’ed?” The change in tone is a little too obvious and complete, like a movie with a cheap twist ending. Still, Spektor is bold enough almost to sell the song, and on the whole her performance throughout <em>Begin to Hope</em> exhibits new levels of control and direction, reaching a point where the song and the singing are inseparable.

    On wide-ruled loose-leaf with cursive signatures and loopy flowers doodled in the margins, it sounded awful. Conor Oberst founded the unfortunately titled Team Love, an imprint whose flagship band was Tilly and the Wall, an Omaha indie pop group that featured members of Oberst's lapsed teen-pop band Park Ave. and a tap-dancer instead of a drummer. Those of us who like our indie pop with a dash of sophistication couldn't be blamed for rolling our eyes at the extravagant whimsy of it all. And when <em>Wild Like Children</em> arrived, its paeans to teenage urgency were packed with every expected measure of fanciful sincerity, but its exuberance and sound musicianship rendered its potentially grating aspects charming, transcending mawkish nostalgia and engendering real pathos. In Tilly's world, ""raucous"" wasn't a sneaky shorthand for ""sloppy,"" and ""childlike"" wasn't a euphemism for ""stupid""-- Tilly addressed the frissons of youth with the nuance and precision of adult hindsight.</p><p>
    Paradoxical as it sounds, <em>Bottoms of Barrels</em> is an even more mature take on immaturity. The songs are infectious, usually visceral, booming with bright, big-hearted melodies and densely speckled with tap-dancer Jamie Williams' clattering cascades. Multiple songs make express mention of the very act they inspire-- the wanton stomping of feet. Two in particular comprise the most memorable music to emerge from Omaha in recent memory. ""Rainbows in the Dark"" has a woozy melody that billows over a crisp rhythm. Neely Jenkins's mobile vocals cover every available inch of space, surging and subsiding through deft register shifts. The music's energetic crackle is matched by its lyrics, where a dizzying torrent of images reels like a runaway carousel-- fights break out; the neighborhood boys buzz with joy; a punk record shoots stars; a city spins light; and it's all bound together by ""the stitching of beautiful seams."" And ""Bad Education"", with its lithe gypsy swagger, finds Jenkins's voice sawing like a fiddle, ticking off a digest of calamitous escape, tugging at seatbelts, leaping from saddles, kneeling at steeples. The whole record bristles with energy, but the sheer <em>chutzpah</em> of these two songs is difficult to overstate.</p><p>
    Tilly's at their best when Jenkins and Derek Pressnall are trading lines like mash notes; the songs where Pressnall takes the lead tend to be more maudlin and less lively, pretty but soft-focused without Jenkins's ragged edge. The gentle acoustic lilt of ""Love Song"" is typical post-Bright-Eyes sensitive boy fare: ""As we removed each others clothes/ I thought I would sing some notes/ So that maybe you would slow dance with me."" And ""Coughing Colors"" is a slow-building, harmony-bathed piano ballad of almost satiric tenderness. These numbers are a bit syrupy, but actually strike a nice contrast to the greater part of the album's hectic gallop, and Pressnall lodges a more vigorous vocal performance on the incantatory ""Sing Songs Along"".  Kianna Alarid, the group's third vocalist, takes on the occasional torch song as well, most notably the lovely lament ""Lost Girls"".
    </p>
<p>
    Tilly and the Wall's music is childlike in the sense that it celebrates the tactile and emotional world with the verve of unjaded perception; organs of pure sense probe the enticing recesses of the night. Their music is a prism that refracts the wonder of the human pageant from various angles, making familiar colors bend fantastically. It doesn't deny harsh realties-- Tilly's world of teenage knife fights and drunken bra-clasp fumblings doesn't elide homeless women walking the snow; a prostitute with ""money spilling out of her hands;"" ""the newly born crying, realizing what life is"" or a grandfather's weathered eyes. Tilly blurs them all into a giddy compendium of humanity, at once acknowledging and renouncing the possibility of despair: ""The world is big and it's got a loose heart/ So you either start screaming or start singing.""

    ""If the waves were a little longer, the light/ Would be violet and visible and life/ Would be beautiful,"" Ben Lerner writes in ""Mean Free Path"". Color is Growing's métier, but it's also just a function of light, and since Growing focus on subtly graded shades, angles, and refractions (with the occasional bold primary for contrast), it's fair to say that each of their four LPs-- including <em>Color Wheel</em>-- has been a study in audibly rendering distinct qualities of light. The shimmering and rattle-flecked gloss of ""Fancy Period"" is the most evocative of an actual color wheel. Percussive bolts of static sputter across the channels, revolving like radial spokes; variegated color blurs around the hub, occasionally bursting into brightly drenched hues. Beyond that it's mostly effulgence, bending uncannily through the air.</p><p>
    The duo's effects-laden guitar meditations aren't timid, but they are soothing, even numbing, and womblike-- an aural amniotic fluid. <em>Color Wheel</em> doesn't stray far from Growing's signature sound: Idyllic drones struggle and periodically fail to contain outsized slabs of Tortoise-caliber distorted guitar that violently rupture the placid surfaces. Tracks like the brief ""Cumulusless"", where runnels of delayed guitar slalom around shrill bleats, flirt with surprisingly songlike dynamics, but for the most part, it's textbook Growing. ""Friendly Confines"" opens with washy layers of post-Eno ambiance, delayed guitars in a languid end-over-end freefall through a haze of fluttery pastels and deep browns; a low rumble gradually wells up into one of the massively distorted, major key anthem-fragments that pock the record like the Kool-Aid Man bursting through the sonic wallpaper. The novocaine overdose ""Blue Angels"" evokes a maximalist Keith Fullerton Whitman with its protracted and minutely graded hum.</p><p>
    Many musical trends emerge from concerns of style and innovation, but this sort of non-confrontational drone is a product of sheer exigency. Our world isn't geared toward serenity-- engines rumble, televisions blare, tinny music blasts from public speakers, people bray into cell phones. In this context, Growing seem less like musicians than monks or shamanistic healers, salving distressed ears with their salutary musical Zen. This music really occurs in the live setting, where you can see the audio-luminescence assembled piece by piece, and <em>Color Wheel</em> fairly captures that essence. So the record's main flaw is completely beyond the group's control-- committing something so immediate and spontaneous to tape always dims its aura, and <em>Color Wheel</em> has the potential to lose its luster with repetition. It's like mandala that's been glazed for preservation-- pretty, but sacrificing the deeper beauty of the ephemeral for permanence.

    On paper, Mobb Deep's decision to sign to G-Unit wasn't all that insane. For one thing, it's not like they had anything else going on; the Queens duo peaked years ago, they hadn't been taken seriously since Jay-Z bashed them, and they were getting clumsier and more desperate every year. For another, the duo's stark, nihilistic early work was a pretty clear influence on fellow Queens native 50 Cent, whose <em>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</em> was the bleakest, most violent big-selling rap album since DMX debuted. The big difference between the two camps was always in surliness. For all his gun-talk, 50 Cent is an optimist at heart, and his good-natured sing-songy hooks have a goofy, self-satisfied warmth. Mobb Deep have never been warm or optimistic, and their wispily claustrophobic mid-90s output set new standards for bloody paranoia. For this to work, they'd have to find some happy medium between two fundamentally opposed dispositions.</p><p>
    Mobb Deep only pull off that balance once, on ""Pearly Gates"", a sunny track by Exile. Over a gorgeously lilting gospel sample, 50 Cent stays happy and congenial even when he's rapping about how everyone wants him in prison and then delivering a perfect little chorus: ""Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good/ Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood."" Havoc has a nice verse about redemption and Prodigy, the Mobb's craggily hoarse frontman, changes everything with one about how he hates God; it's stunning in its vicious rage (""For leaving us out to dry in straight poverty/ For not showing me no signs they watching over me""). It's a great moment, but you wouldn't know it from <em>Blood Money</em>'s commercial release. Some Interscope bean-counter decided the song was too volatile and blurred out all the fuck-God stuff, rendering a potentially powerful song toothless.</p><p>
    The rest of the time, Prodigy sabotages himself, leaving behind his harsh gutter-speak for clubbed-up money-talk. That's not a bad thing in itself, but Mobb Deep can't pull off triumphant, and so their boasts sound empty and joyless, and their misogyny is mechanistic-- just as boring as it is objectionable. Worse, Havoc and Prodigy can barely ride their own beats anymore; they sound beaten-down and defeated.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Blood Money</em> works when the two look back to times when G-Unit money wasn't on the table, remembering themselves as poor Queens kids longing for dirtbikes on ""Daydreamin'"", talking about getting their first guns on ""The Infamous"". Musically, some of the tracks are breathtaking; on ""Click Click"" and ""Its Alright"", Havoc takes G-Unit club-rap and makes it harsh and queasy, signifiers of smoothness rubbing up against each other just wrong. And Prodigy can still be truly menacing when he offers chilling specificity: ""Gunpowder resi on the sleeve of my Pelle."" But too much of <em>Blood Money</em> represents something sad and fascinating-- two demons domesticated, two artists who have willfully transformed themselves into hucksters.

     Over the past couple of years, the Cartoon Network has slowly shifted its target market from a grade-school audience to a more reliable demographic: stoners. Sure, since the channel's origin, the overnight schedule-- with its trippy reruns of 1970s fare like ""The Harlem Globetrotters"" and ""Wacky Races""-- appealed to viewers under the influence. But since the advent, and subsequent rapid expansion, of its original Adult Swim programming, the network has seemingly tailored its programming to college students and late-night tokers, two groups with a pretty big overlap on a Venn diagram. Not for nothing is the block's most popular show about talking fast food.</p><p>
      Where cartoons and weed are being prioritized, you're sure to find MF Doom, so it was no surprise that his collaboration with fellow Topps Future Star Danger Mouse ended up being Adult Swim-affiliated. Just as cartoons like ""Sealab"" and ""Harvey Birdman""-- with their pregnant pauses, quarter-hour runtime, and no-plot plots-- are suited to the marijuana mind, so too are Doom and Danger's loping beats, clever rhymes, and tee-hee dialogue snippets.</p><p>
      Yet even with this compatibility, Danger Doom's debut album, <em>The Mouse and the Mask</em>, suffered from the diminishing rewards of its constant cartoon-voice intrusions. Like many hip-hop skits, the samples were funny at first, tedious at third, and unbearable by the fifth listen-- in no small part due to the irritating frequency range used by most Adult Swim voice actors (all three of them). Only with Danger Doom, the skits <em>were</em> the songs in a lot of cases, making a surgical skit-ectomy procedure on one's iPod impossible, and contaminating highlights like Ghostface's fiery verse on ""The Mask"".
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Occult Hymn</em> EP, a free download available at adultswim.com, is suffused with snippets from second-tier Adult Swim shows. The Cartoon Network's graveyard shift has started to Xerox itself with shows like ""Squidbillies"" (a hick ""ATHF"") and ""12 oz. Mouse"" (the asymptote of the block's crude style), and so appropriately this epilogue album is largely made up of remixes and sequels, with only one purely original track, the ho-hum ""Korn Dogz"". For both cartoon and record, these echoes are mere dilutions of the original, save Madlib's elevator-music makeover of ""Space Ho's"".
    </p>
<p>
      Danger Mouse and MF Doom can be forgiven for phoning a few in, given the various large-scale projects the producers are currently busy promoting and preparing.  Nonetheless, the new versions on <em>Occult Hymn</em> largely strip back the mutated Saturday morning theme songs of the original in favor of tired jazz-loop wallpaper, with both the ""El Chupa Libre"" and ""Sofa King"" remixes relying on generic electric-piano fusion. Doom, meanwhile, sounds drained on his new verses, laboring to conjure an extended <em>Back to the Future</em> reference on ""Chupa"", and sprinkling in lukewarm accolades about the new Adult Swim fare.
    </p>
<p>
      You can't hate too hard on a free EP though, and as promotional material and branding maneuver, the Danger Doom collaboration has been an unqualified success. There could be worse music-industry innovations than a patronage industry for rappers to make songs about their favorite TV shows; I'd definitely right-click on a Cam track about ""Mythbusters"" or Kanye rhapsodizing about ""Project Runway"". However, the pitch has to reflect the product being sold, and <em>The Occult Hymn</em>'s second drafts don't reflect the bizarre pacing and twisted humor of Adult Swim the way <em>The Mouse and the Mask</em>'s highlights did.  Even when your audience is predominantly stoners, you can't get away with half-grassing it.

Harry Nilsson, mild-mannered banker by day before being propped up by John Lennon and Paul McCartney as the fabbest songwriter they knew, was one of those guys you read about being able to sing out of the phonebook and make it work. He had a bizarre, almost too-bountiful-for-its-own-good talent that combined sarcasm, dry wit, pure songwriting chops, and a personal buoyancy that usually offset even his most self-defeating, throwaway lines. His best stuff-- pretty much everything he released in 1970-71-- was unlike any major recording artist, juggling disparate aspects of pop music (and even pop culture in general, check his animated short/soundtrack <i>The Point</i> for New Age idealism crossed with acid-damaged imagery) with the whirlwind pace at which he was living.</p>
<p>So, Nilsson was an Icarus. He teetered over the edge both musically and physically, indulging passions for melody and liquor as if both were going out of style. When he and Lennon hooked up in the early 70s, during Lennon's famed ""lost weekend,"" it was like an excuse for both men to give in to every addiction, bad idea (and even a few good ones), and rock'n'roll clichŽ they'd managed to avoid before. For Nilsson, it wasn't totally destructive: He scored several major hits off his <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i> LP. It was a desperate record that, even if it didn't necessarily fall back on the Beatlesque songcraft he'd flashed on his earlier stuff, was overflowing with charismatic bravado and the sometimes-ragged voice of someone who'd inhaled more than his fair share of smoke.</p>
<p>However, if <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i> was desperate, <i>Son of Schmilsson</i> sounded a little bored. Or drunk. Or something you'd imagine a ridiculously talented singer might come up with as an afterthought before heading out for the night. It's not that the songs are terrible: ""Remember (Christmas)"", hokey title aside, is a classic Nilsson ballad, perhaps taking a cue from his pal Randy Newman, but delivered with a nuance that sounds very close to sincerity. Nilsson had a knack for being able to make almost any line, any tongue-in-cheek turn of melodic phrase seem warm, even optimistic in the face of whatever foolery he was up to at the time outside the studio. ""Spaceman"" sounds like a single, 70s style, big chorus and syncopated band hook intact. In fact, it's one of the best ""productions"" on the record, right down to an orchestration that would make George Martin proud, though lines like ""I wanted to be a spaceman/ Now nobody cares about me"" seem almost too fitting for comfort.</p>
<p>However, most of the record is gags. ""Take 54"" (which borrows way too liberally from the bad Lennon solo records) finds Nilsson admitting he needs his girl to come back so he ""can make a good track,"" while ""Joy"" details his run-in with a woman would turn him into her ""joy boy"" over a goofy country-rock backdrop. Funny? I guess. ""You're Breakin' My Heart"" lays it out: ""you're breakin' my heart, so fuck you."" Funnier? Arguably, though at that stage, it wasn't honesty or blunt humor that Nilsson lacked, but tunes. The jokes on <i>Son of</i> tend to fall flat for similar reasons as Lennon's concurrent stuff did: All attitude and not many great hooks make getting through the music a laborious, if occasionally chuckle-worthy experience.</p>
<p>As if retreating further into an inside joke (that Nilsson probably only ever told to himself in the first place), the singer released an album of standards and showtunes, <i>A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night</i>. Fans shouldn't have been surprised at his ease pulling off this kind of music, as he'd always been something of a cabaret pop performer, only now subbing out a clarinet-ridden McCartney influence for Irving Berlin. The best news is that his voice is back to its old, silky smooth self (though he'd completely ruin it the following year recording <i>Pussy Cats</i> with Lennon). The bad news, if you don't happen to love extra golden oldie American popular song, is that the arrangements and performances are straight-down-the-middle, by-the-fakebook croon to make Andy Williams beat the band.</p>
<p>""It Had to Be You"" is nice (and the string quote of ""Over the Rainbow"" is a cute touch by veteran Hollywood bandleader Gordon Jenkins); ""Makin' Whoopee"" is done well, with still more vintage string arrangements, though seems a bit on the slow side to me. In fact, the whole record is geriatric with a capital Muzak: I want to think Nilsson actually loved this stuff, and was paying it homage with straightforward interpretations, but the tempos are uniformly nursing-home ready and his voice perpetually in the same modest, comfy tenor; eventually, I want to look for a trace of sarcasm just to stay awake. The bonus tracks aren't helping, as the last thing I need is more of a drowsy thing. <i>Everybody's Talkin': The Very Best of Harry Nilsson</i> is (another) serviceable best-of for an artist that had a habit of actually tucking his best stuff away deep in the middle of his albums. Nevertheless, if you've never heard the guy before, this has all the hits: ""Coconut"", ""Everybody's Talkin'"", ""Jump Into the Fire"", and his versions of ""One"" (made famous by Three Dog Night) and ""Without You"" (Nilsson's only No. 1). For my money, the best stuff here is ""Me And My Arrow"" (from 1971's <i>The Point</i>) and ""The Moonbeam Song"" from <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i>, but I wish they'd included more from his early records (particularly <i>Aerial Ballet</i> or <i>Nilsson Sings Newman</i>).</p>
<p>After <i>Son of Schmilsson</i>, Nilsson never really came back from the edge. <i>Pussy Cats</i> was an improvement, though often for reasons unintended by its makers. Sometimes when I hear it, I wince-- it's tough to listen to someone self-destruct on record, even if (or especially if) he's giving it his all. Each of Nilsson's records from the mid-70s onward (ending with 1979's marginally underrated <i>Knnillssonn</i>) was less popular than the one before, and unlike some of his pop-genius peers, it wasn't really because he was flying too far over the heads of audience. As such, these latest reissues probably aren't the best way to discover his music, though are still an essential part of his legacy.</p></div>"|11877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11877-son-of-schmilsson-a-little-touch-of-schmilsson-in-the-night-everybodys-talkin-the-very-best-of-harry-nilsson/|6.5|Dominique Leone

      Recorded in Kenya under a canopy of personal hardship, sacrifice, and loss, <em>Ok-Oyot System</em> has the type of compelling backstory that seems as though it should automatically translate into a powerful listening experience. The album is a collaboration between Otieno Jagwasi and Onyango Wuod Omari-- both members of the Kenyan group Orchestra Extra Solar Africa-- and Ian Eagleson and Alex Minoff of the D.C.-based group Golden. It's a collaboration that began when Eagleson went to Kenya for a year to conduct research for his doctoral thesis on benga-- a jazzy, guitar-centric strain of dance music popular in Kenya since the 1960s.</p><p>
     As guitarist and vocalist for Extra Solar Africa, Otieno provided much assistance for Eagleson's research; ultimately, Extra Golden were assembled in April 2004 to create and record their unique benga/rock hybrid. Along the way the musicians were forced to overcome numerous obstacles, including a costly run-in with the corrupt Kenyan police force and the effects of Otieno's severe physical ailments. Suffering from kidney and liver diseases that were complicated by HIV, Otieno's health continued to deteriorate after this recording session. He passed away in May 2005.</p><p>
      The title <em>Ok-Oyot</em> is derived from a Luo phrase that means, ""it's not easy."" This expression is used regularly as an exclamation in benga songs, and needless to say it seems a particularly apt descriptor for Extra Golden's all-too-brief collaborative experience. Yet considering the misfortune that seems to have plagued the album's creation-- and the political nature of some of its lyrics--the music on <em>Ok-Oyot System</em> is not particularly freighted with angry defiance, outward gloom, or self-conscious poignancy. Instead it's an album that sounds very much like what it is: Four talented, enthusiastic musicians playing together as a group for the first time, patiently working through ideas to determine a common musical vocabulary.
    </p>
<p>
     The bulk of the album was recorded in a single afternoon, a spontaneous approach that perfectly complements the exuberance of tracks like the opening ""Ilando Gima Onge"". In the hands of Extra Golden, benga seems an especially malleable genre, one that coarsely blends <em>Indestructible Beat of Soweto</em> propulsion with fluid, almost Cuban-accented rhythms and miles of complex, interlocking guitar figures. On the opener, Otieno adds some appealing, laid-back vocals, but the 11-minute song is dominated by the ambitious dialogue between his guitar and those of Eagleson and Minoff. Both the title track and the deceptively sunny anti-Bin Laden cut ""Osama Rach"" were written in the studio, held together primarily through Omari's agile, inventive drumming and the group's obvious sense of camaraderie.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhat curiously the album also contains two tracks-- ""It's Not Easy"" and ""Tussin and Fightin""-- that are written and performed solely by Eagleson and Minoff. Though by no means unpleasant, without the assistance of their Kenyan partners these two pieces land much nearer to conventional U.S. guitar rock, with ""It's Not Easy"" in particular bearing a resemblance to Lynryd Skynrd's ""Tuesday's Gone"". Throughout the album, Extra Golden's heavy reliance on extended, noodling guitar interplay causes them to skirt the jam-band borderlands, a fact that's surely due in part to the short amount of productive time the group were able to spend together. At their best, as on the lovely, Otieno-penned album closer ""Nyajondere"", Extra Golden prove able to bridge styles and cultures with an easy, seamless grace, and the idea that this group are now unable to proceed together to improve upon these initial recordings strikes me as no small sad thing.

     The OG of the animal name game, Rob Fisk's responsible for a label, Free Porcupine Society, and at least three bands-- Deerhoof, Badgerlore, 7 Year Rabbit Cycle-- that pay homage to whatever's wild in wilderness. Fisk has described his project as ""eco-terrorist hobbit rock"": Like elephants at the circus rising up against their trainers, or Wolf Eyes, it's the kind of outdoors where the primary export isn't flowers.</p><p>
<em>Ache Hornes</em>, the newest from Fisk and his wife Kelly Goode-- 7YRC's guitar'n'vocals core-- adds Zorn-Cline-Bungle collaborator Ches Smith (on drums) and Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart (vocals, guitar), to jazz up the bare family improv. The quartet moves from minimalism, in its Warren Burt tuning fork/xylophone sections, to startlingly conventional rock elements as tight and spare as Slint or Hoover.</p><p>
     ""Wren"" showcases Goode's Kimya Dawson sour-sweet vocals, marching from dubbed out and minimal bass and drum into jokes courtesy of Shel Silverstein-- ""Now I see that you don't care, don't care, don't care."" ""This Makes Me a Barn Burner"" is a tiny harmonic explosion that breaks the deadpan, while songs like ""Untitled"" and ""Magic Yam Part 2"" bounce on single trebly notes, pausing to stop, take stock, and start again. The pacing's immaculate and glacial-- the track breaks often signal a change only in the song's title, not its progression-- as the music flowers into something bigger.
    </p>
<p>
     Tracks like ""4321"" take Slint's willingness to bleed simple progressions dry, circling around similar sounds for 10 minutes and more. 7YRC, like Badgerlore, give the vibe of existing in a space where the rules are theirs: Time goes at their speed, sounds blend where they desire them, and there's more than a hint of escapism chasing their quiet guitar calls and sparse free-jazz drumming. <em>Ache Hornes</em> repeats itself constantly, without resolution, or even much catharsis. Fisk's restraint is almost complete and, like his songs, verging on self-parody. Now that Deerhoof's down a member, maybe he could get back with them and let the demons out again?

      I must be a horrible person. I mean, I used to think criticizing Rose Melberg was kinda like tearing the wings off a butterfly. In the early 1990s, Melberg's Sacramento-based band Tiger Trap recorded one of the essential indie pop albums, giddy with crush-love and sugar fizz. The Softies, her subsequent duo with current All Girl Summer Fun Band member Jen Sbragia, leaned toward fragile, iridescent prettiness, and were every bit as special. You know who probably hates <em>It's Love</em>, their modest 1995 masterpiece? Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. Who also used to go to animal shelters, adopt cats as pets, and then dissect their hearts. Just sayin'.</p><p>
      Melberg's latest album, <em>Cast Away the Clouds</em>, isn't her solo debut-- that was 1998's lo-fi hodgepodge <em>Portola</em>-- but it's her first record since the Softies called it quits after 2000's characteristically winsome <em>Holiday in Rhode Island</em>. While I'd rather not notice the differences here, they don't get much starker: tasteful acoustic guitars instead of tinny electrics, clumsy overconfidence instead of awkward naivete, and worst of all, stuffy seriousness instead of girlish wonder. The term ""twee"" can be an insult or a rallying cry, but it should never be applied to <em>Cast Away the Clouds</em>, because this record is unmistakably mature, like so many artists' late-career disappointments.</p><p>
     So, goodbye cuddlecore heroine, hello dull singer-songwriter. Opener ""Take Some Time"" does have echoes of the Softies in the sparse instrumentation and Melberg's understated harmonies, but it's oddly sterile, detached. ""It's gonna take some time/ To fix this love of mine,"" Melberg sings, her still-whispery voice a bit more conventionally pleasant than it once was. Besides, who <em>says</em> that? Slow, mostly acoustic arrangements throughout emphasize Melberg's double-track laments, occasionally enlivened by piano. ""If you don't extend your hand with passionate intent..."" begins one crime against language. Only ""Irene"" adds drums, jazzy hi-hat, and bouncy ivories that hint at ""Linus and Lucy"", but Melberg gives away too much in the opening line: ""So tired/ Waking up uninspired.""
    </p>
<p>
      Like other Melberg outings, <em>Cast Away the Clouds</em> retains a consistent feel, so other songs drifty sleepily by sounding much the same, give or take an extraneous violin or flute solo. OK, ""Constant and True"" breaks the mold with chiming ukulele and a guest vocal by P:ano's fey, talented Nick Krgovich. Meanwhile, it's not that Melberg has gone soft-- anyway, how could she?-- but something on this album has gone cold, and the clouds refuse to budge. Hey, Rose, I <em>was</em> ready to be heartbroken. Just not like this.

      On his eighth Six Organs of Admittance outing, Ben Chasny's burrowed deeper into the eerie psych bog, creating <em>The Sun Awakens</em>, his most foreboding album to date. In the past he's been vocal about the influence on his work by Keiji Haino's psych-rock crew Fushitsusha, the slow-mo guitar pyrotechnics of Loren Connors, the shambling rock'n'drone of New Zealand's Dead C, and various underground musicians championed in Byron Coley and Jimmy Johnson's seminal <em>Forced Exposure</em> magazine. That range of sounds has never shown up as clearly as across these seven tracks. Chasny's been the odd finger-picker out of the core freak-folk family for some time; on this somber, stirring collection, he's spreading his wings even further.</p><p>
      If the post-folk demarcation needs to be sketched with thicker lines, there's also Chasny's membership in Badgerlore, Comets on Fire, and Current 93. Don't misunderstand: John Fahey and Robbie Basho <em>are</em> here and there, but the aforementioned experimenters-- as well as shambolic troupes like Tower Recordings and Sunburned Hand of the Man-- make more apt aesthetic brethren for the Oakland multi-instrumentalist.</p><p>
     Recording quality isn't something I generally write home about (full disclosure: I recorded Chasny playing his guitar via speakerphone for a compilation CD that I co-curated), but the Fucking Champs' Tim Green did a great job capturing the instruments here, creating the best sounding Six Organs record to date. Green and Chasny also co-produced it wonderfully, subtly layering the various strata, keeping each component distinct (trick: play it loud). The compositional approach isn't unprecedented-- elements of the previous Six Organs albums bubble to the surface-- but the constituent parts are more precisely focused. Imagine the dirge of 2002's <em>Dark Noontide</em> with a stronger Comets undertow consistently pulling you toward some unknown mire. In addition to the compositional integrity, the ways he utilizes his voice have grown exponentially.
    </p>
<p>
      Unfazed by the recent wolf-rock infestation, Chasny opens the set with a brief acoustic ditty, ""Torn By Wolves"". It's Chasny on guitars-- upfront <em>Octavio Paz</em> lullaby with a distant wash in the background-- paired with minimal cymbal taps and percussion from Comets on Fire's Noel Von Harmonson. Throughout, Von Harmonson's drumming is sparer than Chris Corsano's free-jazz eruptions, leading to a focus on the guitars and other instruments, and radically shifting the freak-out mode.
    </p>
<p>
     That plaintive ramble gives way to the ominous ""Bless Your Blood"". It's again Chasny and Von Harmonson on their respective instruments, but Green handles the tone generator and John Connell the Persian flute. Despite the added oomph, the most obvious detail of the piece is Chasny's upfront, claustrophobic flanged voice-- a second track of spectral falsetto drifts and darts, acting as gorgeous counterpoint.
    </p>
<p>
     ""Black Wall"" pairs vocal hypnotics with noisy guitar. The track begins acoustic, but when the guitar crush explodes toward the end, the rings are still there, this time piled heavy with feedback. The guitar's notched up another few digits for the blistering, raga-to-rock-out instrumental ""Attar"", named after the mystic Iranian poet. On the penultimate track, ""Wolves Pup"", Chasny reprises ""Torn By Wolves"". It's the same song played differently and this time with no background peal or drums-- just Chasny on the acoustic. Much like ""Torn By Wolves"", the spare piece acts as a dynamic space-- a moment of comedown before launching into something bigger.
    </p>
<p>
      Closer ""River of Transfiguration"" is a 24-minute trek down the Styx with a posse of groaning monks. Chasny handles guitar, tone generators, organ, vocals, and gong, and the album's previous players all show up with armloads of instruments. Additionally, Om's Al Cisneros lays down bass and sings, and other vocals come courtesy of Comets on Fire's Ethan Miller plus three other acolytes. The sound? Imagine the latter portion of <em>School of the Flower</em>'s ""Saint Cloud"" sans pretty guitar line and taken to the nth degree: It's more about developing a sense of space than rocking out, and its elements slowly drift into the mix until it becomes a teeming landscape.
    </p>
<p>
      Even with the terrific ""River of Transfiguration"", I'll bet a couple bucks that people will be let down by <em>The Sun Awakens</em>. Though it's actually longer than <em>School</em>, it feels shorter because of the lengthy grand finale and overall cohesion. (Songs blend together and cross fade, and the only aesthetic anomaly is the Western wrangle ""The Desert is a Circle"".) It will also prove more challenging for the casual listener: Where's the loner pot cloud of ""Thicker Than a Smokey""? The bucolic ""All You've Left"" and ""Words for Two""? That said, Chasny found himself a heavy fucking vibe and that led him to a transcendent but unrelenting place. If you've ever been intrigued by the sound of the sun imploding, this should be your cup of hemlock.

    On his news blog, Portastatic's Mac of all trades promises that  his second film soundtrack will contain some ""good old rocking out"" among  the usual filmic elements-- cellos, oboes, etc.-- so as to not disorient  those that abide his creative friskiness but pledge allegiance to  Superchunk. That's a damn shame, because as much as I enjoy the rockier  efforts of Mr. McCaughan, this disc is one place where they aren't  welcome. The trailer for this film features one such ""rocking""  track-- it's not officially on the soundtrack, but in this context, it  sounds like the sort of middling indie rock you'd find on the middling  soundtrack of a middling indie film. Jury's still out on whether <em>Who Loves The  Sun?</em> qualifies as ""middling""-- it's currently playing the festival  thing in preparation for a fall release. But bland rock moves aside, this soundtrack  is a nice surprise, exceeding expectations when it eschews the expected.</p><p>
     ""Surprise"" is a relative term, of course. That McCaughan wrote most of this music for instruments he's not proficient in is besides the point. Anyone that's been following his moves over the past 10 years has become accustomed to his use of strings and other orchestral accoutrements, as well as his expanding compositional palette. Still, even the most dedicated fan might do a double take when they hear the guy that wrote ""Why Do You Have to Put a Date On Everything?"" turn to cello and a charmingly clumsy acoustic guitar for this disc's first track, ""Will's Return"". That double-take will probably turn into a full-on gawk when they hear Mac unfurl a melodic theme that sounds as good essayed on piano (""Once Nice Piano"") as it does on upright bass and flute (""Nice One"") or acoustic guitar and oboe (""Nice Strums""). It's a pleasant tune containing a wry bittersweet wrinkle, which makes it perfect to reprise in a film about estranged friends and lovers reuniting.</p><p>
      In fact, a bittersweet feeling permeates every inch of this soundtrack, from  the title of the film (taken from a highpoint of the VU's  <em>Loaded</em> album) to the song titles (""The Sunset Rock"", ""Seems  Like a Long Time Ago"") to the music itself. ""Snake Music"", a solo piano  piece, possess a haunting echo that recalls the key-tickling of another  reformed Chapel Hill indie dude, Crooked Fingers' Eric Bachmann.  Gorgeous downbeat tunes like ""Do You Want To Know?"" or the album's  closing track ""Older Summer"", with their brushed drums and  autumn-sweater haze, reflect shades of Yo La Tengo's more nostalgic  work. Even the half-minute-long ""Fighting Music"", played primarily on a  toy xylophone in a peppy power-pop style, conveys that sense of  reminiscence and nostalgia. McCaughan's so successful at establishing  this mood that when those few-and-far-between rock moments finally  arrive (in the form of two ""Chase"" songs), they come off like farts  during a wedding ceremony. It might have been the rock'n'roll that  gives McCaughan the freedom to write movies soundtracks, but in this instance  he's better off forgetting that he ever rocked.

    If you caught Om's <em>Variations on a Theme</em>, you know what to expect from Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius on the structurally similar follow-up, <em>Conference of the Birds</em>. Much like last time, the trance-inducing ex-Sleep rhythm section allows huge, slightly fluctuating bass grooves, mantra-style vocals, and locked-down drum ecstatics to unfurl as lengthy, addictive, metal-inflected incantations.</p><p>
     Musically, things have also changed ever so, especially in the case of the soothing, minimal, 16-minute opener, ""At Giza"", on which a vintage psych drum sound lends it a Silver Apples feel. One glorious, unshifting constant is Cisneros' penchant for mystical, elevated lyrical loops. Words are seemingly used both for their sounds (check out how he pronounces ""sentient"") as well as their meaning. Besides playing bass and sing-chanting in Om, Cisneros works as a chess instructor for kids in the Bay Area. Somehow that knowledge makes the repetitions and accents of his lyrics feel even more strategic, each word aiding in a flight toward some out-of-body lift-off into the ether.</p><p>
      The languid, dub-tinged ""At Giza"" is the band's most compellingly spare song to date. The title digs into the great pyramids and the words delve into those lake-sitting swans, the sun/waning moon, and seraphic forms. It's another Om avatar for a flight toward freedom/liberation. Sonically, where <em>Variations</em> constantly rocked, there are minutes upon minutes here of between and post-chorus breakdown, creating a dynamic surge when the echoed vocals push the song's ""aviator"" toward the sun and the bass rings with Hakius's recharged rolls and fills.
    </p>
<p>
      Lyrically, ""Flight of the Eagle"" follows a similar path, but from the start the bass is heavier and Cisneros' vocal pattern more clipped and Sabbathian, less serene. It's evocative of the last album, which I really dug, but now that the near perfectly modulated mellow-drama of that first trek's gone and ""a new day dawns,"" the music loses steam. If the duo had found a way to continue the corked, opiate energy of ""At Giza"", <em>Conference of the Birds</em> would be totally brilliant; instead, it's got one great song plus one that makes me forget a little that I'd reached nirvana a few moments earlier.

     Try listening to London-based duo Psapp through the ears of Alexandra Patsavas. She's the music supervisor for ""The O.C."", which has had Psapp on its soundtrack, as well as for ""Grey's Anatomy"", which uses Psapp's ""Cosy in the Rocket"" as its theme song. Patsavas grew up in Chicago in the 1980s, so John Hughes' films likely informed her ideas of how pop music relates to drama.</p><p>
     With this influence as a filter, the characteristics of the music Patsavas has helped popularize come in focus. The strand of cuddly electronic indie pop in particular-- characterized by the Postal Service and Psapp-- is being received as a tender sonic amplification of youthful angst. To my ears, the music is almost there, but something doesn't wash; I suspect technology itself, which enables so much music of this ilk, may be to blame. Sonically, the vast majority of this laptop pop is thin and brittle, a serious problem considering the desired effect.</p><p>
      Take the home studio production of Psapp's second album, <em>The Only Thing I Ever Wanted</em>. Though it comes over as reasonably professional, its sound is boxy and static, which is odd since it's filled with wheezy organs and xylophones and keyboards of every stripe. All the instrumental variety is flattened somewhere inside the computer and the sounds become interchangeable. There's no dynamic range and thus the backing tracks provide no emotional cues. The ""Strawberry Fields"" organ and violin fills on ""New Rubbers"", for example, don't resonate the way they should. The problems are typical for producers whose idea of arrangement is loading samples onto the computer and dragging and dropping the various loops into place. 
    </p>
<p>
     The drab sound is a shame considering the well-constructed songs and Galia Durant's emerging strength as a vocalist. She's only 27 but she seems wise beyond her years. Her voice is knowing, confident, sly, and sexy; she's able to articulate subtle shades of mood. The tunes, though they need a couple of listens to sink in, are catchy in a very clever way. The melodies bring to mind Stereolab around the time of <em>Dots and Loops</em>-- accessible while accommodating diverse influences, with some surprising twists and turns. With its swoosh of strings and digital approximation of a horn section, the clever mid-tempo ballad ""This Way"" comes closest to the 'Lab standard. Elsewhere, Durant reminds me of Dani Siciliano, as in the way she phrases ""Needle &amp; Thread"", her words artfully trailing off as she holds notes for an extra beat or two. 
    </p>
<p>
     But the stiff clatter of the production robs these fine songs of their vitality. Psapp has in the past recruited musician friends to help them present songs live; with any luck, for the next record they'll keep these musicians in the band and get together with a proper producer. Maybe ring up Sean O'Hagen to arrange some strings. This music cries out for warmth and space, and if it gets it, that classic teenflick poignancy is easily within Psapp's grasp.

      I should love Lair of the Minotaur's <em>The Ultimate Destroyer</em>. The guitars are dense and crusty, billowing out thick riffs that chug along with a locomotive's determination. The vocals-- gruff, deep, and meaty-- hark back to metal's earlier days, with lyrical themes of death, destruction, and fantastical monsters. And I admit that when I've got the album cranked and no one's around my brain starts sending messages to my neck that it might be a good idea to go ahead and bang my head. Uh, not that I actually do such a thing when listening to good metal-- I mean, unless you do too.</p><p>
     But as the disc draws to a close, I realize I don't love it. It's good, enjoyable, solid, whatever-- but I'm unable to mouth even one of the riffs ten minutes after the record finishes. The drumming is part of the problem. While Larry Herweg's mechanical style fits here better than in his other band, Pelican, he lacks the flair and power necessary for music this beefy. The thunder-roll of the double-bass seems to be his only trick; when a strong, dynamic fill would push the moment over the top, he falls back on simpler, by-the-numbers tactics.</p><p>
     Taken individually, a few songs are great. The opening ""Juggernaut of Metal"" is exactly that: an assault of crushing guitar work and monster rhythms. ""Grisly Hound of the Pit"" makes the best use of the band's robotic pulse, with an opening section that rolls along like a factory assembly line. Among the strongest of the nine tracks here is the shortest and fastest, the fifty-three second ""Lord of Butchery"". It's the closest thing here to hardcore-thrash crossover, and one of the few songs that benefits from the singular vision and lack of variety. So while <em>The Ultimate Destroyer</em> isn't a strong album on the whole, it contains a few tracks that would be perfect in a playlist of the best of contemporary metal.

Cue grumpy-old man voice: Back then, you couldn't just download some unknown band's single from a blog for free, you had to fill out order forms-- by hand!-- and pray for weeks that the 7"" arrived intact after your check was cashed. Back then, if you wanted to know what was happening in Britain, you had to wait for your local bookstore to get two-week-old copies of the <i>NME</i>.

""Normal"", a cover of a 1980 song by one-woman Brit-punk band The Petticoats, is a sarcastic plea for domesticity delivered with Poly Sterene-like scorn by Jen, while loungey lament ""Perennial Underdog"" contains a mantra that Anderson should chisel into his gravestone: ""Time is what you make it"".</p>

Boyracer was actually inactive for five of those years, when the band fell apart after a bum deal with defunct New York indie Zero Hour in 1996. As Anderson was not able to locate the current owner of certain masters, the compilation features nine re-recordings of old songs-- not that there's any hint of modernization. Each disc covers a five-year era, 1991-96 and 2001-06.

Cue grumpy-old man voice: Back then, you couldn't just download some unknown band's single from a blog for free, you had to fill out order forms-- by hand!-- and pray for weeks that the 7"" arrived intact after your check was cashed.

     Even though she's continuing Memphis Industries' winning streak, on her second release as El Perro del Mar (""the sea dog""), Sarah Assbring sounds so completely bummed out, so miserable in her own skin that even handclaps and tambourines sound like harbingers of doom. But she has so much to live for. For one thing, she makes all this mopeyness seem enticing instead of painfully self-absorbed, expressing her misery through musical elements typically associated with 1950s and 60s pop exuberance: girl-group harmonies, darting guitars, baby-doll vocals, a Gene Vincent lyric, references to parties and puppy dogs and candy and walking down hills. Even the name she gives her hurt-- ""the blues""-- seems old-fashioned, a reminder of an archaic time before mood disorders were given their own names and medications.</p><p>
     It's never exactly clear what the cause of El Perro's blues is, but the album charts a narrative of recovery from some emotionally devastating event-- presumably being dumped. After the lonely drumbeats that begin ""Candy"", which act both as sad heartbeats and an appropriately desolate overture, she runs through the range of reactions. She tries a little self-affirmation on ""God Knows (You Gotta Give to Get)"", a rustling reworking of girl-group sounds that's also the album's strongest tune. On ""Party"", she presumably dials up her ex and tries to hook up again, and her attempts to sound happy are knowingly pathetic. Next comes anger: On ""Dog"", she sings accusingly, ""All the feelings you have for me, just like for a dog."" That she sounds so angelic and steady makes the realization all the more affecting.</p><p>
     These songs are so intent and intense in their misery that it's almost a little funny-- tragedy amplified into comedy. Anyone who sings ""Come on over, baby, there's a party going on"" as if she's reading from a suicide note risks melodrama and maybe even hysteria. But El Perro's a careful singer whose near-tears delivery can imbue downhearted hyperbole with subtle emotional inflections that sound achingly genuine. And her appropriation of traditionally upbeat pop sounds for miserable ends doesn't deaden their powers-- they've always been used to express heartbreak and confusion-- but instead gives them surprising strength as they both assuage her pain and salt her wounds. ""This loneliness ain't pretty no more,"" she sings on ""This Loneliness"", acknowledging the melancholic draw of pop music in general and her music specifically. It's as if she's trying to diffuse any romanticized empathy listeners might develop after prolonged exposure to these songs. She doesn't want to pass her blues along to anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     The pairing of ""This Loneliness"" and ""Coming Down the Hill"" creates a turning point on the album, the moments when El Perro decides to get over it, to move on with her life. Those songs lead directly into ""It's All Good"", with its ecstatic la-la-la's and ooh-ooh-ooh's. ""It's all good. Take a new road and never look back,"" she sings triumphantly. The clouds have parted, the sun is shining, the handclaps can finally sound happy.
    </p>
<p>
      But the apparent happiness is short lived. In a devastating twist ending, the final song on <em>El Perro del Mar</em>, a cover of Brenda Lee's ""Here Comes That Feeling"", makes clear that the singer's deadening sense of loss, which she has fought so hard to overcome, has been replaced with a numbing emptiness equally vast and burdensome. It's a hole in her heart that can't be filled by the cheery saxophone, doo-wop piano, or even Sam Cooke's ""Feel It (Don't Fight It)"", which she masochistically weaves into the outro. The joke's on her, but it's not very funny.

Four Tet's Kieran Hebden would play the loony laptop upstart with a surfeit of good experiments and a deficit of good sense. A groove-crunching Steve Reid acted as the grizzled jazz sage, cautiously restraining his compatriot's erratic computations. Neither musician seemed willing to alter (or revel in) these positions; the ensuing album suggested the artists might as well have telecommuted to the performance. Despite moments of fusion, the album generally exhibited a gross incompatibility between Reid's structured drumming and Hebden's haphazard attempts at international rhythms.</p><p>  On <em>Vol. 2</em>, which was recorded at the same London session, not a whole lot has changed. Yet I appreciate the album more than its predecessor. Hebden and Reid must know that boredom inevitably leads to fascination. It's the Law of Double Albums: One dull record is simply dull, two dull records means the audience must've missed something. Still, there are some material differences between the two volumes, though they're nearly invisible without systematic side-by-side comparison. First, <em>Vol. 2</em> is faster and more reluctant to wallow in eye-shutting ambience. The first volume had a tendency to revert to flaccid schmaltz in the middle of interminable 20-minute jams. No such difficulties plague the new disc. (If anything, the songs are <em>too</em> busy.)</p><p> The album's centerpiece, ""Hold Down the Rhythms, Hold Down the Machines"", is Hebden's most successful attempt to convert Reid's visceral energy into a digital meltdown: A flurry of condensational reverb and acidic cymbals. Reid's disco hi-hat and military rhythms seamlessly roll around Hebden's machine-gun klezmer and wobbly pitch-bend wheels. The whole track is riddled with cut-up hip-hop rasps, coughed-up spittle, and a sense of anxiety. In short, the symptoms of pulmonary congestion. Whatever the value, it's hardly monotonous. For a collaboration that's been fairly minimalist thus far, the song brims with exotic influences.</p><p> Ignoring that notable exception, there's a general sense of unintended consequences throughout the recording. ""Noémie"" approaches interesting ambient ideas but then degenerates into a series of self-parodic references to Australasian percussion: low drones, perfunctory arrangements of scratches and plinks, wooden Polynesian birdcalls, and buoy splashes. The whole thing's a bit too Jungle Cruise to generate any genuine enthusiasm. There are some fascinating elements-- the tinkering tape works and morse code create strange connections between malarial heat and colonial technology-- but it's frustrating to watch these fragments fail to integrate fully into the rest of the piece. The dullest passages absorb entire album sides, while the best ones are unnecessarily short. Why relegate your most interesting thoughts to split-second moments within half-hour pieces? Moreover, it's hard to appreciate those aspects without listening to the (often tedious) context. These are talented musicians-- and <em>Vol. 2</em> is superior to the first disc-- but that development hardly merits owning two full albums of indifferent collaboration. If you have to choose, pick <em>Vol. 2</em>. If you don't, choose Reid's <em>Spirit Walk</em>.</p></div>"|9088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9088-the-exchange-session-vol-2/|7.0|Alex Linhardt

     Some say love and hate are made of the same stuff. And when Sam Windett pleads, ""Lose your hate, it's a game/ Come on love me, it's your fate"" on ""Dart for My Sweetheart"", you can hear him navigating the terrain between the two. Not once on <em>Derdang Derdang</em>, the second album from London-based Archie Bronson Outfit, does he sing a whimsical melody or even deliver his vocals with authoritative confidence. Instead, his voice quivers with uncertainty and howls with murderous desperation. And it fits with the album's principal conceit, spelled out in its first track, when Windett stammers: ""It's so fun to love someone/ But try, try to get, get over it.""</p><p>
     As a sentiment, it's hardly new for pop music-- heartbroken souls driven to kill are as old as the blues. Appropriately, ABO take the majority of their musical cues from the blues-- as well as 1960s garage rock. But the band avoids the trappings of its influences and builds something new out of age-old sources. Taken individually, no part of an ABO song dazzles. In lieu of flashy solos or virtuoso playing, the tasteful and understated instrumental elements form a dark and brooding whole. And there's almost never a flooring shift or change, just determined marches that pick up volume and intensity without swerving from their relentlessly steady tempos.</p><p>
     On ""Cuckoo"", the band lays down a foundation of Mo Tucker-ish toms and snare and a repeated acoustic guitar phrase. But as Windett continues his lovelorn death wishes, threatening, ""I'd bury myself to hold you, darling,"" a bevy of elements turn it into something much less skeletal. A sustained, whistling guitar calls, bird-like, and a chorus of backup singers parrot it back in ""Walk on the Wild Side"" doo doo doos. ""Rituals"", the album's most frantic number, is more dynamic. As the drums move from withdrawn military-style rolls to frenetic gallops, Windett abandons a mournful wail for primal hooting. Fueled by a skronky <em>Fun House</em> saxophone, the song speeds up into a dizzying series of abrupt stops and starts with Windett's screams punctuating the gaps. It would have been the perfect ending to an already unsettling record, but ABO tacked on an anemic acoustic rendition of ""Dart for My Sweetheart"", re-titled ""Harp for My Sweetheart"", that serves only to spoil the album's claustrophobic atmosphere.
    </p>
<p>
      Outside of the closer, there's an impressive coherence on <em>Derdang Derdang</em>, showing how well ABO has developed an original and guiding aesthetic. But like the narrow thematic scope of Windett's lovesick wailing, such a restricted musical palette means that many of the songs blend together. To a degree, this sense of overlap seems intentional: Lyrics are recycled and nearly all the songs feature wordless refrains, with melodies as simple and memorable as nursery rhymes. So even if Windett never reconciles his contradictory impulses in the lyrics, ABO's obsessively hermetic approach to songwriting makes for a focused and assured statement.

     From a career standpoint, artists making ambient music don't have it easy. They're usually faceless, like most electronic producers-- we have no idea who is making this stuff. Since subtle understatement is the genre's forte, they're not typically at the cutting edge of technology, either, so the gear geeks inevitably move on to something else. And then there's the problem of how the music changes once a template is established. It's a fantastic and rare thing to create your own voice in electronic music, but once it happens, you're confronted with where to go next. No matter how appealing or distinctive your sound, it's unlikely that most people will need four or five albums of it.</p><p>
     And that's where I'm finding Scott Morgan's Loscil project here on his fourth album. It's not that he keeps making the exact same record over again. There are changes. Sometimes he makes the heartbeat 4/4 kick a priority; other times he focuses more on glitches. Sometimes his music sounds bubblier, more aquatic, or more organic; traditional instruments have cameos. But despite the variance, the general character and prevailing mood of his four albums is virtually identical. Were a listener looking for a calm, textured, emotionally neutral space to stumble upon any one of them, including <em>Plume</em>, I'm sure they wouldn't be disappointed. If you know his first three records well, on the other hand, you might find this one redundant.</p><p>
      Let's talk about the differences. Morgan looks back a bit further on this record, giving <em>Plume</em> a clear ""classic ambient"" sound. By using spare bits of guitar and piano, he evokes the 1970s world of ambient pioneers like Eno, Cluster, and Tangerine Dream. ""Chinook"" and ""Bellows"" in particular sound like the Reich-channeling trance music Tangerine Dream brought to soundtracks in the late 1970s and early 80s-- most famously for <em>Risky Business</em>-- and it does so rather nicely. Throughout, <em>Plume</em> is much less diffuse with lighter processing. Morgan seems content to let the synths go it alone on droney tracks like ""Zephyr"" and ""Motoc"", inserting just the smallest bits of static-ridden glitch to send ripples across the placid surface. <em>Plume</em> sounds older and more spacious than any of the earlier Loscil material. 
    </p>
<p>
      Which all adds up to...I'm not sure, exactly. <em>Plume</em> is certainly a nice-enough record, but it also seems like the kind of music Morgan could do well until the end of time. There's no sense of challenge or risk, no feeling that this project wants to step outside what it already knows. Not a terrible thing, but also not a quality that invites close attention as new material piles up. One of the tracks, appropriately enough, is titled ""Rorschach"". You'll hear what you want to hear in these blobs of sound, and the specific place you're coming from will make all the difference.

    It's not totally impossible that sometime in the future, some intrepid soul might be able to sing a lyric like ""there's no sun in the sky, no love in my life/ Since I lost my baby, all I do is cry"" over mandolins and honky-tonk pianos and manage not to sound like a complete dipshit. But chances are that person isn't going to be a white middle-aged British ex-raver rockstar with a fake American accent and an affected garage-rock yelp.</p><p>
     Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie has made a career of stacking genres on top of each other into huge messy glorious piles of acid-house and krautrock and shoegaze and Stooges, and that approach has given us <em>Screamadelica</em> and <em>Vanishing Point</em> and <em>XTRMNTR</em>. But whenever he dips his toe into trad-rock formalism, that adventurous streak dries up right away and mutates into stifled reverence. 1994's <em>Give Out But Don't Give Up</em> was the first time he humped the desiccated corpse of garage-blues, and it resulted in Primal Scream's artistic nadir, but it had a certain horn-tinged exuberance and a couple of good hooks.</p><p>
<em>Riot City Blues</em>, Gillespie's new trad-move, on the other hand, is flat and dead. It's as if Primal Scream have run completely out of ideas and so they've reverted to the detestable fallbacks of honking harmonicas and bar-band choogles, acting like college freshmen who just discovered blues.
    </p>
<p>
     ""Nitty Gritty"" is straight up circa-2003 garage-rock pastiche; it shoots for the Stones and ends up with the Datsuns. ""Dolls"" is a desperate grab for handclappy glam-rock stomp-sniff hedonism so forced and clumsy that it should be in a Sparks commercial. ""Boogie Disease"" includes the lyric ""I'm the garbage man, I'm the garbage man/ Stick my fingers in your trashcan,"" which is especially ridiculous because everybody knows British people say ""bin."" The album is packed to the gills with empty signifiers: yelps and sneers and party-up exhortations, but it's so limp and defeated that it's impossible to hate; you just end up feeling sorry for it instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Even in its relatively ok moments, the album fails. The decent forbidding-throb bassline of ""When the Bomb Drops"" makes me feel bad for Scream bassist Mani, who has now been roped into the second retro-rock disaster of his career after already weathering the Stone Roses' <em>Second Coming</em>. ""Country Girl"" has a nice little guitar-and-mandolin bite that reminds me of Miranda Lambert's ""Kerosene"", but it just makes me wish I was listening to ""Kerosine"". And the six-and-a-half minute breathy monolithic psychedelic-flute drone of ""Little Death"" reminds me how welcome it is to have Espers around doing this sort of thing without all the cheesed-out garage-rock moans and sneers. 
    </p>
<p>
      Primal Scream's last album, 2002's <em>Evil Heat</em>, wasn't great, but its scratchy blissed-out electro-clangs yielded a few powerful moments. Gillespie always manages to come up with something interesting when he errs toward hazy rave-casualty fuzz-bombs instead of the blooz-rawk yelps that not even Jack White can pull off properly anymore. After <em>Riot City Blues</em>, someone needs to point a <em>Men In Black</em> memory-eraser at him and make him forget the Mississippi Delta ever existed.

     If you're reading this, you probably already know the bullet points regarding this particular beat combo-- they're from Nashville, they're teenagers, one of them dropped out of high school, their parents are music industry vets, the UK loves them to death, various pop-culture publications have been on their nubile jock since Insert Live Performance Here, and Thurston Moore thinks they're the bees' knees. Some other fun facts: Their full-length debut hits American shores today, on that once-in-a-century date 6/6/06, frontwoman Jemina Pearl's actual last name is Abegg (wise stage name choice, for damn sure), and they rock. No, what BYOP does isn't exactly the most original thing in the world-- watch out for rampant Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparison-- but they do it with a flair and panache and enthusiasm that belies their youth.</p><p>
      Don't expect any ""Maps""-like moments on this record, though. The  closest <em>BYOP</em> comes to showing a softer side is via a veiled  threat-- ""No, we're not out of ammo yet."" Be Your Own Pet piss on  everything in sight, and it's hard to not want to drop trou and join in  on the fun. From the first moment of ""Thresher's Flail"" (a fitting  title for this album's opener), the group's firing on all cylinders,  speeding through 15 tracks in just over a half-hour. It's no  surprise Bad Brains receives a shout-out-- Jonas Stein plays guitar  hero, spitting out power chords every which way, while Nathan Vasquez and Jamin Orrall set a  blistering pace and keep things moving quickly. The band's on point  throughout, especially on ""Bunk Trunk Skunk"" as Pearl gleefully shouts, ""I'm an independent  motherfucker!"" and threatens to make off with everyone's cherry.</p><p>
      As much as I'd like to spread the praise equally among all four Pets,  it's hard not to focus on Pearl. Her wanton charisma-- equal parts PJ Harvey, Kathleen Hanna, and, yes,  Karen O-- is a thing to behold live, but it's definitely not lacking on  record. Granted, it would take a corpse to screw up lines as meaty as,  ""I'm wicked rad, and I'm here to steal away your virginity,"" or the Iggy  Pop-esque request, ""my brain is on fire, so piss right in my ear!"" For  most of the record, Pearl's set to search and destroy, whether she's  yelling about zombies going out for a midnight snack, making bike-riding  sound like the coolest shit to ever hit pavement (""we're on two wheels,  baby!""), or going off her meds and drowning her boyfriend. She can  also take it down a notch, as on ""Adventure"" where she  slides in some charming asides (""okay, so yeah, it's cool,  cause we're, like, adventurers"") amidst her wilderness reportage.
    </p>
<p>
      Even at its most ominous, though, the album never loses its verve or  vitality. It's just one quick hit after another, a succession of aural  whippets that last long after the record's over. An album chock full of  back-to-back barnburners might seem an exhausting listen, but  <em>BYOP</em> bucks that trend with ease. And they just got the right to  vote. Hell, if I were as good as these guys, I'd drop out of high  school, too.

      Matthew Adam Hart, pop or art? First off plural band name, singular (both senses) performer; then there's the early 20th century Eurasian avant-garde ref. But beneath <em>that</em>, the guy professes pop-- ""I do pop 'cause that's what my heart goes/ I don't call it art, no sir""-- while blanketing his happy/sad lit-geek tunes with flittering Casio snowflakes and dense laptop frosting that's sweet enough to distract, which of course is the point.</p><p>
      Russian Futurists' latest pop/art nexus, <em>Me Myself and Rye</em>, distills 13 tracks from Hart's first three albums, otherwise unreleased outside North America. Nothing new here, but if it's <em>all</em> new to you this is an excellent starting point; longer-term listeners will point out unfortunate omissions, like ""It's Actually Going to Happen"" from 2003 sophomore album <em>Let's Get Ready to Crumble</em>, but that's kinda inherent in the whole compilation exercise.</p><p>
      Hart's closest sonic forebear is the synth-kissed poperetta of ca. 1993-1994 Magnetic Fields. The single is ""Paul Simon"", from last year's <em>Our Thickness</em>, and it's a deceptively bittersweet brass parade, raining squishy rhythms like ticker tape onto perfect, pert melodies. Clattering coming-of-age moment ""Precious Metals"" extends a metaphor or three, but you'll mostly notice the bleepy hook and all-too-familiar see-saw guitar sample. ""C'mon"" opens with the spacey Flaming Lips before another welcome drum break upstages the twinkles. Throughout the disc, Hart's high, slinky vocals swim in reverb, while his lo-fi production sets a mesmerizing patina of prettiness. His rhythmic sense admits both youthful turntablism and lonely nights with Simon's <em>Graceland</em>.
    </p>
<p>
     A little melodicism and some harmonies are usually enough to conjure a few Beatles or Beach Boys comparisons. Russian Futurists, though, earn such notices for the way Hart successfully submerses his classicist-pop impulses-- his clever love songs, his sadsack symbolism-- while still chasing every last tendril of luminous sound even at the risk of obscuring his talents as a traditional tunesmith. Standout ""It's Not Really Cold When It Snows"" at first sounds like a blizzardy blur of early 80s synths, but artfully reveals itself as a catchy love song built on one snowflake-precious, tweety-twee observation: ""It's not really cold when it snows/ Unless you're underdressed."" Fortunately, art and pop long ago gave up mutual exclusivity.

     Oakley Hall's third record doesn't change the formula they've established so far: strong vocal harmonies borrowed from country &amp; western, plenty of space for guitars and amplified fiddle to trade licks, and songs that take two or three chords and run them like pack horses. They don't play the clichés for laughs but still keep full-on country at arm's length. Think of them like a cover band whose van broke down somewhere in the lower Midwest, and they stayed on to become the house band at the local tavern, milking it for free room and drinks.</p><p>
      Everything that worked on previous records works here. It's like the recent <em>Second Guessing</em> but more so-- the ingredients of the recipe are that much more prominent.""Lazy Susan"" shows more of the marathon monotony of Pat Sullivan's former band Oneida, and there are a few more psychedelic interludes coming in at the corners, like the fleet-fingered opening guitar figure on ""Confidence Man"" or the brief quoting of Hendrix's ""Castles Made of Sand"" on the otherwise somber ""Nite Lights, Dark Days"". Some of the seams are a little too visible, like the traditional folk verses that collide with the ragged Crazy Horse fury of the riff on ""House Carpenter"" that quickly grows predictable. Brief moments of <em>Gypsum Strings</em> prove they could push their experimental side just an inch or two further, had they wanted to. ""Living in Sin in the USA"" diverts the middle of the record with a fluttering organ part that shouldn't mesh with the band's country affectations. It somehow makes the steady pace of the ballad even lovelier, though it's helped by Rachel Cox's solo vocal that cements her as the star of the record.</p><p>
     So why do I like this one less? Call it too much of a good thing, or simply a lack of ambition-- inviting guest stars to play tabla (Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Brian Chase on ""Bury Your Burden"") isn't enough of a step forward on a band's third record. <em>Gypsum Strings</em> is like an appendix to <em>Second Guessing</em>, looser and more carefree. Here the band only occasionally show greater attention to detail, most notably on ""Living in Sin in the USA"" or the drifting detour at the end of ""If I Was in El Dorado"". Despite how soon <em>Gypsum Strings</em> arrived-- it's their second album in four months-- I'd hoped for more of those moments.

If all that sounds like another Hollywood summer remake, it's not too far off. Ronnie's done the 1971 reunion with all four broken-up Beatles, the 1976 Billy Joel/Bruce Springsteen treatment, something with Eddie Money, and even a Joey Ramone-guesting 1999 EP on Kill Rock Stars. It never gets even half as good as the great old days, depending of course on your feelings re: Eddie Money.</p><p>
      One cash-in celebritython leads to another. <em>The Last of the Rock Stars</em> carts in Keith Richards, Patti Smith and (again) the late Ramone, backing Spector on a reheated run-through of Johnny Thunders' ""You Can't Put Your Arms Round a Memory"", which was also on the 1999 EP. What's new includes Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner on jitter-by-numbers rocker ""Hey Sah Lo Ney"", the Raveonettes helping out on ""Ode to L.A."" (which, yeah, also appears-- with Ronnie-- on the Ravers' '05 <em>Pretty in Black</em>), and Ronnie and Keith do campy lover's chit-chat on Ike Turner's ""Work Out Fine"" (""You do the work, baby!"" Keith hams). Just in case you were wondering what Spector has in mind, Loretta Lynn's career-resuscitating backers the Greenhornes are featured on a pair of tracks, one of which appeared with Holly Golightly in the Ronnie role on the 'Hornes' own 2005 <em>Sewed Soles</em>.</p><p>
      If <em>The Last of the Rock Stars</em> shows anything other than that the former Mrs. Spector has a laughably high opinion of herself, it's that she remains primarily a singles artist. The one you want is the Amy Rigby-penned ""All I Want"", a bouncy, believable grown-up teenage symphony about just wanting ""something to show me that you care/ Whether I live or die"". Opener ""Never Gonna Be Your Baby"" at least boasts a big, self-referential hook, even if the wannabe-tough-guy guitars and lifelong-smoker-voiced ""wet thoughts of you"" mature pr0n come-ons diminish what suits call ""replay value"".
    </p><p>
      Despite all the guests, <em>The Last of the Rock Stars</em> also suffers from a weird confusion about where ex-hubby Phil's ""Wall of Sound"" meets the here/now. Listeners who can't get past Morrissey's sessionmen should hear the stiff ""Girl From the Ghetto"", which also shares some of that miserabilist's caustic venom: ""I hope your cell is filled with magazines/ And on every one is a picture of me,"" Spector expectorates. Any question who <em>that</em> gun is pointed at?

     ""I feel like getting confessional,"" Tracyanne Campbell sings on the title track of Camera Obscura's third LP. This comes as no surprise to those of us who got all moony and maudlin over the Glaswegian sextet's first two albums. In 2001, the group issued their debut, <em>Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi</em>, in perfect-storm conditions for comparisons to Belle &amp; Sebastian. They even had formal connections: Stuart Murdoch produced the album's lead single, ""Eighties Fan"", and Richard Colburn had played drums in an earlier incarnation of the band. The similarities extended to the vocals, as well, with Tracyanne Campbell often sounding like a more charismatic Isobel Campbell (no relation). But while that record echoed so much lace-and-paisley B&amp;S, in Camera Obscura, Tracyanne played the dominant Murdoch role; John Henderson her recessive yet crucial Isobel. That inversion made the two bands seem like mirror-images of each other, and it was easy to pretend that Tracyanne Campbell and Murdoch were each the silent interlocutors in the other's wry dialogues.</p><p>
      Camera Obscura's second album, <em>Underachievers Please Try Harder</em>, expanded the band's sonic palette to encompass the influence of Leonard Cohen (""Your Picture"") and the Beach Boys (""A Sister's Social Agony""), but did little to allay the persistent comparisons to their forefathers. By no means does this make Camera Obscura the poor man's Belle &amp; Sebastian-- to the contrary, by emerging at a time when B&amp;S was moving away from intimate chamber pop toward more ambitious, less immediate fare, they fell neatly into the stylistic niche that their fellow Scottish band was gradually vacating. And Murdoch's take on heartbreak-- masculine, but tinged with the classically feminine values of empathy and spirituality-- seemed less emulated than complemented by Tracyanne Campbell's perspective, which was feminine, but tinged with the classically masculine values of coarseness and aggression. ""I should be suspended from class/ I don't know my elbow from my ass,"" she sang to a skittish crush on ""Suspended From Class"".</p><p>
     One of Camera Obscura's finest attributes is consistency. There's hardly a dud to be found in their catalog, and their similarly styled songs distinguish themselves the old-fashioned way-- with memorable melodies and unique lyrics. Pleasantly, that ethos remains mostly unchanged on <em>Let's Get Out of this Country</em>; there are few subtle changes to the band's sound, and only one of them is more than cosmetic. With John Henderson's departure, lead vocal duties now rest entirely on Campbell, relieving the music of a measure of contrast. Campbell, however, has more than enough charm to fill the role herself, and so while Henderson's departure shifts the nature of the group, it isn't for the worse.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Let's Get Out of this Country</em> also emphasizes a zaniness that was only hinted at on its slightly more reserved precursors. This is due in no small part to the fabulously schmaltzy Vegas-wedding organs that flash all over the record like blindingly white grins. You can find them short-circuiting the indefatigable bounce of lead single ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken""; trilling through the dreamy melt of ""Tears for Affairs""; and dappling ""The False Contender""'s melancholy sigh. Too much of it would have wrecked the album's delicate poise, but luckily, the group doesn't lean too heavily on it for melodic counterpoint, balancing it out with elegiac brass and moodier organ tones. 
    </p>
<p>
     Campbell's lyrical focus here remains squarely on love and its ugly aftermath. But the real struggle in her songs isn't between men and women-- it's between emotional vulnerability and the stubborn will to retain emotional independence. This unresolved point of view conveys a sense that Campbell's specific personality is coming through the words unfiltered, especially on the soaring title track: ""I drowned my sorrows and slept around,"" she sings, adding hastily and chastely, ""When not in body at least in mind."" ""Lloyd"" contains a familiar Campbell arc, one that moves from timidity (""You can stay a girl by holding a boy's hand"") to hard-nosed pragmatism (""I've got my life of complication here to sort out/ I'll take myself to an east coast city and walk about"") in less than four minutes of fancifully brisk pop.
    </p>
<p>
     On ""Come Back Margaret"", Campbell addresses the still-pined-for ex of her own still-pined-for ex with ""tears in [her] eyes"", but still acknowledges that she ""likes the free days with no expectations."" And on the weepy, twanging ""Dory Previn"", Campbell is ""sick of the sight of [her] old lover"", eventually concluding that it's ""time I let my love for him die."" No endless yearning for Campbell, but no defiant posturing either-- instead, she explores the vagaries of searching for the circuitous route between the two. Though they haven't changed much in the span of three terrific albums, Camera Obscura no longer recall Belle &amp; Sebastian; they only sound like themselves.

Maybe, maybe not. Bambaataa did hook up with Tommy Boy founder, Tom Silverman, though, and the dominoes tumbled. Twenty-five years later and the influence of ""Planet Rock"" is still heard on a daily basis, from the freshest Southern anthems to Visa commercials, so it's no surprise Tommy Boy, in conjunction with Rhino, chose Bambaataa staples and related tangents as the meat of this 2xCD tale. Fortunately for us, these songs, like all great pop singles, cannot be diminished by repetition, imitation, or the patina of age, so their inclusion here is less resuscitative than contextual, placing the songs in Tommy Boy's early genealogy instead of another redundant old school compendium.</p><p> Sounds fun, right? Well, it is, and this is due to the compilers' utter lack of pretension or revisionist cool. Yeah, ""Planet Rock"" and ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" are unimpeachably awesome, but Information Society is less so, yet somehow, its 80s one-hit ""What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)"" is as inoffensive here as it ever will be. <em>The Tommy Boy Story</em> seems familiar-- even by Tommy Boy's compilation-happy standards-- but, by shaking its skeletons and dispensing with the dustier artifacts, it succeeds in making what could have been another nostalgia yard sale sound and look surprisingly new.</p><p> The newness is not in the material itself; most of this is readily available or a slightly altered edit of readily available. The fresh feeling comes from the tastefully selected, one-stop quality that evades when these songs are tucked into a 5xCD boxset or a fat-filled, overambitious compilation. The focus is narrow and the story is straightforward. In the beginning, there was Afrika and so on. Disc 1 draws the electro-line from ""Planet Rock"" through the throbbing heartbreak of Club Nouveau to the acid house godfathers, 808 State's ""Pacific 0101"", a rare-ish remix originally available on a promo single.</p><p> Disc 2 goes Bam-lite, with only ""Jazzy Sensation"", and traces its lineage through the aforementioned Info Society and proto-hip-hop-soul of the Force M.D.'s (a must for hump-tapes). This second side makes closer connects with the simultaneous house and techno movements in Chicago and Detroit, respectively, by focusing on the Latin-influenced freestyle of guys like Joey Gardner, ""Little"" Louis Vega, and the Latin Rascals. It might not be as infinite, but it's a good intro to an underappreciated strain of dance music. Check Queen Latifah's sweaty, whispered-word ""How Do I Love Thee"" and the screwed-Kraftwerk and vocoder of ""Salsa Smurph"".</p><p>  Packaged to resemble a 12"" record sleeve, <em>The Tommy Boy Story, Vol. 1</em> is more concerned with getting spins at a party than being a completist's anthology, and unless you need to own various versions of ""Pack Jam"", this will probably do you just fine. Consider a hands-free DJ set, and remember to play K7's ""Come Baby Come"" when you're ready for people to go home.</p></div>"|9078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9078-the-tommy-boy-story-vol-1/|7.5|Peter Macia

    ""Love is a bolt from the blue/ But what is a bolt but a glorified screw?""</p><p>
      That nice little bit of wordplay, from the opening bars of Augie March's  third album, exemplifies what this band is about. In keeping  with songwriter Glenn Richards' background as an English major, they make  literate, studied music richly adorned with unexpected turns of phrase, both  lyrical and musical. That the Australian quintet has barely secured reliable  distribution in North America is a minor crime-- with bands like the  Decemberists and Belle &amp; Sebastian in the ascendant, they're a natural fit.</p><p>
      While they'd sit nicely on a bill with those bands, though, they're reminiscent of a far  less <em>au currant</em> band: Grant Lee Buffalo. It's more than just a passing thing, too, as ""Just Passing Through"" practically sounds like an update of GLB's ""APB"", though it certainly doesn't seem intentional. Most of it is down to Richards' warm croon and avoidance of uninteresting melodic phrasing. Like Grant Lee Phillips before him, he's a thoughtful singer who clearly spends as much time on the melodies as the words.
    </p>
<p>
     The vocal on ""Mother Greer"" doesn't flow so much as tumble, with words falling over the band's loping, country-inflected arrangement. The country influence threads through much of the band's output, making itself known in the tasteful tack piano of ""The Baron of Sentiment"" and frequent flourishes of slide guitar. ""The Honey Month"" plants its flag in an English music hall with its opening clarinet and trombone fanfare, but the echoes of an earlier era dissipate in a London fog of weary guitar, hazy Hammond organ, and a spot of Theremin. The song's atmospherics turn it into the album centerpiece, juxtaposed as it is with ""Just Passing Through"", the album's hardest rocker.
    </p>
<p>
      For the second album in a row, Augie March prove that generosity is their  biggest fault, stretching the album too thin at one hour plus, a runtime  that could easily have been trimmed by eliminating the rather stultified  seven-minute behemoth ""Clockwork"". Still, it's a vastly enjoyable record, and the bits that get too long are  easy enough to ignore when taking in the larger picture. Hopefully, the  machinations of the music industry will be kinder to them and they'll take their rightful place in the players of fans of literate pop around the world.

     Purple City got a deal off Dipset's rise to whatever incoherent mastery of New York they have, or had; because of it, dudes went from socks and flip-flops to getting shout-outs on Jeezy verses and being recognized on the street-- even when they weren't wearing purple. But their affiliation's down to business, not art: Whatever people love about the Set-- wordplay, vile facts about their bodies and the women upon which they inflict them, the immaculate swagger-- never made it to Purple City. <em>The Purple Album</em> has exactly one guest from their elders in pastel, and that's Jim Jones. Maybe 40 Cal had jury duty?</p><p>
     Although Purple City don't carry the avant-garde torch, they don't embarrass themselves either. Instead, they simply stay true to what little territory they've already staked out. Agallah, their sometimes producer and oft-times rapper, has produced respectable MCs for 10 years; Un Kasa, their best talent, was supposedly known for his ability uptown before he linked up with Purple City; and Shiest Bub, well, made T-shirts for Diplomats before bootleggers took the work over. All three can ride a beat-- <em>The Purple Album</em>'s by-numbers New York/Trap-South production guarantees it's not difficult-- and none deviate from the guns-cash-cars-money-n-sodomy script that made them mid-weight mixtape stars.</p><p>
      So <em>The Purple Album</em> soars all the way up to maddeningly average. Their occasional competency promises more-- with Harlem's current diminishing returns, fans will take talent where they can find it-- then never deviates from its drearily solid course. I count one highlight: Kasa's almost impossible to decipher, J.R. Writer-worthy wordplay on ""Purple City in the Lot"", bounced off a little winding organ riff and 4/4 clap. If nothing else, it sinks Shiest's Cam -- ""I been stylin' out, iced-out tennis chains/ Tennis bracelets, rings/ We the tennis game""-- on ""Catch Him"", a song that also steals dude's production, throwing fake-opera and cymbal crashes at its everyday beat.
    </p>
<p>
     Mostly though, Purple City have the same decent luck with scores of no-name producers that Dipset's managed for years: ""P.A.Y.D.A.Y."" gets nostalgic with a Wurlitzer soar, and their Southern crunk capitalization ""Trap Nigga"" at least doesn't sound too cynical. Elsewhere, their hatred-of-women moment is mercifully brief: The contemptible ""Grind Slow"", in which Buddy Klein, who apparently they brought in to say what they wouldn't, tries something about creating a sperm bank in a girl's mouth. It's as predictable and lousy as you'd expect, and registers as lightly as the drug-dealing and we-made-it banter elsewhere. But, hey, look on the bright side: not a single skit.

     After a third album that even the group admits was a misstep, Radio 4 return to doing what they do best. In other words, it's time for another pseudo-political punky reggae party, filled to the (Andy) gills with the stuff you'd expect from a group that hasn't figured out where the line between homage and plagiarism lies. This could be the group's most accomplished record musically, but when Anthony Roman opens his yap he consigns the band's good deeds to the remainder bin.</p><p>
     Radio 4 have always striven to add meaning behind the motion, but good intentions only get you so far. For a guy who's all about starting fires and affecting change, Roman could use a foot in the ass-- even at his most impassioned, he sounds like Leonard Cohen imitating Eeyore. DFA, bless their souls, knew how to work around this shortcoming: push the monochromatic proselytizing down in the mix, turn up the guitars, and add oodles of percussion. That bit of studio chicanery garnered Radio 4 their best album, and probably also earned them the right to run their mouths off on Astralwerks' dime.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>Enemies Like This</em> features Roman front and center, weighing in on such topical chestnuts as corporate greed, corruption, the unease one feels living in Western society (the band's words), and, of course, Hurricane Katrina. Dig this big crux: ""It's easy to feel/ They're dragging their heels/ As far as the eye can see."" That said, if the result of Radio 4 eschewing politics leads to weak tracks like ""Grass Is Greener"", then preach on, preacher man, and spare listeners any more half-ass attempts at one-upping Interpol. Or maybe they should just write instrumentals. ""Everything's in Question"" starts off fine on a slinky dub-flecked tact and ""This Is Not a Test"" tries to go for the funk, but then in each case the vocals kick in. 
    </p>
<p>
    This isn't to say the album is worthless. For instance, if you're jonesing for some melodica, and your Augustus Pablo records are MIA, then cue up ""Ascension Street"" and try not to notice that it's supposed to be about the gentrification of Brooklyn. If you can't find your copy of the Rapture's <em>Echoes</em> (admit it-- you have one), give ""All in Control"" a bit of your time. Frisky songs like ""(Always a) Target"", the title track, and especially ""Too Much to Ask For"" sound like they learned how to do something besides rewrite ""Anthrax"" for the umpteenth time. That the latter is also the shortest track on the album is probably just a happy coincidence. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, after this screed, I'm sure someone from the group would be happy to point me to the following quote from Kurt Vonnegut paraphrased in their press materials: ""Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae."" Radio 4, no doubt still stinging from the outrageous slings and arrows lobbed in their general direction over previous aesthetic crimes, paraphrase that sentiment. However, they conflate the expression of rage and loathing with the act of critiquing, and turn a comment on critical overreaction into a preemptive dismissal of would-be naysayers. Given what they've cranked out to date, maybe Radio 4 should worry less about their enemies, and more about the finished product.

     Matthew Herbert is a classic British eccentric in a dance scene that valorizes sleek and vacuous cool. In another time you could imagine him walking a crustacean on a leash in a purple velour smoking jacket. You could not, however, imagine him alongside Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos on a beach in Ibiza. Whether it's a minimal jock in Cologne or a superclub jock in Queens, Herbert's records don't make it into many DJ boxes. And he creates albums you can listen to all the way through in a genre built on singles-- he's been responsible for some of the warmest, most inviting and inventive ""dance"" music of all time.</p><p>
      Herbert's has often built his work around three constants: <em>musique concréte</em>,  politics, and the female voice. The influence of <em>musique concréte</em>-- building music from everyday sounds-- has been most audible when he's worn his avant hats, Radio Boy and Wishmountain, but has continued throughout his career. Live and on disc, he'll turn the sound of crumpled styrofoam or whirring blenders into slinky or stomping house grooves. The politics are relatively new. Early Herbert records were lush and luscious and lithe, but not exactly demigogical. Over the past few years, however, Herbert's anti-consumerist and anti-imperialist views have crept into his lyrics and sonics-- that crumpled styrofoam suddenly found itself as part of a greater statement about the fast food nation. And then there's also his Personal Contract for the Composition of Music, which deals with another kind of politics-- the politics of sampling.</p><p>
      Herbert believes it's pointless to sample a trumpet melody or a hi-hat when  you can pick up horn or drumstick. Why not instead build rhythm and melody  out of tapping pencils or scratched denim? Like the  microhouse he had a hand in ushering into existence, Herbert tracks  have a unique timbral and textural pallette-- crunchy, squishy, squelchy,  crackly, snappy. No presets here. It can get exhausting on a  theoretical level-- it's only <em>so</em> interesting that a drum kit was crafted out of sampled dinner conversation or the sound of copulating egrets, after all-- but you'll certainly never hear a Herbert tune built around the familiar sound of an 808.
    </p>
<p>
      The female voice is the part of the equation that gets the least press. But  it's actually his greatest strength. Herbert's first superb work, 1998's <em>Around the House</em>, was  elevated above deep house-meets-IDM by the jazzy burr of his partner and long-time collaborator, Dani  Siciliano. His masterpiece-to-date-- <em>Ruby Blue</em>, a 2005 collaboration with Róisín Murphy-- is so great because he's tackling  <em>songs</em>, not grooves. (Though they certainly groove.) Herbert builds his beats around the singer, rather than salt and pepper them with a sampled voice. It transformed him from a leftfield dance artist into a pop producer with a sound artist's instincts.
    </p>
<p>
      All three constants are in evidence on <em>Scale</em>, another wobbly step down his idiosyncratic path of torch songs, high-end sampledelia, and disco motion. The album draws more from disco than house, from glam than techno, and from blue-eyed soul than trip-hop-- there's a bounce and a skip here that suggests roller-skating rather than chin-stroking. Much of <em>Scale</em> has a sumptuous jazz feel, but unlike Herbert's slightly stodgy and overly retro big band album  from 2002, the music remembers that big band jazz moved the hips. And then  there are the strings.
    </p>
<p>
      Recorded live at Abbey Road Studios, the strings  on <em>Scale</em> are the most sumptuous musical elements to ever appear on a  Herbert record. Wags have already said they're more Lawrence Welk than  Nelson Riddle. True, there is something corny about them, but the corniness works:  Disco was full of records that equated opulence and upward mobility with the  in-house orchestras of 1940s Hollywood. In the race to link disco to house  and techno and beyond, people forget that there was always a brassy,  Broadway vibe to the best disco. After all, it was a short walk downtown from <em>Guys  and Dolls</em> to Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
    </p>
<p>
      Lyrically, the political knives come out within the first few lines of the  first song, ""Something Isn't Right"": ""I just don't know how to bring about  your downfall/ Damn fool/ Go figure out/ How those Christian bones/ Can  orchestrate/ Shock and awe."" They're easy to overlook-- as they are throughout  the record-- because the singing is so creamy, the vocal arrangements so  rich. But once you hear them, like a Magic Eye painting, it's difficult to  un-hear references to ""holy wars"" and U.S. imperialism. They don't always  sit quite right with the love songs-- and like his stringent sampling rules,  it's easy to poke fun at Herbert's political earnestness. But as someone  with a political conscience who makes music, what else can he do?
    </p>
<p>
      Vocally, <em>Scale</em> is a constant delight. Siciliano's voice, once lurking in  the hallways of Herbert's house productions, is now center stage.  Herbert takes the tricks he learned on <em>Ruby Blue</em> in layering and  harmonizing voices and revels in them. Siciliano is one of the great house  singers, belting with glee on ""Moving Like a Train"", only to then  yearn post-coitally on ""We're in Love"", drawing out the title like the  world's most relaxed orgasm. And dig the way she lasciviously opens ""Movie  Star"" with ""you wanna, you wanna put it in my"" as Herbert playfully bleeps  out exactly where you wanna put it. The man himself takes a creaky turn at  the mic at the album's end, cracking like a lounge singer after one too many  brandies.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Scale</em> lacks the unified feel of <em>Ruby Blue</em>, but makes up for it  by overreaching itself. From the number of samples (more than 720) to the methods of  recording (under water! in a hot air baloon! in a moving car!), Herbert has  outdone himself when it comes to his usual conceptual three-ring circus. But,  crucially, this time he's put all that theoretical effort into his  most memorable songs. Sophisticated and whimsical, joyful and yet tinged  with sadness, <em>Scale</em> is one of this year's great albums.

      The first <em>Get Physical</em> mix belonged to a very exclusive club: The dance label compilation that somehow stands in for an entire genre. In 2004, many electro-house mixes and compilations vied for dominance, but somehow none were as consistent, or consistently exciting, as the <em>2nd Anniversary</em> compilation for this hitherto little-known label with a seemingly endless capacity for unforgettable hooks and irresistible grooves. Between then and now, the label's profile has risen considerably, winning over both mainstream dance gatekeepers (Pete Tong, <em>Mixmag</em>) and the more reserved crowd that pays Kompakt's bills, in a feat of sonic multi-skilling worthy of a politician.</p><p>
      So it's at first surprising to find that <em>Volume II</em> falls somewhat short of its predecessor's lofty heights, despite M.A.N.D.Y. returning to the decks to rework the first installment's magic. On reflection, though, it's clear that this sequel simply expresses the problems and pitfalls of Get Physical's enviable across-the-board dominance. Whereas the first volume felt like an unwavering mission statement for an aesthetic already fully-formed and perfectly realized, its sequel finds Get Physical throwing dozens of ideas at the wall-- or, rather, to the nightclub floor-- and seeing what sticks. In itself, this diversity is probably a good thing: looking at the varied array of releases now baring the Get Physical imprint, I'm tempted to suggest that devoting oneself exclusively to this label would still provide a good sense of the breadth of the German techno scene. <em>Volume II</em> certainly pays tribute to this aesthetic openness, mixing up vocal house, disco revivalism, grinding minimalism, pulsating Detroit techno, and trance anthemics with a stylistic restlessness to rival the most dilettantish dance DJ.</p><p>
     Unfortunately, the mix lacks the sort of overarching sequencing logic such diversity requires, instead moving back and forth between the label's increasingly divergent stylistic impulses in a manner that at times feels utterly random. It's hard not to compare this to the organic ebb and flow M.A.N.D.Y. accomplished on their <em>Body Language</em> mix from last year, which covered a similar-- and similarly broad-- range of sounds. Perhaps most glaringly, the temptation to fit in as many tracks as possible leaves some inclusions seeming decidedly cursory. This isn't so much a problem for the more tracky, DJ toolsy selections, but the short shrift given to songs is frustrating-- Chelonis R Jones' gorgeous masochists' love song ""La Bateau Ivre"" is allowed barely a minute to win you over, and Fuckpony's eerily seductive ""Ride the Pony"", whose hypnotic groove begs to played out in full, makes a similarly fleeting appearance. 
    </p>
<p>
     The tendency towards over-representation is understandable when there are so many fabulous tracks in the absentee list, and just look at what made the cut: Rising star Jona complements his panoramic, hard-riffing epic ""Learning From the Mistakes"" with ""Yellowstone"", a simultaneously sweet and sour concoction with a bouncing dubby rhythm reminiscent of UK garage. Francisco's remix of M.A.N.D.Y.'s ""Jah"" is a swoonworthy Patrick Cowley tribute. Elektrochemie's ""Vexed"" sculpts a cloud of smacked-out minimalism into a prowling beast. Luciano's remix of Lopazz's ""Migracion"" features a gorgeously percussive groove that darts about with zephyr-like nervousness. And then, of course, there's Booka Shade's ""Mandarine Girl"", whose multitracked trance chords remain as exciting on the hundredth listen as on the first. 
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps the problem here is merely a case of indigestion from this gluttony of riches. Certainly it makes for a crowded and slightly strained family picture, with brilliant moments stuck four rows deep and jostling to be noticed, and there are too many different faces for you to possibly love them all. But this decadence is also the mix's biggest selling point, suggesting a dance label whose wild outbursts of creativity cannot easily be landscaped into behaving.

     As the home of labels such as Kill Rock Stars and K Records, Olympia, Washington has blessed us with a wide variety of off-kilter music. Unwound, Bikini Kill, and Microphones/Mount Eerie were birthed in the city, while Nirvana and the Melvins used it as a hub, connecting with a population of fans not available in their own smaller hometowns. Something about the bustling college town seems to breed a restlessness that can't be cured with mainstream music. In that sense, Wolves in the Throne Room fit perfectly with their geographical peers. Musically, however, the band is a wholly different monster, combining intense, desolate black metal with dark folk and goth.</p><p>
     Wolves claim inspiration from the ""mystical witch ideology"" of the Olympian forests (a Googling only revealed news stories about a woman robbing banks dressed as a witch, but I don't doubt the mythology exists), and the imagery on the disc adheres to that. The cover is a misty forest waterfall scene, and the sparse booklet shows the three flannel-and-jeans-clad band members ritualistically jamming out in the woods, complete with a naked woman and enough candles to make Smokey the Bear bristle. Oddly, the picture shows two members playing acoustic guitars while a third blows on some sort of woodwind. These instruments don't really reflect the music on <em>Diadem of 12 Stars</em>, but they do give a hint that there's more here than your typical muddy barrage of black metal muck.</p><p>
     The four songs, shrouded in a just-slightly-cleaner version of black metal's usual lo-fi production, range from 13 to 20 minutes. For many of those minutes, the band sticks to the genre's typical facets. An impenetrable wall of wailing instruments is set to a rhythm that alternates from blindingly fast to a slow crawl, and the vocals, mixed low, are desperate rasps peppered with bestial growls. But it's the inclusion of folk and goth that separates Wolves in the Throne Room from the pack, breaking up the madness with moments of poetic clarity. Opener ""Queen of the Borrowed Light"" is a relentless assault for the first five minutes. But seemingly out of nowhere, the distortion gives way to quiet, clean picking and atmospheric keyboards, ushering in the song's second act. ""Face in the Mirror (Part 1)"" introduces witch-inspired, gothic female vocals provided by Hammer of Misfortune's Jamie Myers. But after another brief acoustic folk interlude, the band erupts again into familiar territory with dizzying speed and demonic howls.
    </p>
<p>
     Those who aren't familiar with this style of music might find it hard to see the beauty that is here, and the songs' epic lengths certainly don't invite new listeners. Admittedly, listening to the record is daunting. The songs are complex, with layers of melodies that at times seem to be working completely against each other. Even with the breaks and quiet interludes throughout the songs, it will take multiple listens for songs to differentiate themselves (but really, that's probably not the band's intention anyway). But art doesn't have to be pleasant to be pretty, nor easy to be enjoyable, and <em>Diadem of 12 Stars</em> is a dark, haunting piece that's as gorgeous as it is ugly.

      There's a whole lot of open vowels in the titles to Uusitalo's <em>Tulenkantaja</em>, which apart from being par for the Finnish course, makes a certain kind of onomatopoeic sense, given that the whole thing is pretty much one big wide-open <em>Ahhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuhhhhhhheeeee</em>. That's not to say it's a snoozer-- rather that like much of Sasu Ripatti's work, including that done under his better-known monikers, Luomo and Vladislav Delay, Tulenkantaja favors sprawling structures, bulbous bass tones, and an approach to mood that feels like a slow-burning candle held up to the sublime.</p><p>
      So if you know Luomo's <em>Vocalcity</em>, or any of Vladislav Delay's opulent ambient releases for Chain Reaction and Mille Plateaux, you'll see that <em>Tulenkantaja</em> is also par for the course; Ripatti certainly hasn't jettisoned his subaquatic soundbanks or re-programmed his reverbs, which continue to unfold in characteristically magnificent, granular style. But there are a few twists in the fabric of his dub cosmos, as well. The opening ""Paskaa Musaa"" starts off like a <em>Vocalcity</em> outtake, with cobwebbed pads weaving direct links back to tone and timbre of his earlier work, but a curious moment occurs about a minute in: All of Ripatti's trademark delay falls away to reveal the stubbiest bass sound he's ever shaped, as it goes bonking about in an empty room furnished only with desiccated rimshots and snares. It's not funky, exactly-- even at his most syncopated, Ripatti's percussive outbursts are peculiarly square-- but it's a hell of a lot more uptempo than the sole other Uusitalo release to date, 2000's drifting <em>Vapaa Muurari Live</em>, in which all of the elements feel as solid as spun sugar.</p><p>
     Throughout the album, it's the subtle changes that stand out-- appropriately, I would add, for an artist for whom the theme and variations has always been his defining trope. ""Luminies"" and ""Uutta Verta Hangella"" employ bright, glitter-flecked synthesizers and string pads that might not sound out of place on an Environ record, chirpy and not a little bit whimsical. At the same time, it's tempting to say that his drums have gotten angrier: Listen to the insistent, stabbing snares and kicks on ""Odottava Peto"" and ""Tulenkantaja"", which seem to draw more energy from dubstep than deep house. On the ravy ""Tervatahroja"", outfitted with tubular leads and a gnarled arpeggio, Ripatti sharpens his hi-hats into the closest approximation of jacking house that he's ever come.
    </p>
<p>
     ""Misut Irti/Huutaa"" might be the best example of the ways in which Ripatti has developed his sound. On the one hand it's a classic display of all his favorite tropes: muffled whispers, clouds of static, crisp snares, single-minded two-note bass lines. But at the same time, Ripatti's sense of space seems to have expanded, with different voices making more precise spectral footprints than ever before. It's richer timbrally, too, layering pulse waves with plucked strings and something that sounds almost like a Hammond organ, thrumming with tremolo. Those who have spent scant time with Ripatti's other albums will probably think, ""par for the course,"" and in many ways they'll be right: like the rest of Ripatti's output, <em>Tulenkantaja</em> is at its root yet another remix of a remix of a remix. But for those of us who dig the inner infinities of repetition-- say, those of us who think that Andy Vaz and Unwound may share more common formal traits than differences-- the album shuffles confidently towards the perfection of ideal, one burst of delay at a time.

     Though the press may push this group's metal side before even mentioning that they're an instrumental band, Russian Circles' debut adds sparse, though undeniably seamless, moments of heavy metal grandeur to mostly math-rock noodling. <em>Enter</em> has several moments of gnashing guitars, and the band shows discipline and musical chops throughout, but Russian Circles are metal-dabblers working inside of an indie rock idiom, not a cult band who happen to permeate its finicky borders. (Their circle on a Venn diagram would be completely enveloped by their labelmates at indie-friendly Flameshovel, where the circles of acts like Boris or Pelican just overlap slightly at its edges. No, I'm not going to draw it.) These guys are used to playing for audiences who don't want to hear extended guitar solos with mile-a-minute hammer-ons, or-- god forbid-- a percussion solo. So, they've found a new way to show off: with stunning, bludgeoning, consistently surprising transitions.</p><p>
      Opening track ""Carpe"" stakes out a peak the rest of the <em>Enter</em> strains to meet. It has the albums's most breathless false stops and likely its heaviest moments, veering from ""Twilight Zone"" high note plucking to rubbery fretboard tapping, to punishing power chords and back again. ""Micha"" is a moody Mogwai knockoff that builds from clean guitar and piano to a thrashing crescendo more naturally, and much less interestingly. Thankfully, ""Death Rides a Horse"" brings as much muscle as possible, with a tireless guitar riff riding the song's choppy, unpredictable rhythms. The remaining three tracks (doesn't read like much, but these songs commonly stretch past the seven- and eight-minute mark) traverse a smoother, moodier plane, though there are moments, like the halfway mark of the title track or ""New Macabre"", that are not recommended for pregnant mothers, chronic back pain sufferers, or those with heart disease-- Russian Circles can build an atmosphere so calming and innocuous you'll never see the hammer coming from behind.</p><p>
      The band turns on a dime so quickly, however, that it becomes their best and only trick. <em>Enter</em> never feels like head-down noodling, nor does it get muddled by excess, but maybe it could have used a little of either. ""Hooks"" isn't quite the right word, but the band works so hard on making <em>Enter</em> a seamless slab of genre-melding goodness that they neglected to include any moments that stood out from the rest, so none have a chance of sticking with the listener. The first couple of listens are stunning, and it probably makes for a great live show, but it doesn't leave much of a mark-- just a vague feeling of competency.

     The subtle prettiness of Juana Molina's music tends to engender an undermining passivity in listeners. Our ears have been conditioned by bossa nova records to hear a reserved voice singing a South American language next to plucked nylon string guitars and think of dinner parties, mimosas on sunny mornings, or, if it's something more serious, perhaps a pensive film montage. This sort of thing is background music, we've learned, mostly just by living near stereos during the age of the Cocktail Nation.</p><p>
     Her music may have slipped into the background, even for some fans, but Molina is onto something interesting. Her twin obsessions with the folk music spanning Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil and the shading possibilities of electronics have pushed her work into an unusual place. The guitar is central, but Molina uses the instrument as a line instead of a shape. Chord changes are deployed sparingly, allowing her songs to build horizontally, gradually adding and subtracting sounds to create an endless music that could theoretically go on forever. Here on her fourth full-length, <em>Son</em>, the former television star from Argentina sharpens the focus, going even deeper into relentless and hypnotic repetition.</p><p>
     One knock on Molina is that she pushes a song for five or six minutes when three or four would seem to do. But this take sees her music in a pop realm in which she doesn't really belong, at least not exclusively. Her own eight-minute remix of ""Sólvese Quien Pueda"" from an EP last year that included two further remixes by Four Tet is a good illustration of where her head is at. The length improved the song, re-imagining it as a river with twists and turns and swells that remains constant but never quite the same. 
    </p>
<p>
     On ""Un Beso Llega"", the song's two chords don't signify change or development so much as a weight shift. As her vocals build on each other and the backward noises swirl in the tune becomes weirdly psychedelic, but in a controlled and careful fashion. So much of her change is incremental: The final minutes of wispy drone sound as though her voice hasn't gone but is just buried.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Son</em> is sequenced carefully. It modulates slowly between poles, from sunny to uneasy, from tuneful to open-ended and searching. ""Rio Seco"" and ""Micael"" are short, direct mood pieces that have their say and get out. On the expressionistic title track the whole notion of a song slowly drops away until we're left with an electronic rumble and some strange whistling. ""Las Culpas"" double-tracks Molina's voice as she drops an octave, sounding ominous and solemn. It's sequenced like a road that stretches to the horizon and the sun is up for 55 minutes. 
    </p>
<p>
     The missing piece of the puzzle for us monolinguals, of course, is the lyrics. I don't know what these songs are about. I do know that the record as a whole is concerned with the sounds of nature. Field recordings bleed into the mix, we hear the sound of birds and water, and Molina herself frequently drops the Spanish to cackle or mimic the nasal whine of a cat. ""La Verdad"" contains both bird songs and a closing bit of scat singing that moves between annoyingly feral and surprisingly soulful. 
    </p>
<p>
     All of this happens within a prescribed sound that remains consistent, which tends to reward the people who want to tune the music out. But close attention reveals an album of highly varied moods and textures. Molina's a bit of a stealth artist, actually, sneaking into the deeper recesses of your brain after mesmerizing the lobe that wants only easy pleasure. Listen with one ear at your own peril.

     It's been a year since recovering IDM nerd Jamie Lidell turned his iBook and Ableton rig in for a fedora and microphone, and judging from the success he's had since, the move has served him well. On last year's <em>Multiply</em>, the talented Lidell evoked Motown's classic chord changes and rich melodies while simultaneously running them through the digital wringer, in turn reinventing himself as a whiteboy soul singer for the Shoreditch set. With that record serving as his ideological template, Lidell even further conflated those two sides in his live show. While the gimmick didn't always work, it hammered home the notion that Lidell's trick was one of alchemy: A trenchcoat-clad soul singer with throwback stage moves and a propensity for scatting vs. a small army of hiccuping samplers, synths, and laptops.</p><p>
     And now, as if to further underline the point, there's this. A stopgap release comprised of remixes, alternate takes, live versions, and covers, by rights <em>Multiply Additions</em> shouldn't be any different from your stereotypical odds-and-sods disaster. And yet, somewhat improbably, it's not only totally listenable, it's one of few albums of its kind which one might argue is better than its predecessor without getting laughed out of the room.</p><p>
     A lot of that has to do with its source material. Where an artist like Feist or Death From Above generally has to rely on a remixer's ingenuity to sand away its edges into electronic-friendly form, Lidell's simpler, more aerodynamic tracks practically come remix ready-made. More often than not, he only ever has to decide whether to skew more clearly to jazz-- as he does on sparsely arranged live versions of ""You Got Me Up"" and ""Game For Fools""-- or commit more to electronic music, as with Freeform's sleek electro recut of ""When I Come Back Around"" and Luke Vibert's mirrorhouse funk remix of ""A Little Bit More"". Because most of these new versions veer decisively towards one of those two directions, the album's overall balances basically remain the same. So where most remix records feel like amorphous blobs that bear only occasional resemblance to their originals, <em>Additions</em> feels like the whole of <em>Multiply</em> in reconstituted form. In other words, its got all the same colors in the same amounts, they're just applied differently.
    </p>
<p>
      Conceptually, there's a bit of a missed opportunity here. With the album's first five songs perfectly mirroring <em>Multiply</em>'s running order, you can't help but wonder if Lidell shouldn't have just tried to make a completely different version of the same record. Instead, in place of new takes on the soul ballad ""This Time"" and the jittery skitterfunk of ""Newme"", we get two versions each of ""Multiply"" (which appears in a minor key hotel piano bar configuration and as a chugging instrumental courtesy of Herbert) and ""Game For Fools"" (once live from Paris and later as a charming ukelele-backed cover by occasional Herbert foil Mara Carlyle). But even despite the slight repetition, nothing on <em>Additions</em> feels extraneous-- every bit as nimble and as listenable as its precursor, this is the rare companion record that doesn't feel like a total afterthought.

      In 2004, the Texan psych-folk group Charalambides released <em>Joy Shapes</em>, a haunted, captivating album that will likely come to be considered their masterpiece. Since then, the group's two primary members, Tom and Christina Carter, have moved to opposite ends of the country and largely gone their separate musical ways, though they've both remained as prolific as ever. Each has released solo works and participated in an impressive array of collaborations: Tom performing in various duos with musicians like Robert Horton, Sandy Ewen, and Marcia Bassett, while Christina released albums with Loren Connors and Andrew MacGregor aka Gown. Despite the artistic success of these and other projects, however, there is an elusive, transcendent communion the two can only fully achieve together with Charalambides, purified strains of which are manifest on the pair's meditative new album, <em>A Vintage Burden</em>.</p><p>
     As is the case with their fellow Houston native Jandek, the contents of Charalambides' vast discography can appear from a distance to be more or less homogenous. But upon closer inspection one can easily discern several distinct periods in the group's musical history, each with its own unique charms. For Charalambides, the timeline can be most obviously delineated by group membership, as they've spent two separate extended periods as a trio first with second guitarist Jason Bill and more recently with co-vocalist/pedal steel player Heather Leigh Murray, who departed after the release of <em>Joy Shapes</em>.</p><p>
<em>A Vintage Burden</em>-- a striking about-face from the mystical abstractions of <em>Joy Shapes</em>-- appears to be the beginning of yet another new chapter in the Charalambides' ongoing, spirit-driven narrative. Gone are that album's wordless, ecstatic vocals and elliptical structures, replaced instead by some of the duo's most direct and song-oriented material since their 1992 debut <em>Our Bed Is Green</em>. The Charalambides' individualized sound has always been grounded in the dual vocabularies of traditional acoustic folk-blues and high-wire acid rock, and here the pair occasionally seem to be paying discreet homage to stylistic forbears like Neil Young or the Grateful Dead. Tom's exquisite soloing on the 17-minute instrumental ""Black Bed Blues"", seems particularly Jerry Garcia-like as it moves from arid Texas bottle-neck blues to passages of intricate psychedelia that can resemble the time-collapsed ""Dark Star"" collages of John Oswald's Grayfolded project.
    </p>
<p>
     Lacing together a quiet pulse of E-bowed guitar and lap-steel beneath Christina's plainspoken vocal, the melodic ""Spring"" is quite possibly the simplest Charalambides song on record-- and arguably one of the most starkly beautiful. Over the years, Christina's voice has evolved into an instrument of extraordinary depth and nuance, and throughout the album her vocals are given a newfound authority in the mix. On this track her reflective, animating lyrics (""Do not wait/ Go outside/ Sky is blue/ Full of stars"") fly against the naturally lonesome grain of her delivery, providing a delicate contrast to the wintry, downcast folk of the following ""Dormant Love"".
    </p>
<p>
      Given <em>A Vintage Burden</em>'s relatively standard space-blues construction, there's sure to be those Charalambides fans who will miss the levitational scope of the group's more free-form transmissions. But tracks like the slow-built ""Two Birds"" or the elegiac closer ""Hope Against Hope"" remain charged by the duo's singular brand of indefatigable spiritual exploration. With a sound that seems at once both spacious and intimate, Tom and Christina Carter here again showcase their seemingly innate ability to lock into a shared orbit across the darkening sky, their luminous drift scaled down to its essential, irreducible core.

     The DIY ethic's nothing new, as any caveman will tell you, but in the indie universe it still matters, especially for bands relying on throngs of internet hype and scenesters' word of mouth. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nashville-based Oh No! Oh My!'s debut is self-released and registers across the indie spectrum and beyond, drawing comparisons from the Shins to Simon and Garfunkel. However, Nashville ain't no Brooklyn, and certainly no one's spotting David Byrne or David Bowie at their gigs. Throw in the band's Google-phobic moniker, and you've got yourself a hype machine running solely on a MySpace page and scattered blog fumes.</p><p>
      Songwriting duo Greg Barkley and Daniel Hoxmeler pull off the half-serious, half-goofball indie shtick just about as well as you'd expect from two proud home-schoolers. Obviously the guys have girl troubles, though they're just as likely to deal with them earnestly (""Goodbye to my sweetheart/ You fill my day up like a spark"") as they are in tongue-in-cheek, Violent Femmes fashion (""Jane Is Fat"", ""Women Are Born in Love""). This pull-no-punches, anything goes strategy creates a more relaxed, effortless feel than so many starchy indie up-and-comers vexed by the desire to immaculately emulate their favorite influences. Using twee as a jumping off point, the band utilizes an orchestra's worth of instruments that takes their sound through alt-country, electro-pop, and back.</p><p>
     Opener ""Skip the Foreplay"" is a ""Sesame Street""-flavored flourish, despite lyrics about sex and pregnancy. Barkley sweetly coos the story of an overeager lothario who impregnates a girl before bursting into an über-cute chorus of ""doo-doos"" and ""nahs"" over sparkling synthesizer lines. ""Walk in the Park"" could become your favorite summer folk jam. Bouncing ebulliently from chord to chord, the band hedges the song's wide-eyed gush and family-friendly snapshots with a melancholy sound that quickly evaporates into the sing-song chorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Unfortunately, too many tracks simply dote on impish melodies and moony aesthetics. Songs like ""Lisa Make Love! (It's Okay!)"" and ""Women Are Born in Love"" simply run out of steam where more confident tracks ""Jane is Fat"" and ""I Have No Sister"" motor through hooks and stylistic twists. Luckily nothing's too egregious here, and the album drops at a propitious time considering the bubbly images it conjures of ice cream trucks, beach balls, and slackers having awkward sex. Although exhibiting rather unassuming technical chops, the band's unique charisma should garner results in your heart's blog search engine, if not Technorati's.

      Is Kompakt starting to show its age? In his review of Klimek's <em>Music to Fall Asleep</em> last month, my Pitchfork colleague Mark Richardson lamented the diminishing returns of the pop ambient star's shtick of gently decaying guitar chords: You heard one ostinato dissolving into digital echo, you heard 'em all. But those diminishing returns, especially in terms of the now six-year-old <em>Pop Ambient</em> series, have been in evidence for a while. A crank (or a critic) could argue that Kompakt's kartographers had mapped out everywhere they wanted to go by late 2003. Is all that's left for the venerable techno label to ride the thin lip of the vinyl that separates style from mannerism?</p><p>
      Listening to <em>Hundred Million Light Years</em> you have to wonder. Most of Kompakt's producers have a few pet sounds they like to switch up. See the difference between Superpitcher's skeletal glam reworking of Quarks' ""I Walk"" versus the humid, turgid fog of his own ""Heroin"", the bones of Marc Bolan versus the baleful billowing of Bark Psychosis. But no Kompakt producer has a sound as signature as Japan's Hiroshi Watanabe. His 2002 album as Kaito, <em>Special Life</em>, was the record that made many trance haters finally throw down their arms. Kaito's tracks were strings of blinking Christmas tree lights, almost comically poignant one-finger piano runs, and Sunday morning synth melodies--intimate, introspective, verging on twee. Put it on while doing the dishes. Take it home to mom and not worry about explaining the pacifiers and the big pants. <em>Special Love</em> was the record Boards of Canada would have made had they ventured out from the Scottish countryside and into a city club.</p><p>
      And apparently that's all Watanabe can or wants to do. <em>Hundred Million Light Years</em> is <em>Special Life 2.0</em>--or, hell, <em>1.5</em>. No full-on operating system overhaul here, just a few tweaks to the look of the desktop and maybe an email improvement or two. The basic two-stroke engine of chugging motorik trance rhythms remains unchanged. Funk? Forget about it. Like most Kompakt producers, Kaito's more into freeing minds than asses. Or maybe hearts. He knows those emotion-tugging melodies are his sole reason for existence, and sure enough <em>Hundred Million Light Years</em> finds Watanabe cascading up and down his keyboard like Phil Glass riffing on the ""Theme from <em>Love Story</em>."" And again. And then again. 
    </p>
<p>
      He's certainly good at it. Few other producers could get away with releasing a version album (<em>Special Love</em>) that ditches rhythm entirely for the kind of half-baked approach to harmony and melody that's a hallmark of electronic dance music whenever it abandons the hips. But after the 900th iteration of a two-note vamp or Vangelis sunrise, you may start to wonder if anyone can feel <em>this</em> wistful. Kaito records create a strong mood for sure, but like the <em>Pop Ambient</em> series, a little dab will probably do you.

    Did every mom-and-pop record store on earth simultaneously put all of their Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris discs in the bargain bin? Or maybe Jessica Simpson's performance in that <em>Dukes of Hazzard</em> movie was really more inspirational than it let on. Whatever the case, country-tinged excursions are rapidly becoming <em>the</em> en vogue move for female singer-songwriters in 2006. Everyone from Jenny Lewis and Isobel Campbell to Norah Jones and Michelle Branch have released twanging side projects in the past few months and now Broken Social Star Amy Millan is borrowing the low-brimmed straw hat with <em>Honey From the Tombs</em>, her solo debut. Even without all the de facto competition, though, the LP is a minor affair-- especially compared to the exuberant melodrama of Stars' 2004 triumph, <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em>. Apart from a handful of winning Broken Social Scene-assisted dream-pop gestures, <em>Honey</em> is an austere break-up album dominated by second-rate whiskey'n'tears-fueled backwoods banalities. Without the grit to make her twanging strums stick, Millan merely regurgitates country-folk's most obvious characteristics.</p><p>
    Members of a Toronto bluegrass band named Crazy Strings (seriously) accompany the singer on much of <em>Honey</em>, gently picking at banjos and mandolins. Several of the purely acoustic, drum-less tracks-- ""Losin You"", ""Ruby II"", ""Baby I"", ""He Brings Out the Whiskey in Me""-- skip by interchangeably, all marked by a downtrodden, woe-is-me vibe that permeates the entire record. ""Sometimes I feel like my only friend is a whiskey glass/ You know it don't stop the time but it helps it pass,"" Millan opines on the Jenny Whitley cover ""Baby I"", conjuring a particularly hackneyed sentiment. The abundance of such lazy, sophomoric turns of phrase makes some sense considering most of album's songs were written more than six years ago, but their relic status doesn't excuse such ruminations, which should have been either buried or improved at some point.</p><p>
    Putting its shortcomings into high relief are the album's three tracks recorded with BSS leaders Brendan Canning and Kevin Drew, which lusciously hint at the glossy pop of Millan's main gigs. More sophisticated both lyrically and sonically, ""Skinny Boy"", ""Headsfull"", and especially ""Wayward and Parliament"" embellish Millan's sensual, breathy coo with a perfect amount of unobtrusive atmospherics and lush reverb. Dreamlike and lingering, ""Skinny Boy"" is the album's best pop song, its palpable longing wrapped in chiming guitars and soothing cymbal crashes. Its take on the romantic cycle is nuanced as well, with the singer summing things up thusly: ""Some love, some prostitution/ Some denial, some doubt, some dance."" Meanwhile, ""Wayward and Parliament"" is an experimental anomaly that's more Brian Eno than Grand Ole Opry. Synths offer an ominous intro and are soon balanced by Millan's lullaby croon. Then, about midway through, the song takes a sharp turn into the absinthe ether as jungle drums, skulking bass, and a wafting trumpet evoke a righteously sinister air.
    </p>
<p>
    As ""the girl in Stars,"" Millan offers a blurry feminine counterpart to co-lead Torquil Campbell's haughty theatrics, and together they skewer relationship dysfunction with wit and defiance. But there's little to match the brilliance of something like the poignant aftermath tale ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"" here, as the Canadian songstress trolls the same subject matter while faltering amidst insular self-pity. <em>Honey</em>'s more fleshed-out productions show Millan has the ability to be engaging on her own, but they are too scarce to make this album anything more than a humble footnote.

     On April 4, 1964, the Beatles occupied the top five spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and the first two spots on the U.S. album chart. They also had nine other records in the Hot 100. Today, chart dominance like that is incomprehensible, but the British Invasion's shock troops were truly unstoppable that year. The Beatles had a huge assist from American rock'n'roll and r&amp;b, of course, and it couldn't have escaped the notice of Berry Gordy that three songs in their early repertoire-- ""Please Mr. Postman"", ""You('ve) Really Got a Hold on Me"", and ""Money""-- had originally been manufactured in his hit factory.</p><p>
      In a great bit of circularity, one of the obscurities extricated from the Hitsville USA, vaults for the fourth volume of Hip-O Select's incomparable <em>Complete Motown Singles</em> series is ""Give Me a Kiss"" by the Hornets. It is, perhaps, the worst rip-off of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" ever conceived, with lyrics like ""Let's make the scene for Listerine/ Come on, give me a (sound of band members making kissy noises),"" and an arrangement that lifts George Harrison's guitar part verbatim-- albeit with considerably less technical facility. The odds that the Beatles ever heard this monstrosity are not good (almost nobody heard it, period), but it's emblematic of the way Gordy ran Motown and its sister labels in the early years. By 1964, Motown was a genuine force, releasing consistently excellent music and nibbling at the charts with a constant stream of singles, but Gordy was still not immune to a trend, and ""Give Me a Kiss"" feels like a throwback to his attempts to jump the twist bandwagon in 1961.</p><p>
     He needn't have worried. Motown's own sound hit the top spot four times in 1964, and Gordy's years of patient faith in the Supremes finally paid off when ""Where Did Our Love Go"", ""Baby Love"", and ""Come See About Me"" became the first of five consecutive No. 1 hits for both the group and the Holland/Dozier/Holland production team. Mary Wells added a chart-topper in ""My Guy"" and the Temptations' ""My Girl"", released that December, at last sent them to the top in early 1965. You know these songs-- you can still hear all of them on the radio today-- but they're just the icing on this set's six-layer cake. The 163 A- and B-sides released on Motown, Tamla, V.I.P., Gordy, Soul, and Mel-o-dy take seven full hours to listen to, but it's easily the most solid set yet in the series, and there are only about a dozen songs with which the famed Quality Control department dropped the ball.
    </p>
<p>
      Part of the reason for this consistency is that Gordy finally begun to abandon all the sidelines that were clogging the Hitsville works. The country-focused Mel-o-dy subsidiary was the only imprint still working outside the core Motown sound on a regular basis by this point, and I'm still knocked out by the quality of some of the label's sides. Bruce Channel's ""That's What's Happenin'"" successfully merges the Snake Pit groove with rockabilly for a perfect piece of country pop, and it's the kind of invaluable track that only a compilation like this would have resurrected. Also included is the amazing debut of Gordy's new Soul label, Shorty Long's ""Devil With a Blue Dress"", which Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels made massive two years later.
    </p>
<p>
      While the Supremes were busy taking up residence in the Top 10, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were being eclipsed. As one of the label's first hit-makers, Reeves understandably came to feel somewhat slighted by all the attention Diana Ross &amp; Co. received from Gordy. The Vandellas didn't have a bad year-- they hit No. 2 with ""Dancing in the Street""-- but it's a bit of a mystery why a song like ""Live Wire"" failed to even creep into the Top 40.
    </p>
<p>
      Motown's other big names all check in with outstanding efforts. The Temptations made their first Top 10 showing in January with ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"", and of course there's ""My Girl"", but ""I'll Be in Trouble"" and its B-side ""The Girl's Alright With Me"" are nearly as good. The Four Tops, who had been denied a showcase in their first year at the label, hit right out of the gate with ""Baby I Need Your Loving"", and the Miracles proved ever-reliable. Stevie Wonder dropped the ""Little"" from the front of his stage name and made major strides as a singer on songs like ""Happy Street"". Marvin Gaye curiously followed up the smash ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)"" with a disc that paired a version of ""This Is the Life"" with his admirably refined but still strangely chosen take on ""My Way"". Still, you can't argue with ""How Sweet It Is"" or ""You're a Wonderful One"".
    </p>
<p>
     Gaye was also entering a period in which he'd manage a duet with just about every prominent female singer on the Motown roster. He and Mary Wells teamed up for ""Once Upon a Time"" b/w ""What's the Matter With You Baby"", both exquisite pieces of laid-back soul. This pair is followed on disc two by Eddie Holland's ""Just Ain't Enough Love"", yet another amazing side from a guy who never got the recognition he deserved as a solo artist. Still, his writing and production work with his brother Brian and Lamont Dozier was a defining element of Motown's 1964-1967 golden age, and almost everything they touch here turns to gold.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the joys of this series has been hearing the oddities next to the hits and lost classics, and the final disc on the set serves up a huge one in the form of Ray Oddis's ""Randy, the Newspaper Boy"" b/w ""Happy Ghoul Tide"". As if the Christmastime song-poem on the A-side wasn't weird enough-- Oddis sounds like the narrator from an old educational film strip-- the B-side features him talking with an awful Transylvanian accent to a sped up recording of himself. This holiday season father-son vampire chat gets even weirder when the father closes the lid to the son's coffin, and the son's voice suddenly has echo on it, as though he's been placed in a cavernous room.
    </p>
<p>
      Flirtations with novelty and dance crazes (in this case, the jerk) are at a minimum on this set, though, sidelined in favor of a collection of r&amp;b and soul songs most labels would have been happy to churn out in five years, much less one. 1964 began on a somber note for Berry Gordy in the wake of Kennedy's assassination-- he had been a huge admirer of the President-- but by year's end, Motown had just as much unstoppable momentum as those mop-topped blokes from overseas. The last single on the set is the Velvelettes' ""He Was Really Sayin' Something""-- not a hit, but nonetheless an amazing song with an amazing sound, brimming with all the creative energy that made 1964 Motown's first truly great year.

      Nomo's eponymous debut was one of last year's more pleasant surprises. The Michigan group's Afrobeat-inspired big-band jazz offered plenty of thrills, though its unique identity was still emerging. On <em>New Tones</em>, they've taken that basic blueprint and transformed it into a sound that's more their own, incorporating home-made instruments, a harder, funkier rhythmic attack, and a healthy Congotronics influence. His Name Is Alive's Warn Defever is back in the producer's chair, and the groove this time around is several fathoms deeper than it was the first time.</p><p>
      As he began writing and arranging these tracks last year, Nomo leader Elliot Bergman obviously absorbed the ragged electro-trance music of Konono No. 1 and the other Kinshasa groups brought to light by Crammed Discs, and his latest tracks incorporate things like ""electric sawblade gamelan"" and ""nu-tone symbals."" The album kicks off with a spluttering electric thumb piano riff, quickly joined by staccato blasts from the horn section. As the pieces fall into place, the song gets more crazily awesome by leaps and bounds. When the processed bass and drum kit drop in together under the horns, the whole thing just blasts off, and every note being played by the dozen-plus lineup feels like it's serving the greater good.</p><p>
      Skipping around the album, it's almost impossible not to find a killer rhythm track butting heads with thundering brass. ""One to One"" rides a nasty polyrhythm, laying a swaying 6/8 rhythm against a 4/4 stomp to create an unstoppable groove. You could stick with that charged sway for half an album and not get tired of it, but Nomo moves on after five minutes into the Fela-inspired ""If You Want"", balancing crunching horns with peaceful passages dominated by Rhodes piano and flute. The relative brevity of these pieces-- they range from eight minutes to just three-- is a strength in that it gives you exactly what you need from each composition. Hard-hitting heads, controlled breakdowns, tight solos and sharp attention to detail keep these songs fresh, and they're not allowed to overstay their welcome.
    </p>
<p>
      So in just three minutes, ""Fourth Ward"" takes you on a crazed exotica odyssey, brittle horns floating in the spacious production over Afro-Cuban rhythms in a texture that shoots Duke Ellington's Cotton Club-era jungle music into the 21st century. Sax and ring-modulated synth tangle in the open rhythms of ""We Do We Go"", with the sax frequently sounding more otherwordly than the synth, while the bassline of ""Hand and Mouth"" threatens to swallow the rest of the song. Their cover of Joanna Newsom's ""Book of Right On"", meanwhile, echoes the early-70s free funk of Donald Byrd and Luther Thomas.
    </p>
<p>
      As the album simmers to a close with the majestic horns and clanking metal percussion of the slow-burning ""Sarvodaya"", the sense of having taken a journey is palpable (heck, that song alone is quite a trip). Bergman has taken Nomo well to the next level on its sophomore effort, forging a clattering, vital sound that bridges styles and decades with ease.

<em>Beneath Confederate Lake</em> lie the songs that have fallen away over Pinetop Seven's nearly 10-year history, either discarded, forgotten, or saved for the right moment. For this rarities release-- a companion to last year's lushly orchestrated comeback, <em>The Night's Bloom</em>-- the band troll for a handful of tracks, and the results are surprising. Instead of a jumble of waterlogged debris, <em>Beneath Confederate Lake</em> sounds like a proper album, its songs preserved by the deep, dark waters. Most come from the five years of intermittent sessions that produced <em>The Night's Bloom</em>; they are interspersed with old songs newly recorded, a track by Darren Richard's side-project Grand Isle, and two contributions to the soundtrack of the obscure indie flick <em>Numinmata: When Body Hunts Mind</em>.</p><p>
      As that filmic source suggests, a large portion of <em>Beneath Confederate Lake</em> is instrumental, echoing Richard's interest in soundtrack work. Short interstitials like ""Lewis &amp; Clark, Pt. 1"" and ""Pt. 2"" as well as lengthier songs like the opener ""High on a Summer's Tree"" and the tango ""Fadograph of a Yestern Scene"" conjure a darkly curious atmosphere with a percussive sound that recalls Pinetop Seven's self-titled debut. While the mood and melodies are strong enough to make these songs stand on their own, they also provide a backdrop for the tracks that feature vocals and Richard's literary lyrics. ""The Western Ash"", ""Two Dead Men in a Vermont Graveyard"", and the alternate take of ""Hurry Home Dark Cloud"", which are all from the <em>Night's Bloom</em> sessions, develop the musical and conceptual themes the band introduced on that album. They make full use of the larger lineup to create a lush, textured sound over which Richard's inimitable vocals shimmer like an aurora borealis.</p><p>
     The cover of Tom T. Hall's ""The Promise and the Dream"" proves the album's only misstep, despite the opportunity it grants the band to expand into overt C&amp;W territory. Richard gets points for updating a post-Vietnam ballad and making it explicitly topical, but Hall's straightforward lyrics, which suited him just fine, sound too plainspoken for Richard's otherworldly voice when divorced of narrative context. He just can't sell a line like ""The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""
    </p>
<p>
     Still, this song and the similarly timely-- and more successful-- title track instructively point out the complexity of Richard's songwriting. He sets his story-songs in a hazy American past that incorporates colonial figures, Old West and Native American imagery, and dustbowl details, which are echoed in the technical complexity and antiquated instrumentation of the music. And yet, no matter how historically rooted the music, Richard's concerns remain current. He's engaging the past to address the present, and by relaxing thematic control over the selection and sequencing of these songs, he may have come up with his most relevant album to date.

     I guess Feu Thérèse's debut album is supposed to pacify militant fans of Fly Pan Am, but one wonders how many Francophone enthusiasts are willing to devote time and money to an ensemble that feels more like the side-project of a side-project than a coherent band. <em>Feu Thérèse</em>'s formula seems both familiar and over-ambitious: The scraping guitar of Pan Am's Jonathan Parant joins the psych electronics of Shalabi Effect's Alexandre St-Onge for a project commemorating Luc Ferrari, a French composer known for textured tape works. The dedication may be pretentious, but it's also a bit confusing since Thérèse has more of an affinity for wild improvisation than Ferrari's clinical precision. But the concept is clear: to enhance Constellation Records' usual art-punk doldrums with even more unsettling sound effects and tape manipulations.</p><p>
     The results are happily varied, though they also feel somewhat formless. The most experimental pieces are also the most gratuitous and exhausting. Not that this is an outright criticism. There are scattered moments of insight everywhere. The most interesting (and infuriating) feature of the album is its rapid-fire transitions from <em>musique concrete</em> to 4/4 indie pop. Like Pan Am, Feu Thérèse take a perverse pleasure in turning aneurismal synthesizers into upbeat garage tunes and orchestral jingles. These look-what-we-did! antics are especially grating considering Thérèse's best tunes are just extended psych drills, particularly ""Mademoiselle Gentleman"", a feedback seizure of robot bleeps and dub-soaked static. The vocal track sounds like a pigeon infestation in the best possible way.</p><p>
     Nonetheless, the remainder of the album is merely competent and mostly dull. Witness ""Tu n'avais qu'une oreille"", a 10-minute slog through dour whispers and funereal chants. I think I know what Thérèse is trying to evoke-- Arctic landscapes, spiritual ethereality-- but after a decade of Quebecois post-rock records, it just reminds me of software ads and après-ski bars. By the time the band gets to ""L'homme avec coeur avec elle"", Parant is unabashedly referring to mid-1970s Pink Floyd. Sure, there are some fascinating effects: ornithological recordings, leaky pipes, parliamentary speeches. But they often seem like superficial adornments, not structural necessities. At this point, Thérèse have not yet reconciled the mystery of their experimentalism with the bluster of their guitars. The frustration arises from the fact that Thérèse are clearly capable of better material, as group members have demonstrated in the past. As for the present, it's a promising-- yet somehow unfulfilling-- debut from a group with limitless talent and leaden songs.

     My co-workers often feel the need to tune out the noise pollution leaking from my desk area. For routine music, their impromptu containment procedures work pretty well: They either ignore the sound or erect semi-functional barriers to physically block it out. Certain bands, however, have proven themselves to be not so easily silenced-- particularly ones with eccentric or piercing vocals, fickle and random arrangements, or rhythms that don't fit into gentle 4/4 time signatures.</p><p>
     So obviously, queuing Deerhoof is one of the top causes of this arrangement's failure, inspiring the dreaded one-two question punch of ""what in the <em>hell</em> are you listening to?"" and ""can you please turn that down?"" Even last year's <em>The Runners Four</em>, arguably the group's most accessible and coherent album, couldn't prevent this interrogation, with its sudden bursts of video-game hardcore, Satomi Matsuzaki's schoolkid yelps, and the occasional ditty about pirates or private investigators. Attempts to explain its appeal were met with slow backing-away and a renewed soundproofing effort.</p><p>
      I could never quite verbalize that one of the reasons <em>The Runners Four</em> clicked with me was its relative decline in eccentricity, as compared to the rest of the Deerhoof catalogue; with its epic peaks, three-sided concept, and ""Pinball Wizard"" teases, the album was decidedly classic rock in intention. Now this new covers and live EP, made available as a <a href=""http://deerhoof.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>free download</u></a> in honor of departing member Chris Cohen, legitimizes that interpretation, choosing material from 1960s pop/rock groups rather than avant-prog artists. Here's something safe for work, I figured, because really, how weird can a Beatles or a Herman's Hermits cover get?
    </p>
<p>
     OK, pretty weird. A radio session version of Deerhoof's ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"" has been floating about for a while, but the studio recording included here wouldn't feel out of place on a <em>Freakiest Beatles Covers Ever</em> comp: Satomi pitches her campfire vocals extremely high and multi-tracks them all over the headphones, allowing Greg Saunier to have a myoclonic seizure all over his drums for the duration. It's the perfect encapsulation of the Deerhoof aesthetic, lying somewhere between kid's song and horror movie, the Willy Wonka boat ride sequence of Beatles remakes.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, the other covers don't take nearly as many liberties, sounding more like end-of-rehearsal fuckarounds than transcendent reimaginings. Obligatory Woodstock footage accompaniment ""Goin' Up the Country"" is weird only for how straight it's performed, down to the note-for-note recreation of the porch-hippie lead guitar part. Herman's Hermits' ""There's a Kind of Hush"" is a bit of an afterthought, a minimalist coda stripped down to Satomi's sweet vocals and one-instrument-at-a-time backing. Similarly subdued, if more effective, is their take on My Bloody Valentine's ""Lose My Breath"", which replaces Kevin Shields' guitarchestra with cavernous empty space before straightforwardly building to a satisfying crest. 
    </p>
<p>
      Productive silence is also the highlight of the EP's live cuts, tracks from <em>Milk Man</em> and <em>The Runners Four</em> that show off the band's ability to wildly careen between machine-like onstage tightness and a willingness to let their material evolve. ""Wrong Time Capsule"" and ""Scream Team"" especially stand out, displaying the band's mastery of the old loud/soft dynamic trick while Satomi juggles verses out of order and thrums an absurd bass tone. It's proof that Deerhoof are at their best when they're at their most cumbersome, immune to even the traditional weirdness-nullifying maneuvers of covers or live recordings; try as they might, they're one group that'll never be safe and subtle for the workplace.

     Sometime in the late 1970s, rock music officially reached adulthood. The fans who grew up on rock as a wild, youthful counter-culture were getting older; they had careers, kids, fancy stereo equipment, and whole new sets of concerns. The same went for the stars themselves: Suddenly it was natural for them to look like adults, wear tapered suits, and act like they probably knew a lot about wine and real estate. Think of Rod Stewart, Dire Straits, Mick Jagger at Studio 54, and all those California guys who grew beards and indulged in self-employed guitar-strumming on self-owned houseboats. The British dreamed of an adult high life and the Americans dreamed of white-collar vacations, and they began to make music <em>about</em> those dreams.</p><p>
     By the time Pet Shop Boys came along, pop was fairly adult, and they certainly sold adult-like pop: reserved and witty, even arch. Funny thing about them, though: They're one of the first acts I can think of to have navigated their own career-long growing-up with a form of electronic music. It's been fascinating to watch an act like this become elder statesmen of the British charts, and to bend synthesized dance-pop around the kind of music elder statesmen make-- music that's more careful, eloquent, and subtle, music that's wiser and less demonstrative. Rock guys, after all, usually turn to acoustic guitars and ""roots"" to pull this off, and plenty of non-rock acts (hello, Madonna) can never quite do it gracefully. But Pet Shop Boys have the qualities to make it possible: Pop music that always came from clever heads, a style that was always a bit distanced, and a sound-- Neil Tennant's clear, airy voice; Chris Lowe's lovable building-block electronics-- that makes them wonderfully, even <em>comfortingly</em> familiar. We don't so much need newness and excitement from them; they can just drop in for a little chat, and we'll be glad to see them, and there'll always be some witty thing they pull that's a true surprise.</p><p>
<em>Fundamental</em>, as cleverly titled as any of the eight albums that preceded it, should be a prime moment for this duo, and it is without question a grand improvement from their most recent work. Their electro-disco is back in fashion, which lets them return to, umm, fundamentals: Working again with 1980s star producer Trevor Horn, they make tracks like ""Integral"" pop with a grandiose synth drama half-worthy of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. (Singles and companion discs also get packed with remixes by new-breed electro-disco stars, like Richard X and Michael Mayer.) They're lyrically energized, too, albeit against a nuts-and-bolts target: Much of the album revolves around Tennant's disillusionment with the New Labour government he once supported, particularly Tony Blair's close relationship with George W. Bush (whom some might describe as being a sort of, umm, fundamentalist). In other words, ""I'm With Stupid"" is about exactly what you'd think it would be; ""Indefinite Leave to Remain"" is about UK immigration reform; ""Integral"" kind of goes wide-angle on immigration and security both, with a sarcastic chorus (""If you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear"") that's nowhere near as great as Tennant speaking coyly after it (""Sterile! Immaculate! Rational!"").
    </p>
<p>
     There is terrific work here: ""Minimal"" does a detour into old-school synth-pop, and ""Twentieth Century"" and ""The Sodom and Gomorrah Show"" add so much harmony and shine that they can't help growing on you. (The latter is nearly a new ""Suburbia."") The best moments seem to come from slowed-down crooners, these moments where we can luxuriate in the fineness and familiarity of Tennant's voice. ""I Made My Excuses and Left"" is lovely on this front, and ""Casanova in Hell"" is even better-- if our pop stars were all young, there's just about no chance we'd get to hear piano ballads imagining Casanova as an impotent saddo who wrote seduction memoirs to create his own sexual myth.
    </p>
<p>
      The question, then: How come the record as a whole just doesn't <em>stick</em>? Much of it seems strangely blank, neither great nor at all sub-par. ""Indefinite Leave to Remain"" just floats along sounding well-meaning, the Diane Warren ballad ""Numb"" flails hopelessly, and ""Luna Park"" is a boring assault on an America of spectacle and cheap thrills that sounds like a bad Cliff's Notes to de Toqueville. There's hardly a thing <em>wrong</em> with it, but who ever likes something just for that? Even the ambition of the lyrics seems somehow ordinary-- exactly the way you'd expect an act like this to write songs about politics.
    </p>
<p>
     But this is what you get when they stop by for tea now: Enjoying even the best parts requires a certain faith in this group, the same kind of fondness that keeps you happy to hear an old friend's stories a few more times. It's to this duo's great credit that they've earned exactly that-- our attention in letting these songs grow on us.

      Since the release of <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>, ""experimental"" is a word that has been clinging like a lamprey to descriptions of Wilco's post-alt-country phase. There's the burbling static of ""Radio Cure"", the number stations transmission at the end of ""Poor Places"", and, on follow-up <em>A Ghost Is Born</em>, the endless motorik of ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"". But throughout the band's catalogue, these so-called experiments are really ornamental additions to concise and crafted pop music. Glenn Kotche, who pounds the skins for both Wilco and spin-off Loose Fur, actually merits the ""experimental"" tag. On his third solo album, Kotche serves up another collection of compositions that give no indication that his main gig is drumming for a pop band. Instead, <em>Mobile</em> is made up of eight instrumental pieces, largely percussive, that chart closer to minimalist compositions of the latter 20th century.</p><p>
     The album begins with ""Clapping Music Variations"", in which Kotche takes a portion of Steve Reich's piece, ""Clapping Music"", as a starting point and embellishes from there. Delicate gamelan gives way to vibraphone and bells that play over syncopated beats-- from both acoustic and digital sources. The piece is representative of the music that follows. It stretches out like a landscape in which instruments and silence are granted nearly the same value.</p><p>
     The album's center, though, revolves around ""Mobile Parts 1 &amp; 2"" and ""Mobile Part 3"". It's hard to discern what Kotche means by the titles: Does the word refer to a noun or an adjective? In the case of parts one and two, it would seem the former-- sonic elements seem suspended and hypnotically twirl in and out of focus. ""Mobile Part 3"", on the other hand, moves forward in a more linear fashion, as if it is approaching a destination. Driven by machine-like percussion, it's the album's most melodic piece-- minimalist piano building against a counter melody of ringing tones.
    </p>
<p>
     Throughout the album the music is complex and unpredictable while never sounding improvised. And yet, although these pieces are wrought with meticulous detail, they're rarely memorable. Instead of sticking with the listener, it's a tremendous showcase for how much innovative sound Kotche can draw out of an instrument typically relegated to timekeeping.

     Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs are linked by their shared great taste in the jingle-jangle morningest, California dreamingest pop from the late 1960s. OK, so <em>Girlfriend</em>-oh Matthew Sweet recently had a band with Shawn ""Rockabye"" Mullins. And yeah, Hoffs' Bangles recorded with post-makeup Kiss shredder Vinnie Vincent. Plus, like, Sweet and Hoffs first recorded together in the <em>Austin Powers</em> backing band Ming Tea-- hey, ""BBC1! BBC2! BBC3!""-- remember? But, uh, like I was saying, they've got <em>discernment</em>, see.</p><p>
       Point is, Sweet/Hoffs' <em>Under the Covers Vol. 1</em> collects tasteful renderings of 14 consistently awesome songs from the duo's fave era, and also the Bee Gees' 1971 ""Run to Me"". Some of the best are kinda-but-not-too obvious, like the Beatles' Jagger burn ""And Your Bird Can Sing"", or ""Cinnamon Girl"" <em>and</em> ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"" from Neil Young. This compared to a technically impressive ""Alone Again Or"" for Love and a disappointingly un-manic ""Monday Monday"". Tambourine jingle and mellow guitar jangle abound, yay. Still, a few complaints: Bob Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" doesn't go over as a duet done the Byrds' way, despite <em>Van Dyke Parks</em> on organ, and ""Run to Me"" ain't ""To Love Somebody"". With so little added to the originals, you have to ask: Why do this?</p><p>
     'Cause it's good fun, and on sober rainy days you can't buy that, not unless you go to lobbyist parties with Porter Goss. Anyway, Parks isn't the only music-geek celeb guest: Television's Richard Lloyd tears into a ""Cinnamon"" solo and bendy-wends Scottish quintet the Marmalade's Hendrix-approved 1967 Dutch Top 30 single ""I See the Rain"", while the Velvet Crush's Rick Menck percusses throughout, and former Voidoid Ivan Julian gives feedback to the Velvet Underground's extremely standable debut-opener ""Sunday Morning"". Other good choices: The Zombies' ""Care of Cell 44"", from once-overlooked masterpiece <em>Odessey and Oracle</em>, the ever-essential Left Banke's ""She May Call You Up Tonight"", and the Beach Boys tropical-themed prom doo-wop ""The Warmth of the Sun"". And good golly, the harmonies. Plus, ""The Kids Are Alright"", all right? 
    </p>
<p>
     Suckers for ballads: Hoffs' ""Different Drum"" (penned by the Monkees' Mike Nesmith) marches pretty close to Linda Rondstadt's sublime 1967 big break with the Stone Poneys, while Fairport Convention's Judy Collins-covered ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes?"" gets country-sad with rippled opening chords somewhere between the Allman Brothers' ""Melissa"" and Thunderclap Newman's ""Something in the Air"" intros. Both do-overs are solid, but in the end, Hoffs has done similar material better, particularly on 1983 Paisley Underground super-collab <em>Rainy Day</em>. Meanwhile, Sweet has played with Lloyd Cole, done swell covers like the Kinks' ""Big Sky"", and recorded the aforementioned 1991 pop-classicist classic <em>Girlfriend</em>. So it's tough to compare here, and hey, didn't I say they have great taste? But I still don't get why they liner-note as ""Sid n Susie"".

    Azita Youssefi's voice is turbo-welcome: It is poseless, free from oppressive emoting and trilling and traditional seductions, like a one-person Greek chorus. (If you have never heard her solo work, imagine a waaay restrained Karla Schickele or Carla Bozulich. If your mp3 collection is sexist by default, shame on you, and then imagine a waaay restrained, and female, Jeremy Enigk or Andy Lemaster.) This voice is ready to make interesting music, and it comes with hands that refuse to bore a piano.</p><p>
      But this 11-minute release is howlingly inessential. First, the lyrics on <em>Detail From the Mountain Side</em> are by Brian Torrey Scott, for use in his play of the same name, and they're leaden with faux-philosophical sub-musings that consistently climax in new-age clichés. [<em>The author claims the lyrics are a spoof meant to be sung by ""idiots""-- Ed.</em>] (Okay, in the interest of excessive disclosure, I am days older than this guy, got cussed out by a bipolar live-in laundromat attendant the other night, and cannot believe that Scott's been allowed to teach at the Art Institute of Chicago. The internet contains several portentous passive-voice-employing works of his that you might enjoy, in which characters say ""We're pretentious,"" after stage directions indicate ""Things are changing."")</p><p>
      So poor, greatish Azita ends up singing passages such as:
    </p>
<em>""William James spoke of the waves of consciousness.<br/>
     Under the sun we live as one.<br/>
     Every soul has got a goal to understand.<br/>
     We all need to feel real.<br/>
     Individually we're all tangly among the fog of time.<br/>
     I think of things and everything in smaller terms...<br/>
     The truth of life all day and all night is in the details,<br/>
      And we've all got so much to learn.""</em>
<p>
      That is deeper than <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, the film in which LL Cool J outswims a supershark. Speaking of water, check this out: 
    </p>
<em>""I am going to sing a song about the circular nature of the world.<br/>
     Just like the world is round, the lakes evaporate into the clouds,<br/>
     And the rain comes down.<br/>
     The rivers flow into the ocean.<br/>
     Everything goes back again.""</em>
<p>
      No shitdrizzle! Ease up, Simba! S'like Oprah and Mount Eerie had a baby named...Dr Phil Elvrum! S'like Carlos Castenada mystifisting that lovably oblivious Forrest Gump! And the un-idea of vapor redistribution gets reprised on the closer, ""Evaporation"", during which Azita seems to strain most to fit her winningly original arrangements to the verbiage's agenda, a la the awkwardest moments of Art Bears or Joan of Arc. Not to mention the under-understated production, which I'll wager is the result of some Drag City mid-tier studio/mixing-board presets. Go ahead and try not to think of Chestnut Station or David Grubbs while listening to this.
    </p>
<p>
      As much as I relish Scott's ditsy, redundant, patience-raping platitudes, I hereby admit that ""Love Is"" contains a beautiful nod to Samuel Taylor Coleridge. And: The transition from the Loose Fur boogie of the second track into the Lennonist procession of the third is among my favorite bits of sequencing this year. But Azita is a talent deserving a less gratingly aspirant lyricist. Too much of what she sings on this EP earns what a reviewer famously typed about Albert Camus' novel <em>The Fall</em>: ""One might define stupidity as the state of needing to be told this.""

     Quality control has never been much of a problem for Boards of Canada. With only three full-lengths and three original EPs to show for its 11-year discography, the duo has magnified its legacy at least partly by indulging in generous spells of inactivity. The infrequency of BoC's output has not only fed into the mythos of their carefully cultivated brand, it's also engendered a level of trust that's served as a consolatory point of pride for fans who've felt shut out by the duo's otherwise total remove from the peripheral obligations (live shows, videos, interviews) of being a musical act.</p><p>
     That trust, combined with the relegation of some of Boards' most transcendent material to low-flying EPs (the quartet of tracks on 2000's stopgap <em>In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country</em> ranks as one of their finest song cycles anywhere) is why those of us who weren't bowled over by the airy acousticisms of <em>The Campfire Headphase</em> saw legitimate chance for restitution with this new release.</p><p>
      Sadly, <em>Trans Canada Highway</em> isn't just Boards' slightest effort yet, it's their flimsiest. Of its 28 minutes, five belong to the recycled album track ""Dayvan Cowboy"" and another nine to Odd Nosdam's wandering remix of the same. That leaves 14 minutes of new Boards material spread out across four tracks, two of which clock in around a minute-and-a-half. No matter how you do the math (and god knows, BoC fans will), it's hardly in keeping with the riches of the <em>Hi Scores</em> or <em>Twoism</em> EPs, and certainly not with <em>In a Beautiful Place</em>.
    </p>
<p>
     There's still great material here-- there's just not enough of it to congeal into any meaningful whole. The best of the bunch is the first of the new songs; with its asthma inhaler-synths, warbling melodies and easy, clanging rhythms, ""Left Side Drive"" is vintage Boards-- spacious and gorgeously arranged. Also great is the incandescent minute-long interlude ""Heard From Telegraph Lines"", which could loop for another five without overstaying its welcome. Slightly less memorable are ""Skyliner"" (which, despite evoking the thumping rhythm of <em>Geogaddi</em>'s ""Gyroscope"", feels distinctly like a B-side) and the barely-there ambient shudder of ""Under the Coke Sign"", which might have been better served as a connector to two darker, more befitting tracks.
    </p>
<p>
     As alluded to above, ""Dayvan Cowboy"" is the star of the show, appearing not only in remixed form, but as the backing track to Boards of Canada's first official video, included on a bonus DVD. While the spellbinding promo (which relies heavily on archival footage from Joseph Kittinger's breathtaking 1960 skydive from just outside the Earth's atmosphere) helps to dissipate the song's lingering trip-hop odors (tell me you don't half expect Terry Callier to start singing when those strings kick in), the remix doesn't really do much aside from make half-hearted ambient and drone-inspired allusions to its source material, making for a fittingly anti-climactic finish to an EP that never properly gets off the ground.

     Posthumous releases prompt a kneejerk cynicism from many listeners. It's been only three years since Johnny Cash's death, and already we've seen a mythologizing Hollywood biopic, two versions of a sprawling four-disc box set, and a best-selling single-disc greatest-hits that tried in vain to squeeze a half-century career into 22 tracks. The Tupac'ing of the Man in Black stretches into the near future, with a fifth installment of his diminishing-returns American Recordings collaboration with Rick Rubin due in July. But for now, there's another posthumous chapter: the vault clearing.</p><p>
<em>Personal File</em>, the first new material released since Cash's death, is two discs' worth of unreleased tracks, mostly acoustic, dating as far back as the early 1970s. The story, which sounds like a legend so is probably true, is that Cash recorded them in his home studio and locked them in his vault. They were recorded ostensibly for his own pleasure or at least for family posterity, not necessarily for public consumption. They sound like he's talking not to himself, but to an audience. All in all, the release feels like a scrapbook of sorts: half entertainment, half autobiography in song.</p><p>
     It's more than enough to dispel the aforementioned cynicism, which admittedly has more to do with marketing than music. Cash's commanding voice is in its prime, the setting is spare and intimate, and his song choice draws from hymns and hits to reveal a deep and complex inner life-- of course, it's great. Occasionally it does seem a little heavy-handed, but that might have more to do with the sequencing than the songs. Plus, Cash is a fine storyteller, introducing these tracks with reminiscences that reveal their roles in his life. He introduces ""Drink to Me With Thine Eyes"" with a story about singing it for a high school graduation ceremony: ""I guess this was when I was looking for myself. But I never forget that because it's one of my first public singing occasions. And I've sung this song mainly to myself ever since I was 17 years old because of those memories.""
    </p>
<p>
     His conversational, unpolished performances keep the mood loose and often add levity to the proceedings. On the Louvin Brothers' ""When I Stop Dreaming"" he can't quite sustain the notes that they held so effortlessly, but the attempt is endearing. Midway through the hymn ""Have Thine Own Way Lord"", his voice booming low and grave, Cash stumbles over the tune and has to start again. Poking a bit of fun at himself-- how often has he sung this particular song?-- he jokes, ""Okay. 'Have Thine Own Way', take five.""
    </p>
<p>
      Listening to <em>Personal File</em> feels like reading an artist's journal or an author's correspondence. These 49 songs reveal depths about Cash, although at times they seem almost too personal, as if they actually were never intended for a public audience. The first disc contains secular material: love songs and tour songs and covers and country laments. The second disc is entirely spiritual, including two back-to-back songs about Mary Magdalene-- ""If Jesus Ever Loved a Woman"" could be a <em>Da Vinci Code</em> tie-in. Given the solitary nature of the recording, this second disc sounds like a form of prayer and praise, as if the Man in Black is talking directly to the Man Upstairs. For Cash singing these songs became a form of worship, which makes this second disc undeniably moving.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, the decision to separate the secular and the spiritual on <em>Personal File</em> seems a little disingenuous and misrepresentative. There's already been a collection of discs that categorized Cash's songs under the headings <em>Love, God, Murder</em>, and the vague addendum <em>Life</em>. That set worked because the distinctions were the point of the compilation, revealing the breadth of Cash's interests and output. On <em>Personal File</em>, this same distinction seems a little suspect: Anyone with a passing knowledge of Cash's career should surely realize that he did not keep his spiritual side separate from his work. His hard-won Christian faith played a crucial role in all of his songs, lending them a moral gravity. Conversely, his secular concerns lend his songs of praise a powerful conflicted quality, making them sound like the humble prayers of a repentant sinner. On <em>Personal File</em>, this separation restricts these songs and their meanings and melodies: Why wouldn't ""Have a Drink of Water"", about Jesus in Samaria, fit right alongside Cash's take on John Prine's ""Paradise""? Or ""The Engineer's Dying Child"" alongside ""My Children Walk in Truth""? What would this tell us about such a complex American figure? I recommend you shuffle the tracklist and find out for yourself.

     In retrospect, it seems that the 2004 debut album by Andy Cabic's Vetiver-- which featured contributions from Devendra Banhart, Hope Sandoval, and Joanna Newsom-- was a clear-cut case of freak-folk by association. Since then, Cabic has maintained his close affiliation with Banhart both as member of Devendra's live band Hairy Fairy and as co-owner of the pair's Gnomonsong label. Yet as evidenced by Vetiver's second full-length album, <em>To Find Me Gone</em>, Cabic's music has evolved to the point where it now shares little in common with Banhart's whimsical, fingerpicked delicacy or any other distinct folk traditions. The album instead finds Cabic nudging Vetiver toward the lost canyons of airy West Coast soft-rock and laid-back, country-tinged introspection, all harvested with a dreamy, narcotic warmth and just enough melodic grit to avoid a complete departure off into the twilight.</p><p>
     Vetiver's instrumental line-up has always been fluid, but here Cabic assembles a stellar supporting cast. For this occasion, basic tracks were recorded by Cabic along with guitarist Kevin Barker (Currituck County) and drummer Otto Hauser (Espers, Nick Castro), with further embellishments added by musicians like Banhart, cellist Alissa Anderson, and Dave Scher (Beachwood Sparks). As with their debut, the album was again produced by the Pernice Brothers' Thom Monahan, whose previous work with Banhart, the Scud Mountain Boys, and Apples in Stereo has clearly prepared him well to handle Vetiver's general cosmic parameters.</p><p>
     Even with all this superb assistance, however, Vetiver resolutely remains Andy Cabic's show, and that's a premise that doesn't necessarily come without some drawbacks. His tranquil, reflective vocals are certainly strong enough to get his songs across, yet they're often lacking in sheer presence and emotive personality. On midtempo tracks like ""I Know No Pardon"", his calm, featureless vocals tunnel their central blank narration through the heart of the group's crisp arrangements, leaving an otherwise substantial performance feeling somehow weightless and hollowed-out.
    </p>
<p>
       It's not surprising, then, that <em>To Find Me Gone</em> is at its most arresting on tracks where Cabic simply succumbs to gravity and allows his voice to be carried away on the music's powerful tidal flow. The dense, mesmeric groove of ""You May Be Blue"" recalls vintage Fleetwood Mac at their slinky best, while ""No One Word"" hovers in the darkened prairie evening on a smoky cloud of pedal steel and cello. The album also reprises and subtly reworks two tracks from Vetiver's 2005 <em>Between</em> EP-- the acoustic strum ""Maureen"" and ""Been So Long"", which is here greatly enhanced by the addition of rich, ambient drones and the restless flutter of Hauser's textured percussion.
    </p>
<p>
     Cabic does permit himself to indulge in the occasional interlude of psych-folk, as on the expansive ""Red Lantern Girls"", which slowly builds to a galloping, electric crescendo. Any lingering afterimages soon evaporate, however, upon the entry of ""Won't Be Me"", a frisky bit of retro-country that wouldn't sound out of place on a Ryan Adams album. On this track, as well as on the orchestrated, waltz-time ""Idle Ties"", it becomes easy to wish that Vetiver wrote better pop choruses, as neither song is ever able to amount to much beyond its initial melodic impulses. The same could also be said of the stately, album-closing ""Down at El Rio"", a pensive semi-ballad that has Banhart's voice and fingerprints all over it. As with much of <em>To Find Me Gone</em>, this finale is informed by a gentle, homesick yearning that is surely an outgrowth of Cabic and company's recent life spent on the constant move. Hopefully this lovely but transitory album can soon be read as Cabic's first step toward finding an open space of arable land for Vetiver to truly call their own.

     Fat patron saint of lost causes, godfather of bastard children who hang out at the mall, hater of Bush: Fat Mike, old enough to be my daddy, should be inured to the failure he's chosen as a lifestyle. For instance: That he's been unable to un-elect Bush should irk him only as much as another Pennywise set at the Warped Tour. Clearly, that's not the case (cf. <em>The War on Errorism</em>, two volumes of <em>Rock Against Bush</em>, and now <em>Wolves in Wolves' Clothing</em>), though who can blame him for getting over animal liberation, er, <em>Liberal Animation</em> quicker than two horrific rigged elections? Optimists know that the band still brings it live-- got that dad joke from the man himself, March show in NYC-- but even the 15-year-olds there knew to mosh harder to 1992's on-the-wagon lament ""Bob"" than 1999's operatic country-hating ""The Decline"".</p><p>
     NOFX can't be blamed for pilgrims like myself returning to the band only to miss all the young miracles we spent our latter teenage years repudiating; if we didn't fuck up too bad, we even came back with the same political views they're currently pushing on the next generation. Now we're fans because they're not that self-important, and they make us feel the same way. Their politics are a consolation prize; your high school band will never again cover ""Don't Call Me White"", but at least NOFX still do, if sandwiched between Bush rants.</p><p>
      If <em>Wolves</em> is guilty of anything it's not containing another song worthy of a talent show; or, worse, offering ones to the ""Killing in the Name Of"" set rather than for the guys with the fat trumpet player. Their title track's own take-- ""We all want a Hollywood end, but we're getting a foreign one/ The script has already been penned, and titled/ The Fat Wreck Chords of a Drowning Nation""-- has a cinema joke but nowhere near the old Rage punchline. Which is a problem for both sides of the locker room. 
    </p>
<p>
     Equally discouraging are the heaps of scorn visited upon uncharacteristically easy targets: podcasts, anarchist book fairs, yuppie G8 protestors, middle America, the fat people who live there, the religious people who live there, and, um, people who like Japanese sex-torture (?!). NOFX get their share-- on ""60% (Reprise)"" they cameo as ""The band with our own label/ With money under the table""-- as does Bush, on almost everything here. But being so pissed off sure eats into the quality of their jokes. 
    </p>
<p>
     No worries about craft though. Like buddies Rancid, NOFX are not-so-secretly pop-virtuosos, playing not just fast but without any kind of discernable effort-- as if there were no gear they couldn't kick into-- and delivering signature napalm time-changes on cue. ""USA-holes"" has a funny name and a guitar solo; ""Seeing Double at The Triple Rock"" has riffs but dumb lyrics about ""drinking quotas""; and ""The Man I Killed""'s Pogues-cranked-up balladry almost makes up for the incoherent narrative about maybe killing the president. Joke ska song? Check (""Marxist Brothers""). Joke Spanish torch songs? Check (""Cantado Español""). Read a review that mourned the departure of El Jefe's horn, but I can't say I miss it. 
    </p>
<p>
     The pleasure of hearing Fat Mike and Eric Melvin make melodic lines out of ""We get what we fucking deserve/ Bringing raised fists to a knife fight"" is vintage NOFX but it also expresses something depressing and new: the desire to kill somebody. One wonders and hopes this whole thing is still fun for them. Probably is; after all, they thank Mischa Barton in the liner notes.

     Let's get this out of the way: If Imaad Wasif's name sounds familiar, chances are you read that he's serving as axe-for-hire in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' four-strong touring troupe. That tidbit might have you thinking Wasif's music is serious balls-out rawk, but you'd be dead wrong. Instead, the skeletal campfire compositions on Wasif's self-titled debut manage to be even tamer than those on the benign <em>Show Your Bones</em>. Hanging his fragile melodies on little more than an acoustic guitar, these songs are stripped down to the point of emaciated frailty. At times, it works and the austerity creates a potent sense of intimacy-- you feel like you're right there with Wasif in some half-lit room, flinching at the scratch of string-slides and rubbing your eyes from all that incense smoke. Other times, though, you'd kill to have some lush orchestral arrangement or backing band bury the neo-hippie schmaltz of his lyrics.</p><p>
     The album starts off with its most arresting tune, ""Spark"". Wasif picks through a repeated phrase while his crystalline voice carves out the melody. By the song's chorus, the muted growl of a fuzzed-out guitar seethes beneath acoustic strums as a second track of Wasif singing in falsetto joins in: ""A spark I forgot had me laying on the ground/ The dark's all I've got and it never let me down."" The album's full of these romantic musings on imperceptible conflict: light and darkness, clarity and confusion, what's on the surface, and what lurks beneath it. But as delicate, single-note piano accents bring a little light to the second verse of ""Spark"", the music itself becomes Wasif's way of negotiating these irreconcilable dichotomies. In the next song, ""Out in the Black,"" he sings, ""I found a space in between/ For all those memories/ Out in the black."" His voice seems to literally inhabit that liminal space between the opposing forces he describes as it divides two divergent guitar lines: a gentle acoustic and a slightly distorted, twanging electric.</p><p>
     But the rest of the album doesn't sustain the highs of its first two tracks. At their best, the remaining songs are soothing, if unremarkable. But, at their worst, they plummet into less tuneful and more lyrically cloying territory. On ""Isolation"", Wasif apparently thought it would be a compelling illustration of loneliness to confess that he's been ""crucified for weeks"" and ""can't shake this old monkey"" or, better yet, to simply wail the word ""isolation."" (High school journal keepers, take heed: you have a new poet laureate.) It's a real shame because Wasif's most striking musical strength is his voice, which is refreshingly pure and unaffected. Too bad, then, it doesn't have something purer and less affected to sing.

      Just how significant is NYC singer-songwriter Diane Cluck? As she tells it on one song from <em>Macy's Day Bird</em>, ""God made it rain so I'd run to the bus stop/ God knew otherwise I'd be late."" And so it goes within Cluck's hermetic musical universe, where not only does she invariably cast herself as the central figure, but where nearly everything else-- apparently including even the weather-- seems to exist solely in order to provide her songs with their direction and interpretive meaning.</p><p>
      With this 2xCD collection, Important has generously combined two of Cluck's early releases-- 2002's <em>Macy's Day Bird</em> and 2003's <em>Black with Green Leaves</em>-- both of which were originally self-released in strictly limited editions. On each of these records, Cluck displays the same distinctive, spartan delivery which has endeared her to both the anti-folk contingent as well as to the decidedly pro-folk likes of Devendra Banhart, who included her song ""Heat From Every Corner"" on the momentous <em>Golden Apples of the Sun</em> compilation. Accompanied here only by single variant strands of guitar, piano, or harmonium, Cluck performs her intensely private creations with a powerful, emotive voice and a full devotion to microscopic self-analysis. It's a no-frills approach that can quickly instill a rather oppressive degree of intimacy, and one that is sure to immediately divide her audience between those who find her over-saturated, myopic lyrics to be intrinsically compelling and those who do not.</p><p>
     In the past, Cluck's idiosyncratic vocal style and lo-fi recording techniques have frequently earned her comparisons to Jandek, but on this collection her performances are seldom as purely atonal or as truly emotionally harrowing as anything in the Corwood catalog. Not surprisingly, the recording quality of the earlier <em>Macy's Day Bird</em> is slightly cruder than that of <em>Black With Green Leaves</em>, or more recent works like 2005's <em>Oh Vanille/ Ova Nil</em>, but the production differences are ultimately negligible. Following a brief untitled introduction, <em>Macy's</em> opens with ""Save Me"", on which Cluck issues a heartfelt plea for salvation from-- predictably enough-- herself and her own ambitions. (""Save me, drape me in weakness, make me excuses, tell me it's okay to lose."") Later, on ""Battlefield Nurse"", she assumes the role of the romantic martyr, lamenting ""Sometimes I feel like a battlefield nurse/ It's a role that I was born for/ I don't need to rehearse.""
    </p>
<p>
<em>Macy's Day Bird</em> also includes ""Heat From Every Corner"", a track whose shimmering, understated mystery carries an intoxicating power, as does ""Hover Not"", which is greatly animated by encircling swoops of homespun, overdubbed vocals. These multi-tracked vocals are used even more extensively on <em>Black With Green Leaves</em>, a decision that helps make the latter half of this collection substantially more appealing. Tracks like ""Crash Through the Half-Light"" and ""Casting About"" move with an entrancing, somnambulant swirl as Cluck begins to rely ever further on her wordlessly coiling syllables. On ""I'm Yr Here-- I Am"" she delivers her most forceful vocal performance, calling out romantic threats like ""Don't waste me/ I won't last long/ And I won't come back"" over percussive guitar strums with the authority of a young Sinead O'Connor at open mic night. True to form, this set closes with Cluck issuing one final, literal call for help on ""The Party Tonight"". Phoning up an nameless friend, she asks, ""Will you prop me up and tell me what to wear?"" as her lyrical voice again crosses carelessly from casual intimacy into distant self-absorption, leaving her listeners again to feel like impolite guests who have tarried too long within Cluck's own private domain.

      If you'd taken a poll of the press section at last year's Pitchfork-curated festival, the winner of the Most Surprising Performance Award would have gone to the Go! Team for their hyperactive Saturday afternoon set.  Expectations weren't astronomical going in, given that the newly created band had few shows under its belt, and the record was the sort of basement studio project that often fails to translate to a large scale. But when the Go! Team live act turned out to be less Ian Parton triggering samples and more Gorillaz made flesh, it was easy to see the journos up front letting their scowls dissolve into smiles so wide the top two-thirds of their heads were in danger of falling off.</p><p>
      Though <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</em> was a Crock Pot of musical artifacts and vinyl-crackle production, the Go! Team live get by on charisma and enthusiasm, leaning hard on the frontwoman skills of MC Ninja, and performing with instrument-swapping, guitar-waving zeal. Certainly, it also doesn't hurt that much of Parton's source material was already drawn from the past five decades of dance music, allowing the band to tap into a block-party spirit.</p><p>
      However, there's no guarantee a successful live show will translate well to magnetic tape, a phenomenon perfectly encapsulated by <em>Audio Assault Course</em>. Subtitled <em>The College Radio Sessions</em>, and available as a sampler at select indie retailers, the EP selects six live cuts (plus Kevin Shields' dreadful ""Huddle Flash"" remix) to demonstrate the band's en vivo sound. Sadly, rather than emphasize the Go! Team's onstage chops, the mini-album ends up exposing their on-stage compromises.
    </p>
<p>
      Part of the blame lies with the antiseptic environment of the radio session, where every instrument is mixed just a bit too well and there's no audience to fuel an energy feedback mechanism. Under this harsh microscope, the glue-stick streaks start to show on the Go! Team's genre collages, revealing how easy it is to upset their aesthetic's delicate balance. While ""Junior Kickstart"" benefits slightly from an increased guitar presence, transforming the song into a lost Sonic Youth with Tower of Power collaboration, ""Ladyflash"" and ""Bottle Rocket"" lose their rich girl-group history montage without the thick drums and carefully woven samples.
    </p>
<p>
      Most glaringly exposed are Ninja's pep-squad replacement parts, which tread embarrassing Rap 101 territory, rendering ""Huddle Formation"" and ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"" newly wince-worthy. Where on record the cheerleader chants were merely another grainy, rhythmic element floating in and out of the Go! Team's hodgepodge, sharpening the focus onto a lead vocalist comes off as shrill and distracting. Similar equilibrium disruptions occur elsewhere, whether due to studio soundboard mishaps or poor arrangement, with the grating harmonica of ""Bottle Rocket"" and the piercing pizzicato vibes of ""The Ice Storm"" torpedoing the songs' textures.
    </p>
<p>
      So, I'm put in the curious position of vouching for a band's live show while lambasting their live sessions album-- fans-only throwaway that it may be. But Parton &amp; co. shouldn't feel bad; the truth being that very few bands' stage talent is worthy of being documented on tape-- particularly one as closely associated with intricate studio-ingredient mixtures as the Go! Team.  While in person the group can lean on fancy video art and an audience that usually can't hear the missing or distorted details, <em>Audio Assault Course</em> puts those flaws on unnecessary display, a doggie-bag meal that falls far short of the original experience.

Their kitschy yet deeply affecting lyrics drew so much attention the first time around that I'd met more than a few people who said they hated the group simply because they seemed like cheeky fuckers. They missed the point, but that's another matter. Follow-up album <em>The Warning</em> is propulsion and power and punctuation rolled up into one, abandoning a lot of the graceful, delicate melodies of the debut for songs with more wallop. It was a necessary move-- a step forward-- and the results are mostly golden.</p><p> Of course, a lot of their pert turns of phrases are still around, as are the molten ballads (""Look After Me"", ""Colours"") but they're usually eclipsed by the zooming, gliding synths, keyboards, and drum machines that push things forward. If their flavor was DF-Ay! before, it now sounds a bit more DF-Hey. Nowhere is that more evident than on the unsteady, maniacally fun ""Over and Over"", the early single that got most excited for their turn to the dancefloor. Built on the best kind of chant (one you can remember), a skulking guitar, and handclaps, the song is a standout among spastic jams like the churning Human League-esque ""No Fit State"" or crystalline ""(Just Like We) Breakdown"".</p><p> The centerpiece, though, comes in two parts, from two angles. First, the throbbing, sincere ""Boy From School"", which is marked by Alexis Taylor's sweetly thin vocals and the heartbroken line, ""We try, but we don't belong."" It's as good a pop song as has been written this year. The second, the title track, is a less direct hit and takes a minute to sink in. It's also got one of those couplets (""Hot Chip will break your legs, snap off your head/ Hot Chip will put you down, under the ground"") to distract you. But like a lot of the band's best songs, it splits into three and four parts, veering into bridges where there should be choruses, verses where there should codas, and dirges where there should be melodies. It's not rocket science, but it's also not botany. ""Prepare yourself for a mechanical fright"" is the clarion call.</p><p>  Thing is, where <em>Coming on Strong</em> had scattered moments of mediocrity or unrealized embellishments, this album has several irrefutable numbers-- and a couple of clangs. ""Tchaparian"" is needlessly jagged on an album full of round edges. ""Arrest Yourself"", a kinetic live staple, manages to avoid the effortless groove created onstage by trying the push the envelope with loose horn sounds and a disorienting arrangement. Their failures magnify an incomplete rotation.</p><p>  As far as improvements go, <em>The Warning</em> isn't so much a triumph as it is a reach in the right direction. Beat maestro Joe Goddard seems to have taken more of a backseat vocally to Taylor's coo and this saps a lot of the joyful contrast from the group. Then again, the bear-like Goddard isn't much of a singer in the first place, though he's obviously got the bigger sense of humor. Their hip-hop influence has been scaled back a bit as well, turning to a punishing rhythm section stacked on top of deeper ambient sounds. The built-for-a-cathedral ""Careful"" opens softly and quickly erupts into choppy sample darts, then cools back down again. Its momentum and retraction is a good metaphor for the record.</p></div>"|4029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4029-the-warning/|8.1|Sean Fennessey

Like González, the Norway-born, Sweden-based Brun ballasts her culturally exotic back story with sparse, English-language songs fluent in the well-established idioms of North American and British folk. But unlike, say, Sondre Lerche, Kings Of Convenience, or even the Cardigans, all of whom pepper their songs with occasional North Germanic trills and slightly skewed-in-translation lyrical quirks, there's nothing in the hard DNA of Brun's music to immediately suggest where she's from. Instead, Brun's surroundings are telegraphed to us obliquely, through the thick fog of her lonely, crystalline songs.</p><p>  Re-constructed for North American release, this version of <em>A Temporary Dive</em> contains all 10 tracks from Brun's 2005 sophomore outing as well as an extra offering from November's <em>Duets</em> record. Clocking in at just over 42 minutes, it's an easily digestible collection of acoustic ballads and minor key melodies that flits between folksy prettiness and something a little darker. With an unaffected delivery and a clear, clean soprano that occasionally sends up traces of Beth Gibbons or Nina Nastasia, Brun aims for the kind of subtle, spacious songs that work best at 2 a.m., and more often than not, she delivers.</p><p> A tangle of guitars, keys, synth drones, and choral voices, opener ""To Let Myself Go"" establishes the album's glacial, unhurried pace. A love song that morphs into a sort of sleepy hymnal, it makes for an arresting start, but the spell is quickly broken by the twangy, mid-tempo romp of ""Song No. 6"". Featuring uncharacteristic oversinging from Brun and guest vocalist Ron Sexsmith, the vampy duet is the album's only serious misstep. It feels at odds with the remainder of the record, which hews more closely to the slower, bleaker side of things. As highlights go, there's also the shimmering ""Balloon Ranger"", which winks at PJ Harvey with a pretty turn about halfway through, the string-drenched ""Laid In Earth"", and ""Where Friend Rhymes With End"", wherein Brun cuts through her navalgazing with a jab at her own expense: ""I can't believe I'm writing a song/ Where friend rhymes with end"".</p><p>  Despite the fact that most of the songs on <em>A Temporary Dive</em> benefit from a spacious, hands-off production approach, the best thing here is ironically also the most ornate. With creeping strings that sometimes veer into dissonance, xylophones and a shuffling rhythm section, ""My Lover Will Go"" has a psych-folk undercarriage that's right in line with Gibbons' very underrated solo album, <em>Out of Season</em>. It's hard to hear it and not wish for Brun to go deeper in that direction on her next record, but for now, this is a welcome start.</p></div>"|1205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1205-a-temporary-dive/|7.7|Mark Pytlik

      In the wake of Human Television's frenetic, frankly awesome <em>All Songs Written By</em> EP, the shoegazy <em>Look At Who You're Talking To</em> comes across as a crawling letdown. The uncomplicatedly volatile perfection of ""Saw You Walking By"" has been supplanted by the over-pensive, possibly (hopefully!) ironic opener ""I'm Moving On"", with its layered guitars and ""I'm dying to be near you"" sounding eerily like Ian Curtis in a necktie. Makes sense, though: Apparently, ""I'm Moving On"" predates <em>All Songs Written By</em> and was the Gainesville, Fla., band's first collaboration. Wearing influences plainly on sleeves, the moodiness of ""I'm Moving On"" resembles models like Black Tambourine and My Bloody Valentine. Thing is, Human Television have always been completely disinterested in breaking new ground, and in their case, it's more a virtue than vice.</p><p>
     Human Television do better when ripping off Sarah Records twee, all heartache and swiftness and music for wimps; they're precious but never mawkish, inoffensively erring on the side of agreeable (that's not a complaint). ""Mars Red Rust"" harkens back to the force of <em>All Songs Written By</em>, albeit less shambly and less frenzied. The guitars are reminiscent of New Zealand pop-- the Clean or the Chills-- and there are traces of the Field Mice, Rocketship, and more obviously, R.E.M. and the Wedding Present. Most everything's harmless, inadvertently summed up in ""Such a Trip"": ""Did a little damage/ Had a lot of fun/ Whatever"". Plainly derivative, the band comes off weirdly refreshing all the same. They're like the sweetest (twee-est?) kind of iced tea on hot days when you're thirsty-- familiar and perfect in the way that new, alien shit like cactus juice or something could never be.</p><p>
     Which isn't to say that Human Television should stick only to pop as jangly and scuffed as custodians' key chains; most of the downtempo stuff surprisingly moves, too. <em>Look at Who You're Talking To</em> is a far cry from the belligerent imperative its title suggests. It is, instead, unhurried and hushed, with lines as unexpectedly touching as ""When the full length of my arm is about the same/ As the whole length of your body/ That would go a very long way/ If you're talking to us"". Among the jangly, ""Inconsistent"" is best. Here's the kind of pop song that needs to exist. There are ""goofy glasses,"" the line ""you look so soft,"" and a confession: ""So embarrassing/ So utterly disgusting/ That a full-blown man/ Could have no concept of time/ And no sense of direction."" If any of this sounds familiar, it's because Human Television's onto something. When they sing, ""All you need to know/ Is how much you are like me"", that's basically the point.

The folks at Family Recordings must understand this, since they use the term ""curator"" for those who create playlists for their mix series <em>The Trip</em>, which has previously featured entries from Tom Middleton, Saint Etienne, and Snow Patrol.</p><p> Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey of Pulp compiled the latest edition and their set is book-ended by instrumentals that act like introductory and concluding movements in a symphony; songs are juxtaposed for stylistic continuity, with a few abrupt shifts when things get too samey. There's no sense that either are cowed by current trends or de facto influences. After all, David Essex's awful ""Rock On"" is probably the best-known track of the bunch. This selection of songs is so hermetically sealed by the curators' peculiar tastes that it actually works, even as it meanders over two hour-long discs.</p><p> It's reasonable to expect this compilation to reveal something essential about Cocker and Mackey's songwriting sensibilities, but the results are never so simple or algebraic; these 35 songs do <em>not</em> add up to Pulp. That makes sense considering how central contradiction and irony were to the band's identity. For every glittery synth rave-up, Pulp had an unadorned pop song draped over a simple chord progression. And tension was always at the heart of Cocker's lyrics. One moment, he's extolling the virtues of non-stop partying; the next, he's nursing his hangover with a profound sense of emptiness. </p><p> The first disc is dominated by folky and countrified ballads, songs filled with heartbreak and a tenderhearted acquiescence to how much people need each other. Bob Lind's ""Cool Summer"" and Bonnie Dobson's ""Winter's Going"" are nice thematic links, as lovers slip away with the changing seasons. The most compelling of these traditional songs is Dory Previn's ""The Lady With the Braid"", which smacks of Cocker's taste for awkward and humane detail. As Previn sings to a potential lover, inviting him to ""stay until sunrise,"" she slips in minutiae simultaneously embarrassing and sweet. He can hang his ""denim jacket near the poster by Picasso"" or, if he gets chilly, he can use ""this coverlet my cousin hand-crocheted"". With such a set-up, by the time she admits ""the night cuts through me like a knife"" the cliché is easily forgiven. </p><p> The mix is also marked by a number of novel covers, such as the Polecats' rockabilly take on Bowie's ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and Bobbie Bare's C &amp; W interpretation of Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"". Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark re-imagines the Velvets' ""Waiting for the Man"" as a robotic dance song with a fat bass groove and icy synth lines. But the most mind-blowing cover is Dion's take on ""Purple Haze"". Forgoing the guitar freak-out that made the original, this version is all plucked acoustic, breezy flute, and scat singing. If it weren't for the lyrics-- which apparently Dion felt were the most crucial aspect of Hendrix's version-- this would be entirely unrecognizable. And no, Dion, we will not excuse you while you kiss the sky. </p><p> Cocker and Mackey's selections are satisfying and offer some degree of insight into the kinds of music that informed their work in Pulp. But for every obscure discovery there's a track that begs to be skipped (Neil Sedaka, guys?). Still, this is, by definition, a mixed bag, and Cocker and Mackey deserve credit for wringing this much coherence out of so many disparate songs.</p></div>"|9031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9031-the-trip/|7.3|John Motley

    Maybe it's the French heritage, or their collaborations with new-age dabblers Air, but Phoenix has proven itself a band in touch enough with its feminine side to embrace the dulcet tones and oxymoronic world of soft rock. With production as crisp as a Frito and singer Thomas Mars' mercury croon, the group has assembled two brilliant singles (""If I Ever Feel Better"" and ""Everything Is Everything"") that could slot into the playlists of hipsters and receptionists alike. Yet Phoenix haven't quite been able to stretch their minty-fresh sound over the length of an album, with too much of both <em>Alphabetical</em> and <em>United</em> floating off into the atmosphere.</p><p>
      The approach of <em>It's Never Been Like That</em> reflects an awareness of this shortcoming, as the band seeks a more consistent sound through mimicking the sloppier styles of those uncouth Americans-- in particular the Strokes. Loosening their ties and unbuttoning their cuffs, Phoenix put on their best slouch, slathering the album with messy, naturalistic guitar playing completely at odds with their usual robotic aesthetic. This earnest attempt at a costume change fails...but at the same time creates the uncomfortable dynamic that makes it Phoenix's best album.</p><p>
      For all the effort made to un-slick their sound, Phoenix just can't keep their OCD meticulousness at bay, utilizing all that slapdash guitar as a cued sonic preset no different from familiar tools like the string-synth and disco-bass. Maybe that modular usage sounds like a bad thing, but instead the interplay between lazy strumming and everything-in-its-right-place arrangements effectively rewrites the history of the garage-rock revival, drawing a line between ""Last Nite"" and Tom Petty and erasing the denial that ""Maps"" was the biggest song that scene's brief heyday produced. The tools in ""Consolation Prizes"" and ""Second to None"" may be the same, but replacing studied ennui with a breezy <em>joie de vivre</em> prevents the pop essence from being overly diluted by rumpled poses.
    </p>
<p>
      Here the band improves on its usual success rate by depositing not one, but two showstopper tracks. ""Long Distance Call"" embodies the disconnect between shamble and sheen better than anything else on the album, with the band alternately stomping the gas and the brake to lurch between their easy-listening older material and the happily polluted new image. ""Courtesy Laughs"" highlights the record's second half with a simple chord progression made transcendent by its metronome rhythm. Both tracks still could have remained middle-quartile indie pop without the carefully calibrated cool of Mars' vocals, operating at conversation-level volume and casually, smoothly hitting his marks without protracted strain even when enthusiastically incanting the album's title.
    </p>
<p>
      At under 40 minutes long, <em>It's Never Been Like That</em> is pretty much a sprint, though even at this short distance the band starts to sound a bit dehydrated on both five-minute instrumental ""North"" and the over-long ""Sometimes in a Fall"". But through most of the record, Phoenix marks out their territory in the sparsely-attended arena of new soft-rock and demonstrating the genre's compatibility with indie tropes. Dentists sick of REO Speedwagon ballads send their sincere thanks.

    For a quick primer on the history of concept records about sex, see more or less every record ever sold under the broad banner of rock'n'roll. Shattered 20th century taboos on human intimacy are the reason this music thrived; the genre moniker itself is a euphemism for doing it. And no one ever really needed to be told what albums called <em>Slide it In</em> or <em>Pump</em> or <em>Please Please Me</em> were on about. Enter Home's near-criminally titled 16th album, <em>Sexteen</em>, which takes on a not-very-subtly different project. Its brazen and unapologetic ads want you to know upfront: This is a concept record about fucking.</p><p>
       What's remarkable is that Home mostly pulls it off. <em>Sexteen</em>'s strong first movement pauses mid-coitus to reflect on Homes of yesteryear. ""Straddle Me"" is somehow both a Kama-Sutra-plus-piano pastoral and a throwback to the atmospheric chamber psych of the 13th Home record, 1998's <em>Netherregions</em>, a title I'll never read the same way again. At the album's thematic and literal center, ""Fucking"" is the song you buy a Home album for-- two-minutes of bliss, sexed-up and awkward as hell. Lewd synth, buoyant bass, impossibly catchy melody, all focused on a lyrical admission of why rock musicians do what they do: ""If you hadn't guessed, I will let you in/ On what drives all these knobs all that spin...All decisions are based on my singular goal of eliciting a response from you"". The titular dirty verb at the top of the chorus still staggers me just a little.</p><p>
     Then there's that handful of tracks you knew a ""concept record about fucking"" had to have, most scattered across the record's uneven mid-section. ""Bubble"", a merciful two minutes long, is a Modest Mousian funk mistake, complete with Andrew Deutsch's recorded phone call to a girl with whom he discusses his love of handjobs and how ""wound up"" he is. Urp. 
    </p>
<p>
     Equally remarkable is the band's ever-growing stylistic depth, even if this is the least prog Home to date. You'll hear a pillow of <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>-era Flaming Lips in ""Teasin' and Pleasin'"", which is fitting, given the band's association with Lips producer Dave Fridmann on <em>XIV</em> and the barely-heard and often-brilliant <em>no.15</em>. It's delivered via simple drums, cresting xylophone, and strings nearly swooning behind the melody. Massive bass and twangy distorted axes give ""Push"" a suggestive Stones/Skynryd menace. There's a hint of Sufjan Stevens to ""Driving and Paralyzing""'s pulsing, layered chimes and bells. You might even think Prince or Beck, once or twice, as ""Slide"" and ""Rushing"" document Home's surprising efforts at stilted indie funk/soul, to mixed results. After 15 albums, I honestly didn't know they had it in 'em. 
    </p>
<p>
     Lyrical treatment of ""the act"" itself ranges from the goofy Penthouse Letters schlock of, say, ""Juicy Ass"", to more heartfelt, grown-up depictions of desire. Take ""So straddle me in the back captain's chair/ And let me bury my face in your hair"" (""Straddle Me""): on paper, a juvenile rhyme about quickie lust. But coupled with ""Accompany me west by car..."" and the track's lilting, languorous waltz (a Home trademark since the late 90s), it achieves an awkward, inviting sincerity and a snapshot of copulation and travel a zillion miles from any of Frank Zappa's <em>200 Motels</em>. Similarly, the orchestral balladry of ""Come Like You're on Fire"", a song about making your special someone do just that, proclaims that ""sated and asleep is the next best thing"". And so it is. 
    </p>
<p>
       What's difficult about <em>Sexteen</em> is that even its strongest, most familiar, and Home-caliber tracks all feature dollops of that tough-to-swallow procreation subject matter. Adherence to ""concept"" and erotic mood renders the weaker material all the more tiresome and interruptive. A shorter, tighter record of A-material might've equaled more than the sum of its private parts. At 19 tracks, <em>Sexteen</em>'s themed collection presents serious challenges to ""going all the way"" with it, if you catch my drift. 
    </p>
<p>
     Add CD packaging art that brings intercourse, astronomy, and cute little forest creatures enigmatically together, and you've got one complex and unexpected 16th album. <em>Sexteen</em> is a mitigated success and not nearly Home's best effort. But it proves itself so maturely sexual and self-aware, so happily derivative and vulgar, it helped me be truly, rightly horrified, maybe for the first time, by ""Better run girl!/ You're much too young, girl!"" as it crept down from supermarket PA speakers toward innocents below.

     If originality were the only important thing in music, it would be necessary to invent a new grade to describe the Black Angels' abject failure-- maybe something in Cyrillic. But originality's not always all it's cracked up to be, as anyone who tried to get into Matisyahu can attest. Like seasoned trackers, these Texas-based psych-rockers gingerly place their steps directly in the petrified footprints left by the Velvet Underground and the slightly fresher ones of Spacemen 3, following the path without disturbing its flora and fauna. ""Young Men Dead"" threads a hollowly booming lead through a rudimentary fuzz-groove; ""Call to Arms"" blisses out languorously for upwards of ten sunburned minutes; ""Black Grease"" reduces the blues to one nasty lick pickled in malarial distortion. It's like a Civil War reenactment-- all the actual gore is long since splattered and the outcome is predetermined, but for the nostalgic, the bloodthirsty, and the monumentally stoned, a deep pleasure resides in the faithful reproduction. And who doesn't like an excuse to dress up in silly clothes en masse?</p><p>
     It's not like the Black Angels are the only band un-reconstructing druggy drone-rock decades past the sell-by date. They're not even the only ones doing it with ""Black"" in their name-- you've got Black Mountain and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Brian Jonestown Massacre, which almost looks like Black Jonestown Massacre if you squint, and are drunk. Psych-rock generally takes one of two paths to derangement: intricate sensory overload or brutally stripped and repetitive sensory deprivation. The Black Angels opt for the latter, wrangling reverb-drenched Sonic Boom guitars over plodding percussion, sloshing buckets of soupy, shrapnel-filled bass, and Farfisa injected with photosensitive radioactive dyes. The slo-mo detonation of ""The Sniper at the Gates of Heaven"" gradually dissolves into a spray of sparks, and ""The Prodigal Sun"" flickers and rattles towards a riotously overdriven fade to black.</p><p>
     Sluggishness is this sort of music's métier, but there has to be a nervous, jangled intensity beneath the sloth to make it work, and <em>Passover</em> ratchets up the sick with every clangorous chord. It's a long, darkly iridescent screw, glittering feverishly, boring deeper and deeper into the weirdly giddy wartime terror associated with the Doors and <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. Alex Maas' voice covers the sliver-sized range of emotion between apathetic anxiety and utter dread. ""You send me overseas / And put the fear in me"", he drones flatly over the flanged guitar meltdown of the hat-tippingly titled ""The First Vietnam War"". Far from trailblazing, <em>Passover</em> nevertheless implies that the Black Angels like to blaze until they see trails.

      I suspect that Bird Show-- Town &amp; Country co-conspirator Ben Vida's one-man army of lo-fi buzz-and-drone experiments-- is probably best experienced live. In that setting, other musicians often join Vida, and the songs grow and evolve in real time, lurching with an improvisational air that breathes life into the music. <em>Lightning Ghost</em>, the second Bird Show disc, lacks any sign of that natural excitement, despite the fact that it was largely written on stage over the past year. While there are moments that are quiet and pretty, with layered chant-like vocals working to induce a trance, at other times it's downright irritating, with splashes of computerized noise, static, and squealing feedback. The disc rides the line between minimalist post-rock and noise and, as a result, doesn't really succeed at either.</p><p>
<em>Lightning Ghost</em> starts strong with ""Field on Water"", which features layers of various instruments-- bells, handclaps, and guitar among them-- that writhe through a cyclical rhythm behind Vida's humming vocals. The track is subtle and understated, building ambience through delicate instrumentation. But that feeling doesn't last. Elsewhere, ""Pilz"" lacks rhythm, instead utilizing a seemingly random combination of chimes, single drum hits, and guitar squawks. Vida's voice here is tuneless, moving up and down in un-harmonized layers. ""Seeds"" is even noisier, but it at least sees a return to the hypnotic repetition of the first track. When Vida locks into a groove, it can be mesmerizing. But too often he breaks his own spell.</p><p>
      You've heard records like this before-- a lot of potential nestled in a few songs, but far too many missteps. True solo projects, those created and executed by only one person, can sometimes contain such a singular vision that it becomes hard to understand what the artist was thinking. That might be <em>Lightning Ghost</em>'s biggest problem. It's a frustrating Dr. Jekyll way too eager to turn into Mr. Hyde. And unfortunately, the good here isn't unique or interesting enough to outweigh the bad.

    At March's SXSW festival, the Charlatans UK (as they've been known in the U.S. for more than a decade) were as ubiquitous as baked beans and tongue-staining energy drinks. While fellow Manchester vet Morrissey zipped in and out of town for a single showcase set, the Charlatans popped up on bill after bill and at party after party, like they had something to prove-- because, even after 16 years and nine albums, they do. The Charlatans survived Madchester, they've survived Britpop, and they've even survived their Madchester/Britpop-survivor phase. Now, with a whole new generation of north-country boys adopting Tim Burgess' streetwise sneer, it would appear to be high time to step up and kick those Monkeys back to the polar ice cap.</p><p>
      But then the Charlatans have always been a touch too well-behaved for such antagonistic displays. As impressive as their SXSW stamina was, on <em>Simpatico</em>, the Charlies just sound like they'd prefer to sit on their asses and listen to dub records all day. Like most Charlatans albums, <em>Simpatico</em> begins big: ""Blackened Blue"" is an IMAX-sized pomp-rocker that rides the sort of urgent piano riff used to introduce Olympic athletes in opening-ceremony telecasts. Burgess promises ""there won't be a dry eye in the house,"" but the dramatic entrance is quickly undermined by the ""Apache""-grooved ""NYC (There's No Need to Stop)"", which is regrettable for a) Being yet another song by a British band romanticizing Big Apple bustle, and b) Coming off like EMF having their way with the Clash's ""Magnificent Seven"".</p><p>
      ""NYC"" at least projects a youthful exuberance that's nowhere to be heard on the rest of the overly measured <em>Simpatico</em>, which could be called the Charlatans' ""Jamaican"" album, in as much as 1999's <em>Us and Us Only</em> was their ""Dylan album"" and 2001's <em>Wonderland</em> was their ""Studio 54-era Stones album."" Like My Morning Jacket on <em>Z</em>, the best moments here-- the dirty grind of ""Dead Man's Eye"", the late-night romanticism of ""When the Lights Go Out in London""-- are more informed by reggae's clipped cadence and suggestion of open space than its regional accent. But far too many tracks here opt for atmosphere over impact: In particular, the interchangeable dubwise ballads-- ""City of the Dead"", ""Road to Paradise"", and ""The Architect""-- veer perilously into a Club Med cocktail-hour circa 1984, with non-threatening staccato-guitar jabs, piano/synth lines clinking like champagne glasses and Burgess' usually endearing observations obscured by noncommittal attempts at patois and overuse of the word ""paradise.""

    I guess we're at a point where Mission of Burma's post-reunion accomplishments shouldn't be met by shock and amazement. But, considering how fantastic <em>The Obliterati</em> sounds, I'm tempted to offer the sort of breathless hyperbole that press agents would love to quote, something along the lines of ""every band in the world would die to make this record"" or ""makes <em>onOFFon</em> sound like a barber-shop quartet afflicted with food poisoning."" If you get enough beers in me, I'll probably even claim that it's their best LP to date. Suffice it to say that this record is very, very good.</p><p>
      One thing <em>The Obliterati</em> has over its post-reunion predecessor is continuity and cohesiveness. As good as <em>onOFFon</em> is, it's still the work of three guys who hadn't played together for nearly 20 years. The tongue-in-cheek title acknowledged as much, as did the vinyl-referencing 15 seconds of silence separating the first eight tracks and the final seven on the CD version of that record. That there were more than a few dips into the past (both in Burma's catalog, and in Roger Miller's own songbook) also speaks to this hesitancy. In retrospect, the album sounds less like a coherent statement and more like a disparate (albeit excellent) collection of songs. Contrast that with <em>The Obliterati</em>, the work of a group that's totally comfortable, and confident, within its own skin. It takes chutzpah to title a song ""Donna Sumeria"" and, smack dab in the middle of the song, quote (with all due respect) Ms. Summer's ""I Feel Love"". It takes skill to make it work.</p><p>
     Burma offer a fitting epigram for their plan of attack via the title ""Careening With Conviction"", and as soon as Peter Prescott kicks off ""2wice"" with his free-wheeling drum kit abuse, the album puts the pedal to the floor. The absurd and haunting cut-and-paste imagery of ""1001 Pleasant Dreams"" (""You said my name was hyper-allergenic/ You said I was not hyper-real"") abuts the bare-bones Big Blackness of ""Good, Not Great"". Another Consonant-sounding track from Clint Conley (""Is This Where?"") is right at home preceding the gloriously crotchety Prescott rant (""Period""). Roger Miller's ""13"" has enough room for cello, patented Burma bam-thwok, and glistening harmonics. While the album's closer, ""Nancy Reagan's Head"", has enough room for references to mesomorphs and the sacroiliac, loops of faux-Gregorian chants, and the soon-to-be-classic couplet, ""And I'm haunted by the freakish size of Nancy Reagan's head/ No way that thing came with that body.""
    </p>
<p>
     As for the group's aforementioned conviction, it's to its credit it can make a statement without the need of a soapbox or a bully pulpit. Sure, the band were proud supporters of John Kerry's failed run for the White House, its been known to take the stage with a banner proudly proclaiming NO NEW MCCARTHY ERA, and the LP contains references to the Reagans, the Middle East, and planes falling out of the sky. The message here, however, isn't a proselytizing one, but an inspiring one.  One of the reasons the sound of marching feet has such an allure is because it's the sound of people doing something for a cause. Whether that cause is personal or political is immaterial-- it's the act of putting your weight behind something that's key, and that's what Mission of Burma are doing. They're making their noise their way, the same way they did some two decades ago. And it's a sound as vital and inspirational as ever.

""Insane/Cool It"" is a rough and chugging garage rocker, complete with a mesmerizingly spastic guitar solo that calls to mind Lou Reed's ""free jazz"" freak-outs. ""Fairly Blacking Out"" explores similar territory, as Pollard taunts trustafarian scenesters over clanging strums and a burbling bass line.

    When considering any one facet of Lansing-Dreiden's ongoing multimedia project, it's easy to slide toward reviewing the whole conceptual apparatus that surrounds it. The New York-based collective works in music, visual art, installation, and print, all from behind a smokescreen of anonymity. The art is often formidable, but the theoretical apparatus that surrounds it fluctuates between vague and incoherent. Their nebulous manifestoes are often devoid of actual content, and their anonymity seems to mask an essential lack of things to say. What's the difference between building a cult of personality around an abstraction and an individual? And is media manipulation a valid artistic pursuit, or is it simply art's acquiescence to commerce?</p><p>
      These questions would be worth considering if they had anything to do with <em>The Dividing Island</em>. Given the group's anonymity and the album's museum-quality-- it has the air of an artifact carefully constructed and hermetically sealed under glass-- <em>The Dividing Island</em> seems to float in a void. Thematically, it's blurry, less exploring the nature of division than warily poking at it, careful not to say too much. But the record's hermetic quality founders against one piece of Lansing-Dreiden groupthink, which is surprisingly useful in parsing this album: ""Lansing-Dreiden is a company that sees no distinction between art and commerce"" (from the group's official website).</p><p>
      Sound familiar? It's a clue, albeit an unintentional one, toward the nature of <em>The Dividing Island</em>. As Jess Harvell rightly noted in his Pitchfork article ""Now That's What I Call New Pop!"", in the early 1980s some members of the British post-punk scene combined their adventurous DIY spirit with a newfound commercial ambition. It was glamorous and progressive, synth-heavy and wildly eclectic, integrating diverse non-rock strands into sumptuously produced electro-orchestral pop. It's this cultural moment-- the moment of ABC and the Human League, of cavernously echoing drums and cerebral keys-- that Lansing-Dreiden inhabit here.
    </p>
<p>
     ""A Line You Can Cross"" dips into nighttime neon new-wave, replete with spitting drums, Caucasoid-funk breakdowns, vocodered refrains, and minutely orchestrated electro-kitsch. ""Part of the Promise"" tries on at least four different guitar effects within its first 10 seconds before collapsing into a sleek, rumbling locomotive covered in diverse graffiti-- ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" meets Depeche Mode. The smoky, liquored ""One for All"" channels mellow soul in its abstracted way, quiet thunder sounds and all. But the band is at its best on ephemeral tracks like ""Two Extremes""-- a heartbeat and a watery drone, a helix of chiming synths, with restful, floating vocals. You can see the theme of division play out over the song titles, but the only operative division this record explores, tacitly, is between the band's theory and their praxis. This disconnect is troubling, but <em>The Dividing Island</em> is sealed off enough from it-- from everything except the idiom it reconstructs-- that it doesn't effect the album's success on musical terms.

    If you have even the faintest misgivings about the noise scene or power electronics, Whitehouse may be your worst nightmare. Even the fiercest acolytes will acknowledge that the group has hardly modified its sound over the last two decades. They prolifically release reams of inaccessible music. They lace their impenetrable lyrics with sadistic descriptions of violence, pedophilia, and misogyny. Their productions fail to suggest any degree of talent or sentience. The album titles are like bad art-journal puns. And the records are, quite literally, nothing but ambulance sirens, exploding trucks, and the howls of mutilated cats. They lack the conceptual brilliance of Merzbow, the nuance of Kevin Drumm, and the mysterious modernism of Maurizio Bianchi. Whitehouse are purified clamor, undiminished by any interest in diversity or progress. It's incredible to think this form of British industrialism emerged from the remnants of bowtie-spinning academics like David Tudor and Alvin Lucier. Only years later, their experiments would be fused with Whitehouse's serial-killer paraphernalia and masochistic videos. How times change.</p><p>
      I'm under the impression that <em>Asceticists 2006</em> is Whitehouse's finest album to date, but this is not because it displays any particular strengths. It's a peculiar feature of the group's project that each new album must inherently be superior to the last. This is because a) All their albums are basically the same, and b) Uniformity is precisely the point. Each new recording is merely one more opportunity to consider what the object of their satire is, if it's even satire in the first place. At any rate, <em>Asceticists</em> will revitalize one's hope in the future of industrial noise. By the first track, Whitehouse have shown all their cards: Banshees race around in gravel, whistles and clipping mics fall off cliffs, and Philip Best presents some rather unpersuasive defenses of property damage and murder. Since ""Dans"" is basically undiluted aggression, devoid of any melodic or rhythmic notion, it can suggest anything whatsoever: race riots, bouncing artillery shells, tidal waves, sonic booms, hailing anvils, soccer matches, sweet sixteens. In a strange irony, the numbest songs can also become the most evocative. While the group's sound is dramatically uncommercial, anyone can appreciate its apocalyptic qualities.</p><p>
     As with any Whitehouse recording, I've no idea whether it's intended to be comedic or sincere, although it certainly doesn't matter. After 18 albums, those sorts of inquiries are out of the question. Elephants tap-dance, chainsaws rev, puppies cower. Brief patches of rhythmic density indicate heartbeats or rotor blades. The lyrics, delivered with grating static and cracked equipment, focus on a wide variety of relevant topics, including pornography, noxious gases, decimated orphans, violent contagions and the horrors of David Bowie. Not that any of it is really intelligible. Toward the end of the album (""Ruthless Babysitting"", ""Dumping the Fucking Rubbish"") there are some feeble attempts to employ rhythmic sequences, but this is surely more of an accident than an intentional development. No point in cataloguing the rest of the album in any detail. If you know Whitehouse, you know what to expect. If you don't, well, maybe you should just keep your distance.

    This uneven odds'n'sods EP, mostly comprised of limited-release vinyl tracks difficult for non-filesharers outside of the U.S. to obtain, was created as a souvenir commemorating Xiu Xiu's first tour of Oceania, so it can be forgiven for being of little value to North American consumers. The quality is too erratic to appeal to the casual fan, and the Xiu Xiu diehard is likely to already own the 7""s on which most of the songs appear. Only two tracks, Cherry Point remixes of ""Clowne Towne"" and ""Ale"", are domestically exclusive to this EP, and while those will be the bait for fanatical collectors, they're utterly unlistenable.</p><p>
     What really sinks this EP is how poorly it serves the Australian audience for which it's intended. Already slim at eight songs, it becomes downright anemic when you realize that four of the songs are destined for deletion at your next scheduled iTunes pruning. It opens with ""Bog People"", still an excellent art-pop howler, and still readily available on last year's easy-to-find <em>La Forêt</em>. One track is just 23 seconds of bird sounds that make no conceptual sense within the EP's scattershot gestalt; it seems like a sneaky way of boosting the track count.</p><p>
      Cherry Point's harsh-noise remixes of <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>'s ""Clowne Towne"" and <em>La Forêt</em>'s ""Ale"" find the tracks brutalized and pointlessly obscured. ""Ale"" is slightly more tolerable because the original song's structure and melody glint through the striated layers of muffling distortion. ""Clowne Towne"" affords no such relief, offering a few seconds of vocals before diffusing in a shapeless haze of percussive static. If Cherry Point exerted much time and effort on these remixes, it doesn't show-- they sound like they were made in five minutes using a few layers of a Boss Dr. Sample's effects bank. 
    </p>
<p>
     Xiu Xiu's best foot is very good indeed, but even the four remaining songs don't really put it forward. ""Red Croissant"", taken from a GSL split with Kill Me Tomorrow, is textbook Xiu Xiu-- a stuttering bleat and wheeze, atmospherically chiming percussion, Jamie Stewart's drifting vocals, some piercing synth tones, scraping sounds, barren and plinky expanses. The trimmings are fine, but the tepid vocal melody prevents it from being more than serviceable. ""Blueberry Mine Shaft"", a cover of 5RC recording artist Nedelle from Xiu Xiu's second covers EP, is a simple and lovely acoustic ballad. A pretty-good cover of Nick Cave's ""Jack the Ripper"", taken from a recent split with Paper Chase, is hellishly nervous and raw. 
    </p>
<p>
    The one real gem here is ""Juarez"", a track from a split with the Dead Science featuring Oxbow's Eugene Robinson on vocals. Its stark, ambient field is well-suited to Robinson's possessed wail, his creepy Waitsian falsetto slinking through demonic blues. Given Xiu Xiu's prolific and adventurous nature, it's easy to understand why they'd turn out a tepid track now and then. The impetus behind putting several of them on one weirdly-sequenced EP is much harder to apprehend.

     The Walkmen have a talent for playing at contrasts: Their first two albums masterfully skipped between hazy, fuzz-soaked ballads and pummeling, gravelly rockers. But while it's tempting to call these two albums ""seamless,"" that would be selling the band short-- these records' artfully stitched transitions and interruptions are part of what makes them so great. <em>Bows and Arrows</em>' best tracks, ""The Rat"" and ""Little House of Savages"", are packed with the kind of unrelenting, energetic furor that rock music built its rep on-- but both are made even better in relation to their more subdued neighbors, ""What's in It for Me"" and ""No Christmas While I'm Talking"". So if anyone calls them a two-note band, at least their two notes are always posed in an interesting counterpoint.</p><p>
      Given this reputation, it makes sense that the Walkmen would seek out a  new path-- but <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em> is too confident for its tentativeness to be moving, and too tentative for its confidence to crystallize into any kind of sustainable momentum. Lead singer Hamilton Leithauser has apparently been studying up on the Bob Dylan guide to pronunciation (<em>M Is for Mmphmblgmbn!</em>), as his usual charismatic croon often gives way here to a sometimes comically Dylanesque squeal. And the rest of the band never really commit to holding back or letting loose.</p><p>
      Sadly, there isn't much on <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em> that leaves a lasting  impression. ""This Job Is Killing Me"" is all energy and no momentum;  blurred sonics may have been well-suited for some of the Walkmen's more  low-key songs, but for most of <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em>'s, it's just frustrating. Drummer Matt Barrick does his best to salvage what he can, and for his part, he does lend some interesting percussive choices. Lauded for his inventive and driving beats (and bouncy stage presence), Barrick here frequently scales down his playing to straightforward galloping toms or washes of trebly hand percussion. But while this more skeletal approach adds some textural variety to <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em>, it also prevents many of the album's songs from congealing into memorable entities.
    </p>
<p>
     If there's a blueprint for how the Walkmen could have pulled off an album like this, album opener ""Louisiana"" is it. Leithauser pushes his voice to the very top of its range, forcing out a melody that breezes over well-placed guitar chords. A Jimmy Buffett-esque horn interlude gives the song an inflection that might best be described as ""festive""-- by no means pejorative, considering how few bands seem willing to even venture into such territory, let alone with so much success. This is perhaps also the one song on <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em> where the music effectively draws on the album's overall atmosphere, rather than working against or in spite of it.
    </p>
<p>
     The Walkmen often take flack for putting out albums with one or two great tracks and a bunch of not so great ones. And while ""Louisiana"" and the closing Mazarin cover ""Another One Goes By"" are noticeably stronger than the rest of the album, the sonic push and pull that made the first two Walkmen records so compelling is almost entirely absent from <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em>. Despite occasional flashes of inspiration, much of the record blends together into a whole that is somehow much less than the sum of its parts; the ingredients are colorful, but the end result is disappointingly dull.

      Earlier this month, Snow Patrol debuted at the top of the UK album chart with their fourth full-length, <em>Eyes Open</em>. Glasgow's finest Zippo-rockers held the top spot as if consoling a lover, fending off Pearl Jam before givin' it away to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Led by singer/guitarist Gary Lightbody, Snow Patrol first went major with 2004's <em>Final Straw</em>, which led to the huge UK top five single ""Run"" and a slot opening for Ireland's most overrated Nobel Peace Prize nominee (and friends). The quintet had come a long way from their roughshod early recordings for indie label Jeepster-- and more importantly, they were better.</p><p>
      If <em>Eyes Open</em> lacks the vivacity of its breakthrough predecessor, it remains an assured example of a band still paying more than lip service to the notion of rock music as a vital pop form. On an album of sparks and explosions, Lightbody signals his world-stopping ambitions: ""For once I want to be the car crash/ And not just another traffic jam."" Lyrically, Lightbody continues to be transfixed by the personal. His specialty is the Wile E. Coyote phase of new love-- the stomach-fluttering poignancy of stepping off that happy cliff and trying not to look down-- and he details it with the emotional acuity of his hero, Lou Barlow. This time Snow Patrol's bustling power-pop sounds almost as close to the 1990s radio fodder of the Gin Blossoms as to Sebadoh's antisocial din, but strings, finely layered guitars, and even a choir help the band achieve its chosen mood: ""We need to feel breathless with love,"" Lightbody prescribes in falsetto.</p><p>
     Opener ""You're All I Have"" sets the chugging pace with simple, subtle lyrics and oohing background vocals. There's a pleasingly self-deluded sophistry in a chorus like, ""I have no fear/ Because you are all that I have."" The more muscular second track, ""Hands Open"", begs for feedback-painted forgiveness-- ""It's hard to argue when you won't stop making sense""-- with an equally radio-friendly hook. In a subdued moment you'll either love or hate, Lightbody namedrops your 50-state overlord, Sufjan Stevens. Call me insufficiently elitist, but I find power in the idea of tens of thousands of young listeners discovering a wider musical world thanks to one tightly packed pop song. (And frankly, anyone bugged by this should have found new ways to feel superior by now.)
    </p>
<p>
      At its aching best, <em>Eyes Open</em> takes the style of <em>Final Straw</em> to its shiny, populist conclusion-- not that it will completely free the band of comparisons to similarly anthemic mediocrities like Keane. Massive ballad ""Chasing Cars"" is a bland follow-up to ""Run"", with uncharacteristic platitudes rather than the original's bare drama; ""Set the Fire to the Third Bar"" features Martha Wainwright's elfin vocals but gets overwhelmed by its own deadly seriousness. Still, the skywalking heartburst of ""Beginning to Get to Me"" and music-box melancholy of ""You Could Be Happy"" at least atone somewhat. If it's hard to imagine the name ""Suff-yawn"" being sung in arenas, try imagining a band that once called itself Polar Bear somehow playing there.

     On its first three records this French laptop gang used pop as a marker while actually indulging only rarely. Pop was something DAT Politics' 8-bit electro orbited around, poked at, made fun of, and kept under their pillows, but it was never embraced as an identity. They inched at melody like a high school kid testing a ledge, seeing how close they could get without actually going over. And whenever they almost fell-- such as ""Pie"" on 2002's <em>Plugs Plus</em>-- they cut the pleasure with just enough annoying lo-fi noise to keep people who don't wish they lived inside a Nintendo game at arm's length.</p><p>
     No longer. Here on their sixth full-length, DAT Politics have finally decided that writing and singing catchy tunes won't actually lead to a fatal case of the cooties. The palette hasn't changed appreciably; though they presumably use late-model computers, the noises aren't much different from, say, your local Fan Club Orchestra's Gameboy jamz. So the sound of the thing is still going to rub many (most?) people the wrong way. But in terms of songwriting, they play it straight, and ultimately demonstrate a knack for memorable tunes.</p><p>
     One day, some joker with an acoustic guitar will cover one of these tracks. We'll ask why he or she is singing something called ""V.I.D.E.O. Tape"" and shouting out the letters like a Bay City Roller, but we won't question the integrity of the song. In pop music, certain gestures are common and essential, like salt in cooking, and DAT Politics have learned to love the heavy hand. The ""ooo-eee-ooo-ooo"" backing vocals bumping against the chorus of ""Turn My Brain Off"" are the oldest and easiest trick in the book, and they're wonderful. Gaetan Collet offers a pitiful and charming old school rap on ""What's DAT""; the pumping three-chord progression in ""Gravity"" is a modified version of the one Depeche Mode used in ""Just Can't Get Enough""; there's even a <em>ballad</em> for god's sake, ""Fake Friend"", with a voice processed to sound on the verge of breaking even while the chipmunks cooing in the background are all smiles. 
    </p>
<p>
     All of which is all good news for the more casual DAT Politics fan, those without the patience to pick through the earlier records. On the other hand, the band will probably lose a few people with this record's likeability. This scene, involving Chicks on Speed, the Blechtum axis, and select members of Tigerbeat6, has developed a cult drawn to a boundary-testing aesthetic. Music that is ugly and out of balance can still effectively communicate; depending on what you're trying to get across, something that goes down like two aspirin without water might be just the thing. But DAT Politics have left such concerns behind, at least for the time being, to bop around and shout and let the playful sense of fun take over completely.

    I've been waiting for this record since Ken Stringfellow released his solo  debut. As co-leaders of the Posies, Stringfellow and Jon Auer have made  some of the most sublime power pop this side of 1990, so upon hearing one  half of the band's braintrust on his own, I got curious as to what the other  half sounded like. I had to wait a while-- and Stringfellow dropped two more  records in the interim-- but Auer has finally obliged. Where Stringfellow took his albums as an opportunity to  try out a little bit of country, a little bit of orch-pop, and some  generalized eclecticism, Auer stays close to home on <em>Songs From the Year of Our Demise</em>, delicately  crafting a melancholy, introspective album that feels like an extension of  the Posies while simultaneously outclassing that band's two most recent records.</p><p>
      Part of what <em>Songs</em> makes clear is Auer's role in shaping some of the  Posies' best old melodies-- his manner of constructing a tune is very  distinctive, and harmonizing with himself rather than with Stringfellow's higher  register highlights the inward-facing sadness in his writing. Here even a sweet sentiment like ""you're all I want"" comes  qualified by ""in this wicked world,"" and the darkness is  doubly jarring delivered by his soft, sweetly melodic voice.</p><p>
      The primary failings of the album are minor-- it's a little  too long and uniformly mid-tempo-- and it's difficult to argue with any of the  material on its own terms. It sounds as if Auer might have been keeping aside  some of his best stuff when making the last Big Star and Posies albums, in  fact, and the quiet, acoustic ""Wicked World"" is the most haunting ballad  he's been a part of since ""You Avoid Parties"" in 1990. The album's  beautifully bleak aesthetic is established up front as the chiming  glockenspiel/piano hook and purposeful rock beat of ""Six Feet Under"" heads  to the ""Bottom of the Bottle"", an easily melodic song that essentially  treats you to two great choruses. Auer is great at juxtaposing a rapid,  syllable-stuffed line with a long, drawn-out phrase, and it helps make his  songs memorable.
    </p>
<p>
      So it took him a long time to step out on his own, but Auer proves he  was ready to do it. A few songs show  some promising development of his personal arranging chops, such as ""Four  Letter Word,"" which shifts between contrasting start-stop and  full-speed-ahead sections and ""Adios"", which features some striking vocal  layering. Auer may have the lower profile of the two lead Posies, but he's  every bit the artisan his bandmate is-- and his solo debut is ultimately a  satisfying listen.

<p>Dinosaur Jr.-- featured in one of <i>Our Band</i>'s most entertaining chapters-- imploded when they were still on an indie. And now majorhyperglobochemcorp Rhino reissues Dino's first two albums after they signed to Sire/Warner Bros. at the turn of the 90s-- <i>Green Mind</i> and <i>Where You Been?</i>-- as well as a previously unreleased acoustic solo set from the same period by Dino frontman J Mascis. (The preceding records, <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>You're Living All Over Me</i> and <i>Bug</i>, were reissued last year by Merge.) The two reissues add a handful of bonus tracks-- singles, live takes, stuff from the vault, none particularly revelatory-- as well as typically erudite liner notes from Byron Coley.  <i>Green Mind</i> was recorded mostly by Mascis after the original Dinosaur Jr. shook itself fitfully apart following <i>Bug</i> and he had played through a series of temporary lineups. Original bassist Lou Barlow had already formed Sebadoh and would spend the next decade or so badmouthing Mascis in print. Original drummer Murph only plays on three songs. But the music is just a step on from where Dino had arrived at on <i>Bug</i>: ripcord solos, waves of feedback, jetties of New Order/Cure-style jangle, and Mascis' slack yowl delivering lyrics utterly bewildered by human contact. Opener ""The Wagon"" snarls with nearly as much pop hookcraft and gnarly guitar spizz as <i>Bug</i>'s opener ""Freak Scene"". But throughout the album, Mascis' solos become more controlled bursts of classic rock, less spirals off the dirt track into the ditch of fuzz and mud. Inspirational verse: ""There's a way I feel right now/ Wish you'd help me, don't know how/ We're all nuts, so who helps who/ Some help when no one's got a clue."" Inspirational song title: ""Puke + Cry"".</p>
<p><i>Where You Been</i> was released in 1993, the high grunge moment. It's a bit cleaner than the earlier recordings and somehow also a little less jangly and a bit more, well, grungy. Mascis' guitar is now a Ouija board channeling the King Biscuit Flower Hour heroes of his youth. Recorded with a full band-- bassist Mike Johnson and drummer Murph-- the record has a ""three dudes in a room"" beefiness that was somewhat lacking on <i>Green Mind</i>. The guitar on ""Out There"" snarls and the vocal is one of the Mascis' most plaintive. His voice actually improved with age, his youthful cracked mewl deepening into a cosmic yawn-- even if the vocal on ""Not the Same"" is so high, nasally, and lonesome that it probably still owes Neil Young royalties a decade later. Speaking of nasally: ""Start Choppin"" was the closest thing the band ever got to a hit until the modern rock staple ""Feel the Pain"" a year later, and no one can ever say Dino lacked a sense of humor when they hear that ridiculous falsetto note on the chorus. ""What Else Is New"" adds a pretty string section outro as if the band hadn't been doing pretty since the beginning. When it comes to early 90s major label guitar albums, you could do a lot worse than <i>Where You Been</i> and as someone who lost his Columbia House-purchased copy when he went to college, I was glad to revisit it.</p>
<p>Your enjoyment of <i>J Mascis Live at CBGB's</i> will be dependent on how much you enjoy his voice, his guitar playing, and his songs minus the fuzz. (And, in the case of ""What Else Is New"", the strings.) The set stretches back to ""Repulsion"" off the first Dino album and up to material from the about-to-be-released <i>Where You Been</i>, as well as Skynyrd and Wipers covers by request. For someone who claims to have never played a solo show before, Mascis' voice and guitar are in fine form throughout, and for someone with a reputation as a grump, he's got a good line in personable stage patter. Still, even without bonus tracks it's strictly for fans only. The other two reissues, however, are recommended to anyone too young to have heard them the first time around or anyone who wrote off the band's post-SST work.

    After years of practice, Shogun Kunitoki glide bliss first into the gorgeous keyboard tones and psychedelic ring modulator dervishes on their debut full-length, <em>Tasankokaiku</em>. Hailing from Helsinki, the Finnish electro-instrumentalist quartet downloaded their name in 1998 from a Commodore 64 game. Having long ago ditched 8-bit glitch soundtracks, Shogun Kunitoki here breezily mix the minimalist repetitions of Terry Riley with the analog shimmer of Broadcast or their propulsive forefathers, the United States of America.</p><p>
     Like the best of this sort of music, each track feels as if it could continue to infinity without losing steam. The aforementioned are good initial touchstones, but layers of sounds (and eras and ambient details) are tucked into each wordless piece. In a way, the density brings to mind M83 or other post-shoegaze progenitors, though instead of late-night fireworks, the overall vibe conjures someone squinting at the last few moments of a long day's sun. There's the lonesome joy of Ulrich Schnauss with more foreward tilted drumming, less crashing/rumbling/tumbling of the electro realm. Imagine Terry Riley's <em>A Rainbow in Curved Air</em> informed by Stereolab. On each track, the music maintains its forward trajectory, moving and expanding even during its most minimalist echoes.</p><p>
     Opener ""Montezuma"" exhibits the strongest dynamic sense. Compiled via variations and distortions of a single reiteration, it builds layers and pulses (with an almost Frogger underbelly), until drums kick in amid the wow and flutter and send it spiraling: Think of Steve Reich's <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em> colliding with Tortoise or Air. I've yet to catch Shogun Kunitoki live, but have heard they incorporate hand-painted, scratched, Stan Brakhage-style Super 8 loops into their show. The idea of multi-colored flickers communing with these synthesized pulsations seems straight-up euphoric.
    </p>
<p>
     Each track is comprised of similar ingredients, though paces and accents vary. Cut from the same dewy, psychedelic clothe, ""Leivonen""'s last-minute tambourine suggests the invention of some Switched On the Doors series. Changing pace, ""Tropiikin Kuuma Huuma"" adopts a lilting waltz; Krautrock shakers frolic beneath dusted pulsations. With its moments of swirling noise and oscillating fireflies ""Daniel"" evokes a tangerine daydream. The odd song out, ""Tulevaisuus Miinus Menneisyys = 1"", is a stripped-down bridge-- a fleshier Silver Apples of the Moon. It's the most discordant track, swerving into a paranoid, cracked realm. Closer ""Piste"" begins with a spare, almost bell-like pace and loose-screw jangle until it begins its elegiac comedown. It's a lovely finale that finds Shogun Kunitoki taking flight before disappearing into the fog with one final distinct/period-like tone.

<p>
     Because the album's on the typically great Fonal label (see, Es, Kiila, Paavoharju, Kemialliset Ystävät, and Islaja), the sleek packaging perfectly captures the mood-- a line of trees, a sinking sun, a single bird against the powder pink expanse, the symmetrical lines of an icy or fallow field. Likewise, the generous warmth of Shogun Kunitoki's sound mingles with the slight chill inherent in most instrumentals, creating the feel of gorgeous sunset. One of those where the sky's tinted purple and orange like melting candy.

German producer and theoretician Ekkehard Ehlers referenced and sampled Robert Johnson for a single that wound up on his 2002 album <i>Plays</i>, weaving snippets of Johnson's voice and guitar into a minimal house. Loops and beats are one thing, but to engage with blues over an entire album, and to play it straight, seems a bit trickier. How might a guy like Ehlers, who dwells in the abstracted netherworld of Frankfurt School philosophy, fit into a style where authenticity is everything?</p>
<p>Pretty easily, it turns out. <i>A Life Without Fear</i> collects music originally written for a dance by choreographer Christoph Winkler, but no knowledge of that collaboration is needed to absorb this work. Working closely and writing with Cologne-based guitarist Joseph Suchy-- a shapeshifting player who can modify his style to fit numerous contexts-- Ehlers delivers a fractured but surprisingly thorough look at what blues means, where it has come from, and how it left its fingerprints. The overriding mood is heavy with doom-- returning often to death and apocalypse-- but even within this framework there's room for a huge range of expression.</p>
<p>The versatility of vocalist and harmonica player Howard Katz Fireheart is key. Katz is a U.S.-born and Berlin-based performance artist who leads a band called PostHolocaustPop; his singing here lends a sense of gravity and human frailty. He sounds brittle and haunted on the opening traditional ""Ain't No Grave"" and mean and strong-- and a lot like Captain Beefheart-- on the closing ""O Death"", made famous by Ralph Stanley. Suchy accompanies Katz's moaning with processed guitar that sound like it's bubbling up from a fissure in the earth; the way Suchy plays, there's no question where the singer is going when his last breath leaves him.</p>
<p>Typical for an Ehlers project, questions of authorship are completely up in the air and the record is difficult to fix in time. The guy who looped a few seconds of a Beatles recording for 10 minutes and called it his own work has no problem borrowing when it suits his purpose. On one track, a 78 of ""Strange Things"" from depression-era preacher Charles Haffer, Jr. is played with Suchy adding subtle guitar distortion and Ehlers adding bits of processed noise. The record is made more ""modern,"" sort of, but simultaneously sounds even older than it actually is. The fidelity of the added instruments provides a ""live"" illusion, and it comes across like something recorded in a drafty old house in the early days of electricity.</p>
<p>My guess is that the Haffer track was chosen for its prescience, as the haunting lyrics have an almost creepy timelessness. The lines reach back to the Biblical John the Revelator, directly address the Great War, and then, by extension, move forward to our present-day insanity in a way Haffer never could have anticipated: ""Now Wilson said to the Kaiser/ Please let our vessels be/ Kaiser said to Wilson/ 'Keep your vessels off of the sea/ If you put 'em on the stream/ They'll meet my submarines'/ Strange things happening in the land"". Iran, anyone?</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum are the drifting, shapeless mood pieces that find Suchy spinning out crooked lines alongside trumpeter Franz Hautzinger, with electronics added by Ehlers (the trio recorded an album together for Staubgold in 2004). In a sense, these instrumental pieces serve to transport the record from one era or latitude to the next. While blues sits at the center of <i>A Life Without Fear</i>, the genre is sometimes hit sideways, by probing its roots and digressions.</p>
<p>During a mid-album stretch, the record covers 10,000 miles and several hundred years. ""Die Sorge Geht Über Den Fluss"" is jazz-- short, subtle, and lovely-- as Hautzinger's impressionistic melody seem to reflect the clear mid-range fluidity of Chet Baker. But nothing is fixed. In the track's closing seconds, another world pops out, as Suchy plucks his guitar in a manner referencing the West African kora. The exploration continues on ""Nie Wieder Schnell Sagen"", a drone played by Fireheart on harmonica, and ""Misorodzi"", a piece by West African professor Dumisani Maraire featuring Suchy on balafon and vocalist Fireheart singing lyrics in the regional Shona language.</p>
<p>So it's Blues (Not Blues), maybe. It looks chaotic on paper, but Ehlers has bound the disparate tracks tightly into a singular concept. In the end it's more about the possibilities inherent in a particular constellation of music's universe more than any one style. Ehlers turns the blues in its broadest sense inside-out, pulls it apart, and lays the shreds on the dissecting table while keeping the tissues very much alive. I can't imagine a better artist for the job. Ehlers is a true original who has never made the same record twice, and this is one of his very best.</p></div>"|8967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8967-a-life-without-fear/|8.3|Mark Richardson

      In the film <em>Killa Season</em>, Cam'ron plays a thinly veiled avatar named Flea. In fact, the veil is so thin that, toward the end of the movie, characters casually refer to him as Cam, to which he responds without hesitation. Clearly, Flea is Cam's idealized version of himself-- the ultimate hustler, with the gusto to spit on a small child's forehead and shoot a man in the chest while riding a bike. Yet-- in the film and on this accompanying soundtrack-- the rapper's unswerving hardscrabble guise is becoming wearisome. With his first three albums largely devoted to charmingly skewed soft-batch rap &amp; b, the Harlem magnate hardened up by way of relentless mixtape releases, resulting in the soul-infused 2004 masterpiece, <em>Purple Haze</em>. With that album, Cam cannily balanced twisted takes on rote gun'n'drug-running hip-hop tropes with sweet soul samples that gave his countless bon mots levity and bounce. On <em>Killa Season</em>, such levity is sorely missed.</p><p>
      Since <em>Purple Haze</em>, the whole Dipset machine seems to have fallen into a holding pattern. Aside from Juelz Santana, who actually showed some promising progression on two solo mixtapes and an impressive sophomore album last year, Cam and his cronies continue to release a relentless stream of street CDs with diminishing returns. Seemingly, the entire crew is trying to top <em>Haze</em>'s signature banger's banger, ""Get 'Em Girls"", which combines operatic vocals with arch strings and back-broke bass to emit a crippling, avant-garde thump. Thing is, ""Get 'Em Girls"" can't be topped. Or duplicated. Yet, a large portion of <em>Killa Season</em> is committed to that aim with bumptious tracks like ""Girls, Cash, Cars"", ""War"", and the shamelessly-dubbed ""Get 'Em Daddy"" all puffing lots of hot-air bluster rather than sounding audacious.</p><p>
      The rapper's diminutive Flea moniker also hints at a paranoid inferiority complex that seeps into the record. Instead of showcasing his trademark never-rushed swagger, <em>Killa Season</em> sometimes finds Cam aggravated, yelling flustered barbs over chintzy Casio trumpets and too-busy hi-hats. Exhibit A is ""You Gotta Love It"", his infamous Jay-Z dis. Out of its original context, the song can now be judged as something other than a crass stunt, and Cam nails some stinging blows while battling the harsh beat (which earns a couple of pity points for sampling, of all things, the score from <em>Basic Instinct</em>). Still, no matter how amped Cam gets over one of Mr. Carter's fashion faux pas, it's always going to look pathetic when an opponent wins a fight by not responding.
    </p>
<p>
      When the stiff beats ease up and Cam (slightly) deflates his chest, <em>Killa Season</em> excels. The album's finest moment-- and one of the most intriguing tracks in Cam's catalogue thus far-- is ""I.B.S."", an autobiographical tale chronicling the emcee's bout with the pesky, self-explanatory disease called Irritable Bowl Syndrome. Over an uncharacteristically subdued, twinkling beat from Dipset faves Heatmakerz, Cam starts off with the bold pronouncement, ""This is a true story."" Whether or not that makes the album's other tales less than genuine is unclear-- truth is a highly relative term in Purple City. But he follows up the sincere claim with brilliantly candid couplets, making light of his painful condition. ""I can't enjoy a movie dinner,"" he admits, ""My son growin' up, I'm lookin' like the movie <em>Thinner</em>."" Whatever ""truth"" Cam's speaking of here, it's probably something he should rely on more often.
    </p>
<p>
      But no matter how oddly hilarious and touching ""I.B.S."" can be, it's likely to go down as a barefaced anomaly. A more realistic exit strategy for the current banging-head Dipset conundrum is represented by ""Do Ya Thing (Remix)"", on which Cam shows off a hushed delivery, gliding with easy reticence over a jazzy, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire-sampling Chad Hamilton beat that recalls vintage Pete Rock. Although the rhymes are basically been-there Camlibs, in such smooth surroundings even the mind-numbing hook-- ""More killin' killin'/ More killin' killin' for Killa Killa""-- sounds fresh.
    </p>
<p>
      On the limited edition version of <em>Killa Season</em>, there's a bonus DVD that includes portions of a press conference Cam held shortly after his Jay-Z dis first aired. The spectacle is ridiculously self-serious, showing that the rapper may be drinking too much of his own Sizzurp liqueur. When asked dead-on if the harsh dig at the best semi-retired rapper alive was a blatant publicity stunt, Cam responds, ""I don't need a publicity stunt-- I'm me."" If this underwhelming offering is any indication, such blind self-reference has considerably slowed down Cam'ron's once-unstoppable Dipset Movement.

      San Diego seems an unlikely place to produce a band such as Black  Heart Procession, whose name could hardly be a more accurate  harbinger of their music. After five albums (and one Solbakken collaboration, for the <em>In the Fishtank</em> series), Pall Jenkins and Tobias Nathaniel still generate an overcast, unique brand of misery. 2002's <em>Amore del Tropico</em> freed  them from the monochromaticism of their opening trio of numbered albums. <em>The Spell</em> follows in  similarly eclectic fashion, but is different in one important regard: This  is the first Black Heart Procession album made by a fully integrated band,  with the founding duo fleshed out by drummer Joe Plummer (Modest Mouse),  bassist Jimmy LaValle and violinist Matt Resovich (both of the Album Leaf).</p><p>
     The spirit of collaboration-- potentially picked up from the Solbakken record-- is evident in the album's opening minutes. Plummer is a huge asset, providing the propulsive mechanism that takes most of these songs out of dirgeville and turns them into arresting pieces of cosmically depressing rock. Weird, though, how in music ""depressing"" can often be read as ""uplifting,"" and certain of these tracks have that dualism operating within them, especially the drifting closer ""To Bring You Back"", which sets Jenkins's pallid croon awash in reverb and slide guitar.</p><p>
      The songs lend the album title several layers of meaning-- the trance-like  compositions and static chord progressions take it literally, while Jenkins  has penned a set of enjoyably enigmatic lyrics implying that the spell could  be that of love or the grip of the government or media. The title  track builds to an incredible climax, the  vocal melody growing quicker and quicker until Jenkins's harrowing  declaration ""your spell on me/ It has no cure.""
    </p>
<p>
     ""Not Just Words"" follows at (for these guys) a brisk tempo, slightly resembling recent Modest Mouse. Nathaniel's piano and Plummer's drums are both mixed high, while Resovich has a chance to take the lead in the song's chugging mid-section. Loud guitars carry ""The Fix"" and ""GPS"", the band's hardest-rocking songs to date. Jenkins' paranoia reaches new heights on ""GPS"" as he trots out Orwell with lines like ""All our crimes revealed"" and ""would you believe all these things hang by a thread?"" Amongst the kinetic explosions, though, there's still room for a little old-fashioned Black Heart Procession doom'n'gloom, courtesy of the anguished ""The Letter"" and ""The Waiter #5"", a nearly percussionless float down the River Styx straight into an underworld that it turns out has been frozen for eons.
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Spell</em> is Black Heart Procession's best album, cohesive though it  lacks the conceptual arc of its predecessor, and dynamically arranged, with  the sense of interplay that flows naturally from a working band. It's no  emotional picnic, but it contains moments of immense beauty and grand  intensity, delivered from a wider palette than the group's ever used before.

Over the course of four subsequent full-length albums, Paik have generated a surprisingly graceful and nuanced river of sludge, patiently carving its own steep-sided black canyon through the group's desolate Rust Belt precincts. And the curious, seductive pull of Paik's artificial gravity has never been more acute than it is on their fifth album <i>Monster of the Absolute</i>. Forcefully compacting their murky instrumental riffs into a thickened, implosive mass, the three members of Paik are nevertheless able to supply the centrifugal force necessary to keep their thunderous creations aloft and spinning in continuous diabolical orbit.</p>
<p>Compared to the decayed sprawl of 2004's <i>Satin Black</i>, the seven-track <i>Monster of the Absolute</i> is a model of precision. Though undeniably heavy, Paik draws only tangentially from traditional metal. Their gradual, surging currents can dovetail nicely with some of the more shoegazerly moments of Boris or Jesu, but more often the trio advances with a uniquely limber, propulsive symmetry. Here it falls on the rhythm section of drummer Ryan Pritts and bassist Ali Clegg to do the brunt of the load-bearing structural work, freeing guitarist Rob Smith to add insoluble layers of droning feedback and fine-toothed psychedelic detail.</p>
<p>It's Clegg who also provides the album with much of its essential melodic and dramatic momentum, as on the turbulent ""Phantoms"", a track whose churning, bottom-heavy distortion recalls the post-grunge pummel of such long-gone AmRep trios as Hammerhead or Vertigo. Likewise, the introspective ""Contessa"" rides Clegg's stalwart bass through a boundless sea of massed overtones, with Smith's fractal guitar drones expanding ever-outward into the unlit marsh. More conventional are ""October"" or the spiraling ""Snakeface"", which trace the elegant trajectories of Mogwai or Explosions in the Sky. Guided by Pritt's restless, inventive drumming, the music never succumbs to reductive post-rock crescendoes, but rather voicing each of their hypnotic repetitions around a central organic, breath-like pulse.</p>
<p>The longest piece on <i>Monster of the Absolute</i> is its nine-minute title track, a prolonged narcotic drip of cascading guitar, strummed bass, and fluttering percussion that sounds as though it would need to be broadcast through skyscraper-sized amplifiers to achieve its full levitational effect. Bracketing the album are a pair of brief, percussion-less drones (""Intro"" and ""Outro"") that seem intended to speed the listener's transition into Paik's immersive soundscapes. While all of its pieces share a certain thudding abstraction, <i>Monster of the Absolute</i> features a marked lack of genuine tooth-gritting dissonance. There seems instead to be unexpected, enveloping warmth that emanates from the album's shadows, inviting the listener to spend a perhaps unhealthy length of time beneath Paik's dark, choppy waters.</p></div>"|9014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9014-monster-of-the-absolute/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

     Amorphous left-wing pedagogy is the grist for the Rogers Sisters' rigid yet raucous post-punk mill. The efficacy of political speech in fashionable music, which flattens meaning into packets of style, is in itself debatable. But let's take it as given that dissent is more worthwhile than compliance despite its uncertain effect. Dissent doesn't make progress in individual expression, but in total volume, creating a sense of much-needed solidarity among its exponents. But it also must be altruistic if it's to even achieve this aim; otherwise, it's too easy to write off as self-aggrandizing.</p><p>
     Unfortunately, the Rogers Sisters' rhetoric, with its heavy reliance on the ""you"" pronoun, scans as less than noble. ""Why won't you say what's wrong?/ Why won't anyone believe your story?"" ""You are living in the littlest world."" ""Look around, you've got no one to blame."" Not only is the tactic off-putting, it's a bit incoherent, politically-- are the Sisters preaching to the right-wing enemy, who surely isn't listening to their music, or are they pandering to an already crippling sense of self-righteousness on the left? Or are they accusing liberals of dishonoring the liberal tradition while exempting themselves from complicity? A few ""we's"" would've done wonders to assuage the pedantic tone; instead, the ongoing impression is that the Sisters perceive themselves as above the fray, calling down grand proclamations from some superior vantage, and squandering any chance for solidarity-building.</p><p>
     I address these topics at length because they're so emphatically addressed in the music, but by no means does the questionable political content ruin this competent, lively record, which-- from a musical perspective-- is the Sisters' best yet. Recalling X's boisterous male/female mantras and careering boogie by way of Sonic Youth's frosty downtown cool, <em>The Invisible Deck</em> is a confident and polished record built of cavernous drums, simply slithering riffs, filthy bass grooves, and high-energy dynamics. Its structure is inflexible and transparent, with crisply delineated parts surging together in a wicked propulsion. The guitars are remindful of a more workmanlike version of the first Yeah Yeah Yeahs record, stripped of the inimitably zany flourishes to the bone-deep essence. The vocals fall in overlapping, fist-pumping patterns over seesawing leads and locked rhythms.
    </p>
<p>
     ""Your Littlest World"" moves as if underwater, with a creeping, reverb-bathed dub simmer that eventually boils over into crashing fuzz chords. The stylized garage-psych of ""The Clock"" splatters freaky guitars over a frantically thrumming beat. The dented skronk of ""You Undecided"" catches and flows woozily out of whispery sections ballasted by toothy harmonics. And the epic ""Sooner or Later"", with a sinuous haze of guitar emerging from and subsiding beneath the slow-burning murk, begs for an extended freak-out in the live setting, which is where the Rogers Sisters shine. Despite its didactic tone, <em>The Invisible Deck</em> comes closer to capturing this real-time energy than anything else the Sisters have put to tape.

Monthly Releasing Corporation</em>, in which subscribers receive regular installments of music he's produced from his home base of Anacortes, Washington. It's an unpredictable affair. One month might find a new pop album mixed in with the bills; the next could bring an experimental edition of field recordings. The sheer diversity of the <em>Kelp! Monthly</em> series speaks to Blau's enthusiasm for music of all kinds, a sense of excitement-- for melody, for experimentation, and for the possibility of what music can be-- that's front and center on <em>Beneath Waves</em>, his K Records debut.</p><p> While Blau's vocal presence convincingly knits the 10 songs together, taken individually they hardly seem drawn from the same well. ""Crashing Waves"" is a folky sing-along that channels Will Oldham's sweetly melancholic voice. ""Into the Nada"" is a hazy take on dub, as throbbing bass and delay-drenched guitars compete with horns and Blau's lilting vocals. And on ""Slow Down Joe"" and ""Dragon Song"", Blau strums skuzzy guitar, proving he's not above some solid rock action. It's an inclusive aesthetic, one in which Blau gorges himself on a buffet of disparate genres and styles.</p><p>  Consistent production values also help hold <em>Beneath Waves</em> together. The recordings are often inexact, even sloppy-- a horn sounds out of tune or a drum lags on a beat-- but the lack of polish is charming. The imperfections charge the set with a contagious sense of fun, as if an excited Blau would rather move on to the next song than labor over a perfect take. Even though the recordings are lo-fi, the arrangements throughout are lush. </p><p> ""Crashing Waves"", which opens the album, is the best example of the record's approach. Throughout its seven-and-a-half minutes, Blau piles on textures that range from the subtle addition of sleigh bells to huge, chiming chords. In its middle section, the song plunges into silence, steered by a simple guitar arpeggio and Blau's siren-like cooing. Gradually, tinkling treated piano and woozy horns lead the rest of the band back into the song before surfacing for the climactic finale. ""Crashing Waves"" is a straightforward tune at its core, but Blau's thoughtful production disguises its simplicity. </p><p> Each song here is buoyed by Blau's distinct songwriting sensibility, as he impressively navigates folk, dub, grungy rockers, and more. While the songs on <em>Beneath Waves</em> are all over the map, Blau never struggles under the weight of the various influences that decorate his material. </p></div>"|8968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8968-beneath-waves/|7.6|John Motley

      The cover of <em>Detroit: The Dream Is Dead</em>, Touch and Go's complete collection of Blight's music, features a black-and-white photo of a broken-down and boarded-up building. It's a fitting image, as Blight attempted to embody the pervasive sense of desolation in their community in Lansing, Mich., in the early 1980s. Created amid rampant unemployment and a stagnant economy, the band's wall of noise wasn't so much a reaction to the surrounding world as it was a representation <em>of</em> it. Fittingly, Blight only lasted four months, recording a few tracks, playing a small handful of chaotic shows, and then burning out before they could even burn bright.</p><p>
     There are actually only nine different songs here. The so-called ""Touch and Go Sessions"" are the studio recordings; two of these songs are also included in four-track demo form, and then there's a poorly recorded nine-song live set. The music is metallic and industrial in the most literal sense, like the sound of a sheet metal plant set to a sloppy drumbeat. The clanging bass that starts the disc is usually the only instrument holding down anything close to a melody, while the guitar is more akin to a table saw squealing and wailing in the background. Front man Tesco Vee, who would later go on to front the Meatmen, shows none of his trademark toilet humor here, instead violently railing against society, the government, even himself. Songs like ""Prophet of Doom"", ""Armageddon"", and ""Be Stupid"" give you the general sense of what the band has to say. The music isn't depressing; it's depressed.</p><p>
     Here we have the genesis of what could have gone on to be a unique and powerful band. The combination of mid-tempo hardcore and mechanical noise at times recalls Flipper, Wire, Nomeansno, and even some of the Dead Kennedys' more abstract material. But where all of those bands' voices were developed and focused over time, Blight never got that far. <em>Detroit: The Dream Is Dead</em> is like the record diehard fans seek out because it contains the first nuggets of a distinctive sound. Only in this case, the sound was never actually heard. Blight never developed and never fully realized their vision. And while some would argue that their primitive, chaotic din specifically <em>was</em> the vision-- that any attempts of taking it further would've only watered down the toxic ooze-- it's hard not to wonder what they could have created in another year or two. As a bit of pop sociology exploring the mindset of working-class punks in the Midwest of the early 80s, <em>Detroit: The Dream Is Dead</em> is certainly interesting. But as an essential collection of a could-have-been-legendary band, it feels a little hollow.

Meissner's focus with Klimek is processed guitar that retains the timbre of the instrument; he bends, stretches, flanges, and repeats strummed chords that conjure melancholy, wind-blown emptiness. When first heard, these tracks come over like the soundtrack to <em>Paris, Texas</em> had Ry Cooder grown up playing computer. Positioned among drifting, vaporous clouds of synth found on <em>Pop Ambient</em> records, the Klimek tracks are welcome doses of earthiness. His disappointing 2005 full-length debut <em>Milk &amp; Honey</em>, however, demonstrated that the Klimek project didn't have enough ideas to sustain an album.</p><p>  Just more than a year later-- and with nothing new added to the formula-- Kompakt has released another Klimek full-length. Much of <em>Music to Fall Asleep</em> is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Milk &amp; Honey</em>, and even that record varied little from track to track. The biggest problem is that the Klimek sound is so specific-- plucked or strummed guitar that echoes rapidly into the distance, so that the overtones accrete-- that there is almost nowhere for it to go. Each piece possesses a certain beauty, and Klimek is an original approach to guitar processed with electronics; but after the first few twitches in each track, you've essentially heard the whole thing.</p><p>  The few moments that transcend the formula come when Meissner lets the tones linger so long they bind together into some striking drone. You can just barely make out the steel guitar string clusters that form the basis of ""Kingdoms Here We Come"", but heard en masse, the piece is foreboding in the extreme, with a carefully placed pulse of bass to drive it forward. ""Catalyst"" sounds inspired by early tape music, with strings warped to sound like the chirping mechanical birds of early electronics.</p><p>  Meissner is a talented guy whose work hasn't always received the notice he deserves. As Random_Inc and working with Ekkehard Ehlers as Autopoieses, his music his thoughtful, challenging, and unpredictable. Klimek, on the other hand, is nice enough as far as it goes, but the parameters are far too narrow. A few moments aside, <em>Music to Fall Asleep</em> is limited to quintessential Klimek tracks. If this sound scratches a very precise itch for you, one that never really goes away, who knows, maybe you'll love it. For the rest of us, there's always the next <em>Pop Ambient</em>. </p><p> </p></div>"|4610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4610-music-to-fall-asleep/|4.4|Mark Richardson

    Philadelphia trio Espers' first two releases-- 2004's <em>Espers</em> and 2005's <em>The Weed Tree</em>-- were inadvertently incorporated into the big freak-folk/New Weird America snowball that also tumbled over and swallowed up Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Animal Collective, Faun Fables, and a mess of other psych- and folk-infused players. For the most part, freak-folk tends to eschew any clear genre parameters, but its participants-- willing or not-- are still blissfully united in an eyes-closed, drifting-to-the-strums adoration of ancient British folk tradition, while routinely pilfering from late-1960s/early-1970s folk-rock heroes Fairport Convention, Vashti Bunyan, Shirley Collins, the Strawbs, Pentangle, Comus, the Incredible String Band, and more. The hippie-gone-Renaissance Faire overtones might be distracting to those less-inclined to gnawing turkey legs while draped in beads, but Espers' intricate, vaguely menacing folk songs are smarter, sharper, and more relentlessly compelling than their trappings might suggest.</p><p>
      Espers is now a sextet, and <em>II</em> is far darker, deeper, and more ominous than its predecessors, a rich, droning mix of guitars, vocals slathered on vocals, cello, assorted bells, flute, recorder, mini-Korg, Tibetan singing bowls, dulcimer, a bit of bass, organ, the occasional drum, and a cornucopia of effects. The pretty haze that clouded earlier efforts is mostly lifted-- <em>II</em> is muscular throughout. Opener ""Dead Queen"" slowly builds, oozing sideways from an acoustic guitar riff that sounds half-lifted from ""Stairway to Heaven"", while Meg Baird and Brook Sietinsons coo in harmony, voices precise, inviting dancing bits of drone and effects-laden squeals into the song. ""Mansfield and Cyclops"" (Espers' song titles do little to alleviate their barefoot-in-the-woods reputation) is driving despite its relative quietude. ""Moon Occults the Sun"", which closes the record, sees Greg Weeks howling like Thom Yorke, his pipes beautifully unhinged and in tight contrast to taut drums and guitar.</p><p>
<em>II</em> is a perfectly balanced record, and its arrangements are so exact and delicate that it almost feels like one buzz of a doorbell or ring of a telephone could send the whole thing toppling over, splattering into useless bits. Somehow, Espers manage to expertly capture the menace so inherent to Celtic folksinging, harnessing the same rhythms and pieces of syntax that infiltrated the Appalachians in the early 18th century, and translate that threat into a distinctly American noise. And, like any good folk outfit, old or new, Espers are preoccupied with story: Here, the songs are long and the lyrics are difficult to discern, but there's a hazy narrative in place that makes <em>II</em> extraordinarily difficult to listen to in pieces. There's an end to this tale, and you'll find yourself craving the closure.

<em>Powder Burns</em> doesn't reinvent the Twilight Singers' sound, but it's clear that Greg Dulli is searching for new and darker back alleys to walk down. The album resurrects the guitar drama of 2003's <em>Blackberry Belle</em>, and Dulli, as self-assured as ever, continues to draw on specific elements of 1990s alt-rock-- the extreme dynamic between verse and chorus, the belief that a soaring chorus is half the message. On these new songs you can hear Dulli pushing himself doggedly-- to make the music sound larger and more dramatic on ""Underneath the Waves"" and the title track, to hit harder and heavier on ""I'm Ready"" and ""Forty Dollars"", to convey more and mean more on ""Bonnie Brae"" and ""Candy Cane Crawl"", and in general to raise the stakes both musically and thematically to a vertiginous level.</p><p>
      Consider ""Forty Dollars"", which could have been at home on his frivolous 2005 solo album <em>Amber Headlights</em>. At one time Dulli might have let a line like, ""Love don't mean a thing, but two a.m. and a telephone ring"" be his final thought, the whole point of the song. But here he caps that thought with a Beatles reference that twists a hippy-dippy lyric into something seedier and certainly nothing Paul McCartney ever intended. ""Forty Dollars"" perverts ""She Loves You"", ""All You Need Is Love"", and even Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale"" into a sinister menagerie, but Dulli manages to make what amounts to a gigolo come-on sound consequential and human.</p><p>
     Granted, Dulli has reasons to push himself on this record; he tries to rise to an enormous occasion. Recording of this album was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina, which spared his studio but slammed his adopted hometown. Equipment had to be run off generators, and four songs were written and recorded during the curfew period immediately after the storm. This fact has been reported many times in the past months and will likely be touted even more in the near future, but that catastrophe has obviously touched and emboldened Dulli, who invites fellow New Orleans transplants Ani DiFranco and Joseph Arthur to join him on some recordings.
    </p>
<p>
     More importantly, Katrina and her aftermath have affected his music by altering listeners' perceptions-- it is, after all, an attractive and persuasive story. It's tempting to hear <em>Powder Burns</em> as a paean to the Big Easy, and the ""you"" Dulli sings in every song could be New Orleans itself, a woman soiled by a terrible storm and an even more dehumanizing aftermath (he's said as much of ""I Wish I Was"" in interviews). Of course, only some songs were written in the storm's aftermath, and it's not difficult to figure out which those are. ""Under the Waves"" and ""I Wish I Was"" sound bigger and ballsier than anything Dulli's recorded in a while, his voice raised dramatically-- literally screaming above the din.
    </p>
<p>
     I don't want to overstate the Katrina effect, if only because very few rock albums could ever live up to such an event of such magnitude. A few of these songs, after all, are several years old and could just as easily have been influenced by the death of Dulli's friend Ted Demme (whose passing inspired <em>Blackberry Belle</em>). Plus, this is no inspirational ode to a city under siege-- or ""In the Sun"" for that matter. ""Forty Dollars"" and ""My Time (Has Come)"" fit squarely into Dulli's psychosexual canon, and no track here demands any knowledge of its context to convey its point. Just the same, it's difficult to deny the record's heady senses of danger and immense consequence-- two elements that have been at the core of everything Dulli's done but here sound newly human, gleaned from experience instead of from a record collection or old movies. ""I'm ready to love somebody,"" he sings on ""I'm Ready"", and damned if he doesn't sound like he might really mean it this time.

     It must be halftime of a second-term administration because the celebs are putting on quite a show. From the sands of Africa to the halls of Capitol Hill, the creative-types of Hollywood and New York City are scaling the walls of authority, shouting, ""Impeach the Press Secretary!"" Courage, thy name is Brangelina (Clooney's salt-and-peppered baby blues excused). Meanwhile, the Coup release another fine album to feathery sales numbers, the scales of justice clunk heavily on the side of Ambassador Bono's <em>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</em>, and the American public rejoices knowing they've done something by watching a movie co-starring a temporarily fat sexy dude or buying a crappy record by a guy who wears platform chancletas. Still, though the Prada-prop of the A-list might be a more accurate representation of American politics, the Coup's Boots Riley is the everyday activist, whose music is just another seemingly futile outreach program.</p><p>
     It is important to note the Coup's origins in the San Francisco Bay Area, an urban mecca for progressive wonks and breezy funk. Fighting the power is as ingrained in the lifestyle as trolley cars and ""(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay"". So, when Boots speaks, the choir is listening, and it lends his voice the confident coolness that only comes when one feels strength in numbers. The People United versus Me Against the World, etc. The best evidence of this sangfroid is the thundering-piano anthem ""My Favorite Mutiny"", in which Boots' pragmatic call-to-arms defrosts the cold platitudes of guests Black Thought and Talib Kweli, who are often forced into action against the evil axis crack-rappers and their innumerable minions on the East Coast. For Riley, whose bio includes equal stints in activism and hip-hop, talking policy is as commonplace as talking trash, so when he says, ""If I'm not involved/ I feel I'm not breathing/ If I can't change the world/ I'm not leaving,"" it's usually followed by something like, ""Baby, that's the same reason you should call me this evening."" Most of <em>Pick a Bigger Weapon</em> follows this same trajectory, yet doesn't wear thin because of Riley's abundant wit and wisdom. It's pointless to parse lyrics here because the quotables come in long stretches. Even with the ever-dreaded rap skit, the Coup keep it fresh by cracking wise and having a relevant narrative (check-plus for the acting performances in the sycophant's dilemma, ""Yes 'Em To Death"").</p><p>
      Sonically, <em>Weapon</em> couches the rhetoric in the group's signature Parliament/Prince digi-funk-- with Boots on beats and Pam the Funkstress on scratches-- but this time around the productions are more full-figured and fleshed out, whether they're stomping on a flag or sauntering past security. Slow burners ""Mindfuck (A New Equation)"" and ""ShoYoAss"" (don't let the titles fool you) accomplish the candy-coated cosmic slop Andre attempted on <em>The Love Below</em>, minus the overt outré stuff, while ""Ass-Breath Killers"" and ""Captian Sterling's Little Problem"" thump and clap as hard as any hyphy. Some who fondly remember <em>Kill My Landlord</em> or <em>Steal This Album</em> might initially wince at the less-abrasive sonics, but just as Riley's rhymebook includes more of himself than ever, so have his rhythms become more intimate and seductive. The art of persuasion, people.
    </p>
<p>
     If this is all beginning to sound as if the Coup have suddenly softened their stance, maybe that's the plan. Having toiled in the trenches for a decade plus, with <em>Pick a Bigger Weapon</em>, Riley and Pam appear to have chosen more love than war to further the movement, even if that love manifests itself in oral copulation between George Bush and Saddam Hussein.

     Since the late 1990s, British multi-instrumentalist James Green and guitarist Dave Jaycock have created difficult-to-classify avant/classical/folk with a rotating line-up of musicians under the group name Big Eyes. Following the release of Big Eyes' 2004 album <em>We Have No Need For Voices When Our Hearts Can Sing</em>, however, the duo branched out from a standard group format to instead collaborate with a series of guests that includes Rachel Grimes (Rachel's), Jeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk and a Hacksaw), and Scottish folkie James Yorkston. Dubbing their new project the Big Eyes Family Players, Green and Jaycock spent more than three years recording the material for their new 29-track, 78-minute behemoth <em>Do the Musiking</em>.</p><p>
     Owing in large part to its protracted creation and mixed parentage, this massive, sprawling collection less resembles a cohesive work than a well-traveled cargo trunk packed with a wild assortment of avant-folk and post-rock curios. As a listening experience, the nearest equivalent might be one of the many available compilations of Ennio Morricone's more obscure soundtrack work, one that combines various pieces from every possible film genre. On this set the Family Players veer abruptly from fine-honed chamber miniatures (""For Cognac"") to Appalachian-derived folk (""Bear and Butterfly"") to outspread, shimmering drones (""A Dream of Fires"") without betraying any interest in connective segues or dramatic foreshadowing. As such it is possible to enter the album at virtually any point, or to shuffle these tracks into any sequence, with little gain or loss in terms of progressive momentum. And though nearly each of these brief pieces works well on its own terms, one can easily absorb the breadth of <em>Do the Musiking</em> and still feel no closer to fully learning the true musical personality of its creators.</p><p>
     The Family Players, whoever they may be at any given moment, are at their transporting best on downcast, Old World serenades like ""Golden"" or the sublime ""Ballad of the Blue Lantern"", which follows a signal beacon of a keening violin and guitar across the rain-weary, cobblestone streets. ""Owlet Moth"" keeps a hand-clapped gypsy rhythm, while ""Shanty for Darty"" rolls upon the waves as a simple duet of fiddle and harmonium. On ""Die Nacht"" a small, piano-led ensemble plays a Debussy-like nocturne that is every bit as forceful and convincing as the electric, cascading rock of ""Absolute Endings"", while ""Tresaith"" impeccably blends field recordings of seabirds into a string quartet's stargazing drone. 
    </p>
<p>
      Although most of the tracks on <em>Do the Musiking</em> are instrumental, Green and company do add quiet, unobtrusive vocals to the front-porch hoot of ""Going Home"" and the loner-daze of ""Aquatopiate"". Less successful is the theatrical, banjo-laden clunker ""The Printmaker's Dilemmas"", which is one of the few occasions when the album's deliberate eclecticism turns self-conscious and irritating. One added benefit of the Family Players' ever-shifting strategy and personnel is that none of <em>Do the Musiking</em>'s weaker ideas is able to linger for long, allowing each new track to present another open range of almost limitless possibility. Needless to say, it would be impossible to predict what form the Big Eyes Family Players might take when they next return, but I'm guessing there's enough far-flung information stashed on these 29 pieces to satiate your curiosity until then.

      Emerging from the same Los Angeles scene that spawned such next-level  soulsters as SA-RA Creative Partners and J*Davey, 22-year-old Georgia Anne  Muldrow was born into a family of  creative musicians: Her mother was a singer for the Pharaoh Sanders  Ensemble, and her father was a pioneer of ""that crazy guitar thing"" heard on  jazzman Eddie Harris' ""I Need Money"". On <em>The Worthnothings</em>, her  debut EP, Georgia Anne Muldrow sets out to solidify her musical stock, displaying her  formidable voice over the course of seven tracks, all of which she  wrote and produced.</p><p>
      On the delightful ""Larva"", one of the record's highlights, Muldrow shows  her insightful side atop a toasty, kick-snare combo, singing, ""Oh, joy--  life, won't you learn me/ Destroy what is left of me."" The song, whose  caterpillar allusions speak to spiritual growth, prominently features  her jazz-inflected vocals, which, over the track's neoclassical thump,  sound divine. There's also no shortage of introspection on the  minimalist ""Demise"", which finds the budding chanteuse ""trying to  maintain"" in a world full of pressures and overdue rents.</p><p>
      Though songs like ""Lo Mein"" and ""Nothingness"" flaunt a sunnier, less  conflicted feel, much of the disc is bogged down by thankless  self-analysis. ""Cool World"", an exotic, drum-heavy affair, is undermined by Muldrow's musings (on how her courage betrays  her), which, by then, begin to grate, like your friend who only calls  you when she feels like complaining. The EP's relative brevity only  underscores this problem.
    </p>
<p>
      Thankfully, Muldrow's gorgeous voice is charming enough to  compensate for such shortcomings. And when suited with her more melodic  productions, it assumes a sort of lilting grace on par  with that of songstress Jill Scott's. Though not without its  missteps, <em>The Worthnothings</em> is a quite capable debut from a  multi-talented singer-songwriter who should only improve over time. Mr. and  Mrs. Muldrow should be proud.

But it's also less exuberant, less fun, less love-me-or-else desperate than the band's self-titled debut. Instead, it's all lonely ringing guitar chords, light-jog tempos, pensive vocals alternately breathed and belted-- in short, it's not the promo I thought I was copping, not the shit-kicking sequel, <em>Back to the Futureheads Part II</em>.</p><p>
      The Sunderland-based band's self-titled debut met, and embraced, a paradox: The album possessed equal quantities subtlety and exuberance. Those qualities tend to be mutually restraining but the Futureheads indulged both and the result was 2004's most nuanced and giddiest rock record. Kicking off with the triumphant ""Yes/No"", <em>News &amp; Tributes</em> again rides in booming and victorious, with a thrilling call-and-response vocal hook and a brawny drum beat that's more ""Abel"" than ""A to B"".</p><p>
      But it's a bit of a red herring: Ben Hillier (Depeche Mode, Doves, Blur) produced the album, and he jettisons the band's blood-pumping compactness in favor of a larger, less focused sound. The attitude and songwriting follow suit, stretching out in the bigger, lonelier sonic space. ""Thursday"" couches its deep blue vocal (cf. Bobby Vinton) in flickering eighth-note pulses; it's probably the most static (and soggiest) thing they've written. ""Fallout"" politely declines syncopation, opting instead for chord punches and a wordless chorus over a dogged two-beat. Just the guitar <em>sound</em>, muffled and overdriven and perhaps a bit sun-damaged, is so utterly alien to this band.
    </p><p>
       Unlike its predecessor, which was the work of dizzy young band so anxious to assert a unique own voice it kept on pounding home the same ideas, <em>News &amp; Tributes</em> scoops from every flavor in the freezer. Its newfangled variety runs most errant on ""Return of the Berserker"", which thrashes for thrash's sake, and should only be performed live and in front of drunk people. Other experiments fare better: ""Back to the Sea"" lays into a low-slung groove centered on one of those deep-ass reverby snares Fugazi loved, while ""Burnt"" trots out a wily acoustic guitar.
    </p>
<p>
       Not everything has gone inverted-- and <em>News &amp; Tributes</em> is still catchy as sin. Stripped down, slower, and less note-happy, the album uses repetition to inculcate. ""Skip to the End"" does most with the least, building tension with sporadic chords and a taut, jangly guitar lick, releasing it with a four-part harmony. Dudes haven't exactly forgotten how to sing overnight. ""Worry About It Later"" reups ""Hounds of Love""'s barreling drums, chest-puffed vocals, and optimistic hugeness. Obviously, it's the best song here.
    </p>
<p>
       Some will tell you the kernel idea, the knee-jerk impulse, the gut rumble that's our cue to get moving, is always the brightest moment. So if <em>News &amp; Tributes</em> comes up short of the band's last record it's ultimately because it lacks the urgency of a one-shot glory bid. But it's impossible to play every song like it's your last when you plan to stick around a while, when you've earned something to lose.

A  fruit falls from a tree and goes boom. The hare mistakes fruit boom for  end of world boom, and starts screaming and hopping. Other animals see  and hear the hare, and quickly follow suit. The wise and knowledgeable  Bodhisattva (in the form of a lion) stops the stampede, and shows them  how the hare mistook the sound of the falling fruit for the sound of the  end of the world. One way to interpret this parable is that the animals  learned the danger of putting faith in unsubstantiated information, a  message that might have some relevance in these times.</p><p>  Aside from a few politically minded tracks, this compilation is more  about KRS proprietor Slim Moon giving various singer-songwriterly types  some exposure. ""Singer-songwriter,"" of course, being a lazy stand-in  for what happens when someone picks up an acoustic guitar and pens songs about life. In light of the parable, the sound the hare  hears might be tracks by high-profile contributors Sufjan Stevens and the  Decemberists' Colin Meloy, with the hubbub being the mad dash by various  fans to pick up this comp based solely on the inclusion of these two  artists. Consider this review a lion trying to, at the very least, slow  down the lemming-like rush to snap this disc up-- the Law of Diminishing  Returns applies to this compilation as much as it does to most, and the  two crown jewels attracting all the attention aren't all that valuable.</p><p>  Stevens' ""Adlai Stevenson"" is a perfectly decent (if slight) song,  showing he can use Wikipedia as well as the next kid. It will  undoubtedly sound just fine on his upcoming demo collection, but barely  makes an impression here. Would that the same could be said for Meloy's  awful ""Lazy Little Ada"". The most notable thing about it is the use of  drum machine. Decembrists haters will revel in how this track bolsters  their stance. Hopefully, anyone delving into this thing based on the  drawing power of those two heavyweights will stick around for some of  the comp's true highlights-- the quivering poetry of Laura Veirs' ""Cast  a Hook in Me"", Imaad Wasif's mournful ""Other Voices"", and Danielle  Howle's vengeful ""Kill My Love For You"", to name a few.</p><p>  Of course, for every crest, there's a trough-- Meloy's listless little  ditty, for one. Simone White's ""The American War"" and Nedelle's ""Poor  Little City Boy"" take the annoying tendencies of Nellie McKay-- the  precociousness, the self-satisfied whimsy-- and broadcast them in High  Definition. Wooden Wand meanders around Skip Spence territory without  finding any distinguishing landmarks, while the Slumber Party's Aliccia  BB does her own piss-poor version of lite FM California dreaming-- folks  looking for better approximations of this tact should skip to the Great  Lake Swimmers track. The Moore Brothers' twin vocal attack comes off as  a limp copy of the Proclaimers' brotherly love, and if you don't  remember the ""I would walk 500 miles"" song, consider yourself lucky.  And I'll leave it up to you whether the Everyothers' Owen McCarthy and  his unerring impersonation of Bono are worth your time.</p><p>  To its credit, <em>Hare</em> covers a wide range of sounds within this  admittedly limited purview-- the upbeat and the downtrodden, the  Dylanesque and the Motown-flavored. Unfortunately, this disc is still  mining a very small area, and comes off more as Slim Moon and His  Amazing Friends and His Friend's Amazing Friends than any sort of cogent  statement about singers and songwriters.</p><p> </p></div>"|1920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1920-the-sound-the-hare-heard/|6.0|David Raposa

Why isn't Neil Michael Hagerty skeert? No, this review will not mention his four other past and present bands, because to do so would only encourage him, and at the risk of sounding ungroovy, what he needs right now is a corpulent high school guidance counselor whose breast pockets are stocked with pamphlets about ""motivational horizons."" Which is not to slander Hagerty's energy as an author, video artist, and musician-- even the least guitar-smitten Pitchfork typist could assemble an anthology of selections from his works that would earn a 9.5 or higher. Problem is, that'd be like spending a day looking for a Fiero bumper in the acreage of an infuriatingly uncomputerized junkyard while the proprietor muttered in his sleep over abrasive loudspeakers.</p><p> <em>1-2-3</em> at least has an excuse for its incoherence; it's a sometimes edited, blended, remixed, retitled, and re-ordered repackaging of three (ahem) vinyl-only Hex products from 2003 and 2004, and yes, it plays like three EPs on shuffle. Roughly one-third offers great Midwestern psych voiced by NMH, with his John Fogerty-trying-to exorcise-Roky Erickson yawp that seems both studied and natural. These songs contain chuggy solos and lyrics that are either fascinatingly free-associative and wordplayful or that construct and then abandon narratives or scenes, similar to the prose on Hagerty's if-McSweeneys-was-run-by-Graham Greene blog. <em>1-2-3</em>'s second mode features his sidekick, whom I'll call Strepp Throat because of the pleasantly almost-impassioned femaleness and the conspiratorial anonymity. The backing tracks on these tunes sound invariably like sloppy demos of a bored experimentalist angry that his interior genius slums afternoons in Versechorusverseburg. The album's third flavor consists of its noise collages-- note that I did not say noise sculptures. Some of these are a real trip! You will never want to hear some of them again!</p><p>   Yeah, so, this thing kind of just has to be sweated out. By the bongteenth track, its fealty-to-nothing aesthetic inspires both devotion and rage. Hagerty's a ye-olde-traditionalist cooking up an American style goulash that happens to reek of <em>Bookforum</em> and conservatory chops, which can be awesome, but if you can't just relax about it, you'll collapse from thesis-fatigue trying to discern grand purpose in his high-minded low-balling. A fine, finished-sounding piece such as ""Imaginary Saints"" becomes a sort of tragic tease, like a beautiful foot hanging out of a basin of Country Crock.</p><p> </p></div>"|4002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4002-1-2-3/|6.1|William Bowers

Even at their most spiteful (which was pretty much all the time), the recently disbanded Welsh power-punk trio were campaigning for a better life, ideally one rid of people who buy James Blunt records. It's a struggle ex-Mcluskyite John Chapple admirably continues with his own trio Shooting at Unarmed Men, a band that actually predates Mclusky, but whose own scabrous sludge-punk will inevitably be measured against the latter's redoubtable brand of same. A formidable task, to be sure, but hey, some people prefer Wings to the Beatles.</p><p>  In Mclusky, Chapple was the gangly, ginger-haired foil to skinheaded frontman Andy Falkous and his serial-killer stare, so it follows that SAUM is a more spastic, untamed proposition, full of nervous energy but without Mclusky's steely precision or punishing heaviosity. <em>Yes! Tinnitus!</em> could pass as an early 1990s Touch &amp; Go curio, albeit one whose murky, mid-fi production didn't age well. While ""Pathos at Bathos"" stalks its dimly lit turf with a stuttering Jesus Lizardian bass prowl and staccato guitar stabs-- and ""Never Follow Me Again"" even lifts the murderous start/stop riff from the Lizard's ""Seasick""-- the wet-sandbag effect of Steve Morgan's drum sound diffuses the songs' seething intensity; instead of getting our skulls crushed, they're just lightly bruised. Likewise, the feral, punching-bag onslaughts of ""A Horse By Day Is a Horse By Night"" and ""I Am United Nations"" would probably decapitate you in a live setting, but merely make you flinch in their recorded incarnation. What's missing here isn't so much Falkous, but rather Steve Albini behind the boards.</p><p>   If <em>Yes! Tinnitus!</em> is sorely lacking muscle in the moments where it should be flexing it, Chapple has at least retained Mclusky's knack for undercutting the hoarse-throat hysterics with perversely melodic turns (not to mention ridiculous song titles)-- to wit, two-chord Pavement-pounding closer ""In-Flight Instructions Are a Joke, Say I"", which cheers on its female protagonist into an alcohol-induced stupor with handclaps and a rousing southern rock chorus. And like Falkous, the man can reduce the most confident, self-assured man to a whimpering ninny with a single devastating one-liner (""I hope you like listening to music made for girls""). So even if Chapple and crew sound like they'd have trouble winning an arm wrestling match, when it comes to a war of words, we're so dead.</p><p> </p></div>"|7838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7838-yes-tinnitus/|6.1|Stuart Berman

Marked by stark sensations seemingly told in refracted flashback, the claustrophobic, eerie tales offer slight slivers of menace. Listening is akin to being shackled and bound, watching someone (or something) doing something nasty to someone else. Each affair is vague and stealth and frightening. Tied together by the Georgian's voice-- a too-calm whisper that sounds like Chan Marshall after 36 sleepless hours-- and ominous background interference from producer/uncle Vic Chesnutt, <em>The Mezzanine</em> has all the proper elements of a Southern séance. Given all that, the album should be quite captivating. Instead, much of it ends up being mystery for mystery's sake-- a cabin-fever thriller with little more than a litter of loose ends.</p><p>  Considered the 28-year-old's first ""adult"" album (last year's <em>Husk</em> featured songs Durrett wrote in her teens), <em>The Mezzanine</em> still suffers from the same lack of musical variation that plagued her debut. Though she has honed her particularly unsettling songwriting style, the unrelenting slowcore pacing does her few favors. Chesnutt attempts to add flair to with flickering backgrounds made up of omnichords, xylophones, and distorted guitar, but such embellishments are often too low in the mix to sustain any type of impact. Durrett's voice and purposeful acoustic strums are projected strongly throughout, but her phrasings, progressions, and unidentified pronouns often run together, creating a sense of wandering tedium.</p><p>  Unsurprisingly, one of the only tracks with an identifiable pulse, ""Cup on the Counter"", is also one of the most engaging. Random observations (a cup stain, tiremarks, ""ashes on cinders"") arrive at a typically ominous hook: ""Why try to lie to me/ I'm not a child, I know what I see."" Of course, there's no real inkling of what ""what"" actually is, but the tone of a childhood gone awry (the track is book-ended by a contextually creepy conversation between a young Durrett and her grandfather) is rendered with enough unadulterated mood to satisfy. Yet by the second half of the album, the singer-songwriter's techniques become thin and songs begin to crawl along, drearily drunk on their own enigmatic presence.</p><p> <em>The Mezzanine</em> doesn't fail as much as it disappoints. Durrett's voice is both preternaturally warm and haunting-- a rare combo. And it's sad to hear it languish. On the record's last track, ""In the Throes"", Durrett finally breaks free from her endless, quiet croon and works her vocal chords a bit. In an otherworldy way, the soulful waltz even slightly recalls the Aretha fave ""Runnin' Out of Fools"". Such minor emotional openings are enticing but they're exasperatingly underrepresented on this album of fractional storytelling and aimless dread.</p><p> </p></div>"|2598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2598-the-mezzanine/|5.6|Ryan Dombal

Sure, all that red and white looks striking, and the raw, co-ed blues setup has been fruitful enough to spawn a gaggle of imitators. But the real advantage of self-imposed limits is that the most minute change to White's formula appears gigantic-- consider the buzz that surrounded the introduction of black into his wardrobe circa <em>Elephant</em>'s release.</p><p>
    
    With the White Stripes seemingly on hiatus, Jack White has the time and freedom to alter more than his visual aesthetic. Just in time, too, as both <em>Elephant</em> and <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em> revealed that Jack and Meg had backed their sound up against a wall. Our first exposure to Jack White's 2006 sound was the exploration of <em>Abbey Road</em>-like psychedelic orchestration in a song commissioned by Coca-Cola, his corporate brethren in barber-pole color schemes. Now comes a Midwest supergroup that includes fellow Michigander Brendan Benson and the rhythm section from I-75 commuters the Greenhornes.</p><p>
    
    Injecting new blood into his vampire persona would be beneficial to White's career, as would collaborating with another songwriter in Benson, working with an honest-to-god bassist and trained drummer, and generally being kept from succumbing to his own retro-obsession self-indulgences. On the other hand, the Raconteur recruits aren't exactly modern-minded themselves, with Benson being a devout merchant of power-pop and the Greenhornes traveling the same <i>Nuggets</i>-plundering path as the Stripes themselves. As a result, <em>Broken Boy Soldiers</em> isn't much of a departure, nudging White only a couple clicks over in his classic-rock worship.</p><p>
    
    Yet, as already established, forced perspective makes even these small steps appear as significant strides for Mr. White. It's there in lead single ""Steady as She Goes"", even though it's subtle; the improvements mostly come with hearing one of his compositions freed from the laboriously low-tech ""realism"" of the White Stripes' recent material. It's there even more in the album's title song, where tribal drums and an ominous bowed drone buttress White's valiant attempt at a passable Geddy Lee. Even the rote blues emulation of ""Blues Vein"" comes off more ""I
    Want You (She's So Heavy)"" than <em>From the Cradle</em>, saved from reenactment status by some backward-loop weirdness and film-noir production.</p><p>
    
    Credit White with allowing the Raconteurs to be a two-party system; though I've spent the review focusing on the head Stripe, Benson is an equal partner in this operation, and it's his power-pop rubric that largely dictates the sound of the album. Benson-sung songs like ""Hands"" and ""Intimate Secretary"" crackle with a Cheap Trick kind of charm, given extra heft by White's predilection for harder guitar sounds. ""Store Bought Bones"" might be the best merger of the assembled talents, featuring a distorted organ and manic slide-guitar that would be tired amidst a White Stripes record, but retains its zang here alongside a nimble rhythm section and Benson's understated vocals.</p><p>
    
    But tie on the celebrity blindfold, and <em>Broken Boy Soldiers</em> no longer seems like that much of an achievement-- just another case of men recreating their favorite vinyl deep cuts, if a bit more skillfully than most FM scrapbookers. The album may prove the Raconteurs to be more than just a vanity project, but still falls short of making enough of an impact to totally overshadow the components' origins. It may be refreshing like an ice-cold soda to see White toe-dipping into new territory, but making the switch from black and white (and red) to living color is thrilling only in the relative sense.</p></div>"|6957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6957-broken-boy-soldiers/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

You can probably imagine how hard it is for a critic to either rave or rant about something like this. <i>The Witching Hour</i>, Ladytron's last full-length, was their best yet: a great leap forward from stylish synthpop into something grander and more dramatic, something that commanded attention rather than just charming its way into it. But <i>Extended Play</i> is just odds and sods and loose ends-- more false starts and works in progress than prize rarities. For fans only? Obviously, and only the most dedicated fans at that. The real selling point for the package, in fact, is the bonus DVD, complete with videos and documentary footage.</p><p>
    
    The music itself is inessential at best; at worst, it achieves this weird state of Too Much Information that somehow diminishes the actual album. One of the biggest developments on <i>The Witching Hour</i>, after all, was the way this synth act suddenly emerged with a beefy undertow, bringing out the drums and guitars and settling into grooves that were deep, dark, occasionally dirty, occasionally Germanic. Some of the B-sides here-- ""Citadel"", ""Nothing to Hide""-- make that less impressive, feeling like practice jams, trial runs dedicated to exploring that sound. It was a lot more fun imagining they'd just suddenly woken up one day feeling steely-eyed.</p><p>
    
    Worse is the alternate take on ""Destroy Everything You Touch"", a terrific single that's basically Ladytron's own ""Enjoy the Silence"". The take here is listed as the ""Catholic version,"" but for ""Catholic"" please read ""demo""-- this is just a dirty roughed-out take, a single drumbeat and the chord sequence pushed out on one synth with the vocals in place on top. Not in the delightfully minimal ""stripped-down"" sense, either-- just the sort of rough sketch best saved for anniversary editions or box sets.</p><p>
    
    The remixes are equally lacking: Describing them would only ruin the few minutes of interest you could ever glean from hearing ordinary, serviceable Ladytron reconfigurations. Desperate iPod DJ dudes might get a little mileage out of one-time Smashing Pumpkin James Iha's take on ""Weekend"", which brings some pleasant guitar shimmer (and, seemingly, a Love Is All quote), but Brit producer Jagz Kooner can't bring anything to ""Sugar"", which is too romantically vulnerable for his kind of treatment.</p><p>
    
    It's funny: You might think Ladytron remixes would be a good idea. I'm not so sure, though. Early on, this band was billed as having something to do with electro; these days, they get billed as having something to do with dance-pop. And while both might be true, they've always been more about a certain emotional thrust-- the kind of person-to-person bedroom drama that once drew teenagers to the Cure or Morrissey. <i>The Witching Hour</i> got them there-- in the grandest, most professional style-- but their tracks are still as household-insular as they are dancefloor-functional; even the production has an icy, airy quality that holds everything else at arm's length. Just like old Depeche Mode, it's clubby music for distinctly un-clubby drama-club bedrooms-- who wants to hear someone else meddle with it?</p></div>"|4636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4636-extended-play/|4.0|Nitsuh Abebe

Welcome to
    part two of the post-Libertines docudrama, with Barât's <em>Waterloo
    to Anywhere</em> coming out firing after a relatively non-confrontational
    Babyshambles debut by Doherty. The star-crossed duo's received their
    share of binaries-- Lennon/McCartney, Jekyll/Hyde, Libertine/actual
    libertine-- and the level-headed Barât lives up to most of them both
    musically and behaviorally on his new band's debut. Except, boy, is he
    pissed. While Barât retains the characteristically jolly bounce in his
    step, acrid one-liners and vengeful, ambitious anthems pepper this otherwise velvety,
    matter-of-course effort.</p><p>
    Drama aside, music chemists will love the almost formulaic extraction of
    Barât's half of the Libertines sound into its own element. Doherty always
    possessed the knack for the home-run track (see ""Time for Heroes"", ""Up the
    Bracket"") while Barât laid down consistently wonderful album tracks (""Vertigo"",
    ""Death on the Stairs""). It's no surprise then that nothing from Dirty
    Pretty Things holds up compared to Babyshambles' massive ""Fuck
    Forever"", yet the consistent <em>Waterloo</em> is devoid of <em>Down in Albion</em>'s glaring
    blemishes. Opener ""Deadwood"" initiates a foppish bounce that spills over
    into most of the album. The ghost of the Clash still permeates Barât's
    multi-faceted post-Britpop songwriting, though a cleaner atmosphere (Jet and
    Oasis producer Dave Sardy applies some commercial L.A. magic) and
    theatrical yen steers many songs into Pulp or even Smiths territory.</p><p>
    Speaking of theatre, did I mention Barât's a tad tetchy these days? Seems
    every track the dude's dropping low-brow Shakespeare. For example, take a
    guess at who first single ""Bang Bang You're Dead""'s directed. ""Blood
    Thirsty Bastards"" hunts the ""sycophants,"" ""vampires,"" and ""zombies"" who've
    fed off Barât's hard work, and in soliloquy ""Gin and Milk"" he opines how
    ""no one's too perturbed/ About the things that I would cry for.""
    Thankfully the guy's got enough awesome new chums to self-deprecate on
    bubbly tongue-in-cheek stomper ""The Enemy"": ""The enemy, as I know it/ Is
    right inside my head.""</p><p>
    Blame it on Franz Ferdinand's show-stopping panache or the
    Futureheads/Maxïmo Park bloc of breakneck post-punks, but oftentimes Barât
    seemingly plays catch-up with a rapidly evolving Brit-rock scene that left
    him for dead with the rest of the Libertines in 2004. At times too
    sprawling/self-important (e.g. ""Last of the Small Town Playboys"") or
    self-consciously dirty (short-armed Buzzcocks clone ""You Fucking Love
    It""), there's a sad sense Barât's window of opportunity has been at least
    partially obstructed, if not totally closed. For what it's worth,
    <em>Waterloo</em> goes round-for-round with Doherty's solo vehicle, but too
    much of its pop luster succumbs to could've/should've-been pathos, both
    lyrically and musically.</p></div>"|2643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2643-waterloo-to-anywhere/|7.0|Adam Moerder

In 2006, they're finally seeing their 2004 record hit North American shores. While the 30-minute <em>Seclusion</em> is their shortest full-length, it's no less eclectic or bombastic.</p><p>
    
    The inspirations Aereogramme draw on this time have shifted a bit. When they go pop, they sound less like an above-average indie group and more like the loudest and most exacting guitar band to never get their chance at the platinum ring. ""Inkwell"", the leadoff track, barrels along atop over-amped strumming and new-wavey synth squiggles, while the cheeky Flaming Lips cover ""Lightning Strikes the Postman"" is the devil-horned head-banger, complete with wanky guitar solo. Aereogramme also knows how to pitch some beautiful string-laden woo, as on the self-explanatory ""I Don't Need Your Love"".</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, when the group gets serious, they recall any number of reclusive and thoughtful metal groups. Catch a Tool fan off-guard with ""Bridges"" and they might think Maynard James Keenan is involved with yet another side project. ""The Unraveling"" plays out like a 10-minute cinematic tribute to Aereogramme's future <em>In The Fishtank</em> collaborators Isis, right down to the clicking of the projector reels and the tortured screams. The filmic approach is carried over into the album's closing track, an instrumental appropriately titled ""Alternate Score"". Regardless of which pose the band strikes, their Albini-esqe Wall of Sound production technique bombards the listener with Everest-sized drums and glorious sheets of feedback that only the most jaded listeners will be able to resist. </p><p>
    
    Overall, this is a strong set of songs, but it still feels off. Having one-third of the running time taken up by the underwhelming ""Unraveling"" doesn't help, and packing this much fantastically overblown genre splicing into such a small package sells the group's strengths short. In other words, less is less, not more. Intentionally or otherwise, <em>Seclusion</em> comes off more as a teaser for an upcoming full-length than a complete album. And if that <em>was</em> in fact the purpose of this disc, then mission accomplished, you blue-balling bastards. </p></div>"|64.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/64-seclusion/|6.8|David Raposa

The computer freezes time and allows for reflection and microscopic levels of manipulation; you need good ears to decide what sound goes where and why.</p><p>
    
    Brandon Anderegg and Koen Kolkamp, Brooklynites who run the Apestaartje label and work together as Mountains, fit the bill. Here on their second record they've assembled eight discrete tracks that are immersive atmospheres in miniature; each erects a palpable space for three or four or 12 minutes before moving on. ""Computer"" is listed as one of the instruments, but I imagine the digital realm enters at a late stage in the process; mostly, <em>Sewn</em> is an organic potpourri of old-school sound-- guitar, accordion, field recordings, primitive oscillators, and so on. And the sound is balanced nicely, every instrument patiently stepping forward in its proper proportion.</p><p>
    
    Listening is important, no question. But in spending a significant amount of time with <em>Sewn</em>, I can't shake the feeling that these guys perhaps spent too much time listening to and absorbing other peoples' records. The music here is solid and the tracks develop nicely, but <em>Sewn</em> isn't distinctive, and most of it pivots on stakes other artists have set down. Opener ""Sewn One"", with its uncertain drone that could be an organ but may be processed feedback, brings to mind Stars of the Lid circa <em>The Tired Sounds of...</em>. The repetitive acoustic guitar plucking over a quiet bed of electronics on the following ""Sewn Two"" and ""Bay"" points toward Greg Davis' first album <em>Arbor</em>. The gurgles, glitches, jittery processed guitar, and harmonica of ""Simmer"" sound like Klimek mixed with a bit of Mick Turner. And so on. </p><p>
    
    A couple of things stand out. There's a bit more in the way of field recordings here-- the splashes of water on ""Below"" boldly traversing the forbidden zone long ago mapped as new age. And the record exhibits an effective sense of restraint, never beating you over the head with a new development. But when the white noise rolls in like fog to overwhelm the drones on ""Hundred Acre"", the shift in dynamic sounds like an incorporation of an established technique. And it's not as overwhelming as it should be. </p><p>
    
    None of which is to take away from the essential high quality of <em>Sewn</em>. This is a nice record that I could easily recommend to fans of this style, and to be ""original"" at this point is not only overrated but may also be impossible. But atmospheric electronic music still needs to have personality-- something that distinguishes this particular sonic world from the many hundreds of others out there-- and <em>Sewn</em> merely conforms to established templates. </p></div>"|5691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5691-sewn/|6.5|Mark Richardson

    the so-called ""motherland."" When grandpa was spinning <em>records</em>, though, he opted for melancholic horns and voices or
    polka. He may have dug <em>Gulag Orkestar</em>, the debut album by
    Zach Condon aka Beirut.</p><p>
    
    Beirut's received quite a bit of pre-release buzz. He deserves
    some of it. His tuneful Balkan stomp is fairly unique within the indie realm, an aesthetic shared with Man Man, Gogol Bordello, and Barbez but few others.
    That, and for a 19-year-old from Albuquerque (now living in Brooklyn), he sounds like an old man sipping vodka and humming along to Tchaikovsky
    while the neighborhood kids play stick ball or drink egg creams. The
    <em>sound</em> is there, but beneath the atmospherics his themes of war,
    fallen curtains, bunkers, life on the Rhine-- his song titles are more
    fixated on Germany (and Slovakia and an imaginary Eastern Bloc) than Russia--
    and Gulags, are vague and sometimes less than effective. That makes sense: He
    doesn't have the lived experience for those situations. Perhaps he studied W.G. Sebald to
    add some color, and in a very Sebaldian move the album's anonymous
    cover photos were found in a library in Leipzig, Germany. In the liner
    notes, Condon asks if anyone knows the photographer's whereabouts.</p><p>
    
    Beirut's brassy <em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em>-like instrumental accents have garnered Neutral Milk Hotel comparisons. There's also guilt by association-- ex-NMH player Jeremy Barnes
    and his A Hawk and a Hacksaw compatriot Heather Toast contribute accordion, violins, and percussion.  But while Condon writes generally spare, pretty tableau that can lodge themselves in your ear like hazy memories, his words aren't as intellectually, emotionally, or erotically invested as Mangum's feverish, tear-jerky lyrics. And that's OK-- it's unfair to hold a debut record up to one of the bona fide indie classics of the past 10 years. I mention it only to squash the impulse at the root, because exaggerated expectations shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying Beirut's best work, chiefly the gorgeous triumph ""Postcards From Italy"", an infectious, Rufus Wainwright-tinged love/death story accented by loping majorette drumming, a menagerie of horns, and a plucky ukulele lilt that mixes perfectly with Condon's airy croon.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Bratislava"" is a celebratory march for the Slovakian capital-- a sweaty, saw-dusted cabaret jam with Gogol Bordello. It's at moments like these, his vocals placed further back
    in the mix, that you realize the kid sounds truly authentic and captivating. In the bubblier chill of ""Scenic World"", Condon arms the troops with dinky Six Cents &amp; Natalie Casio drum machines and brings them into Magnetic Fields and Jens Lekman territory. It's two minutes of pretty pop, plain and simple. At the end, amid horn flourishes, accordion, and doubled
    vocals he sings, ""I try to imagine a careless life/ A scenic world
    where the sunsets are all breathtaking""-- he holds the last word, letting it swoon and flutter, like Morrissey with a hammer-and-sickle Band-Aid on his nipple.</p><p>
    
    Time and again, the most powerful element of <em>Gulag Orkestar</em>, and what ought to be emphasized, is Condon's acrobatic, powerful, emotionally nuanced voice. It could carry any style of music. Fixate for a second on the stuff he's doing on ""Rhineland (Heartland)"". The lyrics are dopey, but his trills and whirls are mind-blowing. Pairing these melodies with Eastern European accouterments in lieu of standard guitar-pop creates an obvious appeal. Still, the question ought to be asked: Are the songs really so incredible or do they simply mimic and mine musical traditions unfamiliar to the average indie rock fan? That said, the best songs here are a joy and the average and ho-hum tunes even have a thick and aesthetically appealing atmosphere-- in other words, it's an impressive and precocious debut.</p></div>"|1204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1204-gulag-orkestar/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

It's probably stretching it to call them the turn-of-the-millennium Faust when they were more like the British equivalent of an Elephant 6 band (less Brian Wilson, more Jamaica). But they certainly share that German band's lazy countryside psychedelia, love of jump cuts, and general stoner hobbit humor. Who could hate such good natured, effusive goofballs? </i></p><p> 
    
    But good-natured or not, the Beta Band never managed to cross over. And in 2005, they broke up, disillusioned and in hock to the record industry, after delivering their weakest (and most conventional) album. Shortly thereafter, singer Steve Mason revived his King Biscuit Time side project. The first KBT releases, collected on 2000's eight-track <i>No Style EP, mixed creaky jungle, spastic hip-hop, soundtrack effluvia, psychedelia, and soft pop. The new </i><i>Black Gold opens with ""C I AM 15"", a grainy dancehall tune. But the song, with its burst of deejaying at the climax that takes a sideswipe at George W. Bush and Tony Blair, is a red herring; on most of </i><i>Black Gold, Mason downplays the beat science. </i></p><p> 
    
    Throughout <i>Black Gold, Mason sings from under the covers or into his cellphone or half-asleep in an airport at 5 a.m. It's a melancholy record, with the same happy-to-be-sad feeling of Betas songs like ""Simple"". On ""Left Eye"", Mason implores, ""love me, love me, love me"" as descending piano notes disappear into a golden mist of organ. Rather than the communal sing-alongs of the Betas, </i><i>Black Gold is for headphones, for humming alone on a late night walk. It's hard to imagine a rousing group chant of ""loneliness, sadness, joyless, lifeless"" (from ""All Over You"") at future King Biscuit Time gigs. ""Paperhead"" climaxes with a crescendo of distorted guitar, but sounds like it's fighting inertia to sound appropriately worked up. </i></p><p> 
    
    But I could still listen to Mason's creaky, lonely voice all day. It was always the rubber cement that held the Betas' rickety balsa wood genre constructions together. And he's yet to lose his knack for gentle beauty. ""Impossible Ride"" stretches swooning woodwind into a horizon of reverb, while Mason's guitar pokes through like sunlight through pines. Like the Betas' <i>Heroes to Zeros, </i><i>Black Gold isn't a flashy record. For the moment, Mason seems to have abandoned the audience-baiting japes of ""The Beta Band Rap"" or 15-minute journeys into the heart of collage like ""Monolith"". But unlike </i><i>Heroes to Zeros, </i><i>Black Gold sounds agreeably homespun. This is electronic music made in the garden shed and psych-folk still connected to the twitching wires of modernity, and all the better for it. </i></p></div>"|4438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4438-black-gold/|7.5|Jess Harvell

Reilly, a longtime partisan of situationism and British anarchism, still boldly announces his lofty intentions: ""To break with whatever supports the foundations of musical formalism."" A strange doctrine, considering Reilly's improvisations have come closer to classical orchestration and folk with each successive album. But the credo follows his music: pretentious and arresting, methodical and destructive. With the exception of Joy Division, Reilly's narcotic performances are arguably Factory's greatest contribution to contemporary music. In the last decade, his work has haunted landmark albums by My Bloody Valentine, Galaxie 500, and the Orb. Recently, he received the dubious honor of becoming John Frusciante's favorite guitarist. But his own work has somehow become even more insular and melancholy, particularly on the albums following his mother's death and his (temporary) departure from Factory. His sustained depression is truly a feat for someone who once embodied the cliché of the suicidal dream-pop guitarist in the mid-1980s.</p><p>
<em>Keep Breathing</em> continues the trend, dissolving the more conventional structures found on the gorgeously sad <em>Someone Else's Party</em> (2003) and the tepid <i>Tempus Fugit (2004). Indeed, the songs that seem the most novel are also the most lackluster: The bongos, handclaps, and self-parodic space guitar of ""Nina"" sound like Reilly is pandering for a feature in <em>Uncut</em>. (The lyrics cite Bob Marley and reality television.) Lazy samples and flourishes obscure Reilly's mesmeric guitar on ""Let Me Tell You Something"". Fortunately, much of the remainder finds Reilly on familiar ground: grim intensity, calm virtuosity, ear-puncturing feedback, and a superabundance of delay pedals. Despite (or because of) that uniformity, there's a wide range of emotional registers: vague menace on ""Helen"", sappy ecstasy on ""Lunch"", inertia on ""Tuesday"". The most rewarding moments occur on ""Neil"", which connects corrugated folk guitar, flamenco and African jazz rhythms, and passing glances at the Delta blues, and the nostalgic ""Big Hole"", which inflames the fatigued vocals with feral harmonica.</i></p><p>
    This is a comfortable but hardly earth-shattering album. Durutti devotees will welcome Reilly's reinvigoration, but new fans may miss any sense of abrasion. The feedback is loud but almost always soothing, and that constancy can lead to tedium. For all of Reilly's revolutionary bluster, <em>Breathing</em> is probably as palatable to Deadheads as sulky post-punk kids-- a supremely accessible record with appeal to anyone invested in noise and beauty.</p></div>"|2490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2490-keep-breathing/|7.5|Alex Linhardt

    music has always communicated with her fans via revealing and heartfelt lyrics. Dawson's short-lived duo the Moldy Peaches spearheaded the so-called anti-folk movement in 2001 with their self-titled debut, which blurred fairly light
    compositions with slapdash, seemingly spontaneous stories. In contrast, topics such as
    body image, depression, and child abuse made their way on to Dawson's
    last solo album, 2004's <em>Hidden Vagenda</em>. That record was created in a
    high-scale studio alongside well-known musicians from bands like
    Primus and Eels, but on the newly released <em>Remember That I Love You</em> Dawson returns to minimal instrumentation, home-tracked recordings, contributions from her circle of friends. With Dawson, the focus is on the lyrics, with her music tending to serve as a mere platform for sprawling, humorous stories whose serious subject matter contradicts the childlike catchiness underpinning them.</p><p>
    Both lyrically and in her quick yet carefully considered delivery,
    Dawson most closely resembles her buddy Jeffrey Lewis. Each artist
    has a sharp wit that overrides his or her faux naïve spin, and while Dawson's music is often about her own self-exploration and questioning, she also offers advice to her listeners. ""I Like Giants"" is a funny, metaphor laden shout out to anyone who has ever had body confidence
    issues, and ""Caving In"" is about accepting those days when you feel
    helpless and low. Dawson also embraces mortality as one of the main themes
    of <em>Remember That I Love You</em>. ""12/26"" is a moving, honest account of how
    she felt about the tsunami of 2004, and ""Underground"" deals with her
    desire to be cremated instead of buried. Perhaps the most touching is ""My Mom"", on which Dawson talks about her hospitalized mother's
    illness and urges her ghosts to go away (""As long as she is haunted
    she'll never get strong/ My mom needs you gone"").</p><p>
    On ""The Competition"", Dawson sings: ""On the days I stayed in bed/ I sang
    and sang about how crappy I felt/ Without realizing how many other people
    would relate"". This is what the relationship between Dawson and
    her fans is built upon: realizing that you are not alone, and looking at
    difficult issues through the lens of laughter. The only time I ever met
    Kimya Dawson, she grabbed me and gave me a huge bear hug for
    seemingly no reason; that's kind of how her music feels-- like a
    comforting, unexpected embrace.</p></div>"|2580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2580-remember-that-i-love-you/|6.8|Mia Lily Clarke

In the late 1960s and 70s, Candi Staton's voice boomed with the stylish conviction of Aretha Franklin and the hoarse pathos of Otis Redding. She left her mark on bitterly sad Muscle Shoals sides like ""You Don't Love Me No More"" and ""I'm Just a Prisoner (of Your Good Lovin')"", most of which were reissued by Capitol in 2004 as a self-titled compilation. Staton's extensive catalogue includes disco, Grammy-nominated gospel records, and, in the early 1990s, a club-ready UK top 10 single, ""You Got the Love"" (only the final song in the <em>Sex and the City</em> finale, like duh!). On <em>His Hands</em>, the 66-year-old diva finally returns to her soul roots.</p><p>
    Staton's miseries, at least, seem undiminished by time. Her best old songs convey near-Biblical tribulations, often depicting a pathologically penitent woman who begs for the love of her man, confessing her own sins while holding him blameless. In real life, Staton's trail of doomed relationships rivals Tina Turner's. Yet in giving husky voice to her powerlessness, she became powerful. On <em>His Hands</em>, the heartbreak continues in a new set of old sad bastard music, notably Merle Haggard's ""You Don't Have Far to Go"" and Charlie Rich's ""You Never Really Wanted Me"". Staton's bombshell voice remains singularly affecting, if a little more rehearsed, ranging from raspy overblown notes to frayed whispers.</p><p>
    The voice is willing, but the musical backdrop is weak. Producer Mark Nevers, of alt-country collective Lambchop, and Staton's band, which features a few of her family members, surely had the best intentions. But the horns, female choirs, and clichéd licks of <em>His Hands</em> sound a little too slick-- think <em>Blues Brothers 2000</em>-- where Staton's first couple of albums clawed through veins with tragically self-abasing passion. The inclusion of four Staton originals doesn't help matters, though they're not much more pedestrian than the Will Oldham-penned title track. ""His Hands"" is a leisurely waltz that ballasts its arty ambitions with clumsily incongruous lyrics: ""There were a lot of things in his touch/ Sometimes the slightest whisper, oh, it could hurt so much/ I could feel him coming nearer, his little noises and such"". The strain behind that final rhyme is almost audible. </p><p>
    No matter how huge Staton's voice, <em>His Hands</em> is merely a nostalgic echo that falls short of the original. Her recent self-titled retrospective is still the best starting point for those who'd like to be entranced, mystified, and deeply touched by Staton's emotive brand of Alabama soul. It gathers all of the tracks from her 1969 debut, <em>I'm Just a Prisoner</em>, and the 1971 follow-up <em>Stand By Your Man</em>-- including her Grammy-nominated version of the Tammy Wynette standard, plus her take on the Elvis hit ""In the Ghetto"". Though Staton's most wrenching songs confront what men's hands have wrought, her strength has always come from deep within. Such fortitude deserves better than this. </p></div>"|7742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7742-his-hands/|5.6|Marc Hogan

I mean, why <em>couldn't</em> Sonic Youth have been the best selling group of the 1990s? What did My Bloody Valentine record if not great pop songs? Wolf Eyes is a classic singles band! Sad but true: This old wisdom doesn't fly. Though it's harbored its share of forward-thinking songwriters and producers, independent music isn't traditionally thought of as user-friendly. And although its recent ascent in popularity has allowed its most accessible bands brief bouts with commercial success, the culture is still mostly populated by artists whose music is too difficult, challenging, or in some cases, annoying, to appeal to anyone but the smallest minority.</p><p>  In his decade-long run as the ringleader of art-rock collective the Danielson Famile, Daniel Smith has practically defined the term ""cult artist."" His records-- most of them highly conceptual paeans to God-- can be exhausting, barraging listeners with surprise twists and turns and tangled song fragments. Smith himself has an inimitable vocal style: a twisted melange of bleating, twinging yelps, whoops, and screeches. Yet Smith's discography has yielded him a small but unflaggingly loyal congregation, drawn to music that, above all else, is uninhibitedly gleeful, celebratory, and rallying-- the kind of inspired communal rejoicing that's highly contagious.</p><p>  Though I've long admired Smith's idiosyncratic vision, navigating his music's quirks and structural obstacles hasn't always been wholly rewarding. But after two years spent refining his approach in his Clarksboro studio, he's re-emerged with an album that serves as the resolution of his recorded output: the spectacular <em>Ships</em>. Harnessing a work ethic so steadfast its presence is felt throughout the album's entire duration, here Smith distills the best and most unique attributes of his sound, and marries that creative concentrate to a grander, more cinematic sensibility. The result is staggeringly triumphant-- the blustering, ambitious consummation of all he's worked toward.</p><p>  Initially recruiting likeminded noise-pop explorers Deerhoof as his backing band, Smith's ambitions for the album eventually found him corralling a total of 20 musicians, including all Famile past and present, Anticon alumnus Why?, members of Serena Maneesh and Half-Handed Cloud, and longtime Danielson acolyte Sufjan Stevens. So many mismatched contributors could have turned the album into a chaotic melée of disparate ideas. Instead, the sound only grew greater and more colossal with every added hand-- one more instrument in a superdense wall of beautifully ramshackle orchestration that creaks and groans beneath its own enormous weight.</p><p>  That weight is <em>Ships</em>' cornerstone. None of Smith's previous records-- and in fact, very few indie releases this year-- have flat-out <em>rocked</em> like this one, with blaring trumpets signaling snares to exact their force beneath sweeping multitracked vocal choruses that simply won't stop crescendoing. On standouts like ""Ship the Majestic Suffix"" and ""Bloodbook on the Half Shell"", the music builds to such immense heights, and increases tension so far past the expected breaking point, that the inevitable release is nearly dizzying. But Smith also grasps the inherent malleability of such a sizable ensemble, and though he most often uses it to breathe life into the album's darkly apocalyptic overtures, he also wisely crafts shimmering psychedelic passages that prevent it from becoming too claustrophobic.</p><p>  Of course, while vastly more accessible and streamlined than Smith's other outings, <em>Ships</em> is, in that same vein, very much a cult record. And like other recent, successful cult records-- the Fiery Furnaces' <em>Blueberry Boat</em>, Animal Collective's <em>Sung Tongs</em>, and earlier this week, Scott Walker's <em>The Drift</em>-- the elements that make it so refreshing and exciting to some listeners are certain to put off others. Smith's vocals, for instance, are significantly calmer and less abrasive here than ever, but his charismatic chirps and squawks may be an obstacle for even some seasoned fans of yelpy indie rock. And while they offer Smith the opportunity to achieve a number of unusual melodic feats, the unpredictable song structures may initially throw some listeners for a loop.</p><p>  Still, the fact that it lacks some of the broader appeal of independent music's more orthodox practitioners also allows more room for the kind of weirdness and experimentation that makes <em>Ships</em> such a fascinating listen, and indeed, such a watershed in Smith's development as an artist. It's the kind of album he may spend the rest of his career trying to top-- and in the closing track, charmingly titled ""Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up"", he seems to recognize it. With wide-eyed bewilderment, amidst the clash and clang of cymbals and triangles, butterfly flutes, manic guitar strums, ascending eight-part harmonies, and surprise key changes, the euphoric message is reiterated: ""Thanks, thaaaaaanks, <em>thaaaaaaaaaanks!!!!""</em></p></div>"|2642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2642-ships/|9.1|Ryan Schreiber

Or should I say the 1990s: Paul Simon has arrived at his rock 'n' roll contemporaries' midlife crisis a decade or so late, and not in the good, fashionable way. As the 20th century wound down, elder statesmen such as Paul McCartney, Mick
    Jagger, and Eric Clapton dabbled in newfangled electronica-- and whippersnapper David Gray sold six million before Bob Dylan could contemplate following suit. At the time, Simon was busy flopping a musical, 1997's <em>The Capeman</em>, and prepping 2000 safety-move <em>You're the One</em>. On <em>Surprise</em>, Simon &amp; Garfunkel's better half signs up an, ahem, hot young knob-twiddler-- 57-year-old Brian Eno-- to handle ""sonic landscape"" (haw haw actual liner note!) on half-formed tone poems that live down to the self-absorbed, vapidly mystic, utterly clueless conception of Baby Boomers one sees in TV commercials.</p><p>
    
    It appears Simon is still narcissistic after all these years. While that's not inherently bad, here it's ill-advised. <em>Surprise</em> drowns in signifiers of experimentalism-- wobbly U2 electric guitars, drones, whizzes, and oh-em-gee programmed beats-- that already sounded stale when ""electro-folk"" was actually a fad. Meanwhile, when Simon isn't probing the mysteries of aging, he's singing about his own writer's block. ""Locked in a struggle for the right combination of words in a melody line,"" he begins on ""Everything About It Is a Love Song"". On ""Sure Don't Feel Like Love"", Simon waxes even more meta-- ""Thing about the second line?""-- but clunky thing about it really is that ""the poet"" just rhymed ""school"" and ""fool"" in two straight songs, and his one-man band's busy textures can't fully distract from insipid songwriting. Even Simon's welcome bursts of wry humor are self-centered: ""I'm paintin' my hair the color of mud,"" he Jason Mraz drawl-raps on outrageously unfunky ""Outrageous"". Eno is Simon's Just for Men.</p><p>
    
    Narcissism, it turns out, is just the metaphysical underpinning for a bunch of post-hippie New Age nonsense. ""Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?"" Simon repeats on ""Outrageous"". The answer? God. Oh. Raga-like ""Beautiful"" describes adopting children from Bangladesh, China, and Kosovo. They're beautiful. Proggy ""Wartime Prayers"" goes mealy-mouthed political, its gussied-up choir a weak contrast to Neil Young's impassioned legions on the recent <em>Living With War</em>, while ""Once Upon a Time There Was an Ocean"" shows off Simon's knack for huge, simple metaphors before stumbling on adolescent wordplay: ""Nothing is different, but everything has changed"". Wait, wasn't that a Ben Lee electro-folk song? Opener ""Why Do You Live in the Northeast"" says we're all the same, even if some of us eat rice, and poses another rhetorical Q: ""If the answer is infinite light, why do we live in the dark?"" Here I'm still trying to figure out if the theater's really dead.</p><p>
    
    Given how much recent indie pop owes to Simon, he probably coulda cleaned up with a Rick Rubin nostalgia treatment. It'd be kinda neat that he didn't-- if the results weren't so vainglorious. ""I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind with a genius marketing plan,"" Simon sermonizes. Closer ""Father and Daughter"" is the most conventionally light-jazzy thing here-- the only track without an Eno-scape, it originally appeared on <em>The Wild Thornberrys</em> soundtrack. And while it's better than, say, Bob Carlisle's ""Butterfly Kisses"" it won't replace ""Daughters"" as daddy/daughter wedding dance. Still, pulsating runaway tale ""Another Galaxy"", with the album's finest melody, shows Simon's compass hasn't totally slip-slid yet.</p><p>
    
    Contractually mandated ""surprise"" pun: In the end, Eno really isn't one. Talking Heads' 1980 <em>Remain in Light</em> owed as much to African polyrhythms as Simon's wildly successful <em>Graceland</em> did six years later. Moreover, Simon has always changed trappings from album to album, bringing on Nile Rodgers and Philip Glass for 1983's underrated <em>Hearts and Bones</em> and looking to Brazil for 1990's <em>Rhythm of the Saints</em>. But while a trendy folk-rock arrangement initially made ""The Sound of Silence"" a hit, memorable songs made Simon &amp; Garfunkel worthwhile. On <em>Surprise</em>, Simon neglects his strengths, and the record's Plastic Eno Band mud paint can't bring them back.</p></div>"|7855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7855-surprise/|5.1|Marc Hogan

Live, Johnson is both stout and spry, like a stud leprechaun or a Hollywood version of a meth middleman, and he only smiles at his guitar or his drummer's drums. There is something generous about his anthemic tendencies and his prolificness, yet the songs can seem aloof or withdrawn.</p><p>
    
    Skeptics should approach this album from its adventurous rear: The explosive sing-along ""Take a Rake"" earns all of those planet-words (saturnine, mercurial, earthy) that the Secret Machines often seem to be pursuing, and the whomping riffage of its phallic coda hopefully presages the band's unsentimental-Zeppelin future. The muted but propulsive ""Take the Maps and Run"" is the least conventional composition, inhabiting that experimental-ballad zone where folks thought Wilco was headed after <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>. The beginning of the record may seem like stately stuff for the Neil Young heads, with guitars both bedraggled and pristine, but the thud of ""Calling Thermatico"" makes Centro's last record seem twee. Warbled organs add future-boogie to ""The Fugitives Have Won"", and the backward loops and violins of ""I See Through You"" are a poppy field to ease the forlorn-parmesan lyrics: imagine a rustic Donovan, high on Ecclesiastes. </p><p>
    
    Ten years strong, this band exhibits a knowingness: when ""In Such Crooked Time"" threatens to clear out even the slow-dancers and fans of poetic phrasing (""on the shores of your decline""), the album re-abrupts with a fist-pumper called, winkily, ""For New Starts."" Critics dismissive of anything not novel seem like the backhanded targets of ""Patience for the Ride""-- and that's on top of its class/political narrative and literally last-minute solo. The squall and tremelo contained on <em>Fort Recovery</em> alone could cause all manner of rockist relapses. Keep an antidote handy; maybe ""Vacation"" by the Go-Go's?</p></div>"|1379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1379-fort-recovery/|8.1|William Bowers

Maybe it had something to do with the European Union becoming an official entity in 1992, but during the rest of the decade, multi-lingual bands that replicated sonic tricks from different eras seemed interesting. Stereo Total, Pizzicato Five, Cibo Matto, Sukia, Arling &amp; Cameron-- hell, pretty much the entire Emperor Norton stable; these acts wanted nothing more than to find the common cool in bachelor pad lounge, disco, funk, new wave, and the entire family of romance languages. Not surprisingly, these groups frequently referenced the modish mid-60s, another time of great transition, when the world was shrinking because of jet airplanes, space travel, and television, and culture and fashion spread rapidly from one country or continent to the next.</p><p>
    
    Aggressively international pop may not have the cachet it once did, but it never really went away; last year's debut from New York's Brazilian Girls fit the bill nicely, and so does this record from Spain's Pinker Tones. The Tones are Mr. Furia and Professor Manso, two guys based in Barcelona who first recorded together using the name the BCN Connection. The theme of <em>The Million Colour Revolution</em> fits nicely with the record's sound; the world they look to is pluralistic, inclusive, and hybridized. The songs come in a language for every market-- Spanish, English, French, German-- and the style flips from track to track: bossa nova, spybeat, funk, reggae, even a couple that verge on a capella.</p><p>
    
    Which leads to the first thing in the Pinker Tones' favor: A good record collection is one thing, but both these dudes can sing. At key points they table the frenetic sampling to stand around the piano and double their voices and simulate a neon-striped barbershop quartet. The arrangement of ""Pink Freud"" isn't terribly far from the warped choir in miniature Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks were shooting for in the breakdown of ""Heroes and Villains""; almost as sharp is the breezy buh-bah-bah-bah lounge bossa nova of ""Beyond Nostalgia"". Tight arrangements are a constant, but Pinker Tones bring a human touch that strengthens the connection to the styles they emulate. </p><p>
    
    They also know how to write hooks. The vocal riff on the housey ""Sonido Total"" is a twice-removed cousin of the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You"" chorus and retains nearly all the smartass whine; the hopelessly caffeinated faux-ska of ""Karma Hunters"" would be difficult to bear if the chord progression and chorus weren't so catchy. The instrumental ""Pinkerland Becaina"" sounds like an old Leon Redbone tune that you hear once in the background of a beer commercial and winds up stuck in your head for days. Such straightforward tunefulness should be a requirement for this kind of music, but a lot of bands can't mange it. </p><p>
    
    Despite the pluses, there's no question that an album like this can be tiring to hear straight through; all the turntable scratches, ironic bits from spoken word records, crashing drums lifted from some late 60s Spector production-- it piles up and wears you out. A certain amount of fatigue is probably built into the aesthetic, but that doesn't detract from how good most tracks sound in isolation. Global indie pop is here to stay and Pinker Tones do it very well. </p></div>"|6597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6597-the-million-colour-revolution/|7.3|Mark Richardson

Though the duo have occasionally deigned to tour the states, they've mostly done it while wearing masks, and <i>Miastenia</i> is their first official U.S. release. (Drummer Bruno Dorella runs one of the premier Italian weird labels, Bar La Muerte, on which Ovo's music is released in Europe.) For what it's worth, <i>Miastenia</i> will likely be the most romantic metal album this year; Dorella and Stefania Pedretti <i>sound</i> like a couple. And if one's love-life ranks low on the list of things prized in muddy dirges-- bass tone, brutality, brown notes-- their low frequency, overdue American invasion might do the trick on its own.</p><p>
    
    In an idiom where the drummer's job is to not get so high that he forgets to hit the floor tom every 30 seconds or so, Dorella's groovin' double-bass and tom sweeps, as on ""Anime Morte"", give <i>Miastenia</i>, well, <i>swing</i>. Their growly groove is less Big Business lazy and more golden-90s bass-band (Regraped, Hammerhead, Karp), with the addition of Pedretti's Yoko Ono beatboxing. On ""Voodoo"" she whispers, chirping like Satomi Deerhoof, slow cello gathering speed behind her; one U.S. show report had her playing her own dreads with a bow. If there were a part of my body I could get this low and evil, I'd probably play it too.</p><p>
    
    Pedretti also plays a guitar, tuned and amplified to sound much more like bass (or arriving subway)-- especially on slow stomps like ""Due Paia Di Cuori"", which sounds like power-violence mixed with Disney vocals, or the slightly quicker paced ""Mammut"", on which Dorella chews up toms while Pedretti adds, um, <i>melisma</i> to her menacing Gollum screech. In another dimension, <i>Miastenia</i> is battling fellow Load fantasists Forcefield, the good-guy <i>Lord of the Rings Modulator</i>s, and Wizardzz for dominance of our planet. </p><p>
    
    ""Miastenia"", the 20-minute plus closer, is a goofy death-march with slow, plodding guitar strokes and helium, cookie monster vocals. Bathos, sure, but more intentional than that: Ovo are kinda funny, and they know it. That they deflate every norm worshipped currently in stateside head-banging circles; that's funny too, even if it's obvious they don't exactly belong. No doubt they don't in Italy either.</p></div>"|6123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6123-miastenia/|6.9|Zach Baron

Walker beats the noise-mongers in New York, the conservatory-schooled theater kids, the gallery poseurs, the reclusive art-pop geniuses, all the perennially stylish genre tourists, celebrity revolutionaries, and outmoded underground icons. He, despite little more than a cult status in his native (and long since abandoned) country, has emerged a visionary, maker of some of the most texturally complex, viscerally emotional, and downright horrific music this side of anyone at all.</p><p>  But then, the composer of <em>The Drift</em>, Walker's first new studio record since 1995's devastating <em>Tilt</em>, didn't appear from out of nowhere. Rather, the Ohio-born artist (born Scott Noel Engel) staked a claim to the musical territory somewhere between orchestral pop and psychological soliloquy from his earliest solo records. After garnering major success in the UK as one-third of the pop act the Walker Brothers (none of whom were actually related, or born with the name Walker), Scott Walker left the group and released four LPs between 1967 to 1969 (<em>Scott</em>, <em>2</em>, <em>3</em>, and <em>4</em>), each of which is held as a classic by diehard pop sophisticates. The earliest of these records were also successful in the UK, though as Walker's themes became weightier (influenced not only by Belgian singer/composer Jacques Brel, but the dark end of art-house cinema and literature), his audience slowly dwindled. Walker released a string of albums in the early 1970s that retreated drastically from the ambition of his first four before unexpectedly reuniting with the Walker Brothers for 1978's <em>Nite Flights</em>, and unveiling the first glimpses of the major musical artist we hear today.</p><p>  Walker's <em>Climate of Hunter</em> from 1984 furthered his movement towards the abstract (albeit very gradually), though it wasn't until <em>Tilt</em> that his gift for radical songcraft and sound sculpting came to the fore. If his earliest solo music contained unusual themes for a pop artist, they did at least contain fairly conventional orchestrations and melodies. <em>Tilt</em> threw all that out in favor of a hybrid mixture of modern classical music, found sound, dissonant avant-rock, and hyper-personal vocal expression. It was a masterpiece, even as it alienated fans hoping for a return to comparatively calm waters.</p><p> <em>The Drift</em> is still further down an unbeaten path. Written and produced over a seven-year period, this record, like a painstakingly fine Ingmar Bergman film, moves slowly and deliberately, with an intense focus and refusal to turn away from disturbing ""images."" Like <em>Tilt</em>, its stories are taken from a varied, almost overstuffed horizon of literature, news stories, Walker's half-forgotten dreams, and otherwise poetic neuroses. Speaking visually, the music is mostly darker hues, though sudden flashes of blue light or explosive white beams punctuate an otherwise intimidating monolithic landscape. Walker describes working with ""blocks of sound"" as opposed to written arrangements, and the record betrays a broad, almost brawny movement, as if being slowly, persistently kicked in the gut by the characters (or characterizations) of the composer's songs.</p><p>  Lyrically, <em>The Drift</em> (like its predecessor) practically invites volumes of analysis, especially after repeated listens-- but then, the best part about them is that they aren't usually explicit. ""Cossacks Are"", with pulled quotes like, ""A moving aria for a vanishing style of mind"" or ""A nocturne filled with glorious ideas"" could very well refer to Walker's own music, or even poke fun at his reviews. It's hard to say for sure, but impossible to resist looking for clues.</p><p>  Throughout the album, textures change without a moment's notice: The solemn organ and drum pulse of ""Clara"" leads like a brick to the head into the wallop of sticks on animal flesh and churning, nauseating strings, only to shed its skin into muffled-scream violins, and back again. Walker sings about a body ""dipped in blood in the moonlight/ Like what happen in America,"" and later describes a vision of the song's namesake (""Sometimes I feel like a swallow/ A swallow which by some mistake has gotten into an attic and knocks its head against the walls in terror""). The images fly by as they would in a nightmare, and the music is no less surreal or paranoid. ""Cue"" looks at the parasitic life of a virus, proceeding like a Stanley Kubrick movie, free of any particular morality or obligation to end happily, and full of exquisite imagery, as considered as it is obscene.</p><p>  ""Jesse"" begins with the hum of jet engines and a mutilated take on Elvis Presley's ""Jailhouse Rock"" guitar riff. Walker has described this as his ""9/11 song,"" and uses the motif of Elvis and his stillborn twin brother to make a statement about American mythology and hubris-- and yes, that's pretentious, as is most of Walker's output for the last 30 years. It also reminds that ""pretension"" isn't always synonymous with ""bullshit"": Walker earns every one of his conceptual pretexts via the iron-fist dynamics of the songs, and his own deep, wet baritone, deepening the scope of every measure it inhabits. Sometimes, his words seem secondary, as on the explosive noise rock intro to ""Hand Me Ups"", which sounds akin to legendary experimental Japanese band Ground Zero (check the bass sax!), or the pounding, jittery middle section on ""Psoriatic"". Elsewhere, Walker's voice is held afloat and given center stage by the gentlest accompaniment, as on the subtly wry album closer, ""A Lover Loves"". If you don't think the guy has a sense of humor, check the ""psst-psst-pssts"" between every verse.</p><p>  There will doubtlessly be many listeners who don't understand how anyone could listen to such relentlessly ""bleak"" music, but Walker is the kind of artist that exposes a lot of would-be art as background entertainment-- and like a great artist, he doesn't actually make a value judgment out of it; he merely goes on about his work, distancing himself from the fleshy pile of pastimes and people who would obscure the most ambitious functions of art. Walker inspires, scares, confuses, provokes-- not because he wants to manipulate you, but because he's an interesting person who's worked a long time trying to make interesting music. Even at its most dissonant and abstract, this record is human to the core, and if you're ready to face a few demons, it's as inspiring as music gets.</p><p> </p></div>"|8764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/|9.0|Dominique Leone

Afterward, Drew Daniel mentioned it increased shipping costs exponentially. So then, why bring it? Well, it's a lovely piece. Plus, people are almost as interested in <em>how</em> the San Francisco duo create its sound as what it sounds like: A bowed-cage as symphony offers a sumptuous visual. Using anything from a crayfish's nerve tissue to a cow's reproductive tract, Daniel (who is, we must add, a staff writer for this website) and M.C. Schmidt utilize digital-age <em>musique concrète</em> to create tunefully fractured electronic music.</p><p>  After giving nose jobs on <em>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</em> and providing backbeats to the war between the States on <em>The Civil War</em>, Matmos returns with their fifth, most-engaging full-length, <em>The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast</em>. These 10 works are described as biographical ""sound portraits"" of historically and culturally important gay figures, which incorporate details relevant to a particular person's life or practice. Displaying a continued mastery of their craft, the songs not only live up to the concepts behind them, they could easily exist without them. But because the theme <em>is</em> there, elaborate packaging offers a different cover image for each icon: Visual portraits of the subjects drawn, sketched, constructed, or painted by Dan Clowes, Jason Mecier, graphic designer Rex Ray, Michael Bernard Loggins, and others.</p><p>  How's it all work? Well, consider ""Rag for William S. Burroughs"". The author's family accrued its wealth from the Burroughs Adding Machine Company (later, the Burroughs Corporation), based around his grandfather's invention. After grandpa's death, the company introduced the Burroughs typewriter. Various machines also show up as a central image in Burroughs' work; most famously, typewriters in the nonlinear, hallucinogenic masterpiece, <em>Naked Lunch</em>. The track swivels on a percussive adding machine and the clickity-clack of typists. The ragtime vibe? Burroughs was born in St. Louis, where Scott Joplin, the ""father of ragtime,"" wrote a few of his most famous compositions. At just under 14 minutes, its Mugwump stylings go from Futurist machinations to swingy, piano-based saloon ramble, and then psyched-out hand-drummed raga. A question remains: What are the typists spelling?</p><p>  Each track is just as thematically tight-- scored and curated to the smallest detail. ""Snails and Lasers for Patricia Highsmith"" uses the mystery writer's snail obsession-- she supposedly kept hundreds of them as pets, and she wrote about them in works like the short story, ""The Snail-Watcher""-- as the slimy composers of that piece. The technique: A laser was pointed at a light-sensitive theremin; snails were let loose within the theremin's range, fucking with its pitch. The result is an ominous, hard-boiled brushed jazz piece accented with what sounds like a harpsichord flourish. It eventually turns into a bleakly paranoid theremin landscape as the snails frolic in slow motion.</p><p>  One of the poppier productions is ""Solo Buttons For Joe Meek"", a crisp 1960s surf-rock anthem on which the Kronos Quartet add a layer of melancholic strings to the song's space-age bachelor joyousness. By track's end, summertime fun recedes in favor of the elegantly funereal. Joe Meek? He was a tone deaf, dyslexic 60s British record producer known in part for his quirky, deftly produced instrumental works-- sometimes fleshed out with space-age effects. He killed his landlady and then himself in 1967; the track manages to score the entire trajectory of his too-brief life.</p><p>  The scraping, mechanical ""Roses and Teeth for Ludwig Wittgenstein"" is the most traditional bit of <em>musique concrète</em> here. Perhaps the oddest (most obviously brainy) tracks on the album, it's offered up to the complex Austrian philosopher, focusing on a conundrum paragraph from his ""Philosophical Investigations"" read by Björk and the composers Laetitia Sonami and Marcus Schmickler, among others. Wittgenstein sets it up more elegantly, but after stating that ""A new-born child has no teeth. A goose has no teeth. A rose has no teeth,"" he supposes what would happen if a cow shit on a rose. Fittingly, the percussion is played with roses. There's also a goose honk, cow sounds, and manure is incorporated (somehow), etc. The final noise blast is pure industrial spillage. Well, philosophy homework was never quite like this.</p><p>  Another piece based primarily around a written text is ""Tract For Valerie Solanas"". The same way Sunn 0))) was nailed for recording Xasthur in a coffin, Matmos will get a lot of column space for playing a cow uterus and vagina as tribute to the woman best known for shooting Andy Warhol. Sunn 0))) was aiming for claustrophobia and positioning Xasthur as cryptic solo artist; in a similarly smart way, the moo parts are a great pun on both the cow's goods (its reproductive tract) and Solanas's S.C.U.M. Manifesto (a feminist tract). Score.</p><p>  Other standouts include ""Semen Song For James Bidgood"", a haunting, trance-style piano-based ballad which features Zeena Parkins on harp and Antony on vocals, ""Steam and Sequins for Larry Levan"", a rump-shaking disco mutation in honor of the Paradise Garage DJ, and the funkified ""Public Sex For Boyd McDonald"", which incorporates whispery, quivvery recordings made at the San Francisco sex club Blow Buddies.</p><p>  There are a few moments when the concept's cooler than the result, but in general <em>The Rose Has Teeth</em>'s experiments result in frenetic dance tracks doubling as reading lists. Throughout, Matmos smartly mix high-culture icons, underground heroes, and cult legends, consuming objects and texts that transform everyday items (and lives) into something beautiful and strange. All said, the two are lucky the album doesn't stink: If it had, Wittgenstein's defecating cow would've offered a pretty great metaphorical diss.</p><p> </p></div>"|5153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5153-the-rose-has-teeth-in-the-mouth-of-a-beast/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Over the past year alone, 5RC has released acclaimed albums by the Mae Shi, No-Neck Blues Band, and Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice. With such an impressive roster of artists, it isn't surprising that Moon chose to celebrate 5RC's progress with a compilation.</p><p>  It's apt that the first 5RC compilation should highlight Deerhoof-- the San Francisco quartet were the first band to sign to the label, and have stuck by it even as their has popularity soared. They're the only group to have two spots on the 17-track <em>Samp-Le-Mer</em>: ""Running Thoughts"", which appeared on <em>The Runners Four</em>, and a previously unreleased recording, ""Chi-Tan First Guitar"". The latter is a brief, lo-fi track built around subtle guitars, a minimal vocal line that repeats the word ""meow"" in Japanese, wheezy segments of harmonium, and the brisk twang of a sitar. Like the other 10 unreleased tracks on this comp, it doesn't stand up to the band's other recordings.</p><p>  Need New Body's ""Endless Sky in the Mind's Eye"" is also underwhelming when compared to last year's intriguingly opaque album <em>Where's Black Ben?</em>, a vicious instrumental soundscape. The Planet The's disjointed, rhythmically textured post-punk and the dilapidated marching beat of the Punks' ""We Are the Shit, Part 2"" are previously unreleased tracks that go toe-to-toe with these artists' other work. Far more effective in this compilation, and saving it from becoming crippled by songs that were deemed too weak to make it on to a ""proper"" release, are the tracks by Xiu Xiu (""""), Hella (""Madonna Approaches R&amp;B Blonde Wreckages""), the Mae Shi (""Remarkable Dirty Animals""), and BARR (""My List of Demands"").</p><p>  Quality aside, <em>Samp-Le-Mer</em> is first and foremost a document and celebration of 5RC's brief history. Moon may not provide a flawless run of tracks, one that represents the individual strengths of the groups on his imprint, but this collection still serves as evidence of the label's diversity and devotion to exciting, genre-crossing music.</p><p> </p></div>"|1839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1839-sur-la-mer-samp-le-mer/|6.8|Mia Lily Clarke

The experiment has been completed for some time, and now the various members of the collective announce its findings over and over. This isn't necessarily a censure; it simply means that the label has developed an aesthetic-- a blend of hip-hop, post-rock, sound collage, and electro-pop-- that cuts across nearly all of its recent releases. This is a natural outcome of the Anticon's intricately collaborative nature-- any given release by Sole, Doseone, Pedestrian, Odd Nosdam, Alias, or Why? will probably feature cameos from all the rest. The imprint has traded the element of surprise for familiarity, which is bad news for listeners who place a high premium on novelty, good for those who enjoy the established Anticon idiom.</p><p>   Like everyone in Anticon, Jel has been involved in many in-house collaborations (most notably Themselves, Subtle, and 13 &amp; God), and his debut LP-- a murky palimpsest of disembodied samples and dirty beats, incantatory rhymes and live instrumentation, leftist rhetoric and absurdist non sequiturs, breathy female vocals and ephemeral melodies-- features the usual array of cameos from Anticon and like-minded artists. In other words, it's another archetypal Anticon record. Why? plays a twinkling piano and eerily whistling synth to Jel's intricately sculpted martial percussion and string instrument accents on ""All Day Breakfast"". The sluggish, grimy funk of ""Soft Money, Dry Bones"" finds Jel running a Pedestrian-penned digest of leftist surrealism (""Dry bones recruited outside of a mall for 'Real World: Kabul'"") through his serviceable yet anonymous backpacker flow. Stefanie Bohm of Ms. John Soda adds her abstracted coo to this and to the blippy static of ""All Around"", and Odd Nosdam laces colorful drones through the coruscating twitter of ""Know You Don't"".</p><p>   The first Themselves record, <em>Them</em>, remains the pinnacle of the more rap-oriented side of Anticon's catalog, in no small part because of how perfectly Jel's minimalist beatscape complemented Doseone's maximalist flow. Unfortunately, <em>Soft Money</em> doesn't compare favorably to that visionary work-- its pleasures are more obvious and middle-of-the-road. Having abandoned razor-sharp minimalism for a murkier, fuller tone, Jel's music here doesn't focus your attention to a laser-point the way <em>Them</em> did, but neither is it big enough to saturate it-- it lurks comfortably in the middle distance. Its politics, too, are overstated yet affectless: Instead of showing, Jel tells, with undie-rap's typically preachy bent. The anti-auto-industry screed ""To Buy a Car"" cuts up commercials over a slinky buzz and echoing pings, and the message is far from subtle: ""Don't buy this product; you don't need it."" The same might be said of <em>Soft Money</em>-- as it doesn't deviate from the standard palette, those of you with a lot of mostly-instrumental hip-hop in your collection don't in fact need it. But it's a solid example of the form, and so you might want it-- not a good enough justification for buying an environment-raping Hummer, maybe, but good enough for a record.</p><p> </p></div>"|4233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4233-soft-money/|6.0|Brian Howe

Collectively, it's reminiscent of the oft-cited college-rock milestones of the 1980s (once more with feeling): Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and R.E.M. If that's a sound you're jonesing for, Cities can mash that particular button. They plow through their revival on all cylinders, eschewing the minimal and heavy-handed style of similar artists like Interpol in favor of inertia; the band rarely stops to catch its breath over the album's 10 tracks. But a copy of a copy always gets harder to read, and I'm still squinting at Cities' debut for any sign of personality.</p><p>  Cities add a Western gallop to opener ""A Theme"" and an amphetamine rush to the strumming of ""Lakes"", but both just scratch the surface of their influences, showing plenty of verve but not much in the way of dynamics or memorable melodies. They do, however, feature lots of slipping in and out of ""passionate"" falsetto from singer Josh Nowlan, particularly on ""Lakes"" and ""OOC"". (Full disclosure: They also feature former Pitchfork staffer Rob Mackey.)</p><p>  I'd like to say Nowlan is spiking the band's watery punch with an effeminate streak borrowed from of Michael Stipe or Jeff Buckley (rather than, y'know, Chris Martin), but nothing here implies they're quite that discerning. Cities practically revel in their meat-and-potatoes approach. ""Cons, Thieves, and Murderers"" is a sparser, less strum-happy highlight that's buoyed by stick-clanging drums. More switch-ups like that from the rhythm section could have lifted this record to higher peaks (why do those trailing behind Interpol never realize the band's secret weapon?), but just ""Cons"" and ""OOC"" have much interplay between the band. More common are tracks like the angst-ridden closer ""Barricades &amp; Garrisons"", its build-and-release too predictable to be cathartic.</p><p>  Chalk it up to tentative steps on a debut LP, but calling Cities workmanlike is almost being too generous-- albums like this make Editors sound innovative. Too polished for the garage, but too complacent to be ready for the bright lights, Cities have a long way to go.</p><p> </p></div>"|1836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1836-cities/|5.9|Jason Crock

    creatively spelled album titles, frontman Jason Lytle turned to Ma
    Joad. ""We was always one thing-- we was the fambly-- kinda whole and
    clear,"" says <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> matriarch. ""An' now we ain't
    clear no more."" Modesto, Calif.-based Grandaddy, hailing from the same
    illusory promised land barely endured by John Steinbeck's Okies, retravel
    their signature space-pop terrain on fourth and final
    album, <em>Just Like the Fambly Cat</em>, demanding and often rewarding attention like so many prose
    poems about goddamn turtles.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <em>Fambly Cat</em>, Lytle's slow-build
    home-studio sonics offer subtle textures,
    whether the sad-eyed Atari beeps and Books-ish spoken-word samples of
    opener ""What Happened..."" or the dolorous opera singer pledging never
    to return in bittersweet finale ""Shangri La (Outro)"". Wherever there's
    a man inventing a guitar-based crunchy cereal, Lytle'll be there.
    Wherever a starchild's strumming acoustic and Peter's robbing Paul to
    pay Korg, you'll see Lytle's formerly bearded mug.</p><p>
    
    It's all vaguely familiar, but Lytle's fine-grained production pops a
    freshmaker or two into the mix. Tracks fold and refold onto
    themselves, sprouting unexpected codas, like the ""Wicked Game""
    acoustic-guitar noodles at the end of energetic teenage-dream
    slapstick (and first single) ""Jeez Louise"", or the growl'n'yawp pet
    sounds at the end of the hazy ""The Animal World"". Four
    songs clock in at over six minutes, each featuring leisurely escalating swoonscapes rather than proggish movement changes or noodly improv. So the honeyed verses of ""Where I'm
    Anymore"" melt into a lush, 1970s AM-pop ""meow-meow"" chorus, which in
    turn eddies into surging guitar.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, there's some endearing nonsense about the journey of a lost
    cat, but clearly it's Grandaddy that's really moving on. In
    his sweetened, beatific falsetto, Lytle describes faded summers,
    ironic ice cream trucks, fear of failure, and a prodigal son's love
    for his mother, once dipping into the dark void (""Nothing rad/ Nothing
    right/ Nothing I'll feel tonight"") of pathological intoxication.
    Sometimes it's as if Lytle is singing out of nostalgia for a future
    that never came true: A world where Grandaddy ironed out its
    inessential bits and made an album comprising solely the band's many
    moments of glossy low-key bedazzlement-- where Pete Yorn and Saves the Day opened for <em>them</em>.</p><p>
    
    ""I don't wanna be the story of the guy who tried,"" Lytle sighs flatly
    on ""Guide Down Denied"", the turning point of the album. From here on, the songs find silver linings and beguiling hooks. Simple truths come hard-earned, given depth by Lytle's luminous instrumental
    touches: ""You don't have to be alone anymore,"" he suggests on
    ""Campershell Dreams"", and it's like a fucking revelation. Energetic
    ""Disconnecty"" looks ambiguously at solo flight, while ""This Is How It
    Always Starts"" shimmers into whiskey oblivion, before doom-laden
    ""Shangri-La (Outro)"" confirms, dude's never coming back.</p><p>
    
    No grapes, no wrath, but, like Steinbeck's lil' novel, <em>Just Like the Fambly Cat</em> is a quest for hope. On the disc's catchiest song, perky ""Elevate Myself"", Lytle finally ceases his
    self-torture, eschewing the pop conveyor belt in favor of self-actualization: ""I'd rather make an honest sound/ And watch it fly around/ And then be on my way."" It's not how the world ends, but it's
    how a fambly-- of men, of fans, and of robots-- quietly crumbles. No more false Shangri-La: Like any
    self-respecting technophobe savant, Lytle's moving to Montana.</p></div>"|3550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3550-just-like-the-fambly-cat/|6.8|Marc Hogan

    self-indulgence, an idea dump for a band looking to
    expand its boundaries, give the secondary members a
    few chances to songwrite, or share that gestating song
    cycle about warring clans of magical elves with the
    world. The Red Hot Chili Peppers don't seem to
    be likely candidates for any of the above,
    having spent a two-decade career trafficking in
    progressively diluted funk songs about California,
    sex, and having sex in California. Then again,
    they've given their record the preposterous
    pseudo-Latin title of <i>Stadium Arcadium (what's next, a
    music review book called <em>Thesaurus Musicarum</em>?), so
    maybe the shirtophobic quartet is ready to let their
    art-rock flag fly.</i></p><p>
    
    Probably for the best, that's not the case; through
    two-plus hours of music, the emphasis here is
    on the Stadium. Like many of their peers
    from the heady peak of alternative rock-- your Grohls,
    Cornells, and Billie Joes-- the Peppers have eased
    into a comfortable life traveling down the middle of
    the road. Kiedis, Flea, &amp; co. can even stake a truly
    rightful claim to the territory now christened Adult
    Album Alternative, having practically induced labor on
    the genre with the mega-hit ""Under the Bridge"" and their subsequent string of ever-so-slightly askew
    mid-tempo pop. Fitting examples abound on <em>Stadium
    Arcadium</em>, catchy tunes that will ensure a long tenure
    for the album at the front of the store. The band's
    sin, however, is one of self-denial: If the Red Hot Chili
    Peppers have pretty much mastered a marketable style,
    why bludgeon us with an unwieldy and inconsistent
    approach for 1/12th of a day, nagged by an annoying
    tendency to detour through affirmations of their
    technical talent and loyalty to funk-rock?</p><p>
    
    It could've been worse, as the sessions that led to
    <i>Stadium Arcadium reportedly yielded enough material
    for a triple album. So the band has shown <em>some</em> ability to
    self-edit, but not enough to save the record from
    typical double-album bloat, the islands of good tracks
    floating amidst the should-a-been B-sides. Conveniently-- or perhaps subconsciously-- the set is still front-loaded, with the first disc
    containing most of the highlights, like the
    expertly paced sunset anthem of the title track or the
    one-peak-after-another rave-up of ""Torture Me"".</i></p><p>
    
    But sprinkled throughout the first disc, and coming to
    a head in the second, are products of the band's
    compulsive need to tip the light-bulb hat to their
    younger selves, most notably half-baked funk tracks ""Hump De Bump"" and ""Warlocks"". Whereas
    poor production values and drug-fueled exuberance once
    excused their George Clinton worship, 20 years on,
    in Rick Rubin's sterile environment, the band sounds
    like they're in jamband training camp, filling in all the empty spaces with blippityblap
    reminders of Flea's virtuosity and John Frusciante's
    desire to use every effects pedal ever invented
    (potentially the primary motivation for making this a
    double album).</p><p>
    
    Isolated to the occasional compulsory workout, these
    excesses could be ignored, but when they slip into the
    over-long outros of straightforward
    soon-to-be-singles, the band's lack of perspective is
    obvious. Rubin, producing his fifth consecutive RHCP
    release, appears unwilling or unable to push the band
    into any kind of challenging territory, settling for
    inserting a great treated-drum breakdown in the middle
    of ""Readymade"" that he'll probably mine the next time
    Jay-Z rings him up. Brief moments where the band
    takes on a new identity, like the Fleetwood Mac-style
    finale of ""Wet Sand"", are fleeting, while other experiments (the
    spoken-word of ""Death of a Martian"", the bizarre
    background vocals of ""Animal Bar"") simply derail right
    as soon as they leave the station.</p><p>
    
    Maybe the Mac are an appropriate guidepost for the
    Chili Peppers, potential guides for how to sublimate a once-renowned rhythm
    section into slick California contempo-pop-- hell, they even made a similarly uneven
    double album! But keeping one foot in the funk of their
    origins and becoming mired in muso leanings is a
    ball and chain for the band's current incarnation as
    radio-pop darlings, a period that has now lasted twice
    as long as their goofball early days. By
    trying to incorporate all these personas, <em>Stadium
    Arcadium</em> can't help but grow as distended as the name
    suggests, revealing a band too proud to merely play
    the game they've already solved or use the added space
    to risk a less worn path. </p></div>"|6710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6710-stadium-arcadium/|4.7|Rob Mitchum

The band once split the difference between OR's frontman Will Shelf and keyboardist Jonathan Meiburg, each pulling 50/50 songwriting duties. You may wonder where Sheff has gone on this record, but you won't miss him. The push-pull between Sheff's croaking and Meiburg's lilting falsetto is gone, forcing the less-experienced vocalist to dial it up and find newfound strength in his vocals. With Meiburg in charge, Shearwater make several leaps from their previous albums: Did you want stark backwater hymns with PJ Harvey-levels of catharsis? <em>Palo Santo</em> has that (opener ""La Dame at La Licorne""). Hiss-soaked tributes to some heretofore lost or imagined side of the radio dial à la M. Ward? That's here, too (""Palo Santo"" and ""Sing, Little Birdie""). Even if mid-tempo Bruce Hornsby piano ballads are your bag, Meiburg has that nailed down (""Seventy-four, Seventy-five"" and ""Johnny Viola"".)</p><p>
    Those aren't even the highlights of <em>Palo Santo</em>. The records puts its best feet forward early: The banjo-plucked folk of ""Red Sea, Black Sea"" is overwhelmed by a strange backward pulse of keyboards throughout the verses, recalling the Southern Gothic twinge of R.E.M.'s early material. It's then lifted by sparse but stern percussion and Meiburg's ranting vocal turn in the chorus, powerful but frayed on every edge. That keyboard throb pushes the song one notch further into uncomfortability, building a sense of impending danger, but it's Meiburg's voice that makes you want to hear it again (and again). ""White Waves"" is perhaps where Sheff could have sat in on a duet, but instead makes for a rather catchy moment of schizophrenia. Meiburg's falsetto promises he ""won't go traveling tonight,"" and more chillingly, ""there's something singing in the ice in the deepest part of the wood."" That's before the song sprouts an unexpected riff, a few chords lurching back and forth in syncopation, while his voice bursts and implores himself not to go over the guitars that rise and vanish at the whim of Meiburg's wavering delivery.</p><p>
    While Meiburg's voice and a guitar, piano or banjo are at the center of most of these tracks, the instrumentation has suddenly fallen into place, intuitive now where it once diverted attention from previous albums' monotonous mood. <em>Palo Santo</em> is no less dark, certainly, but the songs breathe and swell much more naturally, with some of Meiburg's sharpest melodies yet. The more fragile arrangements from the Shearwater of old appear now and again, but where you'd once expect an intimate performance, songs like ""Palo Santo"" hint at empty space beneath that's nearly bottomless. Will Sheff has been writing narrative songs for years, but Jonathan Meiburg has written the soundtrack worthy of his own, or anyone's, images.</p></div>"|7105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7105-palo-santo/|7.6|Jason Crock

    music presents any significant descriptive challenges, it's just the first
    time I've ever been unsure of who I'm writing about. I mean, it's not every
    week that you receive a new CD by Creeper Lagoon, only to be suddenly told
    by the band that they're about to change their name to Painbirds, only to
    have them realize that it was already claimed by some alt-country band and,
    rather than finding another Sparklehorse song to name themselves after,
    revert to their original moniker. So, Creeper Lagoon it still is, until
    another e-mail tells me otherwise.</p><p>
    
    But the confusion is oddly appropriate-- Creeper Lagoon always struck me as
    a band with a bit of an identity crisis, punted around from roster to roster
    (the Dust Brothers' Nickelbag imprint, Dreamworks, the Arena Rock Recording
    Company) like a reliable but unloved utility infielder. Their history is one
    marked by bad timing, emerging in an era when WB teen-soap music supervisors
    were still cutting checks to Paula Cole instead of Death Cab. The band's
    winsome 1998 full-length, <em>I Become Small and Go</em>, massaged plaintive,
    post-Pavement songwriting with burbling, Dust Brothers-grafted
    techno-sonics, though not flagrantly enough to beat the Postal Service to
    the electro-emo party by five years. Then, as per indie rock rite of
    passage, Creeper Lagoon made an over-produced, underperforming major-label
    debut, <em>Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday</em>, which dropped into the
    pre-Strokes alt-rock void of early 2001 and took the band down with it; by
    year's end, co-founding multi-instrumentalist Sharky Laguana was forced to
    assemble an entirely new line-up. A low-key EP (<em>Remember the Future</em>) for Arena Rock
    arrived in 2002, and it seemed for a while as if the Creeper Lagoon only appeared in second-hand CD shops and as a ""Related
    Artists"" link for people doing online Beck searches.</p><p> 
    
    But even if the name stays the same, <em>Long Dry Cold</em> attempts a clean break
    from Creeper Lagoon's cursed career trajectory: Opener ""Henry Ford""
    begins with startling analog synth-tones before yielding a sunshower of
    Manitoban acoustic-guitar glitches and Rachel Lastimosa's processed,
    blissed-out vocal sighs. But while these amoebic lullabies bear scant resemblance to the Creeper Lagoon that emerged almost a decade ago, its Sunday-morning psychedelia was anticipated by <em>Remember the Future</em> tracks like ""Kisses and Pills"", which closely followed the
    slackadasical strums of Pink Floyd's ""Fearless"". <em>Long Dry Cold</em> works from a
    similar stoner-folk base, but constructs it with the click of a mouse rather
    than the pluck of a string; acoustic guitars and hazy harmonies may be the
    most prominent elements here, but the multi-layered splendor of tracks like
    ""Jimmy Robertello"" render these most familiar devices as refreshingly alien
    sound forms.</p><p>
<em>Long Dry Cold</em>'s 13 tracks appear in a uniformly dreamlike blur that can
    work to the album's detriment; aside from ""Henry Ford""'s impressive opening
    salvo, the sequencing seems random and haphazard, establishing little in the
    way of track-to-track tension. You also wish Laguana and Lastimosa
    would treat their vocals less as texture and poke their heads through the
    haze more often (as the late-set charmer ""Nothing as It's Going to Be"" is
    brave enough to do). But in a world where Nada Surf commands respect 10
    years after being written off as an alt-rock one-hit wonder, surely Creeper
    Lagoon-- new name or no-- have earned their chance at a second coming.</p></div>"|1665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1665-long-dry-cold/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Unlikely combinations abound: banjos prancing atop accordions one minute, pedal steel floating over crunching distortion on the title track alone; ""Watch the Days Slowly Fade"" uses copious amounts of radio static on what's their poppiest song yet. Despite all the jumping around, <em>A Gilded Age</em> meshes surprisingly well and retains the band's vintage fetish, so even modern touches like the distorted lead guitar in ""We Were All Saints"" smell of musk and mothballs. </i></p><p>
    
    Two of these eight tracks first appeared on Norfolk &amp; Western's self-released 2005 album, <em>If You Were Born Overseas</em>. Given its ambitious instrumentation, <i>A Gilded Age may seem like a new beginning, but it really just extends last year's baby steps, and these fleshed-out arrangements still sound pretty twee. (Seltzer's percussionist and songwriting foil is Rachel Blumberg of the Decemberists, whose lead on ""Minor Daughter"" is every bit as precious and creepy as an eyeless porcelain doll).</i></p><p> 
    
    The bigger sound isn't always best: the careful pace and slow strumming of opener ""Porch Destruction"" are well suited to Selzer's laconic delivery, but the strings feel punched in and suffocate an otherwise excellent track. Indeed, Selzer's voice loses some of its gravity amongst all these new toys; in more forced moments of genre blending, like the doo-wop chorus between the maritime song-story verses of ""Clyde &amp; New Orleans"", Norfolk &amp; Western come across like teens looting their grandparents' wardrobes. When the songs work, as with the impossibly gentle ""A Voice Through the Wall"", it's precisely because Selzer's voice carries them through. </p><p>
    
    Even with the booklet's brief explanations for each song, I wonder if Selzer is more concerned with buttressing his band's sound than having something to say. The shift in focus is understandable, and the brevity of an EP is the perfect place to explore new territory, but it feels like Norfolk &amp; Western are still building towards something grand without making any bold declarations.</p></div>"|5891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5891-a-gilded-age-ep/|6.7|Jason Crock

It's the most exciting thing I've heard this year. At the tail end of the disc, there's ""The Last Time"", where the beat splits the difference between disco-era funk and roller-skating jam, and Cee-Lo sings like he borrowed some time-traveling platform shoes from the Delfonics' closet and wound up on mid-1970s <i>Soul Train</i>. You shouldn't fixate on those details-- I may be exaggerating-- but the main thing about those two tracks are that they sound awfully fresh. Play this when people are over and they'll almost certainly ask the question: ""So who <i>is</i> this, anyway?""</p><p>
    
    I don't mean to spin any big theories on you-- this isn't that kind of record-- but let's stop for a second and notice the context. Now that hip-hop has nearly three decades under its belt, every major genre of American pop music is more or less ""mature."" You know how rock geeks, after nine or 10 years immersed in the genre, start looking elsewhere for surprises-- hip-hop, dance, bluegrass, anything they haven't already figured out? Well, these days we can read Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee telling <i>Tape Op</i> that rap is all repetitive big business now, and claiming that alternative rock is where the innovation is-- in other words, sounding not unlike an old rock guy wondering why bands still sound like the Velvet Underground. This kind of uneasiness isn't new, of course, but it's interesting: It seems like there's a big itch out there right now, everyone looking for ways to make the music feel as new and free as it did when they first came across it.</p><p>
    
    Two guys interested in scratching that itch, hip-hop-wise, are both associates in Atlanta's Dungeon Family. Andre 3000, of Outkast: It might seem like he's just trying to be weird, but the guy has spent the last decade visibly searching for some new way to be-- not just new music, but a whole new model of identity for the black male musician. (Avenues he's tried include futurism, mysticism, Baduism, sincerity, dandified couture, genre-less chart hits, and close study of Aphex Twin.) The same goes for Cee-Lo, one half of the Gnarls Barkley duo-- a Goodie Mob rapper turned funk freak and soul-shouting faux preacherman.</p><p>
    
    Who does Gnarls Barkley pair him with, the two of them dressed up like Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> droogs, or Wayne and Garth? DJ Danger Mouse, a guy known by undie-rap geeks for his own beats but read-about-in-<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> for mashing up Jay-Z and the Beatles. The two of them: They're trying something new here, you know. Even the lyrical themes of this album-- madness, depression, monsters, visionaries, being yourself-- seem like conscious attempts to be arty. And that's <em>before</em> you get to the tossed-off Violent Femmes cover. Which is only track four.</p><p>
    
    Don't get me wrong: This is not some grand genre-busting mission statement. For the most part, it sounds like two guys playing around and having fun, sometimes more fun than the listener. DM's production aesthetic-- ""if it's enjoyable for more than 2 minutes and 10 seconds, then that's the song to me""-- means the beats come out like candies in a box, a line of little treats and mini-ideas. (Pick some samples, make them bump a little, move on.) Cee-Lo sounds like he's writing in the vocal booth, just hopping in and singing his takes until something good develops. But as scattershot and weirdly limp as parts of this are-- two guys just knocking things together, seeing what happens-- well, it feels better to hear someone trying.</p><p>
    
    And the treats are real treats. The single, ""Crazy"", has been found atop UK charts (and on U.S. television dramas), for all the same reasons that Outkast's ""Hey Ya"" hit big-- it's a big, brash pop song that sounds retro and modern at the same time. ""Transformer"" is a tweaked-out jumble with the pace and clatter of English grime, plus flutes. There's traditional r&amp;b; bump, ""cinematic"" darkness for the monster stories, DM's dusty-sample boom-bap. ""Just a Thought"" has Cee-Lo experiencing crisis over classical guitar and bursts of overdriven drums: ""I've tried/ Everything but suicide/ And it's crossed my mind/ But I'm fine.""</p><p>
    
    Imagine: Two guys fooling around with whatever sticks, musically, and yet here's Cee-Lo, sounding as convincing as possible in his best reverend soul-voice, writing serious and sincere about life. It's a joy, and in this context, where unselfconscious freshness can feel strangely hard to come by, it'll charm the hell out of a whole lot of people-- whether or not it'll really stand up to more than a season's listening.</p></div>"|3693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3693-st-elsewhere/|7.7|Nitsuh Abebe

An appropriately titled record, <em>Logic</em> was keen and calculating: Weighing the commercial potential of brooding, atmospheric gloom-rock during the halcyon days of Interpol, just when bands like Joy Division and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen were rotating to the top of the nostalgia cycle, the Stills subscribed to the notion that precise, cerebral guitar-rock could be heart-wrenching when paired with tender, immaculate vocals. Frontman Tim Fletcher had the pipes for the job, and his voice, dappling a landscape of craggy guitars and gently insistent beats, made <em>Logic</em> a dark and glittering vacuum that, at its best, could suck all the air from a room.</p><p>
    
    Detractors might prefer <em>Without Feathers</em>, a much different record than its predecessor, albeit one equally deserving of its title. Much looser and sparser than <em>Logic</em>, <em>Without Feathers</em> hunkers down in the dirt and scratches around with clipped-wing exuberance, instead of soaring somewhere high and remote. If I read anyone comparing it to Interpol, I'm going to start believing what the kids say on the message boards when someone disses their favorite band-- the critic must not have even listened to the record. Where <em>Logic</em> couched its mawkishness in a sumptuous, shadowy mantle of sophistication, <em>Feathers</em> lets it all hang out: The jaunty pianos and major key leads, Fletcher's openly maudlin lyrics, and his cheerful/wistful phrasing all downplay the aching drama of <em>Logic</em> in favor of a peppy enthusiasm.</p><p>
    
    The change is evident from the first song, the cheerfully galloping ""In the Beginning"". Pianos plink with abandon over a hitch-and-gallop rhythm guitar; a bright lead skims through the mix like a day-glo Frisbee; former drummer Dave Hamelin (the band's primary songwriter) belts out winningly mawkish platitudes (""a hero never turns around"") like he means them-- which, by God, he probably does. ""The Mountain"" crashes dizzyingly in the vein of <em>Logic</em>, but the vocals retain none of that album's simper, boldly asserting itself above the fray. ""Destroyer"" shines with a sprightly brass section, while ""Oh Shoplifter"" bristles with handclaps and iridescent organs. Other songs are more melancholy in character, like ""In the End"", with its imperious piano phrases and balladeering. ""She's Walking Out"" drifts and shimmers: ""We'll leave in a balloon,"" Hamelin fancifully asserts, sounding like Julian Casablancas fronting the Walkmen. <em>Feathers</em> seems less a continuation of <em>Logic</em> than a valuable complement, cheerful and heartfelt as the latter was somber and stylized.</p></div>"|7719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7719-without-feathers/|6.7|Brian Howe

Which makes the act of rounding up exclusive tracks from the various volumes onto a single unmixed CD a perverse exercise in missing-the-point. And yet, it's also long overdue: Deliberately spotlighting DJ/artist polymaths since its early days, the series has stipulated that participating selectors contribute at least one exclusive song to their mix.</p><p>
    Given its brevity, this single-disc release could afford to be more comprehensive: In fact, in some senses the selection appears downright revisionist. Repressing the existence of the more intensely physical techno-flavored mixes from the mid-90s, <em>The Exclusives</em> belatedly includes Carl Craig's ""DJ-KICKS"", a marvelous slice of disquieting tech-drama, as a bonus track-- of course, it's the album's highlight. But perhaps !K7 simply recognizes on which side its bread is buttered: whereas the Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister and Thievery Corporation volumes are legitimately hailed as stoner classics, excellent early mixes from Stacey Pullen and Claude Young languish in techno-purist obscurity.</p><p>
    Consequently, <em>The Exclusives</em> offers a survey of the imprint's middle-period focus on trip-hop and downbeat, also swerving through xFC-jazz as well as modish recent ventures into electroclash and nouveau disco. Inevitably, the torpid, head-nodding grooves which open the disc now seem a bit myopic and quaint, but by-and-large the contributors were either the best in their field or rose to the challenge-- even DJ Cam's inferior noir-by-numbers ""Bronx Theme"" is more enjoyable than it has any right to be. And it's nice, too, how the compilation's chronological tracklisting traces the increasingly diverse yet brief late-1990s trip-hop cul de sac fading to a distant memory as the disc winds to a close.</p><p>
    The series has always cannily favored selectors whose aesthetic is eclectic but distinctive, so it's interesting to note how each artist's contribution provides a skeleton key to his entire mix: Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister's smoky and shuffling ""Black Baby"" is archetypal K&amp;D;, while the rolling piano and plaintive vocals on Erlend Øye's ""The Black Keys Work"" handily compresses his volume's explorations of bittersweet pop and halcyon European house. Tracks by artists such as Viktor Duplaix (lush xFC-jazz r&amp;b;), Chicken Lips (wonky vocal disco), and the Glimmers (boiling psych-house) are all likewise simultaneously top-notch and revealing. Only Tiga and Annie (ironically, two artists more feted for their compositions than their mixing skills) fail to do their own mixes-- or general oeuvres-- justice with their slightly gimmicky contributions.</p><p>
    Of course, <em>The Exclusives</em> isn't really a substitute for the mixes themselves, and the best DJ Kicks compilations (hint: Playgroup) remain more captivating by dint of their incongruous organic unity and largesse of vision, the inspired games of sonic join-the-dots that the mix format allows. Perhaps this will appeal most to people at either ends of the spectrum: completists and dilettantes daunted by the voluminous DJ Kicks back-catalogue. But beyond these pragmatic functions, <em>The Exclusives</em> is most interesting for providing a sort of meta-narrative to a series which has privileged itself for being at the forefront of hi-tech easy listening: a panorama landscape shot of ripples crossing the surface of cool.</p></div>"|2119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2119-dj-kicks-the-exclusives/|7.2|Tim Finney

    conglomerating via the darkest depths of their fiery imaginations, so does
    the combined force of drummer Zack Hill (Hella, Team Sleep, Nervous Cop)
    and guitarist Mick Barr (Octis, Orthrelm, Quix*o*tic). Like Patton's Fantômas, Hill and Barr flutter between hyper-intense speed metal and jittery, apocalyptic soundscapes. Their creations are
    linear but no less dense or persistent in delivery, and the overall
    result of their debut release, <em>Shred Earthship</em>, is like having thousands
    of tiny needles dropped into your ear drums from a great
    height.</p><p>
    Hill and Barr give themselves so much space and freedom for experimentation on <em>Shred
    Earthship</em> that they extend their distinctive, instrumental prowess even further than with their main projects. Barr's ruthlessly shredding harmonic
    solos weave the thick tapestry of the tracks, while Hill himself
    has said that ""this album tops any level of playing I've ever done on a
    record""-- a pretty major statement considering that the self-taught
    musician has been responsible for some of the most remarkable
    heavy drumming of the past five years.</p><p>
    For the most part, <em>Shred Earthship</em> consists of disheveled rhythms smoldering with death metal influences but not actually flirting with any
    obvious techniques. It's more like Hill and Barr reduce the elements of
    the genre to its core-- focusing on the bare bones of style yet still
    keeping things bafflingly intricate. Hill's low-tuned drums and flighty
    footwork hold the flow throughout the record, and although Barr appears to
    be wary of straying too far into melodic zones, his licks never seem
    repetitive or stodgy; on some occasions, the duo sound like a less
    riffy but more intensely manic version of Sleep.</p><p>
    Because both musicians are familiar with playing in duos (Hill in Hella,
    and the Ladies with Robert Crow of Pinback; Barr in Orthrelm and
    Crom-Tech), they're used to staving off the potential thinness in sound of a two-man setup. Here they accomplish this through compositional sensitivity and an extraordinary range of
    manual and electronic effects. The end result of this rhythmic workout is
    an all-encompassing blast of broken cymbals, unexpected but wildly
    textured amp glitches, and effervescent noises that twist and jerk like a
    well-built yet surprisingly agile beast.</p></div>"|4037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4037-shred-earthship/|6.8|Mia Lily Clarke

And as evidenced by 2003's <em>Antipop Consortium Vs. Matthew Shipp</em>, the Blue Series' cross-textual platform appears to be a perfect fit for former Antipop iconoclast Beans and his tweaked, non-linear trajectory. So it seems natural that for his third full-length solo album, Beans has returned to Thirsty Ear and enlisted the heavyweight jazz rhythm section of bassist William Parker and drummer Hamid Drake to operate in a stripped-down, post-bop trio format.</p><p>
    
    Given Beans' absurdist, loose-wired tongue and the adventurous, often radical discographies of his sidemen one might reasonably expect <em>Only</em> to ignite some serious non-idiomatic free-form fireworks. Instead, the three musicians choose to maintain a cordial distance, and their resulting electro-funk collaborations generally fizzle into the same vague, middling inconsistency which has too often plagued Beans' solo work.</p><p>
    
    Beans has long been one of hip-hop's most genuinely inscrutable eccentrics, an impression magnified here by the decision to identify each of <em>Only</em>'s songs by a seemingly random number rather than a title. In a way this makes perfect elliptical sense, as none of these tracks contain recognizable choruses or lyrical hooks to the extent of previous Beans retro-futurist transmissions like ""Mutescreamer"" or ""Structure Tone"". In fact, more than half of the tracks here are either entirely or predominantly instrumental, concentrating an unwise degree of attention on Beans' light-fingered production rather than his loopy, open-streaming lyrical flow.</p><p> 
    
    This approach does allow Parker to own the opening ""5"", first by drawing a subtle bowstring and then lumbering into a rubbery double-bass line, while Drake adds deft accompaniment with Meters-like precision. On this track and the dub-figured ""1"", Beans' contributions are almost invisible, as he uses a low-tech assortment of electronics to scribble in the margins. As the album progresses, however, the music's limited palette begins to unduly handcuff the rhythm section, and on longer tracks like the inconsequential ""20"" Parker and Drake jog in place as if waiting for Beans to make something happen, playing foursquare beats that could've been generated by any two available session guys.</p><p> 
    
    When Beans does find occasion to open his mouth, he immediately goes on the defensive to preemptively disarm his critics. ""Patron saints of mediocrity/ attempt at mocking me?"" he asks incredulously on ""198"", before declaring himself ""your baby girl's backside-splitter."" He does get down to some vintage rapid-fire, surrealist boasting on ""4"" (with one-liners like ""Got you wearing an expression like a burst balloon"" or ""I spill enough blood to paint a house"") although at points his vocal timbre and brusque delivery can come to bear a rather alarming resemblance to Wesley Willis. But this entertaining, if typically bewildering, vocal barrage is the exception on <em>Only</em>, an album of missed opportunities that illustrates the widening disconnect between Beans' maverick self-image and the actual potency of his muddled, scattershot creations.</p></div>"|605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/605-only/|5.9|Matthew Murphy

In the three closing years of the 1970s, the English quartet had one of the     greatest opening runs of any band, shifting to post-punk before punk began to go stale and forging three masterpieces in a     creative furnace so hot it burned out by the end of 1980. Those     albums-- <i>Pink Flag</i>, <i>Chairs Missing</i>, and <i>154</i>-- still sound remarkably fresh,     and have been re-mastered and reissued with their original vinyl tracklistings, both individually and as part of a five-disc set, <i>1977&gt;1979</i>, that also includes live performances recorded in London (in 1977) and New York (1978).</p>
<p><i>Pink Flag</i> was a fractured snapshot of punk alternately     collapsing in on itself and exploding into song-fragment shrapnel. The     record's minimalist approach means the band spends only as much time as needed on each     song-- five of them are over in less than a minute, while a     further nine don't make it past two. It's clear you're not getting a typical 1977 punk record from the opening seconds of ""Reuters"", an echoing bass     line that quickly comes under attack by ringing but dissonant guitar chords.     The tempo is arrested, lurching along to the climactic finale when Colin     Newman, as the narrating correspondent, shouts ""Looting! Burning!"" and then     holds out the lone syllable of ""rape"" twice over descending chords, which     grind to a halt over chanting voices. It's all the bombast, tension, and     release of a side-long prog opus in just three minutes.</p>
<p>As if to underscore that this isn't a predictable     album, the next song, ""Field Day For the Sundays"", rages to a close in just 28 seconds. The band     acknowledges the thin line between advertising jingles and pop songs on the     49-second instrumental ""The Commercial"", but also write a few     genuinely hummable songs, like ""Three Girl Rhumba"", whose guitar part is     actually more of a tango, and the more     identifiably punk ""Ex-Lion Tamer"". ""Strange,"" meanwhile, makes the mistake     of sticking around, only to be eaten by spacey amp noise and quivering     ambience-- a taste of things to come.</p>
<p>Wire immediately left the crunch of <i>Pink Flag</i> behind on <i>Chairs     Missing</i>, 1978's great leap into even artier weirdness and Brian Eno-inspired     ambient experiments. Producer Mike Thorne's synthesizers took a more key     role, propelling songs into haunting soundscapes and downpours of noise. The     funny thing is that, though a fairly major departure for the band, the album     cloaks its curveball up front, beginning as <i>Pink     Flag</i> did: With bassist Graham Lewis's nakedly produced pulse being     attacked by guitars. ""Practise Makes Perfect"" seems almost cheekily     named for the way it builds directly on the constant crescendo structure of     ""Reuters"", except this time Newman's ragged vocal is met with     interjections of derisive laughter and the final comedown leads into a bed     of gently viscous synth.</p>
<p>That denouement foreshadows one of the album's most arresting     tracks, the starkly minimal bass-and-electronics sculpture ""Heartbeat"", an     openly beautiful piece of experimentation that morphs into a pop     song without a chorus. The album as a whole is less purposefully fragmented than its predecessor,     the songs more conventionally structured even as they veer in     unexpected directions. The stunning centerpiece is ""Mercy"", which provides the basic blueprint for an absolute ton of tension/release     post-rock. Over nearly six minutes, it storms through thunderous verses with     Robert Gotobed's drums shuddering away underneath. Each new section     leads to a nastier climax, culminating in a blazing guitar-and-drum     conflagration.</p>
<p>On 1979's <i>154</i>, named for the number of shows Wire had played to that point,     the band moved further into the abstract. ""On Returning"", ""The 15th"", and ""Two People     in a Room"" are concise, punchy songs that place the vocals up front,     sometimes with two-part harmonies. The last of these is one of Wire's great,     frenzied moments, with Newman's tortured vocals shouting down Bruce     Gilbert's intravenous guitar riffs with crazed shouts of ""My God, they're so     gifted!"" <i>154</i>'s centerpiece, ""A Touching Display"", out-apocalypses ""Mercy""; it's a hellish soundscape that features Lewis' heavily     distorted and processed bass fretting out a harrowing anti-melody. Despite     the incredible highs, though, <i>154</i> is also the least consistent of Wire's     first three albums, and a few of its experiments don't bear full fruit.</p>
<p>One of Wire's overlooked strengths was their ability to write a tremendous pop song, as exemplified by songs like ""Mannequin"", ""Outdoor Miner"", and ""Map Ref. 41 Degrees N 93 Degrees W"" (an     open field in Iowa, by the way). Listen to the harmonized ""ooh ooh""s on ""Mannequin"", the softly sung verses of ""Outdoor Miner"" (which was only prevented from chart success by a payola scandal), and the transcendently huge chorus of ""Map Ref."" indicate this was a band that could have made an entire career out of harmony-laden power pop.</p>
<p>As it stands, they didn't, and Wire famously quit a year after <i>154</i>, claiming     to have run out of ideas. Their subsequent reunions have put the lie to that     notion, but you have to admire Wire's insistence on laying off when the inspiration doesn't feel right, even as the band's initial run remains an unassailable testament to its unquenchable creativity.</p>

The tempo is arrested, lurching along to the climactic finale when Colin     Newman, as the narrating correspondent, shouts ""Looting! Burning!"" and then     holds out the lone syllable of ""rape"" twice over descending chords, which     grind to a halt over chanting voices. It's all the bombast, tension, and     release of a side-long prog opus in just three minutes.</p>
<p>As if to underscore that this isn't a predictable     album, the next song, ""Field Day For the Sundays"", rages to a close in just 28 seconds. The band     acknowledges the thin line between advertising jingles and pop songs on the     49-second instrumental ""The Commercial"", but also write a few     genuinely hummable songs, like ""Three Girl Rhumba"", whose guitar part is     actually more of a tango, and the more     identifiably punk ""Ex-Lion Tamer"". ""Strange,"" meanwhile, makes the mistake     of sticking around, only to be eaten by spacey amp noise and quivering     ambience-- a taste of things to come.</p>
<p>Wire immediately left the crunch of <i>Pink Flag</i> behind on <i>Chairs     Missing</i>, 1978's great leap into even artier weirdness and Brian Eno-inspired     ambient experiments. Producer Mike Thorne's synthesizers took a more key     role, propelling songs into haunting soundscapes and downpours of noise. The     funny thing is that, though a fairly major departure for the band, the album     cloaks its curveball up front, beginning as <i>Pink     Flag</i> did: With bassist Graham Lewis's nakedly produced pulse being     attacked by guitars. ""Practise Makes Perfect"" seems almost cheekily     named for the way it builds directly on the constant crescendo structure of     ""Reuters"", except this time Newman's ragged vocal is met with     interjections of derisive laughter and the final comedown leads into a bed     of gently viscous synth.</p>
<p>That denouement foreshadows one of the album's most arresting     tracks, the starkly minimal bass-and-electronics sculpture ""Heartbeat"", an     openly beautiful piece of experimentation that morphs into a pop     song without a chorus. The album as a whole is less purposefully fragmented than its predecessor,     the songs more conventionally structured even as they veer in     unexpected directions. The stunning centerpiece is ""Mercy"", which provides the basic blueprint for an absolute ton of tension/release     post-rock. Over nearly six minutes, it storms through thunderous verses with     Robert Gotobed's drums shuddering away underneath. Each new section     leads to a nastier climax, culminating in a blazing guitar-and-drum     conflagration.</p>
<p>On 1979's <i>154</i>, named for the number of shows Wire had played to that point,     the band moved further into the abstract. ""On Returning"", ""The 15th"", and ""Two People     in a Room"" are concise, punchy songs that place the vocals up front,     sometimes with two-part harmonies. The last of these is one of Wire's great,     frenzied moments, with Newman's tortured vocals shouting down Bruce     Gilbert's intravenous guitar riffs with crazed shouts of ""My God, they're so     gifted!"" <i>154</i>'s centerpiece, ""A Touching Display"", out-apocalypses ""Mercy""; it's a hellish soundscape that features Lewis' heavily     distorted and processed bass fretting out a harrowing anti-melody. Despite     the incredible highs, though, <i>154</i> is also the least consistent of Wire's     first three albums, and a few of its experiments don't bear full fruit.</p>
<p>One of Wire's overlooked strengths was their ability to write a tremendous pop song, as exemplified by songs like ""Mannequin"", ""Outdoor Miner"", and ""Map Ref. 41 Degrees N 93 Degrees W"" (an     open field in Iowa, by the way). Listen to the harmonized ""ooh ooh""s on ""Mannequin"", the softly sung verses of ""Outdoor Miner"" (which was only prevented from chart success by a payola scandal), and the transcendently huge chorus of ""Map Ref."" indicate this was a band that could have made an entire career out of harmony-laden power pop.</p>
<p>As it stands, they didn't, and Wire famously quit a year after <i>154</i>, claiming     to have run out of ideas. Their subsequent reunions have put the lie to that     notion, but you have to admire Wire's insistence on laying off when the inspiration doesn't feel right, even as the band's initial run remains an unassailable testament to its unquenchable creativity.</p>

Frog Eyes shouldn't be accused of front-loading their     releases, but even without conjuring gnomes and cups filled with     blood, their openers shine extravagantly bright. <i>The Bloody Hand</i>'s ""Sound Travels From the Snow to the Dark"" alchemically transforms David Bowie's ""Spaceman"" into an earthy power ballad, and <i>The Golden River</i> is jumpstarted by ""One in Six Children Will Flee in Boats"", an acoustic-to-baroque dustpan anthem.</p>
<p>Since <i>The Bloody Hand</i>, Frog Eye's 2002 debut, Mercer's brainy <i>Ziggy     Stardust</i>-meets-<i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> sound has proven maddeningly inspired. Mercer attacks each     syllable in his gothic libretto with such gusto that even if he wasn't saying anything interesting his exuberance would still be enough to draw a crowd. Lucky for those of us who dig language, he doesn't half-step;     in fact, unpacking his dark, fantastical scenery and     swamp-stomp poetry requires close reading and, perhaps, a     working knowledge of Latin.</p>
<p>I'm not saying anything new: Mercer, along with drummer Melanie     Campbell, bassist Mike Rak, and keyboardist Grayson Walker, have been     an established force for a few years, gaining a wider audience with     2004's less magical <i>The Folded Palm</i>. Still, you get the feeling that     for many, the Victoria, B.C. quartet remains no more than a name     dropped by Wolf Parade when its members are asked to list their     favorite contemporary musicians. As Daniel Johnston or the Vaselines know, a ringing endorsement from a younger, more popular artist can draw new listeners, which is just one of a dozen or so reasons why     it's nice to have these early, hard to find but absolutely essential     albums reissued by Absolutely Kosher. And man, did they ever bring     them back with triple-fat style.</p>
<p>If you consider yourself a longtime diehard, keep reading, because     there's more than enough extra material appended to make old friends     shine like new. Showing an attention to detail, the label     and band decided to place a 30-second pause before the bonus     tracks on each album-- this way, theory goes, the extras seem     self-contained and not like a run-on sentence.</p>
<p>Anyhow, once <i>The Golden River</i>'s 11 tracks end, 12 additional     songs more than double the listening experience. The reinforcements     were culled from the ""Emboldened Navigator"" 7"" (originally out on     Brooklyn's excellent Soft Abuse label) and a wonderfully raw,     previously unreleased recording session with Wolf Parade/Sunset     Rubdown's Spencer Krug on keyboards.</p>
<p>Steely-eyed completists will note that <i>The Bloody     Hand</i>'s ""The Fruit That Fell From the Tree"" is here as ""The Fruit That     Ate Itself"" in homage to the Modest Mouse oldie. Take a gander at the     gruff, pokier version of the aforementioned ""One in Six Children Will     Flee In Boats"" (from <i>The Golden River</i>): Its crackles are lo-fi and pretty until Mercer sharpens his surroundings. ""Libertatia's National Lullaby"", a melancholic distorto/spring-reverb closer, is another repeat. Parsing every minor repetition or hiccup requires a flow chart (mine's been kept in glittery crayon), so you can do the math on the rest of that.</p>
<p>While reviewing Sunset Rubdown's LP, I deflected the Krug/Mercer comparisons, but it's increasingly difficult to let them slide. Not only does <i>The     Golden River</i> reinscribe the Krug session, but instrumental track     ""A Song Once Mine Now No Longer Mine"" shows up on Sunset Rubdown's     debut as ""Sol's Song"". Then, more obviously, there's ""Spencer's Song     For Carey to Officially Sing"" and the new Canadian supergroup Swan     Lake, in which the two are joined by Destroyer's Dan Bejar. Critical difference: Like Krug, Mercer has one of those voices. Unlike Krug, his backup band doesn't always sweep-- it occasionally gargles. The more staid backing band calls for more acrobatics in a singer's delivery-- as a wise Pitchfork staffer put it, Krug acts like a monster, Mercer, in fact, is one. A humane monster, of course, like John Gardner's Grendel.</p>
<p>The newfangled version of <i>The Bloody Hand</i> is just as jammed. Here,     it's buffered by <i>Seagulls Is on the Rise</i>, the until now unreleased sophomore album from Mercer and bassist Mike Rak's pre-Frog Eyes band, the Blue Pine. The material feels a bit aimless, less distinguished, and is generally mellower than Frog Eyes. There are compelling moments, though, like the Jarvis Cocker-like crooning on ""Buttercup"", the paper-shredding guitar solo on ""Tyranny of Sight and Tyranny of Seeing"", and the stuck-in-quicksand and sloshed on whiskey     power-sad closer ""Before They Was Killed in a Car Crash"", which goes     out with some full-on psychedelic, hurricane noise. (Tellingly, a few     tracks before it is ""Drinking: The Song"").</p>
<p>Whatever the peaks and valleys, these fresh-faced reissues were     intended both as a build-up for Frog Eyes' next full-length as well as     a way to bring the original trilogy (as Mercer views it) to a     definitive close. They succeed in providing the     latter, but according to sources close to the band, album four, <i>Tears     of the Valedictorian</i>, has been pushed back until early 2007. Please,     though, no worries: Until then, there's a 19-minute     single-song EP forthcoming on the Spanish label Acuarela and, more     substantially, these super-stocked reissues.</p></div>"|11743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11743-the-bloody-hand-the-golden-river/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

The moody, slow-release fuzz-rock of last year's self-titled full-length wasn't particularly raucous outside of a couple headbangers like ""Friends Are Evil"". There's still plenty of that patented guitar crunch here, but <em>Silver</em> exhibits a stronger sense of melody, as if the syrupy haze froze a bit and in the process created something more crystalline. The title track neatly posits, ""Silver's just another gold""; this EP manages to immerse such precious-metal glimmer into the mire.</p><p>
    
    Separating the compositions into component parts, the most noticeable difference is Broadrick's voice. Placed effects-free above the swirly fray of the first two tracks, it accrues disembodied distortion and layers as the EP progresses. At the bare, early moments, this legend from Godflesh and Techno Animal actually sounds like Blake Schwarzenbach. Well, if the Jawbreaker/Jets to Brazil heartbreaker found himself on a serious downer tip, gazing at untied shoelaces, fronting the seismic heaviness of Khanate.</p><p>
    
    Shake your heads if you want, but ""Star"" sounds especially like <em>Dear You</em>-era Jawbreaker in its opening bars, particularly Broadrick's vocal rhythms (""It won't be so hard/ Not for you/ Not you"") and in the build toward anti-crescendo. Instrumentally? Not so much: Broadrick's bare, double-tracked voice-- at one point he almost loses his breath-- contrasts with the craggy background. In one channel, live drums battle with regal, wind-tunnel synth lines; in the other, a chattering drum machine kicks up dust with that requisite layer of lovely buzz.  While exhibiting a surprisingly clear pop sense, it's easy to see how this record follows from the past work, especially older songs like ""Tired of Me"". It's <em>that</em> Jesu structure we're talking about, differently mixed, processed, and augmented. </p><p>
    
    Beyond the vocal treatment, Broadrick's production is crisper. It's difficult to know how he fit more sounds into his already packed fog'n'smog soundscape, but that's exactly what he did. Throughout, each detail remains multi-dimensional. There are no 10-minute drone-rock pieces like ""Walk on Water"" or ""Sun Day"" because when he does aim for the epic or an open-ended swan song, as on ""Dead Eyes"", a skittering Postal Service-type drum machine palette chops each second into something gently but busily propulsive. And propulsion is key. If a formula could be written, it might be something akin to: sketch pop songs, restructure with Codeine dynamics, then drape in M83 minus the film dialogue and purple tendencies. </p><p>
    
    Just when it seems that dour, sugar-drenched slow-rock anthems are the new drone, ""Star"" flows into ""Wolves"", a darker, molasses-lugubrious ballad. Then, the slow rifts of synth, echo, vocoder, deep-freeze percussion, and guitar crunch on ""Wolves"" compliment nicely the backward laps and ricocheting beats of the following ""Dead Eyes"". At this point in the EP, the vocals are buried and robotic, as if the voice has shed its humanity in anticipation of the ending. Or maybe he's drowning, drifting out to sea in the gorgeous ambiance of the finale's diminishing industrial eddies. </p><p>
<i>Silver's only shortcoming is its length. The layers on each track are so interesting-- no matter how closely you look, it's impossible to spot the shadowy bottom surface-- that fans of backlit ambiance, dark metal, and Flying Saucer Attack circa ""My Dreaming Hill"" will be left wanting for more. Of course, wanting more is a compliment, and Broadrick was wise to keep the collection so brief and engaging. Still, greedy fuck that I am, I'd like more of this metallic beauty thing. Hell, as indie kids launch into their boring Sabbath, its great witnessing bands like Isis, Sunn 0))), Mouth of the Architect, Ocean, and Jesu etching distinctively pretty crosshatches into otherwise rumbling seas. It's the new metal baroque: Come on, dudes, continue to get gorgeous. </i></p></div>"|4353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4353-silver-ep/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

While retaining the EP's inchoate sound-- the clangorous mid-tempo guitars, incantatory vocals, and chiseled rhythms-- it's much poppier, more subtle, and subdued than its predecessor. Rahim's 1990s-style post-punk now traffics in airy lilt more than scraping ironclad drag; the same serrated dirge is infused with a weightless bounce. It's as if J. Robbins had skipped directly from from Jawbox's early Dischord albums to the more restrained Burning Airlines, or maybe what Q and Not U would have done had they stuck around for a few more years.</p><p> 
    
    Robbins did in fact produce this album, an ideal choice. Not only does Rahim owe a stylistic debt to Robbins' bands, his production style-- unfettered yet nuanced, with slightly fuzzy rhythm guitars, full-bodied bass, and crisply shimmering drums-- complements the restraint of the songwriting, holding each of its components in its own glittering suspension. Throughout the album, thick cords of elastic bass intertwine with silvery filaments of guitar. Droning calls and distorted responses drift up in hypnotic litanies. Sinuous keys diffuse through the burnt-out, hulking framework of the percussion. Concise drum breakdowns section off the music like a flexible grid. Each song pursues its individual character within the gestalt: ""10,000 Horses"", with its lightly slashing guitars and rolling beat, actually gallops like a horse, with grace, power, and control. ""Desire"" builds and breaks tension by juxtaposing sections of rumbling bass, careening guitar and loping drums with a staccato bump and eerie falsettos. And ""Forever Love"" is a straight pop song, with its dreamy vocals and idyllic, gently pinwheeling glide, although there's still a stabby breakdown in the middle of this scattering dandelion fluff, lest we forget what we're listening to.</p><p> 
    
    But what makes Rahim unique isn't their overall style; it's the tiny yet indispensable songwriting flourishes that lodge obdurately in the memory. It's how the step-by-step vocal line of ""KlangKlangKlang"" is mirrored by a twinkling chain of guitar notes; the mournful brass section that sounds like an old soul sample; the dark wave of bass and compressed drums that rolls in after a fillip of perfectly-placed hand percussion. It's the two brisk handclaps that launch ""Something From an Amputee"" into a cascade of chimes. It's the stutter at the end of the fluid organ phrase on ""Only Pure"", and the sparse cowbell reverberating through the astral harmonies. It's the Dismemberment Plannish organ whiz near the end of ""Forever Love"", and the gym-class whistle piercing the martial murk of ""Shut Off the Light"". It's Rahim's exquisite attention to counterintuitive detail, revivifying a genre that's been teetering on the verge of depletion for years. </p></div>"|6956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6956-ideal-lives/|7.5|Brian Howe

    caught fire during the first song. The band never broke stride on the glam 
    Zeppelin stomp of ""Pure Morning"", though-- Brian Molko just changed the song's 
    lyrics from ""A friend in need is a friend indeed/ A friend who bleeds is 
    better"" to ""A friend in need is a friend indeed/ A friend with a fire 
    extinguisher is better"" as the staff of Boston's Avalon raced to put out the 
    flames.</p><p>
    
    Molko's response to the potential disaster was revealing in a few ways: It put his under-appreciated sense of humor on full display, but 
    it also handily illustrated the interchangeability of his lyrics-- the 
    fire extinguisher line actually sounded OK. He's made a career (and a 
    pretty successful one at that, with more than six million albums sold worldwide) out of milking a 
    specific libertine personality. If you're offended by music that seems calculated, take a pass on these 
    guys-- Molko's mix of arm's-length sleaze, studied sexual ambiguity, casual 
    drug references, and sad-boy romantic pining is so precise you could design 
    an algorithm around it.</p><p>
    
    What Placebo do well is deliver some 
    pretty good glam and grunge-influenced hard rock. Molko sells his lyrics with a high, nasal voice that lends a calm sadness to lines few other singers could get away with. On their latest album, <em>Meds</em>, the arrangements and recordings are so airtight you 
    could suffocate in them, with the distortion strictly compressed and neatly 
    controlled-- everything on the beat and vocal guest spots by Michael 
    Stipe and the Kills' Alison Mossheart so underplayed that they're nearly hidden. 
    Steve Hewitt's drumming is so metronome-friendly it could be a machine, and 
    the band augments him with mecha-Bonham programming on a couple of 
    tracks. Even with the Ziploc production, this is still the most varied record 
    Placebo have produced-- they now have more settings than ""quiet"" and ""loud"".</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the fast-paced build of its title track, though it's a bit of a 
    mystery why when ""Infra-Red"" is sitting right behind it. The barbless hook 
    goes, ""Baby, did you forget to take your Meds?"" and Mossheart's backing vocal 
    is wasted saying ""sex, drugs, and complications"" over and over. ""Infra-Red"", 
    meanwhile, has a beats-n-guitars swagger to it and a nice lead-off line in 
    ""One more thing before I shuffle off the planet,"" which would have made a great 
    opening shot. ""Follow the 
    Cops Back Home"" offers some pretty bad advice with its refrain of ""Follow 
    the cops back home/ And rob their houses,"" a strangely jokey line in a song 
    that treads similar sonic territory to Interpol's ""NYC"". ""Pierrot the Clown"" 
    is a better, if less dramatic, ballad, with a small army of soft-hued 
    keyboards tagging along with Molko's melancholy croon.</p><p>
    
    ""One of a Kind"" kicks off with a stomping groove topped by a climbing synth 
    loop, but it squanders some of the verse's svelte momentum with a shift to 
    stiffly noisy guitars in its chorus. ""Drag"" seems to be titled with a nod to 
    self-parody, as the song itself has nothing to do with the expected gender 
    ambiguity, instead referring to Molko's claim that he ""drags"" behind the 
    song's subject. Musically, it's the album's best rocker, playing off 
    Hewitt's steady playing with great e-bow riffs and a memorable chorus. 
    The best song on the record, though, is closer ""Song to Say Goodbye"", an angry goodbye spit over a sharp beat compromised by an 
    intentionally out of tune piano placed low in the mix. A totally unexpected 
    synth melody kicks in around 2:20, taking the song right through the roof as 
    it heads off toward its abrupt ending.</p><p>
    
    If only everything was as inspired as that song. As it is, five albums in, 
    Placebo's shocking-to-your-grandma approach hasn't really changed much, 
    though they've developed a little more stylistic nuance. <em>Meds</em> isn't a 
    terrible album, but there's very little to get excited about on it either, 
    and Placebo's calculated naughtiness is no more convincing than it's ever 
    been. If you've 
    enjoyed their past output, you'll likely enjoy <em>Meds</em> as well, but there's no 
    need for anyone else to bother.</p></div>"|6328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6328-meds/|5.1|Joe Tangari

Poetry is typically viewed around these parts as a luxury pursuit for academics and effete upper classes, and anything written in free verse is considered at least weird and possibly wrong. We are, after all, the country that produced Rod McKuen, the poetic equivalent of Thomas Kinkade. So, to these ears and perhaps many others, early 1980s Billy Bragg songs like ""Milkman of Human Kindness"" and ""Ideology"" sound a little like kitsch, despite their relevance in this post-Enron climate. ""I am the milkman of human kindness"", he sings, completely sincere, but then the next line sounds like a punchline: ""I will leave an extra pint for you"". There was a time when combining ambitiously poetic lyrics and stripped-down post-Clash pub rock seemed not just natural, but caustically rebellious. It's as if folk music had been tensing for 10 years-- through the British depression, the growing political rifts, the punk and post-punk movements-- until it boiled over in 1983, with Bragg's debut EP, <i>Life's a Riot with Spy vs. Spy</i>.</p><p>
    
    That is, at least, a conflicted American's understanding of Bragg and his place and time, 20 years later. Just as I can't imagine the sort of impact he had in the early 80s without referring to secondary sources, I can't imagine how present-day England, especially the generation currently in their serious twenties, views Bragg and his early releases. So Yep Roc's lavish reissue set, which includes five albums available separately or together with a bonus DVD in one set called <i>Volume 1</i>, plays much differently on this side of the Atlantic. England was Bragg's home, his stomping ground, his audience, and his one subject.</p><p>
    
    For Bragg, being working class gave his words more power than if he'd been a professional, and his words in turn freed him from working-class drudgery. Then there are the musical elements-- his voice, whose passionate delivery often exceeded its range, and his guitar, stoically shouldering the burden of accompaniment. The Spartan sound-- so stark and pure on <i>Life's a Riot...</i> but increasingly diluted with handclaps and trumpets on subsequent releases-- promised two things: an unrelenting intimacy (which it delivered) and more honesty than your typical full band (jury's still out). But the effect is nevertheless powerful, and it reinforces the painful conflicts in Bragg's lyrics and the unstudied yowl in his vocals. Those who discovered <i>Life's a Riot...</i> 23 years ago must have felt like he was speaking both for and to them personally. </p><p>
    
    Judging from these releases, as a purely political artist, Bragg was insufferable: he's overly earnest, blunt, and humorless, essentially a pamphlet set to rudimentary music. Fortunately, he wrote and sang about personal and political issues as if they were the same thing-- and to him they probably were. A composite portrait arises of a man torn between the security of home and the need to change the world, caught between his uncertainties (Can one man really make a difference?) and his transparent suspicions of marriage and disgust with sex. On 1984's <i>Brewing Up with Billy Bragg</i>, his confusion rankles into misogyny, as his view of women begins to focus either on their emasculating powers or their cheating ways. ""In the end it took me a dictionary to find out the meaning of unrequited"", he sings on ""The Saturday Boy"", ""While she was giving herself for free at a party to which I was never invited"". </p><p>
    
    But on the apologetic ""A New England"" (from <i>Life's a Riot...</i>) and the absolutely devastating ""Levi Stubbs' Tears"" (from 1986's <i>Talking with the Taxman About Poetry</i>), his youthful conflict-- between politics and romance, between society's terms and his own-- is painfully genuine. It's the sound of a man maturing as he works through each life crisis in song, either unaware or comforted by the idea that most people go through the same trials. There's nothing special about feeling this pain and confusion, but Bragg was able to put those problems into words and those words into songs. That never goes out of style. </p></div>"|904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/904-volume-1/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

Orchestra of Bubbles manages to capture both trajectories at once. Like some crazy amusement park ride, you feel yourself ascending and descending at the same time; it's a simultaneous come-up and come-down, a combo rocket takeoff and marshmallow-factory landing. Which is to say, this isn't merely an impressive record: It's a remarkable feat of engineering.</p>
<p>The brief is basic; just like the album jacket says, Orchestra of Bubbles is a collaboration between Ellen Allien, proprietor of Berlin's excellent Bpitch Control label, and Apparat, co-director (alongside T. Raumschmiere) of the Shitkatapult imprint. And for anyone versed in both artists' work-- Allien's melodic, electro-infused techno and Apparat's often melancholic, detail-packed, granular bit-crunchings-- the combined effort sounds much like you might have expected, or indeed hoped. The rhythms toggle between techno's glide and electro-breaks' syncopated lurch; Allien's contrapuntal sensibilities shine through in dozens of interlocking pieces; and Apparat's downcast inclinations burst forth from every plaintive phrase. Apparat's production hallmarks, particularly his sense of space and his fondness for pulverizing grain delay, are all over the record, and they mesh wonderfully with Allien's enormous analog leads; the sheer sound of the thing is fuller than anything either artist has released-- in comparison, even Allien's recent, effusive Thrills sounds thinner.</p>
<p>Orchestra of Bubbles, an appropriately synaesthetic title if ever there were one, is an immersive record, from the rush and whir that open ""Turbo Dreams"", the album's lead cut (and single), to the whitecapped guitar chords and percolating delay that end the closing ""Bubbles"". Both artists have upped their stylistic range here: ""Bubbles"" borrows the Orb's ambient dub and Barbara Morgenstern's singer-songwriting, with a damn-near emo touch; ""Retina"", a crazy carousel of sawing cellos and bright, arpeggiated keyboards, sounds a lot like Steve Reich. (And maybe a little like Dead Can Dance-- but then, Bpitch always did have a bit of a hidden goth sensibility.) ""Metric"", meanwhile, traces dubstep's infiltration of Berlin; the strings-- real ones!-- might not be orthodox over at Tempa HQ, but there's no mistaking that seismic wobble.</p>
<p>The triangle hiding behind the beat on ""Metric"" is one of my favorite individual sounds on the album, which seems appropriate given the way the Orchestra swings between the micro and the macro. The songwriting-- almost every cut is far too composed to qualify for ""trackiness""-- is masterful, but it's also easy to miss, considering how captivating all the details are. It's not just the individual sounds that dazzle, but the seeming surface of it all, a fusion of digital, analog-electronic, and acoustic timbres so richly textured it feels almost tactile.</p>
<p>Despite the enormous fluffy clouds of grain and reverb, the album never stops moving-- even the loosest of their bass lines work like billows to keep blowing things forward. (Occasionally, the funk is more obvious: ""Floating Points"" borrows its boompty from !!!'s ""Me and Guiliani..."", surprising as it may sound.) But they leaven their momentum with tentativeness, never simply pushing the beat toward climax but stopping to explore the little loopholes in time and psychoacoustic space. ""Jet"", the album's highlight, wants to have it all ways at once: a compact funk bass line below, misty pads on top, and then a nimbly twisting arpeggio that goes shooting through it all like a giant's vine. A high-pitched, trombone-like sound melts like hot plastic from unseen heights, and everything feels at once within reach and incredibly far away. Readers of Alice in Wonderland will recognize this symptom as micropsia, which might make sense: Allien and Apparat have burrowed one of the most magical rabbit-holes you'll explore this year.</p></div>"|415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/415-orchestra-of-bubbles/|8.5|Philip Sherburne

Over the course of just one year, Sunset Rubdown's progressed from <em>Snake's Got a Leg</em>'s rickety and insular lo-fi basement tape sound to a fuller-bodied EP to this exceedingly well-dressed, multi-hued glam pop.</p><p>  Now operating as a full band (here, a quartet), Sunset Rubdown more closely resemble Wolf Parade but still maintain the rougher ragtag sound of their previous recordings. A good example is triumphal opener ""Stadiums and Shrines II"", which continues the practice of updating Krug's songs and echoing his past catalogue (all while building a personal cosmology). This version includes the same lyrics and general melody as the scrubbier slip-n-slide on <em>Snake's Got a Leg</em>, but otherwise it's an entirely different monster. Krug sheds the off-kilter dust-bowl harmonium and stuttering underwater feel of the original for a cleaner, less warped anthem. Now, when he sings ""there's a kid in there/ And he's big and dumb/ And he's...kinda scared,"" instead of going by unnoticed, it'll make you lose your breath.</p><p>  In his more fleshed-out, metaphysically epic form, Krug consistently finds ways to yoke disparate parts; there's so much inventive stitching, in fact, it makes it tempting to offer a play-by-play with color commentary for every song. Beyond writing catchy tunes and packing them with whispers, mallets, harpsichord, and patches of cheapskate drum machines, he's an intriguing presence. Instead of bubbling along at one level, he roller coasters and raves, mixing nonsense with sharp observations and sadness with puns. This jam-packed, unbridled sound ought to heighten the Frog Eyes comparisons, but complicated by the groups' shared tour and Krug's former role as one of Carey Mercer's band members, that contrast is a bit of a bore. Besides, Krug doesn't stick to any particular style beyond his approach to his howls.</p><p>  More interesting to note: The cumulative effect of <em>Shut Up I Am Dreaming</em> surpasses ""I'll Believe in Anything""'s ostensible perfection. That's a brilliant song, yes, but this a brilliant album, ballooning with those sorts of moments on repeat. See, for instance, the speedy ragtime re-versioning of ""Snake's Got a Leg III"", which feels comparable to Wolf Parade's ""Dears Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts""-- albeit with a scrubby sense of pathos-- or jaunty sawdust kicker ""They Took a Vote and Said No"". As in many of Krug's songs, there seems to be some sort of moral, as if he's writing warped and warbling Aesop Fables. Here, it's ""a kid"" who ""wants a ride"", learning that nothing comes for free and ""there are things that have to die so other things can stay alive."" Some fleet-fingered guitar work and crashing drums obscure the lesson; after a pause and piano line, we're handed a kick-ass axe-toting coda.</p><p>  Then there's the piano-based ballad ""Us Ones in Between"", on which he pulls out his deck of unexpected metaphors woven with an endlessly ambient tone-generating guitar: ""You are a waterfall/ Wading inside a well/ And you are a wrecking ball/ Before the building fell."" Again, there's one of those tenderly surrealistic morals: ""I've heard of creatures who eat their babies/ I wonder if they stop to think about the taste."" Through an inversion, Krug himself becomes the creature as well as the eaten, asking, ""Oh baby, mother me before you eat me."" In other new turns, there are female backing vocals provided by former Pony Up! member Camilla Wynne Ingr, and on many tracks glockenspiel or xylophone tap a ringing background.</p><p>  The opening piano tingle of ""Swimming"" churns into haunted-house circus music and then it bursts and blooms into the catchiest little music-box reprise of ""The Dust You Kick Up Is Too Fine"" from the debut. These echoes are everywhere, the resampling a weirdly pleasant and satisfying sort of minimalism, offering listeners a chance to see his work from various angles.</p><p>  This is rich stuff and it won't be surprising if some listeners prefer Krug's maniacal flights of fancy to <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em>'s sense of balance. There's obviously much to be said for Wolf Parade's addictive push/pull switch hitting-- that overflowing seep between Bowie/Eno and jittery Iggy/Springsteen-- but it's also incredibly fun watching pop songs pulled apart and restitched into tiny rococo monuments and tossed skyward. All the Wolf Parade comparisons are a drag, sorry, but they're inevitable. Plus, the context's important: Because Krug followed some of the best material on <em>Apologies</em> with this elegant wallop, he's looking increasingly like an important songwriter rather than just another flavor-of-the-month.</p><p> </p></div>"|7818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7818-shut-up-i-am-dreaming/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

Occasionally, some wiseacre will blather about his collection of Kardinal Offishal mp3s or, god forbid, his love and respect for Swollen Members, and you wish you'd never said anything in the first place. As deeply as we love Canadian indie boys and girls, rappers trying to cross the border still find it surprisingly difficult. We like our rap stars either angry, self-educated, and packing or benignly solipsistic and fashionable; the politely unarmed of Canada don't offer much beyond, for all intents and purposes, the edited version of American commercial hip-hop, and nobody wants that. This was enough to make Rollie Pemberton neglect his blog long enough to issue a grimy clarion call to Edmonton and beyond as Cadence Weapon.</p><p>
    It makes sense that Rollie's first proper album would be a rousing alarm. His father, Teddy Pemberton, having emigrated from Brooklyn to Edmonton, almost single-handedly introduced hip-hop to the province in 1980 through his college radio show ""The Black Experience in Sound"". In a 2000 interview with <i>See Magazine</i>-- which, like Pitchfork, later employed Rollie as music journo-- Teddy Pemberton remarked of his arrival in Edmonton, ""I would see the kids walking around, and they didn't even have a clue. I decided right then and there: 'I've got to change this.'"" <em>Breaking Kayfabe</em> is infused with the same sense of obligation, an idealist's thrust against perceived indifference. Call it Rollie's Künstlerroman, his struggle against the insouciance of a scene that his father helped birth. Sounds heavy, but Rollie pushes forward with a slap on the back, like the friend who gives you a new shirt ""Not because yours looks <i>bad."" It does. Your shirt looks horrible. </i></p><p>
<em>Breaking Kayfabe</em> revels in clashing the two worlds of hip-hop together, the self-awareness of Rollie's underground-leaning lyrics spilling over gargantuan synth riffs and decidedly non-boom bappy beats. Imagine a less-irritating Slug if produced by a Three 6 Mafia inspired by Sparks instead of cough syrup, and you're somewhere near Cadence Weapon's aesthetic. Rollie's electro clatters and clangs, but not at the cost of rhythm, as many of the underground's boundary testers would have you believe is necessary. Anti-Pop Consortium hinted at this kind of accessible experimentation, but then ate themselves. Cadence Weapon sees the idea through on songs like ""Vicariously"", a tumbler of bleeps and drones borrowed from Nintendo backed by a grinding, metallic break. ""Julie Will Jump The Broom"" does Books-like, but struts where they stumble. ""Diamond Cutter"" talks noir and treats a Rick Rubin-esque break with caustic techno-disrespect. </p><p>
    Throughout, Rollie makes choices that surprise: flipping a sample from video game Silent Hill into a Wild West shootout with the Canadian rap establishment; subtle references to his father's passing; admitting his contradictions and not expecting credit for doing so (ahem, Kanye). These are things most rappers don't like to bother themselves with, and much of that can probably be attributed to Rollie's background. Raised in a library of music and having already dissected his influences, Rollie takes confident first steps as Cadence Weapon. <em>Breaking Kayfabe</em> may not be his masterpiece, but it hints that he may be capable of one, and now you can finally get his music without having to write a check to his landlord.</p></div>"|1801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1801-breaking-kayfabe/|8.0|Peter Macia

Right out of the gate it was aggressive and direct, turning the insistent beat of post-rock into a slap in the face to the powers that be. Two years later, the more preciously titled <em>In Praise of Shadows</em> sets the band back to a chamber duo, using a consistent pulse as a base from which to explore ideas and textures. Instead of a ""No War"" tour, this is more like a last-minute, ""anything could happen"" trip with a Eurail pass.</p><p>
     
    The band describes <em>In Praise of Shadow</em> as seven pieces that should he heard as a whole, and it feels like a suite, at least in the sense that each track has a single function and leans on the others to cough up a whole. Of the two travellers, drummer and percussionist Chad Taylor is the intrepid one, launching each track and bringing all of the momentum to the album. By contrast, trumpeter and electronics manipulator Rob Mazurek hangs back-- either because he's busy exploring, or because he's so hung up looking for the right idea that he misses his shot. On the long title track, he acts like a colorist when the momentum invites a soloist; he rarely shouts back to Taylor's ""go go <i>go</i>"" percussion.</p><p>
     
    We've seen these sites before-- the smears of grueling abstract noise that abruptly cut off, the thoughtful chamber interludes, the martial beat behind a growling horn. The only cut that seems to surprise the musicians as well as the listeners is ""The Glass House"", a long, static percussion piece that envelops you like, well, sort of like a glass house, but more like a garden of endless, hanging sculptures: An eager melody on what sounds like thumb piano seems to fade away as your ears get lost in the background resonances. It's the only stretch of the album that'll give you pause.</p><p>
    
    But the rest feels too familiar-- and instead of concluding, the album just stops after a last, quizzical track. If this is the flight home after their trip, it's like those times you're too tired to do anything aside from wait for the plane and flip through someone's <em>Time</em> magazine; without saying it, you know that your big adventure just wound up looking like somebody else's postcards. But hey, that one glass house place was pretty wild, wasn't it?</p></div>"|1439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1439-in-praise-of-shadows/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    been waiting for since <em>Ten</em>. Or <em>Vs.</em>. Or <em>Vitalogy</em>. Or whichever album was the last on which Pearl Jam were a fully 
    accredited rock band. This eponymous effort-- the group's eighth 
    studio full-length, and first for J Records-- is the most consistent effort the group's released since 
    its second album. No pump organ-flecked spoken-word jags about 
    insects, no meandering Eastern-tinged meditations on life, no songs 
    about Jeff Ament's dog. Just 13 tracks of thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge rock'n'roll for the thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge fellow in all of us. But 
    it gets pretty boring pretty damn quick.</p><p>
    
    Think what you will of the group, but there's no denying their growth. 
    Despite having the wide eyes of Alternative Nation turned toward them-- selling 17 million copies of their first two records-- Pearl Jam 
    decided to take the road less traveled, and that seemed to make all the 
    difference in maintaining the band's creative viability. Of course, 
    this choice is where they broke with the lion's share of their fan base-- millions who bought into Pearl Jam's original MO weren't 
    willing to put up with creative wanderlust. On <em>Pearl Jam</em>, that's what you get from 
    start to finish (barring one accordion cameo in the minute long reprise 
    of ""Life Wasted""). While there's no shirt-rending Jesus Christ poses to 
    be had here, this is as close to the righteous bombast of their heyday 
    as they're likely to ever get again, for better or worse.</p><p>
    
    One thing that has returned, unfortunately: An emphasis on Eddie Vedder's voice, an 
    acquired taste's acquired taste. That his mushmouthed mewling and 
    moaning became the template for a slew of copycat chest-thumpers is the 
    stuff that keeps vocal coaches up at night. The ""weird"" Pearl Jam 
    albums found Vedder's singing improving ever so slightly, to the point 
    that he was actually singing without any odd affectations-- the uh-huhs, 
    the oooh-yeahs, the arghs. On this album, though, he's back to the 
    multi-line mulching, growling for all he's worth through its more aggressive tracks. He often sounds best on the low-tempo songs, where the mood better complements his voice's 
    strength-- Eddie's a crooner, not a wailer. But here, he even wails through the slower songs, killing ""Parachutes"" with his 
    over-emoting and vamping unsuccessfully over the bluesy saunter of ""Come Back"".</p><p>
    
    Granted, Pearl Jam haven't lost the perspective they've gained through age-- good luck trying to get their young selves to pen a Springsteenian 
    working-class portrait like ""Unemployable"". Instead of 
    trying to rage against the machine, they're appealing to its 
    intellectual nature. Unfortunately, this nuance is steamrolled by the 
    group's need for fan-friendly riffage. After years of trying to live up to one of their early 
    statements-- ""there ain't gonna be any middle anymore""-- it's 
    disappointing to find them steering the ship back toward the center.</p></div>"|6210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6210-pearl-jam/|5.5|David Raposa

    glitch-pop hooks of the stuff he releases under the name his parents gave

    Audion doesn't quite have the brand name appeal of the Matthew Dear stuff, 
    which crossed over to indie kids on the back 
    of Dear's wet, fey vocals and the hiccoughing funny noises that pass for 
    hooks in the world of microhouse. This is probably why the marquee for

    techno has shifted from, well, not being marketed at all to being written up 
    in places like, say, I dunno, Pitchfork. The slick packaging and widespread 
    dissemination of the Fabric series is designed to appeal to people outside 
    the techno cognoscenti. Some Fabric mixes-- Michael Mayer's springs immediately to 
    mind-- are guaranteed to find a wide-ranging audience with their equally wide-ranging track selection, shifts in tempo, and petty indulgences like hooks 
    and vocals and overt melodies.</p><p>
    
    I'm sure heard on a club soundsystem, with sub-bass rearranging your body 
    chemistry, <i>Fabric 27 would work. (An hour plus isn't really enough 
    time for hypnosis to take control.) It's itching, rippling minimalist 
    muzak, beats bobbing in a lagoon of bass mucous. If you're not listening 
    very closely, the tracks will slink by unnoticed, transitioning from one 
    burbling minimal workout to the next. Like the Ivan Smagghe Fabric mix from 
    2005, Dear's mix will be embraced by people who think looking for possible 
    variations in a seemingly unceasing, unchanging matte black bottom end the 
    most enthralling thing in the world. Everyone else will just hear a same-y 
    techno mix.</i></p><p>
    
    Maybe the fault lies in Dear cutting up two or three tracks into a new 
    whole. This is what DJs have been doing since disco, and as long as Jeff 
    Mills is still alive I wouldn't write it off in a techno context. But Mills' 
    multi-turntable hacking has a fury and drive utterly lacking in what I'll be 
    succinct and call the post-Ableton/Hawtin era. Instead of butt-bumping chops 
    and delirious edits with the frayed edges still visible, you get three 
    minimal techno tracks that sound like...a single minimal techno track. This 
    smooth, toothless mixing may be technically impressive but it's also pretty boring.</p><p>
    
    Techno purists are probably grimacing at the mere mention of ""functional"" as 
    a pejorative. Maybe instead of your beanbag chair or on the stairmaster, 
    you need to listen to it on the highway wreathed in fog at 5 a.m. Some old 
    techno sawhorses still hold, I guess.</p></div>"|487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/487-fabric-27/|6.2|Jess Harvell

Sound quality varies widely, like the album was patched together from a bag full of tapes made on wildly variable gear. Which is likely, given that the music was recorded over the course of several years in 10 countries with contributions from more than 30 people. The list of instruments used stretches into the dozens; performed bits are pasted together with field recordings and wholesale appropriation of records from other artists. And to top it off, the CD is long as hell-- well over 70 minutes-- and it feels even longer. In short, focus and restraint are nonexistent. So why does this porous blob of a record sound so good? Why does it fail in such a beautiful way?</p><p>
    
    Function's Matt Nicholson is, curiously enough, a relatively conventional indie rock songwriter. Opener ""Beloved, Lost to Begin With"", with lyrics adapted from a Rilke poem, has familiar neo-shoegazer features-- male/female harmonizing by Nicholson and Felicity Mangan and a glacial tempo-- but other elements bubble up to indicate Function are on their own trip. There's a crackling campfire throughout the song (sure enough, the neighbors are credited in the booklet with ""fire/chatter""), and when the drums arrive they're absurdly huge, as if thundering down a mountain. A slow, pretty indie rock song is thus bent though production tweaks into something strange-- a pattern repeated throughout the album.</p><p>
    
    Other proper songs are spread evenly over the course of the record; Nicholson sings some, elsewhere he recruits others to help him. They range from solid and workmanlike to quite good, but it's not the songs that make this record. Rather, it's the way they fit with all the weirdness swirling around them, how they gradually emerge from behind the thick production fog. While Nicholson is a decent, and sometimes very good, songwriter, one gets the sense that in his heart of hearts he's really just a freak for sound. The kind of guy who obsesses over the timbre of amplifier hum, fated to walk the earth with a MiniDisc recorder in his pocket. </p><p>
    
    Plenty of bands alternate songs with instrumental interludes, of course, but I don't know of many willing to go to such extremes. After the second track, ""The Red Hook Miracle Fountain"", another bit of tuneful slowcore with falsetto vocals by Nicholson, the record descends to a microscopic level on ""Prayer in a Tonal Forest"", with clicks of static and fragments of guitar notes that linger on the threshold of audibility. And this for more than four minutes. The abrupt drop in volume and subtlety of this moment is courageous, coming as it does so early in the record, where some will be compelled to switch it off. It strikes me as a lovely track worthy of inclusion on a Kompakt <em>Pop Ambient</em> compilation, certainly not something you'd expect to follow the previous two songs. </p><p>
    
    The instrumentals are highly variable but generally favor heavily textured drone. ""Shards"" and ""Mad Light Obviating Things"", with their processed guitar feedback mixed with flutes and harp, suggest that Nicholson has spent many hours with his head lodged somewhere between Fripp and Eno; the longer ""New Music for Bowed Animals"" is closer to the Experimental Audio Research's wispy and cosmic VCS3 synthesizer trips. ""The Broken Shaman"" is an unlikely sample collage, combining trombone from a Stuart Dempster record with voice from a Lakshmi Shankar record (all samples cleared!) and then mixing the results with live percussion. </p><p>
    
    Occasionally, the soundscapes and tunes come together nicely into one track. ""Alone With the Real Magic Dragon (Hanalei)"" stretches the ethereality of dream pop into an eight-minute blissout, as strings, wordless vocals, and guitar bleed together in swatches of psychedelic color. The recording quality on this one is no great shakes, unfortunately; according the booklet the track was recorded in Hawaii, Melbourne, Belgium, and England, so there you have it.  </p><p>
<em>The Secret Miracle Fountain</em> is very far from a perfect record; still, despite its length and meandering nature, it's rarely dull. Even during the patches that don't quite work, the momentum engendered by the ambition carries the day. Disciplined adherence to a fixed set of goals may be the most prudent path to success, but with this record, Function argue convincingly that sometimes you have to leave the planning behind and go on instinct. </p></div>"|3368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3368-the-secret-miracle-fountain/|8.2|Mark Richardson

Something like: Thou shalt not     plucketh tracks from any Sabbath album past <i>Sabotage</i> when     compiling a one-disc greatest hits collection, and thou shalt choose     very carefully from both <i>Sabotage</i> and <i>Sabbath Bloody     Sabbath</i>, lest ye disenfranchise Sabbath neophytes. After all, only     dedicated spelunkers are going to want to venture into the depths     plumbed by Black Dio and Black Purple and Tony Iommi's Traveling Sabbath     of Ebon Darkness. If you want the best, then you want Ozzy Osborne     cribbing notes from Hammer Studio horror flicks and/or his own     experiences with various controlled substances. Rhino knew this back in     2002, when they compiled two discs' worth of Ozzy-era goodness.     Twenty-nine total tracks; a mere four from the final two Ozzy albums,     and only 10 from the latter half of Ozzy's tenure. On this greatest hits     collection, the ratio's less favorable-- out of 16 total tracks,     three are turds from the post-<i>Sabotage</i> era, plus one     underwhelming track each from both <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i> and     <i>Sabotage</i>.</p>
<p>Were I in an Old Testament mood, I'd simply draw the line at <i>Vol.     4</i> and start turning heathens into salt. Such a demarcation means     folks who bought this comp could cut bait with the     awesome-beyond-words ""Supernaut"" and display their devil horns with     pride. Tracks like the turgid ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" and ""Hole in the     Sky"" sound like watered down Sabbath, especially following various     <i>Vol. 4</i> highlights. Which is a sight better than Sabbath doing     their best Cheap Trick impersonation (""Never Say Die""), or Sabbath     trying to one-up Blueshammer (as on ""Rock 'N' Roll Doctor"" and ""Dirty     Women,"" both from the misnomered <i>Technical Ecstasy</i>). I guess     listeners should be happy Rick Wakeman's contributions to the band's     gradual decline or the group's foray into new-wave what-the-fuckness     aren't included.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the compilers try to ruin the party, there's no     denying what Sabbath once was. From the first bell toll of ""Black     Sabbath"" until ""Supernaut"" fades to black 11 tracks later, the     band's greatness is unmistakable. Iommi must have brought a few extra     virgins to the crossroads when he met up with old Lucifer, as the leads     to songs like ""War Pigs"", ""Black Sabbath"", and ""Iron Man"" are     inescapable and eternal. (That the compilers saw it fit to     indiscriminately chop two minutes off of ""Iron Man"" is just another     strike against this disc.) The group's Gothic interpretation of the     blooze is all but perfected on the track which inspired their name.     Iommi plays a few notes, Bill Ward crashes his cymbals, Ozzy offers some     stanzas concerning devil worship, and cathedrals in fog emerge from the     speakers. It's campy as hell, but they play it straight, and it works. Almost 40 years later, the music is still able to evoke this mood     perfectly.</p>
<p><i>Paranoid</i> is the apotheosis of the Sabbath sound, as five minutes     on any classic rock station will attest. And there's a very good reason     for that-- tracks as played out as ""Iron Man"" and ""War Pigs"" still pack     a punch, with the production lending the songs a cavernous feel that     flatters the group's deceptively simple instrumentation. After that     peak, the group refined their sound, which included both sublimely     stupid rock stuff like ""Sweet Leaf"" and the mellotron-aided piano     balladry of ""Changes"". And tracks like the unstoppable ""Supernaut"" and     equally great ""Snowblind"" hold their own against other high points in     the group's catalog. Blame the drugs or plain old sloth, but later     attempts to expand the group's palate weren't nearly as successful.     After <i>Vol. 4</i>, the band sounded less like Sabbath than like a     group that either wanted to be Sabbath or be something else. Including     back-to-back examples of this mediocrity to close out this retrospective     is not the best way to end things. Of course, this compilation is     hardly the best way to pay tribute to Black Sabbath. Those with any     interest in checking this stuff out would be better served by either     seeking out actual albums or spending the extra cash on the     aforementioned two-disc collection of Sabbath's best.</p></div>"|775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/775-greatest-hits-1970-1978/|6.2|David Raposa

""No consequences."" ""Just ass-shaking shit."" ""Why you hating?"" ""Stop thinking so hard.""</p><p>
    
    BULLETIN: Reports are circulating that Miami Bass paragon Luther ""Uncle Luke"" Campbell's filthy and amazing split box set, <em>My Life and Freaky Times</em>, featuring a soundtrack and a 2xCD spoken word audio-biography, has been delayed by retailers citing its content and lascivious packaging inappropriate. In other news, Spank Rock released <em>Yoyoyoyoyo</em> last month.</p><p>
    
    That's the hierarchy. <em>Yoyoyoyoyo</em> is one of the most precise and brilliantly produced albums of the year. One-time DFA disciple Armani XXXChange, working from a homemade studio in an apartment in Brooklyn, displays a keen ear for smart ways to mash regional and time-lost delicacies (H-Town Screw, B-More Club, Philly Soul, Miami bass, NYC Electro, 1980s dance pop, Samba, First Wave Freestyle, etc.). XXXChange uses dug-out bass, Space Invaders blips, and relentless 808s, among myriad sound effects, to enhance what can feel like sonic revolution. Each song uses a new sound to flex his skills, like the cheek-pop plucking on ""What It Look Like"" or the sped-up orchestral underbelly on ""Coke &amp; Wet"". ""Bump"" has an accelerating cowbell and synth loop as tight and hilarious as anything on LCD Soundsystem's debut. His versatility is a gift, though it sometimes robs Spank Rock of any discernable individuality. Still, an album full of disconnected but adventurous beats is hardly grounds for failure. More troubling is the message. </p><p>
    
    Much has been made of MC Naeem Juwan's geographical history. Born in Baltimore, a move to Philadelphia reportedly informed his style, as have tutorials from noted Rawkus beatsmith Shawn J. Period. But Juwan's rap POV bears little resemblance to Mos Def or Talib Kweli, nor does it fit bass's garrulous charm or Baltimore Club's chant-heavy style. He's got a helium-laced voice and his patterns are intentionally manic, jumping around, off-beat-or-on, as if his point can't be made fast enough. Sometimes it's dazzling; mostly, it's frustrating. ""Rick Rubin"" is less about the producer, and more a questioning philosophical treatise (""Is it off-key?/ Is it just too hip?/ Is it out of touch or is it the touch?"")-- Spank Rock doing his Rimbaud joint over stutter-clap, revealing one of many knowing winks on the album. He also raps about ass. A lot. </p><p>
    
    Moving bodies is as worthy a goal now as it was when Little Richard sang, ""Good booty, if it don't fit, don't force it"". But Spank Rock's unspoken nihilism-- or, more pointedly, chauvinism-- has been getting a pass. You may be thinking, ""Rap writer comes down on innocuous, possibly ironic good-time MC for sexism, continues ignoring Interscope artist's crimes."" Fair point. Amanda Blank hops on ""Bump"" for a verse that could out-nasty Lil' Kim on her worst day to balance things, if only for a song. It's just that when a group like Spank Rock achieves a certain status with tastemakers, so much of its ethos remains uncontested and unclear. The quotes above are some of the responses I've heard when attempting to engage in conversation about this album. I still can't tell how serious Juwan is when he says, ""Ass-shaking competition champ, ooh that pussy gets damp, pump that-- pump that-- pump that amp."" The image is clear. But is it sheer reportage? Fantasy? He's got jokes? No doubt he likes ass. Next to a domineering pro like Uncle Luke, though, Juwan comes off like a stepchild. </p><p>
    
    There's a fluid, unidentifiable hipster appeal to Spank Rock and <em>Yoyoyoyoyo</em>. Because they lack a true identity, they're as comfortable performing with Bun B or Devin the Dude as Man Man or Animal Collective. Existing in the Hollertronix quadrant-- a fun, strange cultural sphere occupied by the undeniably talented but suspiciously prominent Diplo, among others-- will get you criticized as vacant. There's nothing vacant about the dire sexuality chirped about here, it'd just be more useful if it could be more easily understood. The thrilling and immediate ""Coke &amp; Wet"" is so raw, smacked by a sharp Moog and guitar-slink, that when Juwan oddly boasts through the chorus ""Coke and wet, bitch/Guns, nigga, holla!"" it sounds like it could be parody. On the other hand, closer ""Screwville, USA"" is as nostalgic and dramatic a Houston anthem as I've heard this year. And who knows if these dudes have even been to Texas. </p></div>"|7856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7856-yoyoyoyoyo/|6.5|Sean Fennessey

    of disbelief is key with Tool. Taken at face value, with their 
    song suites, meat puppet videos, and histrionic singer, they're pretty 
    goofy. People make fun of Tool fans because they assume they take the band 
    seriously-- these spotty, greasy kids with bad shoes and worse hair who 
    already wear an insult on their T-shirts. At 28, I'd feel funny mocking 
    15-year-olds still finding their place in the world. And as for taking them seriously-- well, I 
    take Tool about as seriously as I do black metal or Lil Jon or the films of 
    Tsui Hark. Which is to say, not very.</p><p>
    A Pitchfork-friendly analogy: Tool are the Radiohead of xFC-metal. Both bands 
    predate scenes they later became avatars for; both were more creative and inspirational than their followers; both were incredibly pretentious; and both still managed to sell an ass-load of records. Tool didn't release an album between 1996 and 
    2001. They missed xFC-metal's entire rise and fall, an era of whiteboy dreads, bonsai facial hair, funk bass poppin', and constipated balladry. And much like Radiohead 
    when they dropped the <i>Kid A/</i><i>Amnesiac doubleshot, Tool released 
    </i><i>Lateralus early in this decade to radio silence and huge numbers.</i></p><p>
    Like a 
    mall-friendly King Crimson, <i>Lateralus</i> had a starless and bible black sound that 
    actually rocked rather than wittering on, converting complex, mathematic passages into visceral rock. Also like King Crimson, the lyrics were mostly garbage, but 
    goddamn did that rhythm section pummel the shit out of its instruments. As 
    with the Mars Volta's debut, the drums were the lead voice on 
    <i>Lateralus, and Danny Carey was his instrument's Minnie Ripperton.</i></p><p>
    Five years later, Tool return with <i>10,000 Days. But rather than delving further 
    into experimentation or exploring their strengths, Tool have made an...A Perfect Circle record. 
    Like singer Maynard James Keenan's side project, </i><i>10,000 Days is 
    considerably less punishing and much more ethereal. Songs like ""Lost 
    Keys"" and ""Vigniti Tires"" are dark ambient soundscrapes that just make you 
    wonder where the drums went. And when they are there, they're decidedly 
    less brutal than on </i><i>Lateralus. On ""Right in Two"" they sound more like 
    bongos. The title track features sitar and tabla. Listening to this album, you get the sinking feeling that Tool have made an art-rock, rather 
    than art-metal, album. And yes, the difference is considerable.</i></p><p>
    Keenan's vocals are no less powerful here, but your appreciation of his style still 
    depends largely on your feelings towards quasi-operatic hard rock (you know, like 
    emo, except they actually hit the notes they're going for). People who enjoy 
    voices that sound like they're singing into their overcoats to ward off a 
    night chill will probably find it embarrassing. (The white dude version of 
    melisma?) The lyrics-- the usual mix of drug references, conspiracy theories, 
    tortured declarations of vague emotional trauma, and general 
    doom-mongering-- won't do much to convince non-believers. And with most 
    songs stretching from the seven- to 12-minute range-- and without the 
    stop-start whiplash that was the previous albums' definition of 
    rhythm-- it's unlikely that most listeners will possess the patience or fortitude to make the pilgrimage more than a couple of times.</p><p>
<i>10,000 Days is supposedly named for the amount of time between Keenan's 
    mother becoming paralyzed and when she died, so it's sort of a ""Death Disco"" for suburban 
    teenage potheads. If only the music had one-tenth of the Public Image 
    Limited song's power. Instead I find myself in the awkward position of 
    trying to sell you on the merits of a deeply uncool band by telling you to 
    go buy their last album instead. But hey, the next time you're sneering at 
    someone in a Tool shirt, just remember how retarded you look walking down 
    the street with the words ""The Boy Least Likely To"" or ""Clap Your Hands Say Yeah"" across your chest.</i></p></div>"|8105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8105-10000-days/|5.9|Jess Harvell

For an album assembled in approximately six days, it contained a surprising amount of good material: elegant, sophisticated, and generally winsome pop songs constructed from violin and loop pedals. A year later, Squaresoft has yet to send a cease-and-desist order, and Pallett's emerged with something far grander than his modest debut.</p><p>
<i>He Poos Clouds</i>. The title is meant as a compliment (cf. shit that don't stink), and maybe also as a way of cutting through the seriousness of the thing itself-- 10 compositions for a chamber ensemble including strings, piano, harpsichord, percussion, and voice. Work through Pallett's lyrics and there's the more serious possibility that this album is about suicide. These songs are populated by characters both fantastical and hopeless: frigid young professionals, an impotent real-estate broker, Lazarus, a Japan-obsessed suicidal, ""the Pooka,"" a lost teenage daughter, and Jenna, who ""dreams of being physically able/ To behead herself at the dining room table."" They talk to themselves (and occasionally one another) in arch, pithy exclamations, which Pallett, in print, riddles with explanation points. What's dating? ""Tell lies, tell dirty lies, tell diggory lies/ Until you're lying in his bed!""</p><p>
    
    There are grand gestures in the music, too, starting with the unbearably tense sequence of rising notes that closes the first song, irritating you to the point of emotional sensitivity. Some are full of good feeling, like the opening of ""Song Song Song""-- a clatter of vigorous stick-on-wood percussion that only gradually steps its way up into pizzicato harmonies. Others are packed with something more anguished, like when the broker in ""This Lamb Sells Condos"" bickers with his spouse: Pallett does spiteful crosstalk (""I feed you every morning and ask so little"") under what sounds like a children's choir urgently singing designer labels (""Hedi Slimane and Agnes B/ I'm not content""). Still more urgency in ""Many Lives -&gt; 49 MP"", as Pallett sings around an insistent violin lead and others shout violently from the back of the room.</p><p>
    
    Pallett's combination of pop idiom and classical practice is fluid and natural; he sounds perfectly at home here, miles from the self-conscious ""conceptual"" way indie acts usually take up string quartets. But this may or may not be an album for classicists. Pallett's arrangements are terrific in their rhythmic tangles of strings, pushing and weaving in odd spots, but they're also-- intentionally or unintentionally-- the tiniest bit monochrome, heavy in staccato undertows and the same arch feeling as the album's title. (Arch in tone and arched in eyebrows, especially when the pizzicato comes out.) Pallett's voice can also lag behind his writing, and its recording here is naggingly lacking in crispness; right when you want a strong voice swelling over the strings, it can go muddied and dull and get dragged underneath. But where <i>Has a Good Home</i> was promising, <i>He Poos Clouds</i> seems like the real thing: No matter the title, there's an ambition here, and a dedication to Pallett's own mission, that's a joy to hear. This is, in a word, fierce-- it can engage you on a level most albums can't, and digging through the lyrics seems to reveal...well, something. Which isn't as common a situation as we might hope.</p></div>"|3333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3333-he-poos-clouds/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

It's a shame, though, considering how he fits with recent trends in experimental pop. If the music scene were a corporation, Drake would sit just a couple doors down the hall from acid-folk and whatever you call the stuff Fiery Furnaces play. He'd be in the office reserved for the guy who's been there longer than most of upper management, but who isn't particularly interested in climbing the company ladder. Some people, when given the space and time to explore the inner workings of the firm, ultimately just want to do the work; they avoid social obligations that may well assist their profile on the grounds that they might also hinder their focus.</p><p>
    
    If that makes Drake the Milton of the indie experimental <i>Office Space</i>-- his desk dense with both modern and archaic recording equipment, photographs of decrepit wooden sheds, a banjo and a bear suit-- it hardly makes his own work ordinary. Drake's music, taken as a whole, is unlike anything I've come across: a joyous, macabre hybrid of <i>Song Cycle</i>, <i>Rubber Soul</i>, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, and the sounds of Appalachian fingers on strings and mice scattering under your floorboards. The music has a few notable siblings but is married to no one, and it's hard to imagine if you haven't actually heard the stuff.</p><p>
    
    Drake self-released his first solo record in 1994; at the time, it mostly fell on deaf ears, but now it's been reissued by the U.S. branch of out-rock fountainhead ReR. <i>What Day Is It?</i> is not only Drake's most song-oriented release, it's also arguably his best, rivaled only by 2002's very different <em>The Skull Mailbox</em>. The basic sound will be familiar to fans; Drake's distinctive synthesis-- American folk and progressive rock, mixed with music that defies categorization-- hasn't changed. The songs <i>are</i> strikingly different in that, well, they're ""songs""-- verses, choruses, even ""hooks,"" idiosyncratic as they are. It's funny to see how Drake's stuff has sidestepped these notions over the years, but for beginners, I can't imagine a better gateway to his work.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""The House"" begins with dissonant, mysterious strummed chords from an acoustic guitar; the chiming of an electric guitar melody on the left and Drake's admission that ""I heard a sound, a scuttling sound / It could be a mouse, but I don't think so"" represent well the kind of black comedy/paranoid horror imagery Drake prefers. ""The Drawing"", likewise, begins with the statement: ""You always start first with my eyes, except when you're serious, then it's my ears"". The music is a rustic mix of Beatlesque melody and country-blues, but when the ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" riffery begins, the song goes from sly joke to epic jam. Seriously, I've already gotten a note from the neighbors over this one.</p><p>
    
    And speaking of jams, the machine-gun rhythm that launches ""Plates"" should sate the avant-rock crowd, just as the instrumentals ""Weeds"" and ""Spiders"" will answer the burning question: Is there a way to turn a hoedown into a prog-down? Despite the genre leaps, Drake isn't really showing off; he sounds like he's having fun, even with the many hundreds of notes that pass by in a typical song. Tracks like the buoyant ""The 13th Animal"" or the mystical, quasi-psychedelic ""Precarious Glimmering"" are unselfconscious and effortlessly motive, where almost anyone else would sound heavy-handed trying to pull them off. Again, if you haven't heard Bob Drake and aren't already put off by the references, <i>What Day Is It?</i> is a perfect primer. There really isn't anything else like it.</p></div>"|2443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2443-what-day-is-it/|8.6|Dominique Leone

    exploration of lost love-- songs about heartbreak, betrayal, and revenge, delivered so infectiously that you can't help feel like it's a mixed  
    message. The album seems to exist in the cleansing stage of a breakup, when, despite the pain and anger, things might turn  
    out OK after all. Hearts are broken, but before it's all said  
    and done, a boy's going to get the girl, a boy's going to get the boy-- damn it, someone is going to get someone.</p><p>
    
    The disc opens with the one-two punch of ""Him for Me"", a pop-punk be- 
    mine story, and ""Relationship"", about the inevitable post-salad-days  
    when things turn out to be not so perfect after all. The drums are  
    snappy, the guitars are charged and excited, and the harmonies soar.  
    Throughout the disc, the band sticks pretty close to these elements. If <em>Dear John</em> has a weakness, it's that the songs can be too monolithic. The tempo generally varies from mid-to-quick, and the tone, lyrical themes, and general structures are all  
    pretty much the same from track to track.</p><p>
    
    Of <em>Dear John</em>'s few slower tracks, ""Well, William"" is a desperate ballad  
    built on plaintive strumming and a reserved beat, while singer Colin  
    Daly embraces the haze of drugs and alcohol in order to try to understand the motives behind a boyfriend's decision to leave. Closer ""I'm"" has a similar theme to  
    ""Him for Me"", bookending the disc's lyrical elements over muted  
    guitar and a shuffling rhythm. This time around, our narrator  
    is through waiting around to be noticed, and, hard as it may be, <em>he's</em>  
    moving on. Maybe the album's titular proverbial letter is  
    directed outward after all, and the heartbreak on the other end will  
    be even worse. After all, unrequited love or not, this album is a  
    hell of a lot of fun. </p></div>"|2942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2942-dear-john/|7.0|Cory D. Byrom

    is as good as the band gets. Buzz surrounding the band stalled despite the
    single's acclaim, yet the anonymity only fueled its 1980s time capsule
    mystique. Vis-a-vis ""Love Is a Number"", <em>Kick</em> deflates the band's
    nostalgic value, much in the same way an hour-long documentary on Stuart
    Goddard's battles with mental illness would detract from Adam Ant's
    music. Flagrantly molding a
    hit single from parts of heavily-trampled touchstones seems fine, thanks
    mostly to its outright catchiness. Dragging the listener through an
    album's worth of emotional trials and tribulations, on the other hand,
    feels all been-there-done-that, unable to sustain the band's endearing
    over-the-topness.</p><p>
    Almost every track on <em>Kick</em> plays up a handful of
    electro-80s tropes, and credit's deserved for the band not trying to
    mask their influences á la most self-aware dance-rock revivalists. The
    mopey title track kicks off the album with a cross-section of goth rock
    artillery-- quickened quarter notes on the bass pedal, churning bassline,
    frigid synthline, and tortured vocals enter in staggered succession, a
    dolled-up version of the Cure's ""The Figurehead"". On ""Pig Heil Jam"",
    frontman Finn Dyke's vocals dissolve in an electrical storm of synth and
    guitar squall, one of the album's several attempts at recreating early Human
    League's signature sci-fi vocal pastiche. While the homage comes off
    respectful, chic UK producer Paul Epworth pulls out all the stops. ""Girls
    in the Back"" knows no subtlety as gauche instrumental hooks gorge every
    second Dyke's silent, and nearly every track here features a faux-trance
    breakdown where everything cuts out except the electronic drums and a few
    beeps.</p><p>
    Fact is, White Rose Movement's ""electro-clash"" 80s sound basically
    candy-coats Nine Inch Nails industrial and metrosexualizes the lyrics,
    making <em>Kick</em> pretty redundant. ""Alsatian"", for example, barrels
    through the verse on one chord, piling on vocal effects and synth
    squelches until reaching (ta-dah!) a chorus with two chords and the same
    sonic baggage. Tackiness aside though, the band displays a knack for
    hooks, even if many of them run about as cheap as ""Sunglasses at Night"".
    White Rose Movement may emit a nice turn-back-the-clock charm, but
    <em>Kick</em> commits the classic mythological errors-- it's Prometheus
    reintroducing new wave before strapping on wings and flying too close to
    the sun.</p></div>"|8813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8813-kick/|6.8|Adam Moerder

Southern man, when will you pay them back? A kinder, gentler machine gun hand. Like many musicians of his generation, Neil Young has never shied away from political statements. However, his views haven't always been easy to pigeonhole as left-leaning, complicated as they are by Nixon-empathy (""Campaigner""), his early-80s support for Reagan, and most recently, his ill-advised United 93 quickie tribute ""Let's Roll"" (not as lingeringly embarrassing as Paul McCartney's ""Freedom"", but a stumble nonetheless).</p><p>
    
    These mercurial politics have a lot to do with Young's impulsive nature; as his manager Elliot Roberts put it in Jimmy McDonough's biography <em>Shakey</em>, ""If he watches TV on the road and there's a CNN special on Bosnia, Neil wants do a record and a benefit within two days."" With his attention now directed toward the current Bush administration and Iraq war, that M.O. hasn't changed; in fact, the internet's greased distribution wheels have fueled it, allowing <em>Living With War</em> to travel from studio to stream to stores in roughly a month's time.</p><p>
    
    This fast-track approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Lyrically, <i>Living With War captures all the indignant ferocity and off-the-cuff logic of a blog-post screed: calls for impeachment, ""Mission Accomplished"" mockery, etc. Obviously, Young's not dishing out well-measured, footnoted policy analysis here, but neither is he bothering with metaphor or subtlety-- it's all direct, literal, and viscerally emotional. It's a bold move: Shooting from the hip opens Young up to a whole list of easy talking-point criticisms (""oh my god, he was </i><i>born in Canada!</i>""), and the proper-name references almost guarantee a brief shelf life.</p><p>
    
    But from a musical perspective, <em>Living With War</em>'s short gestation benefits Young's performance, inspiring him to make his loudest, rawest release of new material since at least <em>Ragged Glory</em>, maybe even <em>Rust Never Sleeps</em>. With his guitar re-tuned to its characteristic distorted snarl, and the clearly live mix preserving bum notes and sloppy harmonica or trumpet solos, Young returns to the spontaneous recording style of albums like <em>Tonight's the Night</em> that best suits his talents. Coming hot on the heels of the contemplative <em>Prairie Wind</em>, the serrated guitar of ""After the Garden"" and ""Restless Consumer"" quickly puts to rest any notion that post-aneurysm, sixty-something Neil was going to slip quietly into retirement.</p><p>
    
    The album's most effective political statement-- the decision to use a 100-strong choir for backing vocals-- has little to do with the lyrics. As unrehearsed as the main instruments, the choir is used not for pretentious ends, but as a way to turn every song into a mass protest, with Young's distinctive howl falling back into the mix behind the wall of voices on the title track or the centerpiece ""Let's Impeach the President"". Ironically, preaching to the choir <em>with</em> a choir saves Young's complaints about cable news, photo-ops, and pharmaceutical ads from succumbing to faded-hippie fogeyism.</p><p>
    
    Alongside Bruce Springsteen's <em>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</em>, <em>Living With War</em> is the second album this spring on which an elder rock statesman makes an effective protest record with a raucously communal approach, reverently covering historically heavy anthems along the way
    (""America the Beautiful"", in this case). As a political statement, however, Young's record may be more fleeting, with its topical references to steroids and New Orleans. But despite the press releases, the impulsive politics of <em>Living With War</em> are almost incidental to its success, mere fuel for Neil Young to return to the vicious sound he's neglected in recent times.</p></div>"|8856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8856-living-with-war/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

But <em>Rio Grande Blood</em>, Jourgensen's 10th proper full-length under the Ministry name and second focusing on the Bush administration, alters this trend.  On guitar is Prong frontman and former Danzig member Tommy Victor, who adds his characteristic squealing harmonics and complex, quick-fingered riffing.  Taking care of the low end is Paul Raven, also formerly of Prong, but better known for his stint with the highly influential Killing Joke.  Given that <i>Rio Grande Blood</i> is Ministry's strongest collection of tracks in more than a decade (not an overstatement-- keep in mind, we're talking <i>Filth Pig</i> era), the addition of these two from Industrial Metal's Council of Elders is not likely coincedental.</p><p>
    Musically, this album follows the same basic formula Ministry have relied on since at least <i>The Land of Rape and Honey</i>: The songs are fast-paced, the guitars chug over drum-machine beats, and Jourgensen's distorted vocals wail atop it all.  But while nothing much may have changed in Jourgensen's camp over the years, the formula isn't nearly as limiting in the hands of these musicians.  This first becomes apparent on ""Señor Peligro"", when Victor makes his presence felt with a speedy opening riff that balances palm-muting and raw fretboard friction.  He's got the chops-- and carefully laid accents-- required to pull off speed-metal riffing without sounding generic.  Gone is the computer-program sterility of recent Ministry: Victor's guitar work is dynamic and human.</p><p>
    Jourgensen's imaginative use of vocal effects helps to differentiate these songs. On ""Gangreen"", his voice is shiny and metallic, recalling 1988's ""Destruction"".  Unfortunately, it also features a guest vocal appearance by someone named Sgt. Major, allegedly a former drill instructor, who spews lame insults throughout the track.  Later, on ""LiesLiesLies"", Jourgensen's vocals are deep, gruff, and raw, much like the death metal growl characteristic of <em>Psalm 69</em>.  And though Ministry were never known for melody, their best work was always marked by subtle melodic sketches, which recur here, to powerful effect, for the first time in years.</p><p>
    Further mixing things up are additional vocal contributions from Jello Biafra (on the unfortunately titled ""Ass Clown"") and Liz Constantine (on ""Khyber Pass"").  But ultimately, <i>Rio Grande Blood</i> isn't likely to attract any new fans.  Jourgensen's attempted to branch out before without success and he now seems resigned to stick with what tends to work best.  Yes, <em>Rio Grande Blood</em> rehashes <em>Psalm 69</em>, but as long as Jourgensen has talented musicians along for the ride, Ministry could do a lot worse.</p></div>"|5311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5311-rio-grande-blood/|6.4|Cory D.

Across the course of his innumerable available (and hopelessly unavailable) recordings, Kneale has crafted his various free-form creations with an uncommon patience and a painterly eye for detail, resulting in a catalog that veers dramatically from austere electronic flutter to ferocious scorched-earth noise.</p><p>
     
    Kneale's work has become increasingly guided by the pull of black/doom metal in recent years, as best exemplified by his sludgy productions as Black Boned Angel. This inclination is in glorious display on <em>Our Love Will Destroy the World</em>, a new Birchville full-length that inseparably marries Kneale's mile-deep electric drones and jacked-up Neu!/Hawkwind propulsion to create a gnarled, ridiculously savage heavy-psych juggernaut.</p><p>
    
    On many of Birchville's past albums, such as last year's exquisite <em>With Maples Ablaze</em>, Kneale has been joined by collaborators like Reynols, Dead C's Bruce Russell, and Lee Ranaldo. It's unclear, however, whether Kneale had any guests contribute to the multi-tracked ensemble din of <em>Our Love</em>. Despite its full-band assault the album advances with such a concentrated, beam-like focus that it sounds as though it might have been transmitted onto tape directly via one man's seething brainwaves.</p><p> 
    
    Two of the five tracks here originally appeared on 2003's out-of-print <em>Screamformelongbeach CD-R. Among the others is the centerpiece, the seismic, 16-minute riff-mantra ""55,000 Flowers For the Hero"", an Acid Mothers Temple-style piledriver whose emotive impact is somewhat akin to being overtaken by a swift-flowing river of molten asphalt. Incredibly dense with massed overtones of guitar and electronics, this track appears at once monolithic yet dazzlingly intricate in its drifting shadows, shedding excess layers as it very gradually melts away to a lone specter of amp distortion. Likewise, ""Heaven's Flaming Horse"" combines sawblade drones and turbulent grindcore rhythms to forge an insoluble, corrosive mass of charred flesh and spent wiring, reducing metal's flash and bombast down to an endlessly intense, solitary roar.</em></p><p> 
    
    Following this barrage the melodic ""Lay Thy Hatred Down"" appears as an oasis of tranquility, the counterpoint of Kneale's sedate guitar and woodwind figures providing the listener a brief respite from the album's high-octane oblivion. The mysterious organ and doctored-tape drone of ""Double Cascade Mini Fantasy"" adds a welcome touch of gothic confusion; the set-closing title track is another tortured, color-saturated Sabbath riff, bombarded from all angles with random debris and piercing electronic wails. Less authoritative and hypnotic than the earlier ""55,000 Flowers"", this redundant finale comes as a slight letdown, though it is somewhat redeemed by its prolonged outro of vibrant, stray particles that careen about as if in desperate search for another unfathomable riff to ride. And judging by Kneale's overall productivity and obvious passion for Birchville's new, heavier direction, the guess here is the wait for that riff will not be long.</p></div>"|1203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1203-our-love-will-destroy-the-world/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

Which is not to say that this Canadian's second full-length is a repellent work-- just a recessive one. On each of the album's 11 cuts, words dissolve into whispered vowels, vocals into the mix's cushy mid-range, until finally the song excuses itself into the background of whatever conversation you happen to be having.</p><p>
    
    Milosh occupies a hallway, as it were, between bedroom singer-songwriter and lounge producer. His album's packaging-- an earnest black-and-white close-up of an earnest Milosh-- suggests the former, and so does the backstory. <em>Meme</em> is supposed to have a theme, and a grand one at that: the breakup with the girl who inspired his debut, <em>You Make Me Feel</em>. Problem is, judged by the standards of confessional songwriting, Milosh fails the most fundamental test: We don't hear a thing about him on the entire album. Unlike his Plug Research labelmate Mia Doi Todd, whose fascinating persona holds every note together even as she swings from plucky folk to don't ask-Dntel electro to cod reggae and back, Milosh is a complete cipher.</p><p>
    
    The good news is that we shouldn't care. Milosh is not really a James Bluntian sensitive dude, or, at any rate, he's not <em>only</em> that. He may attempt to graft a singer-songwriterly, uh, meme onto an album of sweet micro-produced electronica with barely any lyrics on it, but we don't have to fall for it. What we have on our hands is a roll of moody wallpaper that will play brilliantly, which is to say opaquely, in a Schrager-designed hotel lobby, or in any bedroom with a Barcelona chair carefully angled to ""interact"" with a strategic throw pillow. Milosh arrives at his recipe in the first ten seconds of the opener and from there never falters: treated piano loops, gentle pats of percussion (clicks-and-cuts, but nothing too sharp), and breathy vocals that denote neither sadness nor seduction, but rather, a sort of abstract luxury. ""Emo"" has so overtaken our vocabularies that it's basically become a synonym for ""plaintive""-- I have already seen the word applied to Milosh; if anything, he sounds vaguely like Sade. </p><p>
    
    The songs build vertically, by adding and subtracting textures over a basic loop; unconcerned with momentum, they start, go on for a bit, and give up the ghost with one last vanilla-scented breath. Sometimes a line breaks through, such as ""Ooh, I made you cry last night"", and then we're back to the coo. On ""Couldn't Sleep"", Milosh tries some R&amp;B; melisma, but...politely. Breakup album or not, this is essentially makeout music-- albeit scrubbed clean of any sweaty residue. The most energy the disc musters is on ""Playing With Yen"", which opens with faux-Eastern bells but acquires an urgent mid-period Depeche Mode synth riff halfway in. Naturally, this song is the closer. </p><p>
    
    I rarely get to review music this docile. This is, in itself, a respite. The background is not the worst place to be if the party is good enough. </p></div>"|5690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5690-meme/|7.0|Michael Idov

Forget their Brother J.C. Crawford moments on ""Open Up Your Door"" and their pseudo-spiritual, plantation-aping ""ain't nobody do me like Jesus"" ""Medley""; they have still duller weapons in store. Among them: Ramones familial surnames, Stooges attitude, and New York Dolls boy-as-girl-in-the-city (or Joan Jett, girl-as-boy-in-the-city) looking for action. Their sex life could be as fictional as their Doll Rod last names-- even if they play shows without clothes on, and call their new record <i>There Is a Difference</i>, as in two gender-opposite kids looking down their little shorts.</p><p>
    
    Remember how on-the-way-to-school-we-broke-all-the-rules we once were? Sometimes I think I do-- on ""Where My Baby Be"", say, where they do the chorus like debauched Angels, or on ""Booty Call"", where she calls Danny Doll Rod and says she wants action, and he tells her action is his middle name, and I imagine this happened to me once. Is ""action"" anybody's real middle name?</p><p>
    
    Lies do clear the way for good fiction. Demolition Doll Rods tell a bedtime story, the only one: Getting laid, over and over again. Drummer Christine Doll Rod is a Meg White-like bass-and-tom kicker, steady and pumping, though she's not really any good at the instrument. Add that to infinitely repetitive hooks, like ""She don't like nobody but me"" (""Baby Say Unh!"") and ""Honey yeah I wanna take you home"" (""Take You Home""), and loop the same blues lick they stick between each one, and you've got yourself a decent approximation of your standard missionary old-school sex-rock. OG jaded pervert Iggy Pop took 'em on tour with him once, and he would know.</p><p>
    
    Suppose they're not very likable, and they're nihilists in their endless focus on one idea-- fucking-- till it seems as tired as brushing your teeth, and their blues revival screech and three-chord skronk and big chorus are pushing for the grave faster every time they do them. Suppose that's the big idea. ""The first thing that you'll know? You'll be ready for the grand finale, so come on baby let's go let's go let's go let's go.""</p></div>"|2275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2275-there-is-a-difference/|5.7|Zach Baron

His true believers worry less. Despite amateurish recordings and peculiar performances, they'll say Johnston is a classic songwriter of the most traditional sort. Hear your way through <i>Welcome to My World</i>, a collection of his most memorable work, and careful listeners would have to admit the believers are onto something: There's no train wreck in the music. These 21 songs might not be the work of the Brian Wilson-level genius some like to claim, but they're far more keen than most people give them credit for-- every bit as musically satisfying as a Bob Pollard or a Jens Lekman or an Anton Newcombe, and rather more emotionally astute, too.</p>
<p>It's not the success of a savant, either. Johnston is a student of the heart of the whole pop-rock enterprise, with a musical education that comes from years spent with a piano and a Beatles songbook, changing the order of the chords around to create new sequences-- check out the sophisticated double-time changes in ""Lennon Song"". Bob Dylan's in there, too, and Elvis Costello, who Johnston impersonates with comical efficiency on ""Man Obsessed"". Beach Boys, Big Star, Hank Williams-- this stuff comes from the wellspring of pop-music basics, and Johnston knows his way around it as well as the next rock geek. He writes compelling melodies, even when he can't deliver them well, and his lyrics are well formed, coherent, and consistent in their metaphors. He can be cutting and clever (look to the devil's lines in ""Never Relaxed""), moving and seemingly wise (""Some Things Last a Long Time""), and alarmingly self-aware about his relationship with his fans (""Peek-a-Boo""). His subject matter pulls in a lot of very personal quirks, but its core lies in the same stuff everyone deals with-- lovelessness, making a living, all the good old standards. He has plenty to say about them, too, given that his illness has made all those things even more of a struggle than they already are.</p>
<p>What makes it all slightly different is the way Johnston made these songs, especially during the 1980s period so many of them come from: The most well known were recorded with only a boombox and a chord organ, in his brother's garage. The sound quality is poor, and Johnston's voice yelps and lisps, wounded and childish, making it that much stranger to hear the conviction in his playing; it's as if he doesn't think there's anything less than star-ready about this music.

His true believers worry less. Despite amateurish recordings and peculiar performances, they'll say Johnston is a classic songwriter of the most traditional sort. Hear your way through <i>Welcome to My World</i>, a collection of his most memorable work, and careful listeners would have to admit the believers are onto something: There's no train wreck in the music. These 21 songs might not be the work of the Brian Wilson-level genius some like to claim, but they're far more keen than most people give them credit for-- every bit as musically satisfying as a Bob Pollard or a Jens Lekman or an Anton Newcombe, and rather more emotionally astute, too.</p>
<p>It's not the success of a savant, either. Johnston is a student of the heart of the whole pop-rock enterprise, with a musical education that comes from years spent with a piano and a Beatles songbook, changing the order of the chords around to create new sequences-- check out the sophisticated double-time changes in ""Lennon Song"". Bob Dylan's in there, too, and Elvis Costello, who Johnston impersonates with comical efficiency on ""Man Obsessed"". Beach Boys, Big Star, Hank Williams-- this stuff comes from the wellspring of pop-music basics, and Johnston knows his way around it as well as the next rock geek. He writes compelling melodies, even when he can't deliver them well, and his lyrics are well formed, coherent, and consistent in their metaphors. He can be cutting and clever (look to the devil's lines in ""Never Relaxed""), moving and seemingly wise (""Some Things Last a Long Time""), and alarmingly self-aware about his relationship with his fans (""Peek-a-Boo""). His subject matter pulls in a lot of very personal quirks, but its core lies in the same stuff everyone deals with-- lovelessness, making a living, all the good old standards. He has plenty to say about them, too, given that his illness has made all those things even more of a struggle than they already are.</p>
<p>What makes it all slightly different is the way Johnston made these songs, especially during the 1980s period so many of them come from: The most well known were recorded with only a boombox and a chord organ, in his brother's garage. The sound quality is poor, and Johnston's voice yelps and lisps, wounded and childish, making it that much stranger to hear the conviction in his playing; it's as if he doesn't think there's anything less than star-ready about this music. These are things indie rock fans have been known to cherish, but only so long as they feel like the person on the other end of the tape is just like them-- self-conscious, <i>wilfully</i> amateurish, in on the ""joke.""

In a certain     respect, Mott the Hoople's biggest hit (and only contribution to American     classic rock playlists) fits right in: ""All the Young Dudes"" is upfront with     its sexual desire and horny, twenty-something lust. There is one catch: It's also a celebration of the glam's gender-bending aesthetic.</p>
<p>At the time of its release, Mott the     Hoople were wallowing in obscurity despite releasing four albums of high-powered boogie. They were ready to pack it in, but David Bowie encouraged them to soldier on, offering Mott the chance to record ""Suffragette     City"". The band, though, wanted ""Drive-In Saturday"", which Bowie wasn't     willing to part with. ""All the Young Dudes"" was the compromise. In the     short term, Bowie came out looking the genius, as the band briefly achieved     the stardom they felt was rightfully theirs, kicking out their two best     albums in the process. But it couldn't last, and by 1974, guitarist Mick     Ralphs was off playing in Bad Company and Mott faded back to the margins.</p>
<p>Mott the Hoople are still a widely respected and influential band, and it's pretty easy to     hear why-- they've got the swagger, confidence, and riffs of glam and the basic     approach of punk. That's not to mention vocalist Ian Hunter, whose voice was     so limited and colorless that he probably made more than a few kids with     guitars think ""if this guy can sing in a band, surely I can."" The band, however, found countless ways to work around     Hunter, from melodic harmonizing on the choruses that he could yelp and     talk-sing over to clever lead guitar parts that Ralphs used to inject     hooks into the verses.</p>
<p>So Hunter becomes the everyman, just trying to get by, and the tension     between the band's chops and his lack of skill and range is oddly poignant.     <i>All the Young Dudes closes with the dejected piano ballad ""Sea Diver"", a     crushingly sad song that uses a diving bell as a metaphor for being trapped     in a failed relationship. Hunter's inability to get through half an octave     without cracking or morphing into a dock worker's shout sucks out all the     maudlin potential of the piano part and string arrangement, turning them     instead into a kind of security blanket. It's a strikingly emotional     capstone to an album that mostly trades in funky rock and roll and     leather-pantalooned swagger.</i></p>
<p><i>Young Dudes highlight ""Sucker"" is a slow, cowbell-guided rocker adorned with sax     interjections from Bowie; it features a killer call-and-response between a harpsichord and a wordless backing vocal phrase on its chorus. The reissue appends a thunderous live version that     suggests the band's true power wasn't really captured on any of its records.     However, there's also a live version of ""Sweet Jane"" that's as forgettable     as the studio version that leads off the original album. Conventional     revisionist rock crit wisdom says this is a five-star record, but in truth     it's not even close, and that song is a big part of the reason.</i></p>
<p>Elsewhere, a primordial version of ""Ready for Love"" pales in comparison to     the version Bad Company took into the charts two years later, but the band     gets in some strong hard boogie tunes on ""Momma's Little Jewel"" (the early     demo version added here, called ""Black Scorpio"", is even nastier) and ""One     of the Boys"", the rocking follow-up single to ""All the Young Dudes"".     Bowie-philes will love the version of ""All the Young Dudes"" featuring his     vocal, even though it's weaker than the version everyone     knows.</p>
<p><i>Mott</i> follows the band's biggest moment with a concept album     about rock'n'roll success. You could argue that they'd hardly experienced     enough fame to complain about it, but the songs are so humane     and devoid of self-pity that it's impossible to hold it against them. ""All     the Way From Memphis"" opens the album with a charging piano rhythm, and the     harmony vocals on the chorus are one of the band's catchiest moments.     It's a classic song in waiting, a nearly perfect throwback to the first rock     era.</p>
<p>If the whole album stuck to that kind of meat-and-potatoes brilliance, the     band could have been sitting on a masterpiece, but the songs on     which they depart from the basics aren't nearly as compelling. ""Violence""     offers stark evidence that weird wasn't their territory, as Hunter     sounds more drunk than unhinged on the off-kilter chorus, and interludes of people     shouting and arguing add little more than expendable shots of surreal     humor. Ralphs gets in an     interesting solo on ""Drivin' Sister"", as he interrupts the band's headlong     boogie and gets busy with the volume pedal, mimicking a steel guitar. ""The     Ballad of Mott the Hoople"" nods to the band's Dylan influence with its     rambling lament that ""rock'n'roll's a loser's game"" and humming Hammond     organ, but closer ""I Wish I Was Your Mother"" takes it even further,     appropriating the dusky ambiance of Dylan's work with the Band and adding     mandolin and harmonica to the equation.</p>
<p>The band goes exploring on the second half of ""I'm a Cadillac/El     Camino Dolo Roso"", cooking up a spooky groove over which Ralphs' searching slide guitar solo directly points the way to his work on     Bad Company's first album. Rumor has it that Ralphs left Mott the Hoople     because a song he had written was out of Hunter's vocal range, an obstacle     he never had with Paul Rodgers singing his stuff. Hunter and the rest of the     gang kept on going, logically titling their next album <i>The Hoople</i>, but it     wasn't quite the same, and Hunter eventually struck out on his own as well, leaving this sometimes overlooked band with roughly the level of fame their music merited-- a     couple of hits and a sizable cult following.</p></div>"|11786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11786-all-the-young-dudes-mott/|7.8|Joe Tangari

The
    number of good ones can be counted on two hands, if you're feeling
    particularly generous, and the number of bad ones would give an EPA director
    night sweats over all that future landfill space. (And that's before we get
    into the string quartet tributes or jazz remix discs.) There are so many
    variables going into each one-- the unfuckwithability of the original
    compositions, the skill set of the interpreters, the compiler's choices of
    both song and artist-- that their uniform awfulness is kind of amazing. And I
    can't imagine there's much money in them. And yeah, this one sucks, too.</p><p>
    Serge Gainsbourg is one of the 20th century's great perverts. I mean, fuck
    music, Gainsbourg would make Boccaccio blush. A Russian Jew
    whose parents fled to Paris from the Bolsheviks, Gainsbourg studied art,
    painted, and eventually found his way into a musical. He was far from a
    pin-up and initially wanted to just write the songs, not sing them. But in
    the late 1960s, Gainsbourg met, befriended, and eventually bedded Brigitte
    Bardot, with whom he recorded a string of duets whose overripe arrangements
    were only matched by their leering eroticism. After splitting from Bardot,
    Gainsbourg repeated the trick with Jane Birkin. A wit, a wag, and a dirty
    old man, Gainsbourg was the stereotype of the literate, oversexed Frenchman
    come to life. And though his commercial fame peaked in the early 70s, his
    work only became more complex and, well, filthy as time went on. (And
    really, the fact that his only remote American hit, ""Je T'aime...Mon Non Plus""
    stalled at No. 69-- how good is that?) He died in 1991.</p><p>
    So lets get a bunch of English-speaking artists to pay homage to him. And
    then, wait for it, lets <i>translate the lyrics into English. Badly. (Oh
    and the titles too, for good measure.) Think about that for a minute. An
    artist known for his subtle wordplay, puns, and allusions run through Alta
    Vista Babelfish and fact-checked by an 8th grade French class. Have you
    clicked off the review yet?</i></p><p>
    Things don't fare much better on the musical end. A decade ago, Tricky
    could have turned ""Au Revoir Emmannuel"" into something dark, demonic, and
    sexy. Today he's, well, Tricky in 2006. Likewise, the inclusion of
    meat-and-potatoes Britrock band the Rakes is baffling, since they deliver a
    meat-and-potatoes Britrock rendition of ""Le Poinconneur des Lilas"". A
    Futureheads rendition would have been goofy, like a teenage boy trying to
    write erotica, but at least would have had a certain charm to it. And could
    anyone be more <i>wrong for the ironic twists of Gainsbourg songs than
    the ultra-earnest Michael Stipe? (Oh, Brian Molko, you and your yarl can fuck
    back off to the 90s.)</i></p><p>
    The slim, so to speak, highlights: You have to assume that the old man would
    have approved of Chan Marshall and Karen Elson's version of ""Je
    T'aime""-- almost a parody of breathy, laconic-to-the-point-of-catatonia female
    delivery. The Kills strip down ""Le Chanson De Slogan"" to its frame and take
    it as black as their hair. Portishead sound thinner and less glutinous than
    they did a decade ago, closer to the rustic ambience of the Beth Gibbons
    solo album (though that old ""Sour Times"" melodrama would have worked a treat
    in this context). And Jarvis Cocker and Marc Almond are the only two people
    on this record who should be covering Serge Gainsbourg, even if both are a
    bit too panto for their own good. With a more imaginative compiler--and
    fewer Big Names whose fame peaked years ago-- <i>Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited could
    have turned out so much different. Just imagine Matthew Herbert (who's
    already remixed ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to great effect) and Roísín Murphy

Yellow Swans, so that the ""D"" can stand for, you know, different things-- tends to hide just how well-meaning they can be when they're not trying so hard. The first Yellow Swans studio full-length came titled <i>Bringing the Neon War Home</i>, cause that's what they wanted to do; here, they call for <i>Psychic Secession</i>, because that's where they're headed. Leader Pete Swanson wants to bring us along: ""From false election to fear conspiracy/ I had to change my mind/Psychic secession/ We have to change our minds"".</p><p> 
    
    Swanson and fellow Swan Gabriel Mindel Saloman are third-way guys-- oppositional, yes, but inclusive as well. The line ""I woke up with dreams in my life"" from the song ""I Woke Up"" rings twice: Once lyrically, and once at the song's 5:10 mark, when their decaying and nihilistic junk gets brought back to life with just handclaps and a skipping drum machine. The track's ensuing effects are spun out and yo-yoed back with charisma; the beats stitched together by three additional percussion credits.</p><p>
    
    Of their brethren in beats-- Forcefield, Mindflayer, Wolf Eyes-- Yellow Swans' noise is less crowd-oriented in the neck-injuring sense, but more catchy: They get up into not just your gut, but your friend's, too. In their common denominating way, Yellow Swans feel (but don't sound) like Swanson's other part-time pastime, Badgerlore, who united their friends by hanging out in the woods away from it all on <i>Stories for Owls</i>, a forest in which everybody got to play an instrument. </p><p>
    
    ""True Union"", a song that asks to ""seal us in a true union,"" takes the ghostly delicacy of Badgerlore and applies to it feedback and backbeats built of fuzz. Cinematic in scope but comfortable in scale, it's calming, jittery, and, just when they've got you on their team, violent: Bellowing arching screams and vocoder, oceanic wave-crash, and electronic burns make whatever peaceful union they forge into a threat. </p><p>
    
    There are those who want Yellow Swans, like they want fellow former Narnack roster guys Parts and Labor, to ""save"" noise from itself: put a beat to it, melody on top of it, or bring hooks-- to make the stuff sound unlike itself. But if the Load Records tag on <i>Psychic Secession</i> didn't clue you, Yellow Swans aren't pandering or fleeing their pack: They <i>are</i> those outsider dudes, not salesmen. If their pitch is attractive, maybe it's not them; maybe it's you. </p></div>"|8912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8912-psychic-secession/|7.5|Zach Baron

    1992, around the time the band released its full-length debut, and left for the West Coast in
    1997, within weeks of its breakup. Even during that vibrant peroid, it was an underdog city; since then, the best local clubs
    have been bulldozed and the indie record store that signed my checks
    went kaput. Still, New Brunswick possesses a rock aura largely because
    of Lifetime (and, okay, the Bouncing Souls) and the subsequent success of Thursday, a band who likely
    wouldn't have existed without their elders.</p><p>
    Unlike many other hardcore favorites, Lifetime progressed substantially over the course of their career-- their
    last two albums, <em>Hello Bastards</em> (1995) and <em>Jersey's Best Dancers</em>
    (1997)-- are their best work and classics in the genre. Why bother with the history? Because those two records are the reason <em>Somewhere in
    the Swamps of Jersey</em> exists. Angular, honed, stuffed with feedback,
    lyrically taut, they deliver resonant pop-hardcore shards that transcend
    the ""emo"" tag by a mile. There are those complexly
    scissor-fight guitar parts, fault-line structures, and muscular drums,
    but the centerpieces are Ari Katz's poetic pen and exploded monotone, the
    latter which comes off agitated, bored, and heartsick all in the same
    line.</p><p>
    Katz slurs his best lyrics, chopping sentences into weird
    line breaks. The effect is weirdly hypnotic. It doesn't get more heartbreakingly introspective (and
    introspectively triumphant) than ""Hey Catrine"" or more carefully
    observed than memorizing the map a girl squints in ""Turnpike Gates"".
    Plus, even just looking at <em>Hello Bastards</em>' appropriation of the
    Housemartins <em>London O Hull 4</em>'s cover art, it was clear they were lighting out into more interesting territory than your average post-Minor Threat
    youth crew.</p><p>
    The older, baggy-pants material isn't as strong, but it possesses a
    raw, charismatic appeal and melodic sense lacking in most East Coast straightedge rock. <em>Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey</em> makes this early, pre-Jade Tree
    work available en masse: The self-titled New Age records 7"", the ""Tinnitus"" 7""
    EP, three versions of the <em>Background</em> LP-- straight up, remixed, and as a live set-- compilation tracks,
    and a pair of covers (Billy Bragg's ""New England"" and Embrace's ""Money"").</p><p>
<em>Background</em> is historically important, but it's awkward as a three-peat. I appreciate ""You"" and ""Thanks"" (sounding very Hüsker Dü in its
    remixed form), but three times? That said, the most interesting take
    is the 2005 overhaul: It's sharper, brighter, the guitars more pronounced, the drums super-sized. It's so superior to the original that it seems odd they bothered including the old version on the
    unnecessary second disc. It's nice for purists to have both that and the live archival stuff, but otherwise the second slab feels like a justification for the 52-page perfect-bound booklet, which comes amply packed with liner notes, lyrics, and photographs. Those visual accouterments are great, but why not pack disc two with additional rarities or practice tapes?</p><p>
    Whatever my gripes, disc one's tight. It's great to listen again to
    ""Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey"", originally released as the
    superior B-side to the ""Boy's No Good"" 7"". Same goes for 1994's
    ""Ferret"", which takes a minute or so to kick into a quicker gear;
    when it does, it shifts to a blissfully emotive harmony. ""Isae Aldy Beausoleil"" and the rest of the stuff
    from the <em>Seven Inches</em> compilation is here as well, but the real collector
    gems are previously unreleased remixes of <i>Jersey's Best
    Dancers material: A mellow, differently enunciated ""Young, Loud, and
    Scotty"" and a fuzzed-out ""Bringin' It Backwards"", featuring a less explosive
    mosh coda than the album version. The rawer ""Theme Song For a New
    Brunswick Basement Show"" is appealing in its apropos basement-karaoke quality.</i></p><p>
    But why Lifetime? Why now? As most folks know, they recently
    signed to Decaydance, a subsidiary of Fueled By Ramen run by Fall Out
    Boy's Pete Wentz. Cynics and angsty teens are shaking their
    heads, but Lifetime were climaxing when they split and remain friends
    (or, at least friendly), so why not? In their first incarnation, New
    Brunswick's finest delivered their sounds in a tiny van, crashing on
    friends' popcorn strewn floors. Their music has always reflected that
    road-wizened, pre-Warped Tour sensibility-- the production never
    slick, but always tight. That in mind, guessing which direction the
    band takes with the new record will be fascinating. Wisely, they're
    sticking with Steve Evetts, who recorded their last two records. Smart,
    because their legacy could largely depend on it (no pressure, dudes).
    But whatever, even if they weren't returning to hopefully breathe some
    life into a fairly stale genre, <em>Somewhere in the Swamps of Jersey</em>
    successfully provides a snapshot of an important moment in hardcore and post-hardcore before it become a million-dollar industry. Here's
    hoping they get some of that cake, too.</p></div>"|4781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4781-somewhere-in-the-swamps-of-jersey/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

At first the title only <i>seems</i> sarcastic-- when you listen to the album, it turns out it's just honest, if humorously so. The disc features Yo La Tengo and a few friends flat-out slaughtering other people's songs in on-air performances during WFMU fundraisers. It makes sense that this collection of bootleg-quality recordings of unrehearsed covers would be associated with WFMU, given the freeform radio station's legendary penchant for incorrect and outsider music, and the saving grace of the whole thing is that no one involved is taking it remotely seriously.</p>
<p>The deal is this: The members of Yo La Tengo were trying to think of a way they could help their favorite radio station (it, like the band, is located in Northeast New Jersey, although you can tune in from anywhere in the world via their <a href=""http://www.wfmu.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">website</span></a>). Then it struck them that they could perform requests live on the air in exchange for pledges of support. The trick was that they had to play each request on the spot, with no rehearsal or time to remember little things like, say, lyrics. They did it first in 1996, and it's since become a hugely entertaining annual tradition. Gathering requested covers from 1996-2003, <i>Murdering</i> is temporarily charming and fun, but inevitably, its 30 tracks (over 76 minutes!) are a gruelling slog.</p>
<p>To be fair, the band members know music inside and out, as the well-rehearsed covers that populate their records (covers album <i>Fakebook</i>, in particular) and concerts demonstrate. Additionally, they have a jazzier sensibility than most rock bands, so interpretation isn't beyond them. But those hoping for anything even close to the ballpark of their studio albums clearly haven't read the warnings all over the band's own website, which kindly inform prospective listeners not to expect much. Besides, they do have a proper album planned for later this year.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at is, should you order the disc, you're not really buying a Yo La Tengo album. You're not even buying a live album. You're buying a comedy record, for all intents. The bit where Ira Kaplan forgets the second verse of Three Dog Night's ""Mama Told Me (Not to Come)"", and wisecracks about the band's singer, is great-- though not nearly as funny as the version of Archie Bell &amp; the Drells' ""Tighten Up"" that opens the album. Kaplan's exhortations to ""tighten up on the drums now, Georgia"" are so hilariously geeky they actually sort of work, and both he and fellow guitarist Bruce Bennett (who joined the band for these fundraisers) accidentally come in when Kaplan calls for the bass. James McNew doesn't exactly know the bassline anyway, but he gives it his best shot.</p>
<p>There are a few songs Yo La Tengo really nail, like the Modern Lovers' ""Roadrunner"", which Ira spikes with a blistering guitar solo. It's also fitting that they'd turn in a competent rendition of NRBQ's ""Captain Lou"", given that the cult band's cover-request shows were the inspiration for Yo La Tengo's own fundraising appearances. And I honestly cannot believe how well Kaplan remembers the verse lyrics to Huey ""Piano"" Smith's ""Sea Cruise""-- never mind Doug Sahm's ""Mendocino"". On the opposite end of the spectrum, the band's take on Yes' ""Roundabout"" is side-splittingly inept, with someone basically leaning on an organ to approximate Rick Wakeman, while the version of Bachman-Turner Overdrive's ""You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet"" is just plain ghastly (and yet considerably less annoying than the original).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the album's best moments are attributable to inspired listener requests. By far the most imaginative of these is the old promotional song ""Meet the Mets"", a jingle advertising New York's less appreciated baseball franchise. What's more impressive is that the band actually knows all the words to it. Later, recalling their <i>Genius + Love</i> collaboration with Daniel Johnston on his ""Speeding Motorcycle"", a young caller named Lela sings ""Route 66"" over the phone while the band plays softly in the background. It's so genuinely sweet that the band's uncertaintly over the chord sequence doesn't much matter. But again, while these are great moments on the air, they don't exactly translate to replay value, so the disc, packaged inside Adrian Tomine's fantastic artwork, becomes just a keepsake for fans of the band and WFMU (or anyone who ever wanted to hear the Knack, the Beach Boys, Sonic Youth, and Bonzo Dog Band in the same ramshackle medley).</p>
<p>In short, this is the kind of thing that would have been a fan-club disc back in the 90s. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but much as I love Yo La Tengo, WFMU (possibly the greatest radio station in existence, by the way), and the general idea, it's difficult to give this a genuine recommendation. Instead, save your money for next year's WFMU fundraiser: Tune in, make a pledge, request a song, and brace yourself. It's for a good cause.</p></div>"|8873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8873-yo-la-tengo-is-murdering-the-classics/|4.1|Joe Tangari

Now, I'm not so oblivious as to have missed the luminance of Ms. Dion's starpower, but as a marketable icon, Dion seems a bit hollow, and buying a $250 tracksuit with her name emblazoned on it seems a little like buying merchandise celebrating water or air. This is, after all, a performer whose big-budget Vegas revue features a Cirque du Soleil knockoff troupe to compensate for her shortage of stage presence.</p><p>
    
    Rainer Maria are far from having a replica historical amphitheater built for their performances, never mind the attached gift shop, but over the course of their five-album career their sound has traveled a path toward the kind of big-voice/big-message concept that would pack 'em in at an indie casino (Cosloy's Palace?). Once upon a time, the trio rode the second or third wave of emo, with Kyle Fischer and Caithlin De Marrais hurling raw harmonies at each other like Fleetwood Mac cum Fugazi. But after mastering that dynamic on the first song of their first full-length (""Tinfoil"") the band has refocused their vocal spotlight to train solely on De Marrais.</p><p>
    
    In a technical sense, De Marrais' pipes are powerful enough to carry the band's load, especially now that they don't have to deal with intrusion of Fischer's indie-boy yelp. However, the band has also streamlined their songwriting, whittling away the unconventional turns and multiple pre-choruses that made their earlier material more interesting, leaving emotionally aerodynamic compositions free of atonal snags or polyrhythmic left-turns. Rainer Maria may still be writing love songs, but the relationships of <em>Catastrophe Keeps Us Together</em> appear thematically and musically less complicated and knotty.</p><p>
    
    Even with an occasionally dark-tinged lens, <em>Catastrophe</em>'s hearts will go on in widescreen style. The title track turns a grim apocalyptic vision into a repopulation fantasy, De Marrais belting out, ""At the end of the world, I'm gonna find you,"" in true end-credits fashion. Elsewhere, ""Love is...""-like statements are dropped, instructions for relationship success are dispensed, and acoustic guitars are played crisply. Not every
    story has a happy ending, but songs like ""Life of Leisure"" and ""Already Lost"" don't have anywhere near the meltdown of a good old De Marrais/Fischer
    screaming match-- and the vocab-heavy narrations fall short of disguising their cloying, cliched sentiments.</p><p>
    
    Fischer's input throughout is restricted to his guitar, which continues Rainer Maria's trend of focusing mostly on echobox atmosphere rather than serrations. Problem is, the punchier parts still sound the best, the four-chord mantra of ""Bottle"" or the overdrive-drenched darting between the drums of ""I'll Make You Mine"" standing out relative to the spacier, flimsier tones of their reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's ""I'll Keep It With Mine"".</p><p>
    
    It's useless to keep wishing hard for the heady days of the mid-90s; like the rest of us, the members of Rainer Maria are different people than they were 10 years ago. But it's still discouraging to see a band that once painted such accurate sound pictures of the complexities of love go the primary-color route of the power-ballad, snipping off the loose ends and hangnails that formerly propelled their relationship updates. Like the anthemic stylings of Ms. Dion, <em>Catastrophe</em>'s valentines are direct and glossy, but ultimately as hollow as a gift-shop bauble-- a brand
    unworthy of a tracksuit.</p></div>"|6672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6672-catastrophe-keeps-us-together/|4.8|Rob Mitchum

Cars fly. Wiseacre robot maids work tirelessly yet display the full range of human emotion. Dogs talk, but with catastrophic speech impediments to reassure us that we're still their betters. The subtext is that advanced technology equals richer lives, <em>ipso facto</em>. But then the weird and unfathomable digital age swept that analog idyll into history's dustbin. I understand my old record player, but have no significant grasp of how my computer works. The majority is reliant on devices that only an elite minority knows how to build and repair. We're skeptical of progress and intimidated by our increasingly inscrutable machines, which make us feel isolated and over-stimulated. No wonder digital technology in music, from Radiohead to Godspeed, is often deployed as a tacit critique of the world it's creating, an embodiment of homogeneity, alienation, and dread.</p><p> 
    
    Since the turn of the millennium, the Ann Arbor-based electronic music label Ghostly International has stewarded everything from house to ambient, digital pop to electroclash. This label primer is divided into two discs: <em>Avant-Pop</em> showcases Ghostly's more upbeat and structured artists, while the enigmatically titled <em>SMM</em> disc airs out comparatively amorphous fare. But there's some slippage in these characterizations: Benoit Pioulard's ""The Depths &amp; the Seashore"" (from the <em>Avant-Pop</em> disc), with its hypnotic acoustic guitar and spare percussion, would make as much sense on <em>SMM</em>; likewise, the skittering drums and ice-blue melody of Cepia's ""Hoarse"" wouldn't be out of place on <em>Avant-Pop</em>. This malleability is just one of several things that make this comp at least as good, if not better, than individual LPs by the artists it features.</p><p> 
    
    Ghostly artists don't know from technophobia or human obsolescence. Their music is united by a utopian bent, a childlike wonder at technology's capacity to express and celebrate the individual spirit. This spirit is evoked by the music's overarching lyricism and its endless variety within narrow parameters. The palette isn't very diverse-- drum machines and samplers, synths and sequencers-- nor is it used very diversely. Throughout <em>Idol Tryouts</em>, precisely molded drums scatter in soft configurations around silent downbeats; bass rubberizes; house beats crest and subside like whitecaps on the sea; melodies shimmer in high-end digital decay. </p><p> 
    
    Yet each artist manages to put their own unique stamp on these stock varieties like endless variations on the same essential face. Solvent serves up springy, burnished new wave. Dabrye's durable, staticky instrumental hip-hop sings with sampled woodwinds. Matthew Dear's clicky haunted house stomps in iron boots, while Outputmessage's track cascades down in pinging, elastic waves. Loscil's offering finds supple, jittery beats struggling to escape from a glittering black morass. Greg Davis pits raucous acoustic guitar against an ambient pastel wash. Twine scans across alien radio bandwidth, while Deru recasts the sound of trickling water as svelte electro pop. The often wordless yet consistently eloquent beauty of <em>Idol Tryouts Two</em> sounds a resounding rebuke to the idea that electronic music is cold and unemotional; that it all sounds the same; that guitars and human voices are the only true paths to expression. It's also a testament to the idea that technology can be an agent of freedom and delight, not control and anxiety, when humans use it as a tool and not a crutch. </p></div>"|1898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1898-idol-tryouts-two-ghostly-international-vol-two/|8.0|Brian Howe

But it isn't merely the contemporary cred signifiers that make Lovely Feathers a potential hype band; it's the music.</p><p>
    
    Armed with a sophisticated pop sensibility, the Lovely Feathers are never short of musical ideas, as they spastically shift tempo, volume, and style in highly compressed spaces. The songs are unpredictable, leaping from barely-there strumming and whispered vocals to bombastic full-band arrangements. Album opener ""Pope John Paul"", for example, effortlessly packs at least five different parts-- only two of which repeat-- into less than four minutes.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the band's eccentric approach to songwriting is mirrored in its disastrously quirky lyrics. Pop music needn't be literate or even literary to be great, of course, but too many of these songs are marred by distractingly precious words. Often the delivery is tongue-in-cheek; elsewhere, cringe-inducers like ""I like the chapped skin above your eyes/ Even when you complain about my hives"" from ""Mildly Decorated"" are sung with what sounds like conviction. Such couplets, when paired with this high level of musical invention, mark the Lovely Feathers as heirs to the Unicorns' legacy of smart-ass pop. But where the Unicorns managed to situate their cloyingly cutesy lyrics in an album-wide concept about death, there's no such coherence here, just grating loose ends. Sometimes the lyrics manage to be amusing, but mostly they're as irritating as the aforementioned chapped skin and hives. </p><p>
    
    Still, there's strong evidence here that the Lovely Feathers are a superb indie pop group in the making; enough, even, to make you forget the lackluster lyrics. ""In the Valley"" is the band at its tightest, as the thumping bass of its disco-tinged intro gives way to razor-sharp guitar interplay and a swooning string section. ""Wrong Choice"" is classic indie rock in the Weezer vein, with sing-along verses and swelling choruses. </p><p>
    
    The Lovely Feathers have the potential to shape their ideas into something more focused, and the songs on <em>Hind Hind Legs</em> would have carried more weight had they not been sabotaged by silliness and fluffy wordplay. Maybe Yanofsky had this in mind on ""Ooh You Shocked Me"", when he sang, ""Who has a heart? I have a heart."" Perhaps next time, he'll prove that sentiment to be more than just another ironic line. </p></div>"|5005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5005-hind-hind-legs/|7.6|John Motley

The genre tag ubiquitously and properly applied to
    Röyksopp's brand of smooth, pre-dawn electronic-pop must forever
    endure over-hyphenated allusions to its status as the turn-of-the-Y2K
    high-end retail-shopping soundtrack of choice (uh, see?). Those who
    have heard Röyksopp's two albums, 2002's <em>Melody A.M.</em> and last
    year's <em>The Understanding</em>, won't be surprised to learn the
    Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to
    the speakers at yer local Crate &amp; Barrel. And yet the live
    <em>Röyksopp's Night Out EP</em> isn't completely unlike that store's
    unnecessary baubles.</p><p>
    Put it on your wedding registry: ""What Else Is There"", in which touring singer Anneli
    Drecker does a great impression of the Knife's Karin Dreijer's
    studio-version Björk impression, while Röyksoppers TorbjØrn Brundtland
    and Svein Berge lay out their template of club-thumping drum pads and
    Airy analogue synths. ""Only This Moment"" finds the frontmen coolly
    engaging in Depeche Mode mode with guest sighs/moans from
    the excellent Kate Havnevik. ""Poor Leno (Istanbul Forever Take)""
    spreads open the original like a starless night sky, albeit dropping
    the vocals. An intense ""Remind Me"" rides fashion-show guitars, which
    work despite the replacement of Erlend Øye with a vocoder.</p><p>
    And, yes, Röyksopp do perform Queens of the Stone Age's ""Go With the
    Flow"", the primary reason the Norwegian band's longtime fans will want this
    record. Its bleak death-wish lyrics and martial melody make surprising
    sense amid rocket-propelled synths and understated vocals, but the
    cover's still a curio when laid beside Röyksopp's superior, original
    compositions. Plus, the eight-minute ""Alpha Male"" is the same
    lasers-firing space obelisk dropped on the <em>What Else Is There?
    EP</em> like, three months ago. Well, we already done reviewed that,
    and most people who wanted it probably already bought it.</p><p>
    Like a $49.95 designer urn or a $79.95 lasagna pan, <em>Röyksopp's

EP|259.0|Arctic Monkeys|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Domino']|2006-04-25 00:00:00|2006|2016-06-11 20:45:35.192143|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1nf9nlm9v5s.1.6:0.1.0.$498/=1$498.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Five-song EP <em>Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?</em> is the English quartet's first new release since it became the year's most-talked-band and, oh dear, it's largely about dealing with sudden fame and its unfortunate consequences-- the obligations of touring, the demands of fans, the inevitability of backlash. This is nothing new for the Monkeys-- ""The View From the Afternoon"" kicks off their debut LP with a warning that ""Anticipation has a habit to set you up/ For disappointment in evening entertainment,"" and tellingly that's the <em>Whatever People Say I Am...</em> track featured here. Thesis statement laid out, half of <em>Who the Fuck</em>'s new tracks are less about the experience of being young and bored and smartly observant, the combination that, to date, has colored their best tracks, but about the experience of being the Arctic Monkeys themselves-- still young, sometimes bored, but their vision now limited to a tour itinerary or press clippings, and unable to successfully articulate why that's so frustrating.</p><p>
    For the listener, it's easy to spot the chief problem: Songs about the need and drive to become rock and roll stars are more powerful and interesting than the ones about the experience of <em>being</em> a rock and roll star-- just ask Noel Gallagher. Arctic Monkeys singer and lyricist Alex Turner-- an expressive storyteller with a keen eye for detail and a deceptively sly wit-- seems well-equipped to navigate the divide between talking as one of the kids and talking to the kids, so perhaps his stumbles are more a shell-shocked response to the speed in which they gained their fame than a fundamental flaw. The EP's defensive title track comes across as a poor decision, a dispatch from the other side of the velvet rope that moves between communicating directly with their fans (""Your heroes aren't what they seem/ When you've been where we've been"") to dismissing johnny-come-latelys to admitted bouts of paranoia. The stick to your guns/last gang in town tone of the thing is admirable-- lord knows, rock could use a bit of swagger-- but it has a bit of a ""famous last words"" quality to it, reading like that ""Declaration of Principles"" that came back to bite Charles Foster Kane in the ass.</p><p>
    ""Despair in the Departure Lounge"" is about, you guessed it, missing your girl when you're on the road. And sure, it's a cliché, but it eventually unfolds as an unexpected gesture from a lyricist who's often guarded, reserving his empathy for his characters (and, on ""A Certain Romance"", for his could-be enemies) and putting up a front with regards to himself. The moment when the song redeems its cookie-cutter nature is its third verse, and it hits not because of what Turner says but how he says it, slowing his voice into a wobbly quiver that mimics both the haze of travel and the hallucinatory nature of the lyric (""Yesterday, I saw a girl/ Who looked like someone you might knock about with/ And almost shouted""). It's reminiscent of the aforementioned Gallagher's exhausted solo acoustic turn on Oasis B-side ""Talk Tonight"".</p><p>
    The other two new tracks are a third-tier character sketch (""Cigarette Smoker Fiona"") and an understated ballad (""No Buses""), with the latter serving as the record's grower and most thoroughly satisfying track. So, more a reiteration of their mission statement than a new record, the hint of ferociousness and fight on the title track is a positive sign; that the band feels backed into a corner by the manner and speed in which it gained fame isn't. It would be churlish and archaic to insist in 2006 that bands drive around in a van for x number of months in order to ""earn"" success when they can efficiently and quickly cover the distance of the globe with a single mp3. (Gnarls Barkley, the UK market's <em>other</em> recent digital-age sensation, presumably get a free pass because they're industry vets.) If people already have their knives out for the Arctic Monkeys, the band would do best to ignore them and move on rather than address the issue itself in song. After all, the surest way to deflect backlash is to make good music.</p></div>"|498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/498-who-the-fuck-are-arctic-monkeys-ep/|5.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Could <i>Back to the Web represent a retreat to their Athens lair, hidden dark in the recesses of Elephant 6 psych-pop or perhaps buried deep beneath Orange Twin, the group's 150-acre land conservation project? Could this album be a dramatic regrouping, a realigning of priorities and personnel to better capture their early, hazy pop bliss?</i></p><p>
    
    Doubtful.</p><p>
    
    Certainly <i>Back to the Web is the best and most confident Elf Power have sounded in years. The band has finally managed to integrate its 1960s folk fetish with its 70s rock jones-- two elements that are encoded in the group's collective DNA but have been squarely at odds with each other most of the time. Elf Power are doing something right, but interpreting the album title as career commentary might be giving them more credit that they deserve. For all the record's improvement on the band's sound, Elf Power remain completely unself-aware, with little to no idea of their strengths and weaknesses, which, admittedly, have shifted subtly since their last outing.</i></p><p>
<i>Back to the Web starts strong: ""Come Lie Down with Me (and Sing My Song)"" provides a low-key yet confident introduction, with Heather McIntosh's cello carrying an elegantly subdued melody. As the opener flows into the more upbeat ""An Old Familiar Scene"", the tempo remains checked and consistent-- unfortunately, it doesn't change much at all across these dozen tracks-- the same regulated rush of sound, lead by Andrew Rieger's curiously dry vocals, on song after song. Making the most of a generally undistinguished voice, he places one syllable squarely on each beat, with minimal syncopation. Reminiscent of Donovan at his Donovanest and 60s Ren-fest pop in general, this strategy is most pronounced on the darkly pastoral ""Rolling Black Water"" and ""King of Earth"", but throughout the album, Rieger rarely leaves his vocal comfort zone or abandons his meditative, slightly detached evenness. </i></p><p>
    
    Because he is the primary songwriter-- and because Elf Power's music has always served the lyrics-- Rieger's vocals restrain the band considerably, which seems especially unimaginative when the music sounds this nimble and emphatically evocative. With the addition of McIntosh on cello, Olivia Tremor Control's John Fernandes on violin and clarinet, Jimmy Hughes on guitar, and Josh Lott taking over drums, the lineup has expanded in interesting directions, giving the Elf even more Power. Together the band-- also including mainstays Laura Carter and bassist Brian Poole-- crafts sweeping scores for Rieger's songs, creating a psychedelic pastoral that's equally sunny and sinister. They pepper these tracks with beguiling sonic flourishes, like Julien Derocher's banjo on ""23rd Dream"" and McIntosh's cello drones adding low, ominous rumble to ""Forming"". Featuring Rieger's most lushly melodic hook and loosest vocal performance, ""Peel Back the Moon, Beware!"" is a sweetly shambling mid-album highlight, as Carter's accordion and Poole's bouncy bass dance around each other. These are moments that work despite the limitations of the album, proving the band is capable of much more than is captured on <i>Back to the Web.</i></p><p>
    
    Too bad the songs aren't as adventurous as the music. This lack of songwriterly imagination severely limits the band's range. ""King of Earth"" sets a tone that sounds like it's leading somewhere, but despite the layering of instruments-- mostly reeds and guitars-- it never quite fulfills its promise to burst forth dramatically, instead fading at the end with little to show for its three minutes. Even on ""Somewhere Down the River"" and the closing title track, when they try to cut loose and kick up some real noise, Elf Power sound restrained and muted. As the album progresses and each song falls into the same lockstep, the repetitiveness becomes increasingly noticeable and tiresome, and even the band's freshly enthusiastic inventiveness can't entirely disguise or alleviate it. As a result, <i>Back to the Web becomes, very much unintentionally, an album of unresolved tensions and undeveloped builds-- not a welcoming web, but a house full of identical rooms and steep stairs that lead into blank walls.</i></p></div>"|2748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2748-back-to-the-web/|6.4|Stephen M.

One of the most unexpected and impressive recent formations is GHQ, a trance-folk group made up of Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogitsu), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Wooden Wand &amp; the Vanishing Voice), and Steve Gunn (provenance unknown). <em>Cosmology of Eye</em> is their first official album following a typically murky history of small-batch recordings, and here the trio vividly broadcasts an astonishing selection of American primitive drone, slow-puffing acoustic strums, and elongated, dimly-lit ragas.</p><p>
    
    The most immediately striking aspect about <em>Cosmology of Eye</em> is how dissimilar it is to Bassett and Nolan's better-known projects. Listeners familiar with either Magik Markers' spazz-rock extremism or the skull-warping mysteries of Double Leopards might initially be taken aback by the graceful, unhurried majesty of GHQ's drowsy astral maneuvers. As such, this album provides a valuable counterbalance to each musician's previous body of work, infusing their steadfast, ecstatic drone-rituals with a welcome crosscurrent of fresh oxygen. At times the patient, widescreen visions of <em>Cosmology of Eye</em> can seem like a deliberate reverse-image of Double Leopards' claustrophobic din, as GHQ's quiet orbits trace some of the same mystical arcs as East Coast avant-pioneers like Angus Maclise or Henry Flynt.</p><p> 
    
    The echoes of these visionary forebears are most evident on the opening ""Drink the Good Moon"", which layers minimalist violin scrapings over distant percussion and shadowy vocal incantations. Though Bassett's vocals are featured more prominently on the bottomless swirl of ""Drift-Void"", lucid conversation is kept to a minimum around these campfires, as everyone instead seems intent on staring at the flames, hoping to discern whatever spirit figures might rise from the ashes. The epic, loose-formed raga ""Lie, Live, Make It"" forms the bulk of the album's second side, and its repetitive, unresolvable patterns manage to simultaneously recall the celestial mantras of Popul Vuh and the primal rhythms of the Godz. Better yet is the album-closing ""Black River Apples"", which features spiraling, Sandy Bull-like strands of guitar and banjo and likely stands as the most unabashedly gorgeous music either Bassett or Nolan have ever had a hand in.</p><p>
    
    Predictably, GHQ have already followed <em>Cosmology of Eye</em> with the full-length <em>La Poesia Visiva</em> CD-R on the Heavy Blossom label. On this release the trio return to the fertile climes of <em>Cosmology of Eye</em>, dipping again into the perpetual drone-streams that seem always to reside just out of view, extending to the horizon in every direction. If Hototogitsu, Double Leopards, and Magik Markers are sometimes able to channel the exact vibrations of an ongoing apocalypse, GHQ instead create the enlightened hymns of post-urban survivors. Time will only tell if they will eventually become as endlessly prolific as Bassett and Nolan's other groups, but for now it would appear that GHQ have momentum on their side.</p></div>"|3679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3679-cosmology-of-eye/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

    for almost two decades, 
    maintaining a solid base of fans and even flirting with the mainstream-- they recorded three albums for Atlantic. <em>Zeroes and Ones</em> is their fourth release for Thrill Jockey, and first since 2000's <em>Stalled Parade</em>. Frankly, their sound hasn't changed much since that album, which saw them working within a broader sonic spectrum than on previous efforts. Here, they continue to focus on mood and texture, whether they're playing straightforward, upbeat 
    rockers or slower, drawn-out numbers full of sprawling 
    guitar work and dry, dusty rhythms. Unfortunately, these tracks don't 
    have the charm of their more traditional jangle-rock, and at times 
    the disc suffers for it.</p><p>
    
    Eleventh Dream Day start strong with ""Dissolution"", a mid-tempo pop song with a 
    bouncy bass line, co-ed vocal harmonies, and driving chorus-- a formula that works throughout most of the first half of the album. The band changes gears with the sprawling, eight-minute ""New Rules"", which slowly builds throughout its first 
    half, and then spends the second half as a showcase for front man 
    Rick Rizzo's squealing guitar work.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, the second half of the album is a hit-or-miss venture. While 
    several songs sparkle (especially ""The Lure"", where Janet 
    Beveridge Bean takes on the lead vocals), the slower tracks are 
    simply too faceless. ""Return of Long Shadow"" is a sort of moody 
    barroom song that never seems to take off, and the album-closing 
    ""Journey With No Maps"" features nice string work and pedal steel, but 
    is nevertheless forgettable. Even with these 
    missteps, <em>Zeroes and Ones</em> won't disappoint those who've been 
    patiently waiting six years for the next chapter in the Eleventh Dream Day saga-- but it won't win them many converts. </p></div>"|2743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2743-zeroes-and-ones/|6.4|Cory D. Byrom

For years, the city had developed its own aesthetic, code words, and sui-generis star system, all while out of sight of the East Coast's cultural gatekeepers. When the rest of the country suddenly took notice, local stars Mike Jones and Paul Wall became national stars, and rappers all over the world started talking about codeine cough syrup and DJ Screw. The same thing is now supposed to happen to California's Bay Area. The region has its own sound, hyphy, which involves lots of berserk, scattered drum-machines, enormous synth-riffs, and brittle, burbling hooks. Like Houston, the city also has its own look and slang and locally based distribution networks. Lil Jon certainly did his best to package the scene and sell it to the rest of the world when he signed E-40, a local legend whose claim to national fame had previously been inventing handfuls of popular hip-hop slang terms. But the album has been out for a month now, and it's not even halfway to gold, so the results are in: The Bay Area is not this year's Houston.</p><p>
    
    The problem is pretty easy to hear in the first five tracks of <em>My Ghetto Report Card</em>-- the album's pure hyphy section. Lil Jon and Bay Area scene-general Rick Rock slap together a set of monster-bangers, but the effect is more exhausting than exhilarating. ""Yay Area"" sounds like robots malfunctioning: frantic off-kilter drums, high-pitched synth squeals, gurgling staccato vocal samples. This stuff has a frenzied, delirious tension and a striking futuristic sheen, but it has none of the sensual restraint of Timbaland, who is a clear influence. Rock and hyphy-version Lil Jon have no idea how to use silence; their tracks are all push and no pull. After about 30 minutes, it begins to feel like an aural version of three cans of Sparks. On the album's second half, Lil Jon is back to his typical tracks: old-school 808s, evil keyboards, sly R&amp;B; whistles, but it's not enough to save the record.</p><p>
    
    E-40 himself doesn't really help matters, basically rapping in Bernie Mac's making-fun-of-white-people voice-- a nervous adenoidal yammer. And he doesn't ride beats so much as fall over them, sloshing his wavery vowels around so much that they sound seasick. 40 loves words, and some of his lines are so dense with regional slang that they barely make sense: ""One of my youngsters just got popped with a thumper/ They tryna wash it/ They talking football numbers."" He can be humurous (""I'm a couple of tacos short of a combination"") or incisive (""The law ain't concerned/ They love us hustlers and dealers/ They wanna tear our houses down so they can build IKEAs""), and he's often a lot of fun. But his goofy-ass flow doesn't lend itself much to serious sentiments. On ""Black Boi"", he delivers this: ""In my days, I was raised in the Church/ Mama did what she could to keep us off the turf/ But it ain't no one to blame/ But Noreaga and Reagan and rock cocaine."" On paper, it looks great, but 40 still sounds as if he's talking about partying. That voice can get old fast, and Lil Jon tries to address the issue by loading virtually every track with guest appearances, but it doesn't work: the guests either utterly school 40 (Too Short, Bun B) or clutter up the track with clumsy nonsense (Juelz Santana, Budda).</p><p>
<em>My Ghetto Report Card</em> has a few great moments. Rick Rock often makes great use of samples: a Digable Planets vocal loop on ""Yay Area"", Bernard Herrmann's <i>Psycho strings on ""Gouda"". And E-40's 18-year-old producer son Droop-E turns in one of the album's strongest tracks with ""Sick Wid It II"", a streaky hyphy banger that manages not to sound way too ADD. On ""U and Dat"", another standout, 40 himself is barely a factor, as Lil Jon's sidelong crunk'n'b track and T-Pain's indelibly sticky vocal hook do all the work. But the album runs way too long at nearly 80 minutes-- six of which are devoted to a soul-crushing song called ""Gimmie Head"", all anemic organ tweets and TMI lyrics (""Shoot it everywhere while I beat my meat/ In ya face, in ya hair, all over the sheets""), and all the party-up fun stuff starts feeling like teeth-gritted forced hedonism long before it should. If hyphy ever does have its cultural moment, it won't be because of this album; it'll be despite it.</i></p></div>"|2941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2941-my-ghetto-report-card/|5.6|Tom Breihan

Regardless of what poor reasons initially kept listeners at arm's length (knee-jerking because the record is roughly half-full of covers, distrust of a 2004 release from this compatriot of the then-unfashionable Peaches, a spotty solo debut), the protracted embrace is welcome, and a reminder that heady, grownup pop can attract listeners without the gentle nudges of AAA radio and Starbucks.</p>
<p>Armed with a trio of first-tier singles-- the spritely and still underrated ""Mushaboom"", the desolate title track, and a pulsing cover of the Bees Gees' disco ballad ""Inside &amp; Out""-- Feist has quietly become the most popular satellite in the Broken Social Scene system, one of the few members of that collective to command not only respect but admiration.</p>
<p>With Feist touring and introducing <i>Let It Die</i> to new audiences even into the first few months of 2006, it's natural that early adopters are restless for a new release, a role filled this week by <i>Open Season</i>, a generous 15-track collection of remixes, reworkings, and collaborations released in Canada via Arts &amp; Crafts. Unsurprisingly, the album is overrun with deconstructions of Feist's signature song-- there are four versions of ""Mushaboom""-- but it also features a cover of Peaches' ""Lovertits"", a track with Readymade FC, and a duet with Jane Birkin rescued from the latter's 2004 comeback LP <i>Rendez-Vous</i>.</p>
<p><i>Let It Die</i>'s sparse rhythms, roomy arrangements, and seamless genre-blending make it ripe for re-tooling, so it's disappointing that so many of the reworked tracks mimic the sound and mood of their source material rather than stretch them. Feist already straddles the line of coffeetable MOR and cocktail jazz, and many of these remixes move to the wrong side of that divide: Embracing trip-hop's post-halcyon days, the aimless atmospherics of some of the tracks hint at neither post-millennial dread nor the slinky, cinematic grandeur of the genre's most effective material.</p>
<p>Most egregious is that ""Inside &amp; Out"", Feist's lugubrious disco tune, is denied the swirling, maximalist treatment it deserves. Its lone appearance here comes with Apostle of Hustle's ""unmix"", a stripped-down live version featuring only Jason Collett's scratchy, detuned guitar and Feist's vocals, a combination that seems mismatched. The track stutters along without providing a fluid melody for Feist to ride; fortunately she doesn't compound the problem with a melismatic or overwrought delivery, but the awkward pull between her voice and Collett's guitar never creates an interesting tension. Whether the compilation's creators were disallowed to use Ewan Pearson's two remixes of the track-- one a club burner, the other a waterlogged dub-- or left them off because it was feared they wouldn't mesh with the rest of the material, their omissions are unfortunate.</p>
<p>A few official remixes do make appearances here-- including both Mocky and VV (the French electronic duo and frequent Feist compatriots, not the Kills leader) taking cracks at ""Mushaboom"", with both versions earning passing grades. Canadian emcee k-Os and the Postal Service also work over the track, each unable to resist adding their own vocals. The former massages the arrangement, but his precise, clipped vocals are less compelling than the languid, stream-of-consciousness raps that once successfully colored Massive Attack and Mo'Wax tracks. The Postal Service mix sounds like, well, the Postal Service-- low-whirring synths, a gently skipping rhythm, and Ben Gibbard's cozy vocals auditioning for the role of Feist's ""man to stick it out/ Make a home from a rented house."" And, who'd have thought, three years removed from the <i>Give Up</i> LP, the Postal Service template is still an oddly welcome combination.</p>
<p>Other highlights here come via the tracks that weren't as central to <i>Let It Die</i>-- an oddly hypnotic, 90s-retro version of ""Lonely Lonely"", VV's take on ""One Evening"", and the Birkin collaboration. Feist's spirited, democratic approach-- sharing space with friends on both her recordings and theirs, slipping easily to an vocal interpreter's role on covers, this remix album-- is delightfully loose, resulting in the sort of embraceable sound that her more well-known collective ran from on its overcooked self-titled album. Throughout it all, she's also managed to stamp an identity on her work, one that, if anything, is too dominant here. A more adventurous and well-rounded cast of collaborators-- a few more names from outside of her trusted circle-- may have enlivened the record, as Pearson did to ""Inside &amp; Out"". Instead, it's a grab bag of more of the same, serving only to again spotlight the strengths we'd already located in these songs.</p></div>"|3315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3315-open-season/|6.6|Scott Plagenhoef

Their sound is a throwback to 1970s hard rock-- miles of galloping  riffs, noodling organ, and guitar fuzz-- but what makes their self-titled debut rise above mere pastiche is how capably they strike a balance between meaty vintage metal and crisp, stoner-rock melodies.</p><p>
    
    Typically, Wolfmother plays it straight, employing the raw materials of some of the original prog/metal bands signed to England's Vertigo Records during the label's 1969-71 prime: ""Colossal"" booms with heavy power chords and woozy riffing, while frontman Andrew Stockdale's crisp vocals soar through the rhythm's open spaces, while ""Woman"" is a driving, upbeat monster with spacey prog-inflected keyboards.  But they also test their limits on tracks like ""The White Unicorn"".  Its opening bars recall Led Zeppelin's gentler side with clean-strummed guitar chords and Stockdale putting on his best Robert Plant, but tumbling drumfills inevitably welcome back the rock, leading up to a blissed-out, psychedelic bridge.</p><p>
    
    ""Where Eagles Have Been"" best spans the album's breadth: clean guitars turn dirty, organs wail during the transitions, and the slow and intense rhythm becomes upbeat and explosive just in time for the guitar solo.  On ""Witchcraft"", the band evokes Jethro Tull with a Canterbury flute solo that ought to sound forced or hokey, but context is everything, and set against Wolfmother's wallop, it's a natural fit.  Of course, not all their risks return rewards as worthwhile: The obnoxious three-and-a-half-minute garage-punk blast ""Apple Tree"" features the album's most uninspired songwriting and laziest delivery.  Fortunately, they manage to take things out on a high note with the swampy ""Vegabond"", a track that, like much of this record's other material, authentically emulates a classic sound with the conviction and hunger of a young band on their way to finding a more singular voice.</p></div>"|8812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8812-wolfmother/|7.5|Cory D.

    listening to dusty, warped 45s (70s) of pop music from
    the heyday of Motown and Spector (60s).</p><p>
    It's fitting then that Saturday Looks Good to Me's
    productions often sound like a cassette tape that's
    been redubbed a few too many times. Slathered with
    reverb, and occasionally interrupted by broken tape
    head warbles, the basement music made
    by Fred Thomas and a cast of dozens could be written off as affected lo-fi pandering, but in the spirit
    of conducting a séance for the Wall of Sound, it's an
    appropriate approach: cramming as many elements as
    possible into a handful of tracks, and putting the
    resultant technological distortions to good use.</p><p>
    Unless you live in or near Ann Arbor, Mich., it hasn't been
    easy to be a SLGTM completist-- the band has
    consistently bled seven-inches and tour EPs since
    their inception. They have often saved some of their best
    work for these shorter formats, which makes the
    <em>Sound on Sound</em> collection more of a highlight reel
    than a barrel-scrape. Swollen, yes; 30 tracks and
    80 minutes is a lot to digest from any band. But its
    length and unity of purpose allows sufficient time to
    fully submerge in the band's world-- fuzzy, faded, and
    a little weird-smelling, like the rec-room blanket. </p><p>
    Whether sung by Thomas' own glottal voice or someone from his extensive guest-singer
    Rolodex, SLGTM's songs are usually led by the
    next-room stomp of echo-drenched drums, no matter how
    much of a pocket orchestra (horns, strings, organs) is
    thrown on top. But this is no GBV slackery: The sleigh
    bells and gunshot snare of ""Lift Me Up"" emulate
    Motown via transistor radio with meticulous detail,
    while the sheepish instrumental homage
    ""Pet Store"" nails the far-off mono-mix
    percussion of the Beach Boys' ""Let's Go Away for a While"". Even when
    the rhythms are supplied by machines (""It Sounds Like
    They're in Love with You""), it's the kind of dusty
    technology you'd expect to find on a Magnetic Fields
    record, setting up a second timeline parabola
    stretching from synth-pop to Tin Pan Alley.</p><p>
    As with the Merritt catalog, it sometimes seems like
    SLGTM's revival of outdated sonic packaging is meant
    to deflect cynicism toward the sickly sweet sentiments within songs
    like ""Summer Doesn't Count (Unless You're Here with
    Me)"" or ""Girl of Mine"". In a scene where earnest love songs are
    almost anachronistic, it only makes sense to clothe
    them in hand-me-down production and arrangements, even
    if it means sacrificing the immediate for the sake of
    memory mining. It's this level of remove that nips at
    the band's heels, even as they prove themselves
    capable of filling countless 7""'s with instant oldies
    and prom themes that never were. <em>Sound on Sound</em> bears
    testament to this consistency, while it also documents
    the onion layers of nostalgia that haunt Saturday
    Looks Good to Me to both positive and negative effect.</p></div>"|7004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7004-sound-on-sound/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

    Takemura, her more famous and connected collaborator. Tsuyuko first lent
    her quintessentially innocent vocals to his Child's View project in 1998, and many of Takemura's subsequent records featured at least
    one Tsuyuko contribution. Takemura's favored technique during this
    glitched-out phase was to take her flat, indeterminate coos and feed
    them into the silicon chipper, combining the skipping utterances with
    repeating melodic phrases heavily indebted to Steve Reich.</p><p>
    
    It was a fruitful period for Takemura, yielding key tracks like
    ""Meteor"" and ""Kepler"", both of which would have been seriously diminished
    without Tsuyuko's contributions. Meanwhile, she quietly released her
    debut album <em>Ongakushitsu</em> in 1999. While Takemura's aesthetic
    depended heavily on software, Tsuyuko's could have come from
    any time since the development of the electric organ. She has
    acknowledged a debt to the piano music of Erik Satie, and while she
    shares his delicacy and understatement, her tunes are not especially
    melodic. Instead, they can be imagined as small musical sculptures,
    turning slowly in place without really going anywhere.</p><p>
    
    The visual aspect of Tsuyuko's music is made explicit on this
    limited-run boutique release, which combines a CD of new music with a
    hardcover book she wrote and illustrated. The book and music are
    designed to work together, with a few pages of drawings, text, and
    musical notation devoted to each track. </p><p>
    
    Musically, <em>Hokane</em> is of a piece with Tsuyuko's earlier release.
    Dynamic range is nonexistent; tracks develop according to a logic
    inspired by the loose patterns of nature, with melodies that could
    have been transcribed from a gently swaying wind chime. Though electronic organs remain central, Tsuyuko experiments with
    arrangement, scoring her music for flute, vibraphone, voice, and
    several other instruments. There is a strong similarity in timbre to Takemura's work circa <em>Songbook</em>, but Tsuyuko exhibits
    a patience and restraint that elevates the seemingly simple music to
    something more profound. She also transcends the easy poignancy of
    childhood references, opting instead for a removed formality, which
    provides ample distance for contemplation. The mood is tranquil,
    placid, and, at points, quite beautiful. <em>Hokane</em> is so
    unassuming it can very easily slip into the background, but I doubt
    Tsuyuko minds. </p><p>
    
    Of greatest interest in the book is the inclusion of the written score
    to the album, with clefs integrated into watercolors of geometric
    figures, blurred street scenes, and so on. If you read music, you can
    get a sense of how Tsuyuko uses repetition by observing the notes laid
    out on paper, and ""seeing"" this particular album reinforces the
    music's ability to evoke mood and color. Still, while the book is an
    attractive artifact and fits well with the music, it'll probably end
    up on the shelf for a while after you flip through it a couple of times.
    The important thing is that Tsuyuko has a solid new record that builds
    and improves upon her debut. </p></div>"|8320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8320-hokane/|7.2|Mark Richardson

Even as he continues to sharpen his chops on country and western, and U.S. folk and folk art, his disdain for particular political and social developments has only intensified and become more intractable. Rather than diluting his music, his lefty hostility has thus far mirrored the subversiveness of the musical forms he practiced, infusing albums like 2003's <em>The Mayors of the Moon</em> and the following year's <i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds with a fiery dissatisfaction and a feisty humor. All rock legends should age so gracefully.</i></p><p>
    
    That spiritedness is all but absent on <em>Gold Brick</em>, a concept album of sorts about the gold and slave trades that exchanges his C&amp;W; fixation for sea shanties and bland rock. Too many of these songs sound like obligatory run-throughs. Jettisoning the reconstructed C&amp;W; that made <em>Lofty Deeds</em> such a gem, Langford has gathered a decent backing band. Only occasionally do they hint at the rabble they're capable of rousing: Pat Brennan's piano elegantly laces these songs together, and Jean Cook's violin on ""Tall Ships"" speaks more loudly and clearly about these matters than Langford's lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Langford hasn't given them his best batch of songs, though. ""Buy It Now"" lazily tackles even lazier consumerism, but its slothful antigroove can't sell the message. ""Gorilla &amp; the Maiden"" starts strong but soon loses its way as Langford muddles the melody, and ""Anything Can Happen"" proves the adage that there's nothing as boring as listening to someone else describe their dreams. The biggest disappointment is centerpiece ""Salty Dog"", a dead-in-the-water sea dirge that's just embarrassing. Langford flails as he tries to hit the high notes; worse, he never sounds like he's even in character.</p><p>
<em>Gold Brick</em> has some luster, hinting in its best moments at the album that might have been. Langford and his band put some vigor into the reggae-flavored ""Dreams of Leaving"" and the reminiscing ""Invisible Man"", almost excusing its grafted chorus. He finally gets some real fire in his voice on the closer, ""Lost in America"", which recaps American history as global farce: a confused Columbus landing on what he thinks is the West Indies, the Transcontinental Railway pulling the Great Depression behind it. But this moment, which comes too late, reveals the essential imbalance that sinks <em>Gold Brick</em>: Langford is navigating by politics, not by music. He has something to say, but for once in his storied career, that seems to take priority over how to say it. As a result, both the music and the message suffer.</p></div>"|4682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4682-gold-brick/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

Instead, this collection-- consisting of songs Seeger has sung, but none he's written-- is a boisterous, spirit-raising throwdown, conjured by a 12-man band (guitar, harmonica, tuba, violin, B3 organ, upright bass, banjo, piano, drums, accordion, trombone, saxophone, trumpet, and more) and a pack of grinning backup singers. Perhaps ironically, Bruce Springsteen-- one of America's most-adored songsmiths-- is soaring high on a record full of tracks other people wrote.</p>
<p>On <i>The Seeger Sessions</i>, Springsteen growls, warbles, groans, and gags, sounding often like Tom Waits (check the scratchy, ominous vocals on ""Erie Canal"") or later Bob Dylan. It's a stark contrast to Seeger's crisp, clear pipes, and it reinvigorates a handful of ancient American tracks. Like any good folk record, The Seeger Sessions tackles the tangle of war, strife, poverty, and unrest, but does so without sacrificing joy or release (really, the very reasons people began singing in the first place). The resulting collection happily drowns out echoes of Springsteen's underwhelming recent efforts, and just might be the very best and most inspiring album Bruce has produced in more than a decade<i>. </i></p>
<p>Embracing early E Street shuffle and ditching the solemnity of 2005's <i>Devils and Dust</i>, <i>The Seeger Sessions </i>culls from a century of rich, gritty Americana tradition, from bluegrass to country to rhythm and blues to gospel, rock'n'roll, Zydeco, Dixieland, and more. Springsteen is an obvious descendent of folk tradition, but, as he writes in the record's liner notes, this is ""street corner music, parlor music, tavern music, wilderness music, circus music, church music, gutter music."" Or: The Seeger Sessions is a party record.</p>
<p>Clawing through Seeger's considerable catalogue, Springsteen ultimately selected a smart, varied, and cohesive smattering of songs, proving he retains a deep and nuanced understanding of folk tradition. In a recent <i>New Yorker</i> profile of Seeger, Springsteen talks about folk songs as tools with potential to become ""righteous implements when connected to historical consciousness,"" and claims to have chosen this particular repertoire because, ""Everything I wanted, I found there."" Appropriately, Spingsteen's voice seems custom-made for tracks like ""We Shall Overcome"", where his signature gravity spreads shivers, destined to silence even the most jaded listeners with its convincing optimism.  Written in 1905, ""Erie Canal"" (sealed comfortably in the consciousness of any kid born or raised in western New York), is ominous and hypnotizing, with banjo picks punctuated by organs, strings, and an unexpected Dixieland breakdown midway through-- it's not hard to imagine whole arenas shouting, ""Low bridge, everybody down!""</p>
<p>The gorgeously explosive ""O Mary Don't You Weep"" cracks open with teasing fiddles, before horns and drums kick up and Springsteen's throaty shouts are rounded out by a bevy of backing singers, organs sliding in and out, a gloriously sloppy mélange of sound, as indebted to New Orleans as it is to Newport. Springteen's voice is gravelly and real, happily divorced from the overproduction and studio tweaking that plagues his recent work, and perfectly in sync with his band's raucous, gleeful pounding. Everyone here is loose and intoxicated, and nowhere else is the record's quasi-live conceit (the record was made in three day-long sessions, preceded by no rehearsals) as gloriously palpable.</p>
<p>Springsteen has a habit of folding current events into his songs without ever being specific enough to limit a verse to a single time and place. Unsurprisingly, that timelessness syncs up perfectly with the centuries-old songs on <i>The Seeger Sessions, and, if nothing else, confirms that Bruce Springsteen was the right (and maybe only) person for this particular gig. Less an exhumation than a celebration, </i><i>The Seeger Sessions is the best proof we've got that America's folksongs are also our finest artifacts.  It's all here: recipes, prayers, promises, fears, hopes, and hollers.</i></p></div>"|7729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7729-we-shall-overcome-the-seeger-sessions/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

I dig the Lips, too, but for this Oklahoma band to furnish its third album of sun-warped indie pop with such a referential cover is a conceit-- especially since the bands hardly sound alike.  Starlight Mints singer Allen Vest's fey vocals more closely channel Ray Davies in the Kinks' more ambitious moments, when the UK's most ingratiating songwriter was at his least chummy and most conductorly.  Vest hovers nearest the Lips' Wayne Coyne when he loiters in an unconvincing falsetto, but his update conveys less power because he's reluctant to sing out. Had these Candyland denizens orchestrated opener ""Pumpkin"" less busily-- without the wailing wall-of-sound brass, and with more breathing room for the vocals-- Vest's high notes would've carried more beauty. Instead, he becomes a bit player in a boldly decorous milieu. Imagine Phil Spector-era Beatles without John Lennon's messianic gravitas and you have a good (albeit generous) impression of <em>Drowaton</em>.</p><p>
    
    To pull off compelling rococo you've got to weep with every brushstroke, ornament your songs with floor-to-ceiling detail in supplication to god <em>because nothing less will do</em>, and unless everyone's left naked and penniless afterward your shit ain't worth the pilgrimage. As ornate orchestral pop goes, Starlight Mints are too oddball-flip. They cram their songs with every sound imaginable without making a compelling case for any, and music that's so congested needs a sense of hierarchy. They seem mortified of silence and attempt to fashion, from a dab of fuzz guitar or a dusting of rhodes piano, an unnecessary instrumental hinge for every transition.</p><p>
<em>Drowaton</em>'s best songs are notable for what they don't do. ""What's Inside of Me?"" doesn't let excessive adornment get in the way of its album-best chorus. When Vest reveals, ""I just want the world to see/ What's inside of me,"" in one of the album's rare long-faced moments, it's a refreshing change-up from Starlight Mints' usual goofiness. ""Pearl's (Submarine #2)"", meanwhile, resists over-variegating its instrumentation to focus instead on variations on one instrument, the guitar. The song deploys several of them at different volumes and levels of distortion; a muted slide-bent version, deriving wondrous warmth from a vintage-sounding tube amp, barely stays long enough for coffee but takes top prize with a sinuous line. And ""Rhino Stomp"" sacrifices vocals in exchange for the cinematic excess lacking elsewhere. Although the song bites ""I Am The Walrus""'s pizzicato plod and invocation of fat, gray animals harder than <em>Drowaton</em>'s cover does the Flaming Lips, its booming conviction offers a blueprint for the Mints to follow on future outings.</p><p>
    
    After the good comes the unfortunate-- songs that hold promise but find little success because the band is so overzealous with its seasonings. The title track bristles with at least 29 string sounds, 14 of which have not yet been catalogued by biologists, making its dusk-creeps-in slinkiness a humid, mysterious affair, but I wish the band had dwelt longer on the interplay of drums and tension-building radar pulses. ""Rosemarie""'s problems stem more from gag-me-with-a-spoon Beatles worship than overproduction, and those MIDI trumpets are pretty awesome, but the song would still cut a more fetching silhouette if it shed a few layers. At moments like these it'd be nice if the band's appreciation for the Flaming Lips-- a band that understands the value of rough edges-- translated into their music, as well as their artwork.</p></div>"|7468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7468-drowaton/|7.1|Sam Ubl

The record lacks the attention to detail that marked Oakley Hall's self-titled debut, but it makes up the difference by distilling the band's sound to its most engaging elements.</p><p>
    The Hall are led by former Oneida guitarist Pat Sullivan (aka Papa Crazee), who applies his former band's studied patience and fearless blending of genre to Oakley Hall's rustic sound. <em>Second Guessing</em> revels in the clichés of country and stretches them, like a perpetual jam session that never loses its focus or energy. They're the perfect antidote for dabbling rock fans who ""only like real country, like Johnny Cash,"" or a revelation to those who thought Neil Young's ""Down by the River"" was too short.</p><p>  
    Even with their jam-tastic approach, <em>Second Guessing</em> is still plenty palatable. It effortlessly merges a sincere love of country-rock with a band that gets restless easily. There's always a drumbeat quickening the pulse or a tasteful guitar solo carrying the listener from one section to the next. They make the gutsy choice of opening on their longest track, ""Hiway"", with a dirty, distorted guitar that runs underneath it, and the automotive love song ""Eyes, Lock, and Steel"", cements Oakley Hall as scruffy miscreants-- even as Sullivan and lead singer Rachel Cox belt out harmonies like true professionals.</p><p> 
    The creaky vocal to the slower, squeakier ""Adalina Roselma Lapage"" almost falls from its hinges, with comically spiteful lyrics (""she makes me feel like a high school kid/ High school sucked"") and a protagonist who yearns to be ""any other place but lookin' at your dome."" It's a highlight that incorporates the band's offbeat charm without losing their earnestness. They show off their wistful side later in the album with ""Mumbles"", rage against the Man in ""Landlord"", and grow party-weary despite the energetic pace of ""Volume Rambler"". </p><p> 
    The risk of this approach is that without much variation or any huge standout tracks, the mood gets monochromatic. The record remains remarkably consistent, however, and with their third record, <em>Gypsum Strings</em>, due in June, maybe Oakley Hall have already widened past the rural-highway tunnel vision of <i>Second Guessing</i>.</p></div>"|6099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6099-second-guessing/|7.3|Jason Crock

These sly misnomers are common, where cheeky artists or fans throw up unconnected genres as a cheap, easy joke on the consumer. (Slipknot = Blues, hilarious!) When I first noticed the tag on Dudley's new LP, I thought Madlib and co. were goofing, considering Perkins is a funk/soul singer; on <em>Expressions</em>, Perkins' impressionistic Ella Fitzgerald-style note-hanging makes that a little more believable. But where traditional jazz singers are focused chaos-- whether whirling through bustling percussion or slow-burning through low-down bass lines-- Perkins' bleary-eyed style is pure, unfettered slop. He hangs, sure, but it's plain to see he has neither formal training nor any idea that he's stretching out the syllables this goofily. Still, he finds ways to make it work.</p><p>
<em>Expressions</em> is an improvement over his improbably existent debut, <em>A Lil' Light</em>, the 
    work of a man with no idea how to write lyrics-- let alone songs. 
    Not that he carted his horse to any sort of Leonard Cohen wagon; his tracks 
    still amble, amiably. But producer Madlib has taken his ever-present 
    penchant for fractured soul production-- sample-heavy organs and wah guitar sound-- to a slipshod breaking point here, a 
    place where choruses are worthless and verses are for chumps. Perkins' debut was almost entirely choruses; eliminating his formulaic writing, Dudley's 
    meandering here sounds more naturalistic. ""Separate Ways"" is droopy and 
    shimmering at once, with a high-pitched synth punctuating the 
    ramble-sanging: ""Sweet memories of you and me down a one-way road,"" then a 
    bit of scat-talking, then an informal coda. ""Coming Home"" 
    could be about returning to a lover, returning to God or just, ya know, a trip 
    home from the weedspot. Thing is, it's as much about existential terror. 
    Dudley's shook. You can't name a song ""Dear God"" unless you really mean it, 
    no matter how funny it is. ""Dollar Bill"" is predictably about an 
    eternal lack of funds. Even rollicking opener ""Funky Dudley"" has an 
    insecure call-and-response thing happening: ""How'd you get so funky, 
    Dudley?"" Dudley tells us ""whatever it takes to get the body to move,"" but 
    he's only half-right. Only the clipped, pseudo-Parliament groove lets us 
    forgive him his bragging and thoughtless proclamations.</p><p>
    
    There was a time when Dudley (initially known as 
    the West Coast MC Declaime) was compared to the late prankster/genius Wesley 
    Willis on this site. Lyrically, he's just not as funny or insistently 
    bizarre as Willis. He ain't half the singer, either. But his personas (unlucky-in-love drunk, weeded-out couch-dweller, 
    broke-ass God-fearer) offer a vulnerability often missing from most earthy 
    nu-soul artists. It's only natural that Madlib and P.B. Wolf jumped at the 
    chance to record Dudley's first full-length when the overrated 7""
    ""Flowers"" dropped in late 2002. Stones Throw's aesthetic demanded a warbly 
    crooner, especially post-<em>Nigga Please</em>. In Dudley, they've got one, and 
    now he's a growing artist, one without either traditional talent or pretension. 
    He's just a singer that sings because he's got to. There's no other way to shake the 
    demons-- or tell his chick he's sorry.</p></div>"|6526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6526-expressions-2012-au/|7.1|Sean Fennessey

But while <em>Tum</em>'s patchwork of thickly melodic snippets is consistently fine, its evenhandedness skews toward anonymity. <em>Tum</em> obscures its memorable pop melodies with psychedelic tweaks too staid to be truly freaky. The result is an album that sounds good while it's playing, but leaves little of an impression behind.</p><p> 
    
    While consistently maintaining a lo-fi, Elephant 6 vibe that sits well amid the affectedly naturalistic freakfolk of today, each Impossible Shapes album has varied slightly in overarching style. <em>Tum</em> is characterized by a stark duality. On the lion's share of its songs, coruscating organs and gossamer guitars create deep, shifting fields of color; against this backdrop, twangy acoustic leads-- supple, vaguely Far Eastern arpeggios-- trace out brittle tangles. Rooted in this dynamic, the plosive ""Pixie Pride"" seems to respire, with corkscrewing electric leads punching rents in its weepy facade. The opening accordion wheeze of ""Fulgent Fields"" harrumphs toward a clean, bright lead; it's one of the few songs on this largely static record with significant structural variation. 
    
    ""Late Summer Sky"", with its lysergic vocal harmonies and lapidary guitar flecks, typifies the record's brassy/murky aesthetic, and songs like ""Tahuti, Splendid Scribe"", with its gently ramshackle aspect, resonate with the music of the Jeweled Antler Collective. But <em>Tum</em> is more memorable when it bends away from this gauzy style and toward more strident tones, during moments when the idyll darkens: On ""Little Gloves"", maniacal strings stab at the air, then settle into a creaky, seasick lurch that gradually slows to a funerary march, organs bleating defeat.</p><p> 
    
    The psychedelic touches are pleasant but tired, borrowing from Beefheart and Zappa with little revision. Backwards tape is deployed liberally: The antic ""The Working Vessel"" rewinds individual notes over a plunky lead and a stiff two-note bassline; the backwards drums of ""Hathor"" produce a sense of viscous suction; the Banhartesque, hippy-dippy cruncher ""Willow Willow Yew"" doubles back on itself to yowl into oblivion. We get jittery, atonal piano on ""Ra in the Rising""; hard-panned vocals on the crispy garage boogie ""Florida Silver Springs""; dirty bass and squealing organs on the wiggy ""Hornbeam""; unreliable tempos on the rambling ""Twisted Sol Epoch"". What we don't get is any real sense of adventure or melodies sturdy enough to carry around. This noncommittal nature doesn't ruin <em>Tum</em>, but in a musical climate already teeming with slightly deranged pastoralia, it doesn't distinguish it either. </p></div>"|4088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4088-tum/|6.5|Brian Howe

I was a little harsh on these guys <u><a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/beatles/capitol-albums-vol-1.shtml"">the first time around</a></u>. It's not that I hate the Beatles. However, in 2006, after Paul has finally had his way with Let It Be, we've been given three helpings of Anthology leftovers, half the band is dead, Bob Spitz's recent thousand-page Beatles biography moves the band a step closer to trumping Jesus' wordcount, and it appears we're starting to run out of bands obviously ripping them off, I'm a little tired of them. I grew up on this stuff, mind you; countless hours of propping my head up in front of my mom's old record player listening to worn copies of <em>Abbey Road</em> and the White Album, dialing 1-800-BEATLES in the blind hope that someone would answer (and they did: it was a Beatles Convention hotline), drawing pictures of fake bands who just happened to have an acoustic phase in the mid-60s. And I'm spent: the records are in my bones, so I'm rarely urged to play them.</p><p>
    Thing is, for better or worse, the Beatles either invented or popularized almost every rock artist cliché. The notion of bands having separate and distinct creative phases, of band members having different (but essential) roles and personalities, of wives being the villains, of the solo record being an ego trip, of clean, linear emotional/musical/spiritual progression-- maybe it didn't take the Beatles to let journalists and fans indulge in their obsessive (and usually myopic) tendencies, but it sure helped. And now, as the environments they created have become the content of our pop culture historical fiction, they seem just a bit removed from reality. Indeed, even as they convert new fans every year, the Beatles are history-- not quite ancient, but decidedly of another era.</p><p>
    Of course, I wouldn't relish explaining this to someone who might have been around while all of it was going down. I can only imagine the kind of emotional indentures this band must have made on American kids in 1964-- and not just the fawning, screaming ones, but the ones watching culture bend and stretch before their eyes. Hell, even the jaded music critics writing about how the Beatles are history would never have been given the column space were it not for the old mania and fallout (such that now, rock = Stuff to Take Seriously). The early Capitol Beatles records are funny in the respect that for such a momentous happening, they were remarkably shrewdly (and many would argue, hastily) compiled and released. It didn't stop millions of people from falling in love; to see it happen would doubtlessly have been thrilling, but now we look at things with all kinds of distance.</p><p>
    Capitol's second box set of LPs features all four (!) Beatles albums released in America in 1965: <em>The Early Beatles</em>, <i>Beatles VI, <em>Help!</em></i>, and <em>Rubber Soul</em>. All of the records are presented in both mono and stereo, which should be an exciting prospect for fans accustomed to hearing only mono versions of most of the early Beatles songs-- though beware, apparently the first pressing of the box contains incorrect mono mixes of <em>Beatles VI</em> and <em>Rubber Soul</em>. Capitol is supposed have addressed this on pressings after the first run. Nevertheless, most of this stuff has never been on CD, and I probably don't need to convince any diehard fans to run out and hear it.</p><p>
    The sound is uniformly good (despite the mono mastering demi-fiasco), and if you don't mind that many of the stereo mixes essentially amount to vocals on left, instruments on right, these remasters represent the clearest, cleanest versions of most of these songs. Also, if you're curious, the American records were actually mixed slightly differently than the UK ones (more echo on the vocals here, a false start there), so if some of the songs seem a little different, they are. Of course, this set is probably aimed squarely at collectors and the very nostalgic anyway, so no need to feel like a shamed Beatle fan for not buying it as soon as you see it.</p><p>
<em>The Early Beatles</em> contains songs that originally appeared on the EMI's <i>Please Please Me from 1963, but resequenced and missing three tunes (of which ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is the most notable). This record was actually released a couple of years after the Beatles' American debut, <em>Introducing...The Beatles</em>, which had been put out by Vee-Jay Records. Capitol later acquired the rights to the band's catalog, and put this out in 1965. Given the hysteria at the time, I'm guessing many fans didn't care. It's hard to argue with 100% proof pop like ""Please Please Me"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?"", or ""P.S. I Love You"", though I've always thought it was weird that Ringo sung ""Boys"". Covers like ""Anna (Go to Him)"" and ""A Taste of Honey"" are more than serviceable, though the real attraction is John Lennon's famed larynx shredding take on ""Twist And Shout"".</i></p><p>
<em>Beatles VI</em> contains songs appearing elsewhere on the EMI albums <em>Beatles For Sale</em> and <em>Help!</em>. It's an odd mix of raucous covers (""Kansas City"", ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"", ""Bad Boy"") and more low-key stuff forecasting their move into more sophisticated territory (""Tell Me What You See"", the excellent ""Every Little Thing""). This guarantees a schizophrenic album experience, though the quality of the new Beatles originals probably gave fans at the time an awful lot to be happy about.  Nevertheless, <em>VI</em> (unbelievably, the band's sixth American LP in less than two years) lives up to many a Beatle fanatic's claim of being the band's worst Capitol album.</p><p>
    As with the band's UK albums, <em>Help!</em> is where things start to get really interesting. Most fans claim this is because the band was starting to open up to folk music, drugs, and relishing their own eclecticism. Of course, the American version of <em>Help!</em> is made all the more bizarre by including some Ken Thorne-composed incidental music from the Beatles' second movie. So, in between such classics as ""Ticket to Ride"" and the title track, you get James Bond riffs, Hitchcock strings, and a sitar-laden take on ""A Hard Day's Night"". God knows what fans thought at the time, though again, the new songs were such a leap beyond what the band was doing before, it's hard to see how anyone could have been disappointed.</p><p>
    Recognizing the Beatles' shift in sound, Capitol emphasized the acoustic leanings of the band on its version of <em>Rubber Soul</em>. Leading off with ""I've Just Seen a Face"" (one of the great underrated McCartney tunes), and hitting most of the UK version of the record, the band served notice to anyone even halfway listening that they wouldn't be settling for mop-top glory. I doubt I need to say much about the best parts of <em>Rubber Soul</em>; the resequencing isn't as brutal here as on other Capitol albums, though ""It's Only Love"" (originally on the UK <em>Help!</em>) doesn't quite fit the mood.</p><p>
    So: Four decent-to-really-good records with great sound for which most people born after 1965 will have limited need. At the very least, I enjoy hearing these songs in a slightly different light than I'm accustomed, though I wonder how long the band and its various business partners will be able to count on fans' interest in almost-as-good-as-new product. As I write this, the powers that be are said to be working on making their entire remastered catalog available via download, so perhaps the smart money is on the Beatles hanging around a while.</p></div>"|1096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1096-the-capitol-albums-vol-2/|7.5|Dominique Leone

Booka Shade's ""Mandarine Girl"", issued last May, announced a paradigm shift, its sheets of noise and spiralling synth riffs reaching out to both the most stentorian minimal and the most epic trance. Other artists have followed in the duo's wake, crafting records that perversely treat ""minimal"" as a license to create grooves of impossible largesse. In the process, Get Physical has become a byword for arty-but-populist records with crossover potential-- from one genre enclave to another and from cult status to mass consumption.</p><p>
    Booka Shade are perfectly placed to capitalize on this unexpected ubiquity, and while their 2004 debut <em>Memento</em> surprised many with its noirish, claustrophobic vibe, <em>Movements</em> is the gregarious corrective: not only the better record, but friendlier, larger, and more epochal in its survey of the varied delights of German house and techno. And at times it does feel like a survey, moving from rumbling Metro Area disco (""Night Falls"") to fluttering Isolée falter-funk (""The Birds and the Beats"") to beautiful Kompakt techno-pop (""Wasting Time"") with an unselfconscious grace the belies the album's range.</p><p>
    If Get Physical increasingly resembles early Warp in its elevation of club dynamics to a steely artform, <em>Movements</em> might be its equivalent of LFO's <em>Frequencies</em>-- a record whose state of the art grooves were equally suited to sweaty dancefloors and the close intimacy of headphones. Indeed, while some grooves are more physical than others, everything about <em>Movements</em> seems deliberately designed to subvert the usual inverse relationship between a dance record's club-readiness and home-friendliness: ""Darko"" might boast heart-tugging synth melodies worthy of Boards of Canada, but its cavernous, bass-heavy production begs to be showcased over huge speakers in a rammed warehouse. Likewise, the duo's ""interpretation"" of ""Body Language"", their 2005 hit with M.A.N.D.Y., begins with a meandering guitar and reggae lilt intro perversely playing cat and mouse with a mnemonic bassline hook, but it soon builds into a sultry house groove whose brazen physicality leaves the original resembling a wallflower.</p><p>
    But Booka Shade's dab hand with a groove should hardly surprise-- after all, as backroom producers for DJ T and M.A.N.D.Y., they've been partly responsible for most of the music on the most reliable dance music label of the past four years. Rather, it's the unexpected emotive quality to the music on <em>Movements</em> that entrances. ""In White Rooms"", the album's simplest moment, is also its best: A succession of ascending trance-like riffs over a straightforward house groove, with no other purpose than to lay claim to your heart and your tear-ducts. It feels intensely nostalgic, even if, like me, you're too young and/or too far from Germany to actually appreciate its evocation of early 90s trance parties. The nostalgia is not merely for a particular sound or moment, but for the youthful conviction that music can change the world, can change us, merely by its astonishing power and newness. But I swear there is a moment only 30 seconds before the end of this (rather cruelly foreshortened) track where it feels like the duo are actually inventing new emotionsÉso maybe their nostalgia is premature.</p><p>
    Booka Shade will never achieve the auteur status of figures like Ricardo Villalobos, and I suspect they prefer it that way-- after all, these are the guys who ghost-produce records for their labelmates, and make their money from writing nifty tunes for commercials. Rather than seduce with ostentatious artistry, what they offer is a superlative functionalism: Dance music so perfect it can't help but move you.</p></div>"|1202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1202-movements/|8.6|Tim Finney

Take
    Miles Davis. Or Madlib. Over the past 14 years, the West Coast's most
    eccentric indie-rap producer has rarely slowed down long enough
    to undergo careful examination, causing a welcome glut that continues with
    this 35-track, hour-long instrumentals album. Listening to his
    fractured, prolific output-- from the outer space splatters of Lord Quas or the loose jazz
    of Yesterday's New Quintet to collabos like Madvillain's scratched
    soul or Jaylib's supple club detonations-- is a trip through his
    clouded cerebrum with the windows up and the headlights dim. Culled from
    his extensive collection of records, Madlib's first official beats CD offers the most comprehensive study of where the producer has been and-- with previews of in-progress tracks for upcoming projects, including Madvillain 2-- where he's going.</p><p>
    
    As much a peek into a genius' process as a tutorial for dust-bin
    sneezers looking for the perfect beat, <em>Beat Konducta</em> displays
    Madlib's unrivaled knack for searching out oddities with a
    magnificently skewed ear. Floating his blurry drums over everything
    from fart-skronk bass to strong strings to tremulous keys, the beats
    forge continuity through layers of unsullied samples and enough vinyl
    hiss to scare an alley cat.</p><p>
    
    Conceptually based on vintage library records containing stock sound, each track on <em>Beat Konducta</em> is parenthetically labeled
    with a title and a mood. With emcees reduced to short
    snippets (Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., and ODB are all paid second-hand
    tribute), the instrumentals are granted space to mess about and they offer enough fuzzy fodder for listeners to conjure their own jumbles. Various alter egos make unmarked cameos, like
    when the spirit of Quasimoto comes down on ""Face the Sun (Africa),""
    its bitchy brew marked by a stumbling bassy gait. Or ""Sir Bang
    (Bounce)"", which could have easily found a home on the strip-club
    friendly Jaylib album. And Yesterday's New Quintet vibes infiltrate
    the D'Angelo-sampling ""Pyramids (Change)"", which doubles as an
    appealing demo for the neo/lost soul if he should ever once again come
    out of hiding. But, more often than not, <em>Beat Konducta</em> finds the
    producer in Madvillainy mode, offering shifty-eyed funk soliloquies
    with the help of Diana Ross, whose ""Keep an Eye"" gives ""Friends
    (Foes)"" its paranoid core, or Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, whose
    ""Help Me Find a Way (To Say I Love You)"" is given a light hip-hop
    dusting on ""The Comeup (Come Down)"".</p><p>
    
    Though Madlib's restless <em>joi de vivre</em> keeps <em>Beat Konducta</em> moving at a
    quick clip-- most tracks last between one and two minutes with tweaks
    and myriad minor samples zipping by every few seconds-- the lack of MC
    firepower considerably limits its real-life enjoyability. But the fact
    that the album is listenable at all is a testament to Madlib's undeniable
    skills as a hip-hop visionary, expanding the essence with appealing, tarnished grit. In an interview with <em>XLR8R</em> magazine in
    2003, when asked about his future aspirations, Madlib responded, ""Do...every type of music. All types of black art that there is, I'm going
    to try to do."" As this unmistakable beat CD shows, he's well on his
    way to that goal.</p></div>"|5542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5542-beat-konducta-vol-1-2-movie-scenes/|7.0|Ryan Dombal

    singer-songwriter Simon Joyner, who is, in a lot of ways, Conor Oberst's direct antecedent-- reared in the same scene, given to nakedly confessional, lyrics-first songwriting, folk-influenced, with a voice you'll either love or love to hate. Joyner has released eight albums since his 1993 debut, with each record surrounded by a veritable constellation of singles and compilation 
    tracks, the kind of thing that creates nightmares for fans who 
    don't live in places where all those scatterlings are procurable.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Beautiful Losers, that nightmare is over, as it draws together more 
    than an hour's worth of non-album tracks and sweepings from the cutting 
    room-- 21 songs in all. The compilation doesn't bother with chronology, 
    instead sequencing for flow, drawing all of its songs from the 1994-1999 
    span when Joyner was at his most prolific. As such, it predates what 
    to my ears is his masterpiece, 2001's <em>Hotel Lives</em>, though it offers plenty 
    of hints of that record's bleak, ramshackle sound. The album also exhibits a decent 
    amount of variety-- it features heart-pounding, hyperactive folk fingerpicking, melodic dirges, hard-strummed laments, and even a few passing stabs at rock.</i></p><p>
    
    As one might expect, the last of those rank among the disc's worst moments, 
    and the absolutely nadir is undoubtedly ""Judas Blues"", a lo-fi garage number 
    too covered in crust to be punchy, too poorly sung to be catchy and too 
    ineptly played to actually rock. There are a few other songs on which Joyner's 
    singing is just a bit too ragged to effectively convey the tune, resulting 
    in melodies that are more implied than real. ""Swing"" is a pretty prime 
    example of this, where Joyner's croak doesn't even rise close to a croon, 
    and it's hard to tell even where he thought the melody was going.</p><p>
    
    So they're not all diamonds, but they're not all lumps of coal either. There are even a few genuine surprises, like ""R Is for Riot"", a speedy, drum-led tune on which Joyner effectively and quickly strings his words together with a tumbling melody, as the Velvet Underground also sometimes did. Townes Van Zandt and Will Oldham, however, are closer reference 
    points on most of the rest of the disc, such as ""Love Is Worth Suffering 
    For"" and ""I Would Not Try to Break Ties With Me""-- the latter manages to juxtapose the sound of romantic dejection with suburban imagery 
    like ""the girls at the Clip 'n' Curl are talking about a man/ With a rose 
    in his coat/ And your name on the stem.""</p><p>
    
    The real jewel of the compilation, though, is ""Milk"", with forcefully 
    strummed acoustic guitar creating a frenzied atmosphere that sends lyrics 
    like ""This is not a song/ This is just one of those vivid dreams...sometimes 
    I wake up in the darkness when I should have stayed asleep"" straight home 
    and plays to his vocal strengths. It's a great song that any Joyner fan 
    should hear. Joyner fans are about the only ones who should hear much of the 
    rest of this disc, though, which is basically par for a rarities collection. 
    Everyone else can check out <em>Hotel Lives</em> or the <em>Lousy Dance</em> and leave it at 
    that.</p></div>"|4308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4308-beautiful-losers-singles-and-compilation-tracks-1994-1999/|6.5|Joe Tangari

Imagine deconstructed Essential Logic aerosol burns (stuff that barely hung together in the first place!) with kazoo instead of horns or Beefheart played by Nautical Almanac.</p><p>
    
    Mid-set with the aforementioned Nautical Almanac in 2005, a friend leaned over and said: ""Too free for me, man."" Live at No Fun, I had the same thought for Fat Worm: no forward momentum, not much to grab. Only when I turned and started doing something else (drinking? talking?) could I start to follow. Same with the record-- in the background, <i>Pregnant Babies Pregnant With Pregnant Babies</i> sounds its addled best, like on ""Cicadas"", light on the pointless snare work and heavy on feedback insect calls and crunchy leaves under foot. Front and center, odds are your roommates will start yelling at you: ""Dude, what the fuck is that?"" or ""Yeah, I actually lived with one of those guys. Stuff is terrible.""</p><p>
<i>Pregnant Babies</i> spends most of its time in between songs, but when they deign to appear they're sticky third-eye narrative thrillers: ""Red Melting Plastic Box"", for instance, is a story about a picnic gone wrong, honey and ants everywhere; they take over a lunch box and live there. That transitions into ""Laissez-Faire Is for the Birds"", in which pigeons come in, ruin the party, kill the ants, eat all the bread, and ride nature's chaos (gurgles, bird chirps, chords and choruses, the odd harmony) into triumph over mankind. </p><p>
    
    ""Brown"" and ""Hand of God"" make some sense, too: The former basically is a class rant (""she's so sophisticated, get it?""), and the latter's your standard anti-Christ or whoever (""the skin of God is dry and flaking"") song, set to pick and string drags.</p><p>
    
    Fat Worm of Error have a couple people who used to play in Deerhoof, and they've developed their own version of that band's unpredictability and kiddie-moan, except here set in Western Massachusetts and devoid of the presumption of an audience. Like kids, their alternate universe is addictive when you're in it. But mostly you're out of it, it's three-rows-back noise on a plane, and you can't sleep.</p></div>"|3367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3367-pregnant-babies-pregnant-with-pregnant-babies/|6.2|Zach Baron

Singer and
    pianist Amanda Palmer gleefully eviscerates singer-songwriter clichés;
    even when she plays fragile, she does so with smirking duplicity. If the pleasure of listening to music like this usually lies in examining the singer's fractured personal world, the Dresden Dolls both invite and punish such voyeurism-- Palmer pretends that she doesn't know you're looking, then turns around and gleefully stabs you in the face.</p><p>
    It took me a long time to warm up to the Dresden Dolls' rough, dark self-titled debut-- I was initially turned off by its theatricality. Eventually, however, it was the affectations that won me over; at their best, the Dresden Dolls paint a ghoulish
    smile on dark and downcast sentiments. Rather than simply baring their
    misery, the Dresden Dolls transform it into pleasurable artifice, making
    their music at once accessible and profoundly unsettling.</p><p>
    On <em>Yes, Virginia</em>, the few rough edges of the duo's debut are mostly
    smoothed out. Gone are the weird-as-fuck music box interludes and
    occasionally muddied production, leaving only immaculately recorded drums,
    piano, and vocals. Some will decry the slickness
    of <em>Yes, Virginia</em>, but the album's crisp sound often works to the Dolls'
    advantage. Brian Viglione's drumming is now elevated in the mix, and comes across as more dynamic and impressive than before-- amazingly, Viglione often matches Palmer in dramatic flair. And,
    thankfully, Palmer's voice is in prime form, making clear that studio
    sheen doesn't preclude an expressive vocal performance.</p><p>
    Musically and thematically, <em>Yes, Virginia</em> covers much of the same
    territory as its predecessor. ""Sex Changes"" opens the album with a blast
    of manic energy, oscillating between eerily upbeat piano tinkling and a
    brooding-yet-catchy chorus. ""Dirty Business"" is a musically explosive
    character sketch, narrating a girl who ""leaves out condoms on the bedroom
    dresser/ Just to make you jealous of the men she fucked before you met
    her."" The drumless ""Me &amp; the Minibar"" is all gasping, forlorn despair,
    Palmer hissing, ""I was so excited to/ Do such normal things with you/
    When you left last night/ With your toothbrush dry."" While these songs
    are quite different in feel, they demonstrate Palmer's remarkable
    talent for writing vocal parts that are both melodic and percussive.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the album has a few clunkers: The overlong and dull ""Delilah"", a disappointing centerpiece for an otherwise
    strong album, and ""Modern Moonlight"" opts for mood over melody, and
    ultimately falls short on both counts. <em>Yes, Virginia</em>
    doesn't have the expressive range of the Dresden Dolls' debut-- gone are the
    warped-vinyl sonic tinkering of ""672"" and the girl group allusions of ""The

Christopher O'Riley recorded not one but two albums of Radiohead arrangements for solo piano-- <i>True Love Waits in 2003 and </i><i>Hold Me to This last year-- taking the melodies and moods out of their original headspace with renderings that dramatically departed from the familiar versions. It was interesting to hear a classically trained musician engage with the band's cerebral art rock in this manner, and his approach made for some compelling interpretations, even if a large part of the albums' appeal was the novelty of hearing songs like ""2+2=5"" and ""No Surprises"" in a concert-hall setting. Where Radiohead's music is experimental and open-ended, however, Smith is much more of a pop formalist, with absolute faith in verses, choruses, and bridges. On <em>Home to Oblivion: An Elliott Smith Tribute</em> these ordered elements don't translate very well to O'Riley's aesthetic-- and the lyrics don't translate at all-- revealing the leveling effect his style has on his subjects: These Smith interpretations sound too similar to his Radiohead covers-- nearly identical, in fact-- which seems like a failure of imagination considering how different these artists are.</i></p><p>
    
    As with his previous albums, O'Riley's impressionistic style doesn't capture melody very naturalistically. With Radiohead this weakness was less pronounced, but Smith's songs are all melody, so O'Riley's interpretations of ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" and ""I Didn't Understand"" sound clunky and askew. The galloping pace of ""Coast to Coast"", while fine in the original, sounds rushed and manic in this setting, and ""Independence Day"" and ""Stupidity Tries"" trip headlong over their melodies. O'Riley starts ""Speed Trials"" with those same tense chords, which translate perfectly to piano and nicely set the tone for the song, but his arrangement sounds busy in its aimlessness, taking a long time to go nowhere in particular. Perhaps a simple, minimalist approach-- one hand playing a straightforward melody-- would have made this version of ""Between the Bars"" sound as elegant as the original instead of choppy and kitschy.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, O'Riley's method is commendatory and impressive in its meticulousness: He immerses himself in an artist's work, tracking down the rarest bootlegs and rarities with obsessive zeal. <i>Home to Oblivion even unearths one track, ""No Life"", that wasn't even attributed to Smith when O'Riley found it online. The upside to this approach is that the pianist can give a broad overview of an artist without greatest-hits pandering. For example, he doesn't do popular songs like ""Miss Misery"" or ""Waltz #2 (XO)"", but he does perform lesser-known album tracks like ""Bye"" and ""Satellite"". As with his Radiohead albums, </i><i>Home to Oblivion is a fan's tribute. The downside, however, is a head-in-the-sand reading of the artist, completely lacking criticality.</i></p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's due to the circumstances of Smith's death that O'Riley takes such a faithful tack on <i>Home to Oblivion. He's preserving and even reinforcing the common perception of the late singer-songwriter as a classically tortured artist, damned by the same obsessions that seemed to make him exceptional. In his liner notes, O'Riley makes numerous comments about the ""constant temptation of oblivion"" in Smith's songs, even taking that idea as the title of the album (and doesn't that album title seem in poor taste?) This highly romanticized view of Smith did him no favors when he was alive, and it does him even fewer favors now that he's dead. Worse, this approach seems at best limited and at worse patently false, since Smith's demons, while finding expression in his music, were related less to his music than to his own depression and drug addiction.</i></p><p>
    
    But O'Riley's worst crime is altogether more pedestrian: simply put, <i>Home to Oblivion is boring-- a word I typically try to avoid in reviews but seems apt here. The album's ostentatious tastefulness threatens to make O'Riley the Liberace of the indie set, and its practiced pleasantness makes it best suited for dinner parties and study sessions, where unobtrusiveness is both a necessity and a virtue. The album is background music not only because it can be easily ignored, but primarily because it has no foreground. There's nothing here to catch the ear, which makes O'Riley seem strangely oblivious to the challenges and rewards of Smith's music.</i></p></div>"|6109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6109-home-to-oblivion-an-elliott-smith-tribute/|3.9|Stephen M.

Take, for example, Rush's <em>Moving Pictures</em>, which unless you were too stoned to remember,
    featured uniformed workman-types outside an art gallery moving pictures (hardee-fucking-har). Mystery Jets have chosen a somewhat more intangible phrase for their debut album, <em>Making Dens</em>, but are no less explicit in their cover execution. There they are, relaxing in a den, complete with Persian rugs, pub-quality wallpaper, pianos, old gramophones, model airplanes, candlelight, typewriters, stereo speakers-- however, the trees looming overhead betray the fact that they've set up all their crap in the middle of a forest.</p><p>
    
    It's just the sort of curious scene that seems to justify the British press hitching Mystery Jets onto the lineage of Great British Eccentrics, one that spans Syd Barrett to Julian Cope to, more recently, the Coral and British Sea Power. You can see what they're getting at: You don't find too many bands whose on-stage set-up looks like a kitchenware store, who hail from a chunk of land on the Thames called Eel Pie Island, and who have a singer (Blaine Harrison) who can address the guitarist as ""dad"" (aka 55-years-young Henry Harrison). But eccentricity implies a measure of frivolity and whimsy that is palpably absent from <i>Making Dens; though the restless time changes and laser-show synth overtures betray prog-rock's ostentatious influence, the tightly constructed songs here (all but two of which stay under the five-minute mark) bristle with a passion and purpose that belongs only to the truly committed and composed.</i></p><p> 
    
    ""It always pays to be brave/ From the cradle to grave,"" singer Blaine declares on opener ""You Can't Fool Me, Dennis"", and he knows of what he speaks: Born with spina bifida, Blaine has spent his entire 20-year-life walking with crutches. As such, he possesses the commanding, uncompromising voice of someone for whom nothing came easy; a restless romantic in the mould of Patrick Wolf, Clearlake's Jason Pegg, or the Futureheads' Barry Hyde, you could force him to sing a capella before a crowd of lagered up Millwall fans and he wouldn't flinch. In a rare moment of understatement, he sings, ""Emotion pulls you like a horse-drawn cart""-- an understatement that belies the fact that emotion actually pulls Mystery Jets like an Autobahn-bound Benz with a cinder block dropped on the gas pedal.</p><p>
    
    Practically every track is pitched to hit the back rows, from the student-disco pint-raiser ""The Boy Who Ran Away"" to the apocalyptic ""Zoo Time"" to the climactic Dexy's-charged skiffle gallop of ""Alas Agnes"". But couched within the blustery delivery are pleas for intimacy: ""Diamond in the Dark"" recounts first dances, romances and unhappy endings, while, in the most overt reference to Blaine's medical history, ""Little Bag of Hair"" explores the emotional dependency between a bed-ridden patient and his caregiver. So, in effect, like most prog-informed bands, Mystery Jets do deal in fantasy. But theirs has nothing to do with warlocks, goblins and temples of Syrinx: like the makeshift living room depicted on the album cover, <em>Making Dens</em> dreams of the simple life-- specifically, the privilege of falling in and out of love-- that's so often denied to those who lack the means to fully enjoy it.</p></div>"|5686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5686-making-dens/|7.7|Stuart Berman

But over the past 25 years, singer/songwriter Naoko Yamano and her sister, drummer/bassist Atsuko, have been prolific and consistent enough to warrant praise even without the endorsement of more famous fans and mentors.</p><p>  
    
    Originality is hardly the point with Shonen Knife; they feel a kinship with British and American punks like Buzzcocks, the Ramones, and Black Flag, and their music sizzles with unabashed, carbon-copy glee. But the band's familiar, three-chords-and-no-frills guitar chug is typically offset by entertaining lyrical subversions pushed through the Japanese cultural filter. They're known for lighthearted and charmingly guileless lyrics about everything from flying jellybeans and tomato juice addictions to ugly bison and spam e-mail; Naoko's odd obsession with food and animals came about because, she confesses, she is ""too shy to write about love.""</p><p>  
    
    After founder Michie Nakatani left in 1999, Atsuko moved from drums to bass, though she still lays down beats for the majority of this record. Nakatani's departure led to an initial slump in the quality of Shonen Knife's releases, but Genki Shock! finds them sounding stronger and more energetic than ever. Tracks such as ""Broccoli Man"" are lyrically amusing (""Just boiled the Broccoli Man/ He tastes like pistachio/ Steaming, he seems to get angry"") while displaying a Beatles-influenced rhythmic swagger and psychedelic guitar lines that belie the cuteness Naoko exudes. Elsewhere, the Knife deliver high-powered punk anthems like ""Rock Society"" (which, to be honest, brings the whole Ramones thing a bit too close to the bone), the spiky pop of ""Jeans Blue"", and the more elaborate vocal compositions and guitar solos of standouts ""Magic Glasses"" and ""Forest Walk"". </p><p>  
    
    Naoko has often said that her main desire with Shonen Knife is simply to make people feel happy; when you find yourself dancing around the kitchen to songs like ""Giant Kitty"", singing ""Big big big cat/ I like it's fluffy body/ Everybody likes it's funny face"" with goofy joy, you know the Yamano sisters have succeeded with their jewel box of bright, bubblegum sounds. </p></div>"|7130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7130-genki-shock/|7.4|Mia Lily Clarke

    on Sub Pop, the Blood Brothers, Pretty Girls Make Graves-- Seattle has struggled to maintain its reputation as a hot bed of musical activity in the U.S. in recent years. Thankfully, with the rise of bands such as the ephemeral yet superb Chromatics, the city's music community began to reenergize-- particularly the political and radical DIY scene, which has evolved to embrace wider circles thanks to all-ages venues, active organization of protests such as Bands Against Bush, and a continual stream of exciting new groups.</p><p>
    
    After Chromatics disbanded, three of their members-- drummer Hannah Blilie
    (also of the Gossip), bassist Michelle Nolan, and guitarist Devin Welch-- formed Shoplifting at the tail end of 2002. Once teamed
    up with vocalist/guitarist Chris Pugmire, the group committed itself
    to continuing its involvement and support of Seattle's punk rock
    community, as well as embarking on a slew of basement shows and
    tours alongside likeminded groups such as Erase Errata and King Cobra.
    As a live band, Shoplifting are a shattering, approachable, soulful, and
    energetic proposition, and these qualities make their debut full length,
    <em>Body Stories</em>, feel like a bolt of fiery and inspiring positivity.</p><p>
    
    Shoplifting's exploration and communication of feminist, queer, and gender
    politics are processed via their expansive, abrasive songs, which kick and
    jostle like a young buck shaking dirt off its back. Bilile's drumming
    usually keeps things on the danceable side with driving tempos that recall
    the explosive punk of (the now sadly defunct) Black Eyes. Opening track
    ""M. Sally"" begins with a beautifully glittering guitar effect that weaves
    between Pugmire's tale of a woman-- perhaps a muse, perhaps a guardian-- named Mustang Sally, who protects him in times of need.
    Never ones to repeat a formula, Shoplifting blend tracks such as the
    upfront pop of ""Male Gynecology"" with instrumental semi-improvisations
    like ""Flying Factory""-- a furious, rhythm heavy soundscape which sounds
    great thanks to renowned producer Steve Fisk, who captures the band's live
    energy with extraordinary sensitivity.</p><p>
    
    Body Stories is an idiosyncratic and musically smart album. It actually
    <em>sounds</em> as though each member is pushing themselves as far as possible with their instruments and approach to composition, and the result is captivating. Although Pugmire takes on most of the vocal responsibilities, Bilile's singing on closing track ""Claude Glass"" is easily one of the record's highlights. Haunting and unusual, spilling over the prowling bass lines and discordant guitar, she weaves dark and uncertain images with fluctuating melodies and tones, before the song collapses into its bittersweet and sudden end.</p></div>"|7854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7854-body-stories/|7.4|Mia Lily Clarke

Hearing those tracks for the first time in years left me in a minor fit of nostalgia for the Aphex Twin persona circa 1995-- the impish playfulness, the eagerness to repulse, the self-mythologising and half truth-telling that kept him in the public eye, albeit at a comfortable remove.</p><p>
    
    And it felt like ages ago, longer than a decade. Excepting <em>Rubber Johnny</em>, which was years in the making anyway, none of those descriptors have any relation to his current-day incarnation. Since the underrated <em>Drukqs</em> took a critical drubbing way back in 2001, Richard D. James has all but retired his visage from popular culture. In a far cry from his usual prolificacy, he has only the Analord vinyl series to show for his last five years. In a singles review somewhere I wrote that he's handled his elder statesman status in electronic music like a hoary old jazzman, receding deeper into himself and into his music with time. Compared to how inscrutable he is now, the Richard D. James of 1995 looked like Ryan Adams.</p><p>
    
    Which is not to make it sound as if Analord is an insignificant accomplishment. A sequence of 11 different 12"" singles released under the AFX banner on James' Rephlex label starting in January 2005, they gave rise to his much-heralded return to hard IDM and acid techno, in the process selling in the five figure range, an incredible achievement for vinyl-- doubly so in the downloading era. Spawning more than 40 new tracks between them, the singles also helped to disabuse doubters of any notions that James had fallen into creative disrepair. </p><p>
<em>Chosen Lords</em> not only marks the exclamation point on the project, it comprises James' first proper full-length record since <em>Drukqs</em>. While this is basically a sequenced highlights package picked from the Analord bounty, the accompanying press release insists it was the full-length James always intended to release. Even if everything here is already familiar to Analord watchers, it's a welcome return.</p><p>
    
    Boasting 10 tracks and close to an hour of music, this comprises some of the busiest and most idea-packed music from the Analord set. Bookended by the insect electro of ""Fenix Funk 5"" and the sprawling jitterfunk of ""XMD 5a""-- the two tracks that made up <em>Analord 10</em>, the first release in the series (don't ask)-- <i>Chosen Lords consists mainly of wobbly acid techno and dark, low-light IDM. There are a few pleasant diversions: ""Crying in Your Face"" is a solemn 303 ballad hinged around something approaching a vocoder, ""Boxing Day"" is a sparkling old school electro workout, and tantalizing album highlight ""PWSteal.Ldpinch.D"" surprises by introducing, of all things, a banging 4/4. But as with the rest of James' best work as AFX, there's a restless, fidgety quality to everything else here-- bursting with scampering rhythms and analog keyboard spasms, it's a deeply claustrophobic record overall.</i></p><p>
    
    It's also masterfully arranged; James has refined his tangled, tangential compositional style down to a point. Much like a prog jazz record, it all sounds like a shambolic mess on first blush, but listen deeper and the individual parts start to assert themselves, not just in relation to the songs overall, but to each other. That labyrinthine style, along with James' regular palette of retro analog keys, combine to create a sound that is utterly sui generis and happily out of step with the overwhelming majority of techno in 2006.  That he can quietly return with material this strong is pretty impressive indeed.</p></div>"|240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/240-chosen-lords/|7.9|Mark Pytlik

There's nothing wrong with that. Russell rewrote disco in handwriting so fluid and personal that his stature would be assured even if that were all ever he did. But of course it wasn't. I think with time Russell's lyrical work-- one hesitates to use the phrase ""singer-songwriter""-- will only grow in stature, until it stands alongside his disco records in listeners' minds. But before his famed visit to Nicky Siano's Gallery club, and just before he formed his country (not country) band the Flying Hearts, Russell was on a modern composer's track, performing his (for the sake of ease, let's call it) minimalist music at downtown New York venues like the Kitchen.</p>
<p><i>First Thought, Best Thought</i> is the first example of Russell's instrumental work to be reissued by Audika Records, whose Steve Knutson has taken up the challenge of sorting through hundreds of hours of unreleased tapes. Like Audika's other Russell reissues, it features gorgeous sleeve design-- including a heartbreaking portrait of a forlorn-looking Russell, eyes sunken in shadow and cheeks mottled with acne scars-- and liner notes from Russell and the musicians he worked with at the time, in this case Ernie Brooks of the Modern Lovers. Unlike the other reissues, it features music that is both more and less compelling than the Russell listeners have come to know.</p>
<p>The first disc contains the two-part ""Instrumentals"", which was planned to be a 48-hour continuous performance but was only ever played live in bits and pieces. The previously unreleased ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is a masterpiece, up there with ""In the Light of the Miracle"" and <i>World of Echo</i> as Russell's greatest achievements. It melts the bustle of urbanity into the ebb and flow of a Midwestern lake. (Russell was obsessed with bodies of water growing up in Iowa, the way only a landlocked boy can be.) Minimalist only in its repetition, which weaves more than it cycles, ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is not what immediately springs to mind when you think of experimental music from the 1970s. It's beautiful, for one thing. And it sounds like it was made by someone who switched the radio on every now and again. In it, you can hear the gentle lope, twanging guitar ostinatos, and sweeping strings of 70s soul, the crosstown yearning of someone like Bobby Womack. You can also hear the ghosts of Ives, Copeland, and all the American composers who located the soul of the country in the fields, the canyons, and the frontier spaces. Russell wanted to gently dissolve the distinctions between high and low, catching hell for bringing the specter of popular music into New York's avant-garde. But he also dissolved geography. The space across 110th Street became as wide as a wheat field.</p>
<p>""Instrumentals Volume 1"" is worth the price of <i>First Thought, Best Thought</i> all on its own. Nothing else on these two discs is quite so beguiling, but the other pieces continue to reveal other sides of Arthur Russell. ""Instrumentals Volume 2"" flows out from ""Volume 1"", slowly stripping away the drums until the instruments melt into each other like the wax of multi-colored candles collecting in a pool. ""Reach One"" is a very early composition from 1973 which plays two Fender Rhodes electric pianos off each other with meandering results. (It's not necessarily an insult to call this juvenilia.) ""Tower of Meaning"", on the other hand, is an orchestral work of great refinement that cycles through slow, deliberate, not unpretty chords. It's the most traditionally classical piece on <i>First Thought</i>, though as always with Russell words like ""traditional"" and ""classical"" are relative terms. The set is rounded out by ""Sketch for the Face of Helen"", a rumbling bit of oily <i>musique concrète</i> that features a bleating tugboat.</p>
<p>Audika's reissue program is an act of devoted, some might say obsessive, scholarship and curatorship that deserves every bit of acclaim it's received. Five years ago, the availability of Russell's work was limited to a handful of songs on the first <i>Disco (Not Disco)</i> compilation. With the unearthing of material that never left Russell's apartment and the careful repackaging of records out-of-print for years, it now encompasses a broader view of Russell's genius than even those there at the time could have known. The most amazing thing of all is that a huge iceberg of still-unreleased music lurks under the receding, placid waters of Russell's anonymity. Give Steve Knutson a knighthood or something already.</p></div>"|6910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6910-first-thought-best-thought/|7.5|Jess Harvell

NNCK are one of NYC's most shadowy and studiously enigmatic free-sound collectives, while the Munich-based Embryo is a long-running Krautrock group whose music is a stylish blend of jazz, space rock, and pan-ethnic rhythms. Founded by percussionist Christian Burchard after he left Amon Düül II in 1969, Embryo have released more than 20 albums in various incarnations over their 35-year existence.</p><p>
    Burchard has remained the only consistent member of Embryo, a fact that might help explain the erratic nature of their extended discography. Early in their career, on such albums as 1973's semi-classic <i>We Keep On, Embryo's music showed the distinct influence of </i><i>Bitches Brew-style electric fusion, while later records show the group to be progressively informed by Indian, Middle Eastern and North African sources. Much of their work, however, has been too straitlaced and overtly jazzy to peg them as an obvious forerunner to NNCK's primal, shamanic guerilla performances. </i></p><p>
    Yet despite their radical differences in strategy and approach, these two ensembles share more in common than it might initially appear. Both groups diligently shun categorization, drawing upon whatever stray traces of free jazz, psychedelia, ethnic folk, or Martian blues that happen to capture their fancy, while maintaining a decidedly liberal attitude towards possible instrumentation. Moreover, both units are clearly guided by the same dogged devotion to spontaneous invention, and it's this sheer undisguised enthusiasm for joint exploration that enables EmbryoNNCK to so accurately capture the dazzling midpoint between their two softly-colliding galaxies. </p><p>
    On the opening volley of ""Weider des erste Mal"" the album immediately satisfies the first requirement of such collaborations-- it sounds like all participants are thoroughly locked-in and enjoying themselves. As many as 13 musicians contribute to these seven tracks, and yet the collective sound is never inordinately fussy or impenetrable. Nor is it ever unduly chaotic, especially by NNCK standards. With so many individual players involved it becomes difficult to pinpoint who exactly is doing what, but most of these heavily-percussive tracks have a steady underpinning of marimba or xylophone that I mentally credit to Burchard. This sultry percussion helps infuse pieces like ""Frank Cologne"" with the same languid, fractured exotica that has coursed through No Neck's work since at least their 2003 album <em>Ever Borneo!</em> At points, as on the live-recorded ""Five Grams of the Widow"", the assembled rhythms can bring out some of NNCK's latent drum-circle tendencies, but the album's continual melodic updates and relatively short track lengths keep the performances from descending too far into repetitive tribal excess.</p><p> 
    Another of the album's more distinctive voices belongs to NNCK vocalist/ performer Takahashi Michiko, whose spirited pipes supply tracks like ""Wieder das erste Mal"" and the slight-return of ""Das erste Mal"" with a hazy, generative propulsion reminiscent of recent Gang Gang Dance. The collaboration makes its most muscular avant-rock gestures on the bass-centered ""Die Farbe as dem All"", a loose-tongued megalith that would've sounded right at home on NNCK's 2005 <em>Qvaris</em> album. This song is also perhaps the best demonstration of EmbryoNNCK's casual symmetry. As with all the album's best moments, it proves the border between the two groups to be as porous and illusory as any drawn on the atlas, and gathers all their accumulated force seamlessly together into a single, indivisible whole.</p></div>"|5819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5819-embryonnck/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

    When Facedowninshit started in 1999 it was as provocation, uncompromising dudes from North Carolina who hung with the USAISAMONSTER crew and wrecked basements at a blur: seven years hard time have slowed them to a crawl, and landed them on Relapse, even though they're literally one of the last bands on earth a reasonable person could expect to get signed.</p><p>
    
    In other words, don't exactly believe <i>NPON</i>'s titular sentiment. Listen to ""Countless"": Even as Jason Crumer swears up and down about ""No chance for freedom/ No chance for hope/ No chance for countless futureless children/ With no hope"", his guitar's a traitor, flashing blues via thrash via metal via slower metal licks, unable to quite get to that dark place where there will, in fact, be no more riffs (a Kelly Polar show, for instance). ""Ten Strip""'s just too fast: lyrics scream, ""I'm a fucking acid casualty,"" which is <i>exactly</i> what their scattershot and well-armed doom feels like; PCP over weed, 15-minute sets over depressive jags that stretch for hours. Left For Dead pulled a similar trick circa a decade ago, menacing and bellowing over their own predicament-- then too it was always somebody else's fault-- but not in a shut-in way either; kids could skate to it, and did. Actually come to think of, Left For Dead's slogan was ""EAT SHIT"", so maybe they weren't just predecessors but prophets, too. </p><p>
    
    Facedowninshit's ""Fucked"" works out why their misery never quite becomes a downer: ""The guitar's my only friend/ Hack the chord and everything disappears/ Hack the chord until everything disappears,"" which sounds that violent, but really's that redemptive. They come pretty close to a guitar solo on this song, so you know dudes mean it.</p><p>
    
    More evidence for life-is-misery but music-is-fun might be the bassist's name: Waylon Riffs. But the case shouldn't be overstated: As they say, on ""NPON"", ""Self hatred/ Self medicate/ Self destruction/ Nothing positive/ Only negative,"" and they mean that, too: Self-hatred gets a lot of people out of bed in the morning.</p></div>"|3365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3365-nothing-positive-only-negative/|7.0|Zach Baron

We know him as Tom Zé, and at age 70 he's still making resolutely avant-garde music, or ""spoken and sung journalism,"" as he calls it. Zé has never had much use for artistic boundaries, and his history of creating challenging and sometimes outright weird records always kept him on the fringe of Brazilian music. It wasn't until David Byrne discovered his records in the late 1980s, ultimately making him the first signing to the Luaka Bop label, that he gained international fame as one of Brazil's most inspired sonic troublemakers. At the time, he had been making a living in his hometown at his nephew's gas station.</p><p>
    Nearly 20 years later, Zé occupies a revered space in Brazilian culture and music well out of proportion to any sales or popular notoriety he managed to compile in his heyday. But Zé's latest opus, <em>Estudando o Pagode</em>, is worthy of acclaim purely on its own terms. It's an ambitious, flawed, and ultimately vital work of astounding creativity that's in some ways even more radical than the recordings he made in his thirties.</p><p>
    Musically, the album is exactly what the title says it is: A study of pagode music. Pagode first developed as a sort of recreational, improvised music for samba musicians to play at gatherings and has evolved into a dance music of the street-- something of a rural analog to the baile funk that's become well-known in the last few years. Zé claims to have chosen this form largely because, like baile funk (and, for that matter, Tropicalia), it is widely reviled by the Brazilian middle classes. Of course, a guy like Zé was never going to play it totally straight, and the music is shot through with the influence of rock, funk, and hip-hop. The lyrics in pagode frequently objectify women and Zé explicitly confronts this aspect of the style and subverts the music's normal focus.</p><p>
    Lyrically, <em>Estudando o Pagode</em> is a complex, layered operetta featuring a cast of characters ranging from supernatural beings to everyday people. The overriding theme is the oppression of women by men throughout history; much of Zé's drama centers around a male character who, when attempting to shed paternalistic ideas, can't help bringing his own traditional associations into play. So the use of pagode music as the basis for the album is both ironic and culturally astute: It keeps the album firmly rooted in popular Brazilian forms, while using a traditionally macho music to denounce the subjugation of women.</p><p>
    Does this all sound complicated enough for you? <em>Estudando o Pagode</em> certainly sprawls, but it does so in the same way Rio, São Paulo, and Brasilia sprawl: Alternately in patterns and haphazardly, overflowing with humanity at all points, and messy at the edges. And unless you speak Brazilian Portuguese, all of the album's pretense-- it comes with a full libretto, and press copies also included mock Cliffs Notes-- will be confined to the accompanying booklet. That leaves you with the wild musical mélange cooked up by Zé and producer Jair Oliveira, and it never gets boring or too inaccessible. Male and female vocals, sung and spoken, alone and en masse, share space in the constantly shifting arrangements, where acoustic guitars, hand percussion, and jerry-built instruments like piles of metal and rolled ficus leaves mingle with programmed drums and mangled electronic tones. Vocals are pitch-shifted, donkeys and orgasms are imitated and simulated, respectively, while ""Mulher Navio Negreiro"" includes voices approximating the sound of wind.</p><p>
    The record opens with ""Ave Dor Maria"", riding a hip-hop beat topped with heavy descending guitar riffs and all manner of whizzing, fractured electronics, and Zé doesn't betray his age at all with his aggressive vocal delivery. Elsewhere, his singing ability sounds barely the worse for wear, and though he's never been thought of as a ""singer"" so much as a maverick, he deserves credit for making his average pipes do some pretty extraordinary things. Zé received formal musical training in college, and here he seems to use every ounce of it to subvert normality, using unusual chromatic piano runs in ""Quero Pensar"", otherwise one of the catchiest, most harmonically traditional songs on the album.</p><p>
    What really makes the album work is that the music transcends the underlying intellectual conceits. For instance, the scene that ""Duas Opiniões"" corresponds to, called ""It's Ridiculous to Cry"", includes a conversation in the Garden of Eden and a revelation of gossip in the court of angels, but on the level of pure listening, it sounds like a damn nice Brazilian ballad. Likewise, ""Elaeu"" couches its gay-rights message in an instantly memorable pop song, warped at the edges by swirling electronics.</p><p>
    Bottom line, <em>Estudando o Pagode</em> is an impressive album, musically, conceptually, and lyrically, and the cast of musicians and singers Zé assembled delivers on his singular vision. Whether or not this appeals to you depends on a lot of things, from your appetite for foreign-language music to your appetite for music guided by a Dadaist sensibility. If you're a newcomer to Zé, you'd probably be better off listening to Luaka Bop's 1991 <i>Brazil Classics, Vol. 4: The Best of Tom Zé</i> compilation first (I recommend this mostly because of the difficulty of finding his 1970 self-titled album). But in spite of its imposing premise, this album is surprisingly approachable and undeniably unique.</p></div>"|8951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8951-estudando-o-pagode-na-opereta-segregamulher-e-amor/|7.9|Joe Tangari

It's the kind of record that makes you reconsider a band's back catalog just to figure out what went wrong. Here, the reportedly stern producer's hand of Dave Grohl forced each band member to take on a less-is-more philosophy and focus on what they contribute to the songs. But since when has this band been about subtlety?</p><p>
    Rye Coalition's previous album, <em>On Top, found them cannibalizing classic rock and twisting it with a post-hardcore sensibility, mixing it all together for a faster, cheesier, more out of control amalgamation. Maybe their more indie selves split apart and formed another band, leaving these knuckle-dragging dopplegangers in their place, but the tempos have cooled, the bass has lost its sick Jesus Lizard-like rumble, and the riffs...farewell, we barely knew ye.</em></p><p>
    I wouldn't have thought this was the same band until hearing the hoarse cry of vocalist Ralph Cuseglio. Then I listened to the words. Where I used to forgive their lyrics because of their instrumental potency, now lines like ""Dont give a damn what the neighbor's say/ Gonna love you anyway"" are sung unaccompanied between a few bar-band staccato bursts on ""Pussyfootin'"". ""Oh yeah, all right,"" goes the chorus, and the whole thing seems straight from a pile of discarded Miller Lite commercial demos. And that's nothing compared to ""Tequila Mockingbird"": ""We're everything he's not, we're the kings of the block/ We will never stop/ We're so cool we're hot."" If you can think of song titles like ""Between an I-ROC and a hard place,"" you can create better tongue-in-cheek lyrics than that.</p><p>
    ""Burn the Masters"" vaguely describes New York City brownouts over a snaggle-toothed two-chord shuffle, and the one-note piano hammering in the bridge is just one of many weak clichés thrown into these songs with neither irony nor verve. It's not that they've forgotten how to play, because ""IROC"" is crammed with fleet-fingered soloing (the indulgences are probably the most interesting moments) and ""Vietnam Veterinarian"" wedges a sample of chanting cheerleaders in between the chug of the guitars, while Cuseglio screams like he's being squeezed in his bathing suit area. It's the songs they've neglected: They plod forward with generic piston-like rhythms, focusing solely on the one-dimensional vocals and limp songwriting. ""Clutch Pearls"" is unforgivably straightforward third-stage-at-11-a.m. Ribfest hard rock, and songs like ""Secret Heat"" and ""True Love By The Hour"" lack the band's usual manic energy, or any kind of payoff in their melodies.</p><p>
    Perhaps <em>Curses</em> is an example of a flawless lampoon, but I didn't start listening to these guys because they were clever. In the past, they made old conventions sound fresh again. If this is what they've been shooting for all along, then they've perfectly filled the footprints of the dinosaur rock acts before them by cranking out boring records after their peak.</p></div>"|6885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6885-curses/|4.0|Jason Crock

    companion album, recorded around the same time with just the grandkids
    on the mic. The earlier record's ""difficulty"" is debatable; <em>Rehearsing
    My Choir</em> failed for many (including me), but not because it was too
    opaque or complicated. Taken as a whole, the lyrics were probably the
    most accessible the band has written so far. But the lead voice and
    format, both of which were chosen with a reasonable expectation of the
    intended effect, were never going to work for everybody. It was a
    specialty item.</p><p>
<em>Bitter Tea</em> is a very different record: no Olga Sarantos; no overriding
    narrative; not as much in the way of recurring musical themes. But
    it's cut from the same cloth, and its ""meaning,"" or the meaning of
    individual songs, is surely even harder to grasp. This is not by any
    stretch a turn toward the accessible, though there are a few great pop
    moments. We'll get to those in a sec.</p><p>
    What comes to mind during early listens is how odd this record
    sounds, and how often the production on Fiery Furnaces' records is
    overlooked. Some of the distinctiveness is up to Eleanor Friedberger's voice, with
    her English major's diction and her ability to make the dozen or so
    notes in her natural range do all kinds of work. Her brother
    understands her strengths, writing for her crisp lines that draw
    attention to the grammatical construction. ""To see: could there one
    for me be?"" from this record's ""Waiting to Know You"", for example. But
    <em>Bitter Tea</em> as a sonic experience, in terms of the instruments used and
    the effects used on them, is even more exceptional.
    </p><p>
    For starters, this makes two albums in a row where a tinny upright
    piano dragged from a the lounge of a depression-era bordello functions
    as the signature instrument, stitching together the patchwork songs
    with Matt Friedberger's speedy little trills. Before it seemed to
    reference a radio play; here it serves as a reminder that we inhabit
    the world of one band and one band only. Other interesting choices
    abound: squelchy Moog that references neither the instrument's classic
    era nor its 90s update; distorted percussion meant to be disorienting
    instead of forceful; a disco beat that gyrates in place with quotation
    marks standing in for the mirror ball.
    </p>
<p>
    Then there's the regular stream of backward vocals, the record's most
    pressing recurring motif. On tracks like ""In My Little Thatched Hut"",
    ""The Vietnamese Telephone Ministry"", and ""Nevers"", the words move
    backward but the melody still fits the chords. The technique may
    allude to a wrinkle in time or some sort of aphasia, but it also
    points up how little comprehension of the actual lyrics matters to the
    enjoyment of Fiery Furnaces' music. I consider myself a curious person
    but I couldn't care less what's actually being said on the backward bits.
    </p>
<p>
    Puzzling over meanings and allusions seems a worthwhile project, though, and
    I've no doubt that on some level the words can bear such scrutiny.
    Some amount of detective word might transform some of the less
    musically engaging tracks into something enjoyable. I can't find much
    in ""I'm In No Mood"", ""The Vietnamese Telephone Ministry"", or ""Whistle
    Rhapsody"" to draw me back again; to my ears they serve mostly as
    reminders of <em>Bitter Tea</em>'s gassy bloat (72 minutes, though two tracks
    repeat at the end in different mixes). The album seems to drag in its
    final third, but really the lesser tracks are spread evenly
    throughout. It's more a cumulative weariness than any sort of front-loading.
    </p>
<p>
    Which is unfortunate since <em>Bitter Tea</em> contains some of Fiery Furnaces'
    best songs. ""Teach Me Sweetheart"" is unfailingly gorgeous, a
    perfect melding of experimental production ideas that match perfectly
    the mood and the sweet, undeniable melody. ""Waiting to
    Know You"" is almost as good with its prom night slow dance chord
    progression, and bizarre mix; there's no logical reason why this song
    needs an absurdly fat Moog bass, but hey, turns out it does. ""Police
    Sweater Blood Vow"" seems like a quirky leftfield pop hit; in another
    time it might have been this band's ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", And
    ""Benton Harbor Blues"", particular in its second mix, which omits a
    meandering two-minute intro, shows how effortlessly Matt Friedberger
    can come up with a simple, breezy, and likeable pop tune when so
    inclined. If Fiery Furnaces wanted a shortcut to a larger audience,
    this track points the way.
    </p>
<p>
    But such a path probably doesn't interest these two. Fiery Furnaces
    have other things in mind, and so far the project seems in part to be
    about finding a way to challenge themselves and stay interested when
    writing good, catchy songs comes so easy. Fiery Furnaces is the work
    of thought and calculation rather than instinct. This imparts a chilly
    remove to the records but I don't think that's a criticism. There's no
    shortage of direct and heartfelt indie rock that talks about the
    passion, but nothing else going sounds like the Fiery Furnaces'
    carefully considered babble.
    </p>

The Gourds' bluegrass ""Gin &amp; Juice""? Damn, you guys are inconsistent! You pushed Sufjan to #1 at the Barnes &amp; Noble, but you can't be bothered to check for the album that ""a music fan"" on Amazon.com considered ""the best CD I've heard in years... an underground classic""? Add to shopping cart if you care at all about music, or go through life wondering what made ""malachy00"" say, ""Shazam! I won't quantify this one, but iof [sic] you enjoy rock/bluegrass with splash of Snoop then you have found your CD. Buy one for yourself and your neighbor."" I have, and I will. And my neighbor bought one for his neighbor and so on. Expect a copy from your neighbor shortly. Spreading like mumps. And why? Because bluegrass and hip-hop are brethren born from the womb of jazz and blues, sharing the same desire to rise above circumstance through celebration and make a cold world take notice. Makes sense, right? Some white guys finding a connection to black music through white music with a comparable thrust, i.e. getting trashed on gin and juice because what the fuck else are you gonna do...? Well, at least it makes more sense than ""Radio Heads"".</p><p>
    
    This album title is going places: These are people who are ""heads"" because they make beats, but they also purportedly like a group named Radiohead, you see? So, I mean, someone probably <i>should</i> do something with that. Maybe they should go on iTunes and get the Radiohead Essentials (nothing off that crappy first album, though!) and give whatever songs to some artists who are in the studio right now. What's ?uestlove up to? He's mentioned Radiohead in a few interviews. Get him to ask some of his friends to contribute something. Have them whip a track together and hope it doesn't sound like the band at one of those live karaoke bars. Just enough to recoup investment and maybe break one song to radio (Mark Ronson and Alex Greenwald's ""Just""), if not a spot in a commercial or ""Veronica Mars"". I don't know. Oh, and the Bad Plus. They're good at this kind of thing. Possibly set something up with Gilles Peterson and have Jamie Cullum and Joss Stone sing a 20-minute medley of all the album's songs with, like, Lee Ritenour and Grandmaster Flash jamming behind them. It's time people knew how funky Radiohead can get, you know? They're so gloomy. Is James Lavelle dead?</p><p>
    
    So I've got an idea, partially inspired by <i>Exit Music, but pretty much something I've been thinking about for a long time: My instant messages covered by post-rock bands. There's this one from 2002 where I told my friend L00p3r about how I used to set up elaborate crime scenes in my bedroom when I was four years old. I would take all the clothes out of my little red dresser and throw them around the room like someone was looking for a microchip or something. Then I would flip my mattress off the bed, lay on the floor, and put the TV on my head so the blue glow of ""ChiPs"" would reflect in my dead eyes. I would lie there and wait for my parents to come in and fall to their knees in agony, and then I would jump up and say, ""I told you not to make me eat hot tuna!"" But they would never come in my room. I think Godspeed! would be perfect. </i></p></div>"|6663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6663-exit-music-songs-with-radio-heads/|0.6|Peter Macia

Pinpoint-perfect yet still vague about just what that </i><i>thing actually is, this line crops up regularly in reviews and features-- even four years and three albums later. Still, it's a useful phrase to describe the band's music. Their three-guitar rock is Southern in the sense that it sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd and early .38 Special, but even more fundamentally, their songs are thoroughly and deeply saturated in the sap of the region.</i></p><p>
    
    The group's three songwriters-- Patterson Hood, Mike Cooley, and Jason Isbell-- trade in lyrics dense with details that are specific and local, never resorting to broad strokes or simple Southern archetypes, and their sympathies toward modern-day outlaws like the still-workers in ""The Buford Stick"" or the small-town drug dealer in ""Putting People on the Moon"" are ambiguous and conflicted, which seems like a condition that all Southerners live with to some degree or other. They write about the South as they see it personally, and about themselves as they've been shaped by living in the South. This is a considerable accomplishment, one very few present-day regional bands manage to achieve: It adds depth to the characters in their songs, and it gives their personal, more openly autobiographical confessions impossibly high stakes.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this balance between the band and its home was bound to wobble a bit eventually, and it's to the group's credit that it didn't happen sooner. Reportedly their first album written in the studio instead of on tour, <em>A Blessing and a Curse</em> is also Drive-By Truckers' first that doesn't present a larger picture of the South at all. There are hints and evocations on songs like ""Aftermath USA"" and ""Little Bonnie"", but no big statements. Few of these songs have the intense sense of place or perspective that distinguishes their previous efforts. If the Drive-By Truckers once sounded like they were speaking for a wide populace that is rarely represented in contemporary rock music, here they sound like they're speaking only for themselves. Yet, while the songwriters are front-and-center, they actually sound less prominent without their regional distinction to amplify their personalities.</p><p>
    
    While this new creative method doesn't prove particularly advantageous for a band that's built its reputation on solid live shows, it does have its share of blessings as well as curses. For one thing, it plays into the band's twin weaknesses for lots of guitars but relatively few riffs and lots of lyrics with relatively few melodies. Songs like the title track and ""Wednesday"", with its awkwardly generalized storytelling, sound practiced instead of spontaneous, calculated to appeal to an imagined audience rather than actually tested by real crowds. On the other hand, this approach frees the band up to broaden their scope. Mike Cooley's ""Space City"" possesses a gentle yet precarious ruminativeness, and on Patterson Hood's ""Goodbye"" a breezy, 1970s rock vibe offsets dark lyrics about dead and departed friends. Jason Isbell riskily attempts a soaring chorus on ""Daylight"", and even though he doesn't have the vocal range, the technical flaws only make his crisis seem all the more insurmountable.</p><p>
    
    Yet, for all the new tricks this in-studio approach allows them, the Truckers still sound like the same old Truckers-- maybe not always as powerful and urgent, but still undeniably themselves. ""Feb. 14"" recalls the impossible romance of ""Something's Gotta Give (Pretty Soon)"", and ""Little Bonnie"" is-- like ""My Sweet Annette""-- a chapter in the Hood family history. A harsh, funny, lusty look at fame and expectations, ""Gravity's Gone"" is prime Mike Cooley, a song that never loses its slippery hook or tones down its ballsy frankness: complaining about the entertainment industry, he observes, ""Cocaine rich comes quick and that's why the small dicks have it all."" Hood's ""Aftermath USA"" starts funny as it describes the messy evidence of a wild night: ""The car was in the carport sideways...heel marks on the roofline, bad music on the stereo"". But as it progresses and the band's chicken-fried groove intensifies-- thanks to Jojo Herman's keyboard work and an always tight rhythm section-- the joke falls away and something sinister emerges: ""Crysal meth in the bathtub, blood spattered in my sink...it's all worse than we think.""</p><p>
<em>A Blessing and a Curse</em> ends with ""A World of Hurt"", in which Hood delivers the verses in a sing-speak so confident and disarming it threatens to throw the whole album into new focus. Songs like this-- starkly stoic yet moving, drawing on influences that no one else in our little indie world is bothering with-- are why the Drive-By Truckers remain one of the best and most exciting bands to rise out of the South in a while. However, for the first time in the group's decade of existence, they've made an album that doesn't entirely live up to their reputation.</p></div>"|2512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2512-a-blessing-and-a-curse/|7.0|Stephen M.

Otherwise, the sensibility-- imposing, grandiose, broadly abstracted, and elusively creepy-- is identical. The Torino-based band Larsen's latest seems a cross between Godspeed's elliptical storytelling and Swans' doomy elegance (Jarboe imbues several tracks with haunting vocal auras), and like its title, it's an enigmatic palindrome-- leavened with ambiguous portent, it would play just as well in reverse, with all of its amorphous eloquence intact. There's a story here, but instead of unfolding, it revolves in diminishing orbits, wending deeper and deeper into the tiny gaps between Antony and the Johnsons collaborator Julia Kent's quivering cellos and Larsen's lapping electrical waves.</p><p> 
    
    ""The Snow"" opens the album, a post-rock primer layering deep brown pulsations over mechanical sputter and buzz, swelling strings over percussive stabs of acoustic guitar. A muffled clatter moves across the channels like something tumbling down stairs, a sound that resolves into the crisp tattoo of a marble bouncing and rolling across a wooden floor as the spacious mix presses in claustrophobically. It's as if you're moving deeper into forbidding architecture, toward the dark heart of the thing, the boiler room or basement. Thunder rolls in the distance; the narrative thrust is indistinct but pointedly sinister. The brief ""2nd"" shushes up and down on a ladder of echoing percussion punctuated by hollow reports, rudimentary guitar, and spectral vocal harmonies, evoking some infernal machine of flesh, steel, and bone. That's how it sounded to me, anyway. On songs like these, the interpretive possibilities are limited only by the listener's penchant for the diabolical, and it's not hyperbole to refer to these moments as literally hellish.</p><p> 
    
    Elsewhere on <em>SeieS</em>, Larsen leaves less to the imagination, sacrificing thematic depth for melodic breadth, and the resultant impression is heaven to the more nebulous tracks' hell. ""Mother"" flaps languidly like colossal wings, its high whistles and yawning, slowly sawing stings given shape by a gently tumbling bass line, wafting percussion, whispery vocal accents, and a slightly lagging guitar melody. ""Rever"" rises up on a pillar of wowing distortion, idyllic guitars and gleaming celestial tones tracing out a luminous melody across the tumult, with a hymn-like quality to its reverent ascent. All this weighty insinuation, this evoked latitude of experience-- damnation and redemption, hope and despair-- is familiar from a multitude of other post-rock albums, and listeners who've grown weary of the genre's contrivances will find nothing rejuvenating here. But those who still get a spiritual kick from soundtracking their sunset commutes with the appropriate bombast will find <em>SeieS</em> to be a valuable entry in the canon. </p></div>"|4693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4693-seies/|7.0|Brian Howe

When the vocals do come in, Anar Badalov and Flora Wolpert Checknoff, the two teenagers who play just about everything on the album, just mumble in tandem like a gloomy Moldy Peaches, moving glacially toward a melody but stopping abruptly before they get there. It's a trick they pull repeatedly. Badalov and Wolpert Checknoff have this shit down perfectly, but it's all they do. So while <em>Socialize</em> is an impressive work, it's depressive, monolithic mood can be just about unbearable over the course of its 11 songs.</p><p>
    
    This might all just be a long way of saying that Metal Hearts sound pretty much exactly like Arab Strap. Badalov's voice in particular is just Aidan Moffat's smoky mutter without the Glasgow burr, and both bands have the same proclivities toward diffuse, muddy compositions and lyrical explorations of bad-faith Neil LaBute relationship politics. ""You watch me fester in masturbatory quiet/ I swallow a bottle of wine so I can get by it,"" Wolpert Checknoff gurgle on ""Mountain Song"". For a couple of kids who started their band via IM, these two couldn't sound much more sad or tired.</p><p>
    
    All this foggy, understated self-loathing can be a bit much-- especially when the music comes in barely-there wisps of guitar-- but <em>Socialize</em> is lifted by a series of unexpected, intriguing touches. ""Gentleman's Spell"" features a violin that sounds like a film-noir saxophone, and when it combines with the song's murky breakbeat, it's as if the the ghost of Jay Dee come to haunt the world of mopey indie-folk. ""Mountain Song"" takes a bunch of New Order drums sounds but rearranges them to make them sound queasy and disconnected rather than bright and euphoric. And on ""Ocean Song"" florid guitar riffs swim into complicated patterns and form a lush pillow for the empty-shell laments of the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    It'll be a while before Badalov and Wolpert Checknoff manage to turn all this dejection into anything transcendent, but they're both young, and they've got plenty of time. If nobody introduces them to puppies or Pixie Stix or Playstation in the next couple of years, they could reach Cat Power levels of cathartic misery before anyone realizes what happened.</p></div>"|5687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5687-socialize/|6.4|Tom Breihan

So, like, I said, this is a revised version of that previous CD with a couple of changes made. There is a track from our new record,</em> At War With the Mystics, <em>this song is called ""Free Radicals."" You'll find that on here...""</em> --""Wayne's Intro""</p><p>
    
    ...What the fuck? Here I am, hoping to hear a history of the Flaming Lips' much-lauded live performances, and instead I get frontman Wayne Coyne reading me what could be the album's one-sheet (plus an extensive thank-you to the fans) over a homey acoustic instrumental. Coyne's explanatory monologue casts <em>20 Years of Weird</em> as a casual affair, and it's an extremely appropriate introduction; those looking for a live retrospective that does justice to the Flaming Lips' formidable history had best look elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    So, like he said, <em>20 Years of Weird</em> is being issued to coincide with the Lips' new full-length <i>At War With the Mystics. The inclusion of the dreadful album track ""Free Radicals"" immediately dates this compilation as-- like the bizarre remaster of Modest Mouse's <em>The Moon and Antarctica</em> right before the release of its follow-up-- a dubious release that can't decide if it wants to be an in-depth live document or a shameless promo trinket.</i></p><p>
    
    Between ""Wayne's Intro"" and ""Free Radicals"", <em>20 Years of Weird</em> gets off to a frustrating start. Thankfully, one of the compilation's best moments, studio rarity ""Enthusiasm for Life Defeats Existential Fear"", follows these two questionable inclusions. With a simple, repeating melody and slight variations on a central (and fairly obvious) lyrical theme, the song plays kind of like a more subdued version of ""The Spiderbite Song"" from <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>. True to its title, ""Enthusiasm for Life"" chooses comfort over deep angst; lyrics like ""Last night I had a horrible dream/ But your smile in the morning came and took it all away"" come off as subtly smile-inducing, but expertly avoid syrupy self-seriousness. </p><p>
    
    The rest of <em>20 Years of Weird</em> consists of decent-quality recordings spanning the band's history, from early psychedelic jams to a document of one of the 1996 ""parking lot experiments,"" in which Coyne conducted pre-recorded tapes playing in a number of car stereos. The recordings are generally so-so in quality-- there's a lot of crowd noise, the drums clip, and the vocal levels are inconsistent. But every once in a while something transcendent does manage to emerge from the cacophony, especially towards the compilation's end. A 12-minute take on ""When You Smile"" segueing into ""Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus With Needles"" is the most interesting inclusion, showcasing a sloppy and frenetic energy that has been largely absent from the band's current three-piece incarnation.</p><p>
    
    The real irony here is that the Flaming Lips have always operated under such a keen awareness of how limited the <em>sound</em> of a rock show can be. From fan-hugging furries to garbage bags full of inflated balloons to in-the-ear headphones simulcasting the show, the Flaming Lips have employed just about every conceivable strategy to enhance the live experience for their fans. Their 4xCD album <em>Zaireeka</em> proved the band more than willing to extend such sonic experiments to their recorded output. Whatever the future holds, the Flaming Lips have a proud history of taking their fans seriously; <em>20 Years of Weird</em> does an okay job of telling that history, but does little to show it.</p></div>"|3088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3088-20-years-of-weird-flaming-lips-1986-2006/|6.0|Matt LeMay

The prospect of a band comprised of two ex-Promise Ringers (Davey von Bohlen, Dan Didier) and Dismemberment Plan's virtuosic bassist, Eric Axelson, was at least one-third exciting. But not only did <em>Glass Floor</em> fail to capture any of the Plan's rumbling energy, it wasn't even as good as the Promise Ring, misplacing that band's occasional moments of fizzy pop glory in a morass of murky songwriting. Davey's precious lisp was even more pronounced against the drab musical backdrop; the melodies meandered; Axelson puttered away on inconsequential basslines (which was kind of like using a Stradivarius as a doorstop).</p><p> 
    What a terrific surprise, then, that <em>We, the Vehicles</em> not only exceeds its predecessor, but serves as a corrective to every one of its deficiencies. This is still post-emo indie-pop, and some listeners have no patience with the genre no matter how well-turned. But for what it's worth, <em>We, the Vehicles</em> is post-emo indie-pop at its finest. Davey von Bohlen, no longer lisping and puling, has developed a confident, nuanced and-- gosh, almost adult?-- singing style that makes you want to drop the diminutive and start calling him ""Dave."" Instead of the rickety, blasé acoustic whatever that often masquerades as emotional authenticity in post-emo songwriter stuff (<em>Glass Floor</em> included), we get sharp, spacious guitar melodies with an actual bite. And apparently someone gave Axelson the go-ahead to just get nuts on the bass-- the mechanically precise, aerodynamic lines that helped create Dismemberment Plan's sense of off-kilter glide provide a foundation of seething energy for <em>We, the Vehicles</em>, bending it away from the watery slackerisms of its predecessor and into more fertile D Plan/Death Cab territory.</p><p> 
    While the album is consistently strong, the first three direly infectious songs are pitch-perfect expressions of the form. ""Calm"" has a sort of Springsteenian faded glamour, with its down-but-not-out lyrics; the starry whorls of guitar and von Bohlen's confident vocals lofting triumphantly on sudden updrafts. The propulsive yet temperate verses of ""Tearing Up the Oxygen"" are book ended by choruses filled with breathy, harmonized ""ahs"" and a simple, ideally placed keyboard blips, an economy of sound producing a rich aural field. And ""People, the Vehicles"" is a dead-ringer for late D Plan, with its fluid bass and prickly/coasting guitars, and includes some of von Bohlen's most striking imagery to date: His ""boys with directionless hair"" and ""languorous girls in undertaker make-up.""  That it also includes some dross about ""our painted bodies in the secret morning"" is something I'm glossing over-- the song is so engaging that I'm unwilling to shrug it off so easily. We forgave Interpol for their clunkier efforts, and I'm not going to penalize Maritime just for having cheaper haircuts. </p></div>"|5591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5591-we-the-vehicles/|7.8|Brian Howe

    epidemiological rates, it's probably time to
    collectively raise our bars. For a while, it was
    enough to simply encourage them, so stationary and joy-deficient had indie become in the dark days of the
    90s. The first swarm of
    laptop cross-faders were rough around the edges
    technically, letting a little bit of beat-matching
    software know-how suffice for true mixing talent, but
    that was okay, given that it was such a novel
    sensation-- at least for those of us born in the late
    70s/early 80s on the left side of the Atlantic.</p><p>
    
    But now that most major cities have an indie-dance
    night for every day of the week, we can afford to apply
    tighter standards. After all, mixing can be utilized
    for much more than the novelty segue or the arbitrary
    mash-up-- it can be used to assemble an emotional
    pastiche, make a complex genre statement, or manipulate the crowd's emotions as if they're plugged
    into the PA. Obviously, this has been common practice
    in clubs for decades at this point, but how well indie
    bands can be folded into the process remains to be
    conclusively proven.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for Washington D.C.'s James F!@#$%^
    Friedman, his mixing style doesn't wilt under
    harsher scrutiny, as the relentless <em>Go Commando</em> proves. 
    Weaving P4k faves Annie, Out Hud, and the Knife
    into a dark, foreboding 70 minutes of music, the man
    with the cartoon swears proves indie can
    be legitimate turntable fodder in the right hands.</p><p>
    
    Using largely pre-remixed material, such as the
    Rapture/Hush Hush spelling-bee rework of Annie's ""Me Plus
    One"" or M.A.N.D.Y.'s do-over on the Knife's ""Pass
    This On"", Friedman conjures a cohesive mood that's
    pure American Autobahn, like a DFA that's slightly
    less disco-obsessed. Dark rhythms rule pretty much
    from wire to wire, which reverses the hierarchy of
    your usual indie-club set: rather than token
    electronic songs being used to dance up stiff guitar
    band material, Friedman's occasional injections of
    live instrumentation offer an occasional respite from the
    4/4.</p><p>
    
    Whatever the case, the off-kilter voices of Tom Vek
    and Bloc Party's Kele Okereke are made to sound
    downright diva-like amidst the mix's machinery,
    whereas strange bedfellow landmarks like Out Hud and
    zombie soundtrack music integrate with little
    difficulty. Freeform Five's appropriately-titled
    ""Eeeeaaooww"" and the creepy 8-bit lope of Who Made
    Who's ""Space for Rent"" (Rapture/Hush Hush on makeover
    duty again) stand out among the sub-headliner names,
    moments where the new-wave yelping puzzle-pieces right
    into the cyberpunk machinery.</p><p>
    
    Friedman may be a ringer in this competition, having
    apprenticed in what his press kit refers to as the ""D.C.
    rave scene"" (hmmm), but his more polished technique
    should be seen as instructional to the Powerbook
    rookies of the indie-dance night world. Though <em>Go
    Commando</em>, in a Gestalt sense, ends up slightly
    monotone-- and while the tracklisting never quite gets
    as eclectic as Friedman's MySpace profile would
    promise-- it's still a salad bar of sounds that can
    hold the pace at most binge-drinking pre-parties. So
    put the open-digital-in nights at indie bars on
    notice, as the professionals may be starting to
    invade.</p></div>"|3366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3366-go-commando-with/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

    Josh Rouse has yet to travel beyond where-the-heart-is
    innocuousness. Here's a guy who claims he was ripped off by John
    Mayer, after all. Rouse started settling into his current rut with his agreeable yet insubstantial
    sophomore album, 2000's <em>Home</em>. Subsequent pleasantries like
    <em>Under Cold Blue Stars</em>, <em>1972</em>, and last year's
    <em>Nashville</em> conspired to render debut <em>Dressed Up Like
    Nebraska</em> a big, brooding alt-country fakeout. Sure enough, Rouse stays the course on
    <em>Subtítulo</em>, his first album since ditching his former label and moving
    to Spain.</p><p>
    Setting has always been important to Rouse's music, and laidback opener
    ""Quiet Town"" depicts the troubadour's current Iberian environs atop
    sunny Harry Nilsson finger-picking, weeping strings, and campfire
    whistling. Spanish singer Paz Suay lends her lilting accent to
    duet ""The Man Who..."", though the pedal steel, bossa nova rhythm, and
    L-train mentions muddle the geography. Not a Travis reference,
    apparently: turns out the eponymous man just ""doesn't know how to
    smile"". And hey, if you're too cool for Jack Johnson's stoned beach
    bumming, there's always Rouse's scratchy impersonation on palm-swaying
    nostalgia trip ""Summertime"".</p><p>
    Rouse focuses on times and places, <em>Subtítulo</em> suggests, because
    he's not so hot at writing about people. Rouse's idea of a love song:
    ""I'm so crazy about you/ So crazy and it's true/ I think you're
    wonderful/ Don't change,"" amid ebbing elevator strings. It's
    the worst thing I've heard this year that wasn't sung by Richard Ashcroft. Glossy
    potential single ""It Looks Like Love"" is equally vapid: ""There goes that melancholy feeling
    again/ It looks like love is gonna find a way."" As if merely
    mentioning sadness were the same as describing it. He'd need Mariah
    Carey's Olympian melismata to sell this brand of tacky
    sentiment, but Rouse is stuck with a strained Ryan Adams whine.</p><p>
    At only 33 minutes, <em>Subtítulo</em> doesn't leave Rouse, longtime
    producer Brad Jones, and their small band much time to recover from
    such miscues. Rouse's idea of a drinking song: ""Givin' It Up"", a
    heavy-handed ballad about going on the wagon-- ""This is a world where
    no one feels sorry for you""-- replete with lovematic Barry White
    strings. Latin-tinged ""His Majesty Rides"", shaking it like Rob
    Thomas's ""Smooth"" without the Santana solos, finds Rouse singing,
    ""Hey, look now/ We move from town to town"". Cool, so does U-Haul.</p></div>"|6844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6844-subtitulo/|3.7|Marc Hogan

To call a record ""catchy"" reveals almost nothing.  Without it there would be very little left of Guided by Voices, Nirvana, or Buzzcocks, but nor would there be any Ace of Base, Steve Miller Band, or Huey Lewis &amp; The News.  Yet, despite endless failures on the behalf of both critics and fans to quantify this ineffable force, ""catchy"" is unquestionably the word with which to begin on <em>Skeleton</em>, the sophomore album from Denmark's Figurines.</p><p>  Glossing over this young quartet's infectiousness would mean lumping them indiscriminately into the ever-growing phalanx of Modest Mouse/Built to Spill acolytes.  Sure, frontman Christian Hjelm uncannily mixes Isaac Brock's nervous vocal tics with Doug Martsch's nasal croon, and yes, they deploy the same octave riffs and slapdash lo-fi production work that served as a staple for any number of indie legends. But Figurines carve their own niche thanks to an arsenal of refreshing, energetic hooks over a straightforward, non-disruptive palette. While debut <em>Shake a Mountain</em> stumbled over gawky guitars and Hjelm's overly twangy vocals, <em>Skeleton</em> delivers gigantic pop hooks in stride, with charm to boot.</p><p>  Misleading opening ballad ""Race You"" encapsulates the band's newfound boldness by copping more from Antony and the Johnsons than from any 90s behemoths.  Here, in spurts of tortured falsetto, Hjelm nods to Neil Young circa <em>After the Gold Rush</em>-- though he and his band quickly prove capable of a broader range than stark emoting and classic rock pilgrimages.  By the following track, the almost unthinkably hooky ""The Wonder"", Hjelm is shouting one embraceable indie maxim after another, resulting in one of the sharpest indie rock songs of the young year so far.  And this, <em>Skeleton</em>'s de facto opener, is where things really begin to heat up: Furious strummed riffs send the song charging ahead anthemically, its guitars emitting fret buzz and pick scrapes like sparks off Claus Salling Johansen's sixteenth-note assault.</p><p>  From there, the record cruises through a series of familiar indie rock signifiers and off-kilter rhythms, but as with that inescapable signifier ""catchy,"" elements that on paper read as tame or familiar instead congeal into something strikingly refreshing and engaging.  Part of <em>Skeleton</em>'s appeal lies in the songwriting's lead-to-gold alchemy; most tracks begin fairly nondescript before unsuspectingly blossoming into glorious pop gems.  ""I Remember"" kicks off with a geeky Kinks riff and Hjelm's self-consciously cool drawl before launching into a howling exclamation-- Johansen's guitar soaring alongside Hjelm's ascending hook.  Likewise, ""Ambush"" nods to one of Hjelm's few admitted influences with its CCR-fried blues verse, but <em>again</em>, hooks trump hulk as the classic rock-sculpted verse melts into a quirky sensitive guy chorus on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p><p>  Unfortunately, Hjelm's hooks only burn so bright for so long, and while several of the album's more adventurous tracks earn points for diversity, some never quite register. ""Back in the Day"" highlights the acoustic guitar nicely, though all the <em>Led Zeppelin III</em> maskings can't hide Hjelm's uninspired delivery, and ""Ghost Towns"" slacks off as a midtempo ballad. Despite these tribulations, ""Release Me on the Floor"" borrows from the tradition of Built to Spill's great closers, an introspective yet jam-worthy number on urban loneliness.</p><p>  Figurines take a risk with an album built mostly on hum-worthiness, but these hookniks show why Denmark is wise to dedicate a portion of their GDP on promoting the band overseas. Former single ""Silver Pond"" updates the typically retrofit dead end of jangly power-pop with contemporary signifiers.  It's a feat the band manages to pull off again and again, track after track, over the course of <em>Skeleton</em>, and the true heart of the record: making the familiar seem fresh and giddy pop seem like indie manna.  Though Figurines won't necessarily be the coolest band you'll hear this year, they may yet become your favorite.</p><p> </p></div>"|3363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3363-skeleton/|8.3|Adam Moerder

Maybe it's because their sound, despite the fullness that comes from so many members, retains its subtlety and subdued complexity with the loose feel of a pick-up band among friends. Or maybe it's because in songs like ""Nashville Parent"" and ""The New Cobweb Summer"", singer/lyricist Kurt Wagner always seems to be wandering his house, thinking deep thoughts about dogs and sponges, and doling wryly homespun wisdom like some brilliantly addled Lewis Grizzard. He finds inspiration in such housebound activities as walking the dog, verbally sparring with the missus, and drinking in the backyard. In a sense, this is the flipside of the typical country concerns of cheatin' spouses and barstool life, playing up not the heartache that haunts most songs, but the mundanity of the day-to-day grind that everyone faces-- as well as the small particulars that make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>On the two volumes of <i>The Decline of Country and Western Civilization</i>-- one from German label City Slang and the other from the band's American label Merge-- Lambchop gather a gaggle of rarities and oddities, tracks from label samplers and early attempts at songs that would later find homes on <i>What Another Man Spills</i>, <i>Nixon</i>, or <i>Is a Woman. </i>Technically, most are the A- and B-sides from six years of seven-inch singles, but they have the feel of songs stacked for years in the garage behind two decades of <i>National Geographic</i>s or lost behind the bedroom bureau, gathering dust with someone's wallet-size school portrait. There is some overlap between the two tracklists (as well as with the 2001 comp<i> </i><i>Tools in the Dryer</i>, which spans 1987-2000); nine songs appear on both discs, counting two different versions of ""Your Life as a Sequel"" and ""Alumni Lawn"" and two different excerpts from the out-there collaboration ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"". For the most part, however, despite these redundancies, the two volumes don't cancel each other out, but rather complement each other nicely.</p>
<p>Not that there's an official retrospective to compare them to, but these compilations form an engaging alternative Lambchop history, telling more about the band's experimentation and evolution, its range and reach, than any ""best of"" ever could. As such, both <i>Decline</i>s sound better even as they play up the band's lucid contradictions. These songs have the feel of a specific Nashville setting, though they sound like nothing else that comes out of that city. Lambchop's music is on country's map, but they take a winding route via 1970s funk and soul, folk, Americana, and late-80s college rock. These compilations run the gamut from rambunctious, lowish-fi numbers like ""Nine"", with its vocalized rhythm guitar lines, and ""Loretta Lung"", to more polished, reedy-- more Lambchoppy-- tracks like ""Playboy, the Shit"" and ""The Gettysburg Address"", which...how the hell has this stayed unreleased for so long? The opposable sore thumbs on both volumes are two excerpts from a longer piece called ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"", which is a collaboration of sorts with Mac McCaughn of Superchunk/Merge Records and Unrest's Mark Robinson. A jumble of mechanized drumbeats, squirrelly trumpet, and nonsense vocals, each section manages to be just grating enough to be funny, then a little bit more grating.</p>
<p>The City Slang version of <i>Decline </i>gets the extra one-fifth point because the Merge version doesn't have ""Soaky in the Pooper"", which is more than just a great title even though it doesn't have to be. Originally appearing on 1994's<i> </i><i>I Hope You're Sitting Down</i>, it's a hazy story-song about a bad trip, progressing from stupor to paranoia to death.

Maybe it's because their sound, despite the fullness that comes from so many members, retains its subtlety and subdued complexity with the loose feel of a pick-up band among friends. Or maybe it's because in songs like ""Nashville Parent"" and ""The New Cobweb Summer"", singer/lyricist Kurt Wagner always seems to be wandering his house, thinking deep thoughts about dogs and sponges, and doling wryly homespun wisdom like some brilliantly addled Lewis Grizzard. He finds inspiration in such housebound activities as walking the dog, verbally sparring with the missus, and drinking in the backyard. In a sense, this is the flipside of the typical country concerns of cheatin' spouses and barstool life, playing up not the heartache that haunts most songs, but the mundanity of the day-to-day grind that everyone faces-- as well as the small particulars that make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>On the two volumes of <i>The Decline of Country and Western Civilization</i>-- one from German label City Slang and the other from the band's American label Merge-- Lambchop gather a gaggle of rarities and oddities, tracks from label samplers and early attempts at songs that would later find homes on <i>What Another Man Spills</i>, <i>Nixon</i>, or <i>Is a Woman. </i>Technically, most are the A- and B-sides from six years of seven-inch singles, but they have the feel of songs stacked for years in the garage behind two decades of <i>National Geographic</i>s or lost behind the bedroom bureau, gathering dust with someone's wallet-size school portrait. There is some overlap between the two tracklists (as well as with the 2001 comp<i> </i><i>Tools in the Dryer</i>, which spans 1987-2000); nine songs appear on both discs, counting two different versions of ""Your Life as a Sequel"" and ""Alumni Lawn"" and two different excerpts from the out-there collaboration ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"". For the most part, however, despite these redundancies, the two volumes don't cancel each other out, but rather complement each other nicely.</p>
<p>Not that there's an official retrospective to compare them to, but these compilations form an engaging alternative Lambchop history, telling more about the band's experimentation and evolution, its range and reach, than any ""best of"" ever could. As such, both <i>Decline</i>s sound better even as they play up the band's lucid contradictions. These songs have the feel of a specific Nashville setting, though they sound like nothing else that comes out of that city. Lambchop's music is on country's map, but they take a winding route via 1970s funk and soul, folk, Americana, and late-80s college rock. These compilations run the gamut from rambunctious, lowish-fi numbers like ""Nine"", with its vocalized rhythm guitar lines, and ""Loretta Lung"", to more polished, reedy-- more Lambchoppy-- tracks like ""Playboy, the Shit"" and ""The Gettysburg Address"", which...how the hell has this stayed unreleased for so long? The opposable sore thumbs on both volumes are two excerpts from a longer piece called ""Two Kittens Don't Make a Puppy"", which is a collaboration of sorts with Mac McCaughn of Superchunk/Merge Records and Unrest's Mark Robinson. A jumble of mechanized drumbeats, squirrelly trumpet, and nonsense vocals, each section manages to be just grating enough to be funny, then a little bit more grating.</p>
<p>The City Slang version of <i>Decline </i>gets the extra one-fifth point because the Merge version doesn't have ""Soaky in the Pooper"", which is more than just a great title even though it doesn't have to be. Originally appearing on 1994's<i> </i><i>I Hope You're Sitting Down</i>, it's a hazy story-song about a bad trip, progressing from stupor to paranoia to death. The song reveals Wagner at his clever best, mixing offbeat imagery with oddball wordplay. No songwriter can milk as much humor from a simple aabb rhyme scheme. ""Suckers and Smuckers, wake up you little fuckers,"" he sings on ""Smuckers"", and it's easy to imagine a grouchy parent muttering to himself as he stumbles through a kid's messy room. He's a poet of the grump: on ""Moody Fucker"" he savors the saucy vulgarity of the title, rolling out that ""fuck"" syllable defiantly, as if he's just been told to watch his mouth in front of the kids.

""Are you guys not listening to the song, or what?"" they ask; they also request a circle pit <i>right afterward</i>!</p>

Euskara (Basque) in Spain, Romansch in Switzerland, Flemish in Belgium, Friulian in Italy, Breton in France, Yiddish in pockets of Central Europe, and Cornish and Welsh in the UK are among the most popular regional tongues. In a world where just a few languages dominate the global media (and let's face it, English dominates more than any other), speaking one of these languages practically requires bilingualism, and there is legitimate fear that some of them could die in the coming century.</p><p> As much as I like the idea of easy intercommunication, that thought saddens me, because though we can translate from one language to another, the meaning of certain phrases, puns, and proverbs is unique and untransferable-- check the way we slip into French every time we talk about that unsettling feeling that something has happened before. That's why I like to see Euros Childs including a couple of Welsh songs on an otherwise English album-- it's a reminder that communication is a diverse thing, and honestly, it sounds like he's more at home or at least having more fun singing in Welsh.</p><p> Welsh is pretty well-represented as far as minority languages are concerned in popular music, as Super Furry Animals have sold Welsh-language albums to international audiences, and the Welsh-language rock scene has produced a couple of genuine icons, particularly Meic Stevens, who only conceded to English on a single record. Childs has plenty of experience switching between Welsh and English as well-- his band Gorky's Zygotic Mynci did it all the time, even in its band name. (""mynci"" being Welsh for ""monkey""). One of my favorites from that band was <em>The Blue Trees</em> EP's ""Sbia Ar Y Saren"".</p><p> The two substantial Welsh songs on this album (""Cynhaeaf"" is just a snippet) are among the best. ""Downsio Dros Y Mor"" is the finest of them all, moving from its solo acoustic intro into an exuberant harmonized verse supported by basic drumming. The chorus has a catchy, tumbling melody that makes wonderful use of Childs' reedy pipes, adding a dash of Farfisa for extra sunshine. ""Hi Mewn Socsau"" is old-school rock'n'roll, with pounding piano and a little fuzz bass supporting the ooh-aah backing vocal and Childs' lead vocal coming across a little like ELO's Jeff Lynne.</p><p>  Of the English-language tracks, ""Circus Time"" is beautiful British folk with  a marvelous, keening fiddle part playing counterpoint to Childs, while  ""Costa Rita"" slathers a pastoral backing track with gooey, rich harmonies  for a perfect end-of-the-season vibe. While a couple other songs have their  moments, none really live up to that level, especially ""Donkey Island"",  which pushes its melody into awkward corners to accommodate the completely  forgettable lyric. The album's overall flow and structure is decidedly  disjointed, with a scattering of tiny, demo-quality tracks adding virtually  nothing to the record. The eight-minute ""First Time I Saw You"" could be a  nice, slowly simmering folk jam, but it's hampered for minutes at a time by  a nagging synth loop that buzzes like a prolonged fart at the very top of  the mix.</p><p>  For a first  solo record, <em>Chops</em> sounds frustratingly unfocused, coming across more like a vault-clearing exercise than a  true statement. Multiple demo snippets and half-songs offer little more  than padding to get things fleshed up to 33 minutes (I'd love to hear the  faux-country song ""My Country Girl"" fully arranged, for instance), and it  all sails by in a flash, leaving just a handful of lasting impressions.</p></div>"|8974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8974-chops/|5.9|Joe Tangari
