<p>The eight digital bonus tracks split between the <i>Only Life</i> and <i>Time For A Witness</i> reissues are all from the band's third and most recent period, live and acoustic versions of songs from the two 1988 and 1991 albums plus a few covers recorded since their 2008 reunion. And while the new studio renderings of <i>Only Life'</i>s wisdom-dispensing title track and 1991's ""Find A Way"" are fairly exquisite, and the live tracks are good fun, the absence of contemporary supplementary material is a little bit of a bummer.

That he was embittered and frustrated at the start of Margaret Thatcher’s reign is obvious and in a recent <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2016/01/23/this-heat-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, he spoke of his disenchantment of playing in a band at that time: ""I’m singing to the people who get lulled into thinking, ‘Oh, don’t worry about air pollution. They’ll invent a new way to breathe.’"" </p>
<p>This Heat broke up soon after that. But before Bullen threw himself into pursuits outside of punk (activism and education on the politics of health and agriculture), he self-released a solo album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33530-lifetones/"">Lifetones</a>. Written and recorded during the bleakest of times for an activist such as himself, after Thatcher’s landslide re-election in 1983,<i> For a Reason</i> remains a strange amalgam of post-punk’s desolation set to dub reggae’s sunny lilt. It’s also been impossible to hear since the reign of the ""Iron Lady,"" left off of numerous rounds of This Heat reissues over the ensuing decades. There have even been two reissues of bandmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15161-gareth-williams/"">Gareth Williams</a>’s equally rare Flaming Tunes record in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Lifetones’s lone album is part of Light in the Attic’s recent This Heat reissue campaign. And while it’s not nearly as vital or serrated as that band’s output, there’s something enchanting about <i>For a Reason</i>. While 1983 was the year that another British punk band that absorbed and wore its reggae influences on their sleeves were releasing their biggest album in <i>Synchronicity</i>, Bullen’s take on Jamaican dub feels gloomy, sullen, deeply personal.</p>
<p>While anger was often the default of punk and post-punk vocalists alike, and one can feel the feral howls of Charles Heyward on a This Heat track like ""Paper Hats,"" Bullen’s voice is disarming and dry in comparison. It doesn’t arise too often on the album, but when it does, its artlessness gets multi-tracked into a mass chant that at times reminds me of old British folk singers, delivering their message flat and without affect. Tinny keyboards and distant dub drums open ""For a Reason"" and Bullen imparts a sense of purpose with the echoing incant of ""Do everything for a reason."" Against that skitter of snares and needling guitar, he repeats phrases like ""Love the life you live/ live the life you love"" and ""You have to work so hard"" until they act as a mantra.</p>
<p>Too often, the album meanders through instrumentals, not quite getting into a deep groove. Dub effects swaddle an instrumental like ""Decide,"" its one-chord guitar riff turned into effervescence against the echoing drums while ""Distance No Object"" adds a trill of melodica and chintzy keys to the mix. But unlike most reggae, the beats here are lo-fi, oddly stiff and British. The album’s most interesting track is  ""Travelling"" which forgoes Jamaican tropes entirely and instead roves into Bedouin territory. Full of snaking violins, woodwinds in an Eastern mode, it’s only in the last minute of this mesmerizing track that Bullen sings in his stuffed nose drone: ""In the past I was that way/ now I’m this way/ No one is to blame."" He sounds like an old punk opening his worldview and finding another reason to continue to fight the system.</p>

His albums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15041-bible-eyes/""><i>Bible Eyes</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18768-egyptrixx-ab-til-infinity/""><i>A/B Til Infinity</i></a> took techno rhythms, gleaming synth melodies, and noxious ambient atmospheres and spun them into exciting new variants. His new project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33508-ceramic-tl/"">Ceramic TL</a> represents a break with Egyptrixx's style: The beats are gone and the melodies have run dry; with an emphasis on buzzing drones and detuned bell tones, it's <i>all </i>atmosphere, and it is more noxious than ever, heady as huffing aerosol.</p>
<p><i>Sign of the Cross Every Mile to the Border </i>is pitched as ""seven meditations on optimism and faith through the prism of environmental cataclysm."" It's a theme that might bring to mind his former labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"">Jam City</a>'s recent album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20295-dream-a-garden/""><i>Dream a Garden</i></a>, which was <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/17459-jam-city-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described by its creator</a> as an attempt to locate  beauty and healing in the fight against oppression. But the music couldn't be further away from Jam City's dreamy mood board, with its gauzy echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti Politti</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> and vintage 4AD. Psutka's '80s borrowings are limited to the suffocating cacophony of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/454-glenn-branca/"">Glenn Branca</a>'s guitar symphonies and the persistent swoosh of digital phaser effects. His <a href=""http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2013/04/egyptrixx-black-metal-feature"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fondness for black metal</a> is evident in the charred rumbling of a track like ""Life on Earth,"" in which ringing bells melt together into an unbroken din and a low hum crackles like a burning bass amp. At the track's close, a car revs in the distance and the sound of wind and fire whips across the landscape, bringing the album's environmental themes to the fore.</p>
<p>The opening track, a burnished bell-tone whine, is remarkably similar to the stopped-watch loops of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/559-thomas-brinkmann/"">Thomas Brinkmann</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20553-what-you-hear-is-what-you-hear/""><i>What You Hear (Is What You Hear) </i></a>and it scans as pure texture. The entire album, in fact, is almost entirely devoid of conventional musical or rhythmic events, preferring the static repetition of granular loops stretched to infinity. Ceramic TL—does that ""TL"" stand for ""timeline""?—seems to be a project about taking a time-based medium and squeezing the life out of it, stopping it dead in its tracks and flattening it beyond recognition: music as roadkill, as flatline.</p>
<p>Where the music is austere, the track titles are positively Byzantine. ""I Attached To and Pored Over Photos of Places I Loved That Were Reduced to Ash"" is one; ""I Often Wondered How the Group Would React When Eco-Apocalypse Finally Struck"" is another. Some sound like they might be clippings from YA novels (""This Looks Just Like It, the Answer to My Prayers - I Thought My Life Was Over Until Two Years Later I Arrived""), but it's also possible to imagine them, not uncharitably, as <a href=""https://twitter.com/evilbmcats"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Metal Cats</a> captions. Of course, black metal itself is no stranger to florid iconography, and the deep purple of Psutka's prose, as faintly ridiculous as it may be, has the effect of doubling down on his theme, practically daring you not to meet the album on its own ambitious terms.</p>
<div><span>The final track, called simply ""Clearing,"" is a welcome breath of fresh air after the labyrinthine path that has led up to it. Amid a fluttering of birdsong, an automobile's open-door chime beeps, the door slams, and a metallic chop of rotors, indicating sudden liftoff, flashes back to the zap and chug of Egyptrixx. Whether or not it suggests a return in the future to his more club-oriented work, who knows. But it makes a fitting finish for Ceramic TL's claustrophobic audio play, in which sound itself is dramatized as a life-or-death struggle for oxygen. And, at long last, Psutka's bet on ""optimism and faith"" pays off.</span></div></div>"|21606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21606-sign-of-the-cross-every-mile-to-the-border/|7.0|Philip Sherburne

Though still best known for shouting ""lager, lager, lager"" in their epochal 1996 hit ""Born Slippy.NUXX,"" the long-running dance duo, consisting of singer-lyricist-multi-instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31209-karl-hyde/"">Karl Hyde</a> and producer Rick Smith, have quietly but persistently placed matters of the heart at the center of their best songs. Their breakthrough single ""Cowgirl"" pledged ""I wanna give you everything,"" robotically chanting the final word like a mantra for emphasis. ""Jumbo,"" the buoyant highlight of 1999’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8349-beaucoup-fish/""><i>Beaucoup Fish</i></a>, took a (literally) sweeter approach, with singer Karl Hyde purring ""I need sugar"" when ""I get thoughts about you."" And despite the involvement of a series of guest producers whose work never quite gelled, UW’s last studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14655-barking/""><i>Barking</i></a> was held together by a chain of out-and-out love songs, from its singles ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11902-scribble/"">Scribble</a>"" to its tremulous closing ballad ""Louisiana"" (""When you touch me, planets in sweet collision""). Regardless of their reputation for turning late-night urban-hedonism anthems into festival-filling crowdpleasers, Underworld remain romantics at heart. </p>

All told, <i>Barbara</i> is their first proper album in over half a decade.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Opening track and lead single ""I Exhale,"" then, establishes the pair's reunion as a party-in-progress. The two-note synth-bass riff and stomping glitter-rock rhythm provide Hyde with a solid foundation for a madcap spoken-word romp whose introductory lines—""Life / It’s a touch / Everything is golden / Open""—set a tone as upbeat as the album’s utopian title. The second song, ""If Rah,"" features Hyde's absurd proclamation that ""the origin of numbers is a questionable hypothesis."" Not many acts could recover from an opening gambit that ridiculous, but Smith (working here as throughout the record with co-producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23785-high-contrast/"">High Contrast</a>) constructs a groove relentless enough to contextualize that <i>non sequitur</i> as just another outburst from a fellow reveler, dimly heard over the din of the speakers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The celebratory vibe takes a somber but sensual turn with ""Low Burn."" A pulsing throwback to the soundscapes of early albums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19906-underworld-dubnobasswithmyheadman-20th-anniversary-remaster/""><i>dubnobasswithmyheadman</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21265-second-toughest-in-the-infants/""><i>Second Toughest in the Infants</i></a>, its lyrics are a cyclic incantation—""time / first time / blush / be bold / be beautiful / free""—that call to mind landmark moments of initial liberation, whether on the dancefloor or in the bedroom. The song makes a strong enough impression that the pair of comparatively slight downtempo tracks that follow it, the acoustic guitar interlude ""Santiago Cuatro"" and ""Motorhome"" (a gentle plea to ""keep away from the dark side"" marked by a ""Baba O’Riley""esque synthesized highland reel in the background) can be forgiven as a necessary comedown. </p>
<p class=""p1"">They also provide a breather before closing tracks ""Ova Nova"" and ""Nylon Strung,"" the strongest one-two punch in the band’s catalog since ""Dirty Epic"" faded into ""Cowgirl"" on <i>dubnobasswithmyheadman </i>22 years ago. Strikingly, ""Ova Nova"" is the first time on <i>Barbara</i> that Hyde sings more than a single sentence at a time, and beautifully at that. Smith gives his high lilting tenor a digital shimmer, making the refrain of ""change your mind"" sound less about decision-making than actual transformation. But the emergence of bonafide back-up vocals—provided by Esme Smith and Tyler Hyde, the duo’s daughters—set ""Ova"" off not just from the blunt singing of the rest of the album, but from the band’s entire oeuvre. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Fittingly for an album that looks to the future in its very title, <i>Barbara</i> saves the best for last. The rhapsodic ""Nylon Strung"" starts with a hint of urban decay, with Hyde’s voice echoing ""Sliding between the dust of a scorched earth."" But the sadness doesn’t last in the face of what’s to come. The voices of Karl and Tyler Hyde and Esme Smith weave around the lines ""Open me up / I want to hold you, laughing,"" over and over and over, with Smith’s classical soprano soaring high above. The repetition, long the most frequently employed tool in Underworld’s lyrical arsenal, is powerfully moving: Each iteration of the line brings you closer to the absolute vulnerability inherent in loving another person, whether a parent or a partner, a lover or a daughter or a son. The effect is stunning, the kind of music that makes you sob happysad tears in your car in the Sunday afternoon sunlight as you think about the people you wish were riding with you. Underworld’s never had trouble getting listeners to their feet. This gorgeously love-drunk finale makes <i>Barbara</i> a record that can bring them to their knees.</p></div>"|21509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21509-barbara-barbara-we-face-a-shining-future/|8.1|Sean T.

Instead, they reconfigure their core elements — Chip King’s self-waged war between his shrieks and thick sheets of riff-noise, Lee Buford’s man-machine hammer, frequent collaborator Chrissy Wolpert’s vocals and chorus arrangements —and conscript them into their widening vision of the spot where metal intersects with other dark genres.  The result is less sprawling than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/""><i>All The Waters of Earth Turn to Blood</i></a> and scarier for its concision. </p>
<p>Wolpert’s contributions over the years makes her almost a third member, and on <i>Happines</i>s she fights against the usual notion of women metal vocalists as pretty voices in the background or magnets for male gaze by becoming the confrontational center. The Body have often lashed out at the world through envisioning its end, and Wolpert turns that anxiety inward, proving that, yes, they <i>can</i> get more uncomfortable. The songs in which she has the heaviest hand are <i>Happiness</i>’ most powerful. Her chants of ""go it alone"" throughout leadoff track ""Wanderings"" feel like a visceral reminder of unremitting horror, and her chamber-pop instincts take on an alien tinge next to King’s shrill wail. She can also play off herself, as she does by combining a more brooding croon with brief soaring highs in ""The Fall and The Guilt,"" the album’s most devastating track. </p>
<p>""Adamah"" sees guest vocalist <span>Maralie Armstrong</span> channelling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a> over Buford’s clipping thuds, not too far off from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32640-rabit/"">Rabit</a>’s bullets-as-percussion approach.  Combined with King’s clipped rhythm, which recalls <i>Blood</i>’s ""A Curse,"" it's the closest to pop that The Body have ever come. This isn’t a huge leap for them: They’ve covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3135-sinead-oconnor/"">Sinéad O’Connor</a>’s ""Black Boys in Mopeds,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>' ""Terrible Lie,"" (with Thou) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a>’s ""The Chain"" (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLtiLqPApco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">also with Thou</a>); never before has it seeped into their composition like this.</p>
<p>Pop and metal have more in common than diehards of both would prefer to admit, and one is both rely heavily on structure and tight performance. The Body aren’t improvisatory live, but they don’t play it straight like most metal bands do either, putting it all into an endurance test that’s made them both the heaviest live metal act and guaranteed death for punk houses’ electrical systems. King leans on noise on <i>Happiness</i> more than ever before, from subtle squeals in ""Shelter is Illusory"" and the undercurrent of ""Hallow / Hollow"" to the complete absence of chord structure in ""For You"" and ""Guilt."" When ""The Myth Arc,"" the final song, kicks in, King blurs the line between doom metal and total noise abstraction. Buford is also a freer player than before, incorporating the punch of harsh techno beats but without an interest in keeping listeners in line with a steady, comfortable tempo. In a way, The Body has always been obsessed with feelings of consuming futility, and in kicking free of conventional structures and following Wolpert's lead, they've come closer than ever to their truest selves on record. </p>

If a conventional approach is failing, then there's no downside to trying something different and getting weirder. On previous projects, 21-year-old Detroit rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33574-zelooperz/"">ZelooperZ</a> showed hints of an outsider waiting to break out, but 2011's <i><a href=""https://zelooperz.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coon N the Room</a></i> is a teenager's failed concept album, and 2014's <i><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/help/id891401174"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Help</a></i> stood out only for its stilted verses (especially considering mentor and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30720-bruiser-brigade/"">Bruiser Brigade</a> leader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a> appears twice and excels). But on his latest album <i>Bothic</i>, ZelooperZ is now both more refined and eccentric than ever. It's nearly impossible to identify a single conventionally rapped verse on the album, which somehow works to its advantage. For the most part, <i>Bothic</i> lacks straightforward melody and ZelooperZ's delivery borders on grating, yet the result is still occasionally enthralling.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>ZelooperZ opens the album with his best </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/""><span>Lil B</span></a><span> impression on ""Summit"" over a beat reminiscent of </span><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>. It's truly </span><span>an inauspicious start to the project; ZelooperZ is not as observational as Lil B, nor does he give off any semblance of stream-of-consciousness rapping, which makes the track simply sound the work of a bad rapper–someone who tries and fails to rhyme or flow. From there, however, </span><i>Bothic </i>picks up.<span> ""Bothic Bout It"" is a banger despite (or perhaps due to) a complete lack of comprehensible lyrics. The consistent repetition of ""bothic"" (a portmanteau for ""</span><a href=""http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/danny-browns-outsider-rap-protege-zelooperz/Content?oid=2396696"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>bruiser gothic</span></a><span>"" that ZelooperZ coined) suggests that we don't need much more than heavy bass, rhythm, and a couple of well-chosen words or sounds for a song to communicate intensity. ZelooperZ has a rudimentary flow, but the momentary offbeat bits of flair that show he has a feel for the grace notes outside traditional structure. ""Bothic, rockin' </span><i>Rick</i><span> Owens in Hot Topic / Popped a pack for 175, blew a bag, then I made some profit"" is intentionally askew and is easily one of the most memorable lines on the record, not only for its humor, but also for how ZelooperZ withholds certain sounds, creating small bursts of energy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At times, it sounds like ZelooperZ is ignoring the production around him, like on ""Scale,"" where he moans over jaunty piano. Still, it works, its haphazard parts colliding together to form a mess, but a compelling one. </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30729-ratking/"">Ratking</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33373-wiki/"">Wiki</a> shows up on ""Heart"" for the <i>Bothic</i>'s only guest appearance; he clearly outshines ZelooperZ lyrically, but while his quick ""where I'm from"" narrative is welcome, it's somehow not as notable ZelooperZ's frenzied shrieks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Bothic</i><span> requires a fair amount of immersion to enjoy. With the exception of ""Bothic Bout It,"" ""Heart,"" and ""ISBD,"" most tracks would probably be skipped immediately if heard out of context. ""Ocean,"" for instance, is a relaxing comedown, but ZelooperZ's delivery of ""ocean"" as ""oshaaah"" doesn't work without hearing him go through warped exercises on ""Scale"" and ""Automatic."" As a whole, <i>Bothic</i> seems intended to be heard as the work of a next-level auteur, but there are </span><span>still too many moments that beg the question whether it's successful or just plain strange. </span><span>ZelooperZ is not a finished product as an artist, but if </span><i>Bothic</i><span> is any indication, he's willing to push boundaries and could potentially create a style all his own.</span></p></div>"|21713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21713-bothic/|6.3|Matthew Strauss

A few years into their career, the group’s already busted into the top tier of the Boston house show scene—a considerable accomplishment for any young rock band, considering the scene’s predilections towards snoozy folk and hostile hardcore. But while Horse Jumper of Love's live performances recall the low, slow burn of bands like Silver Jews and Arab Strap, their Bandcamp output hinges on one man: lyricist and frontman <span id=""docs-internal-guid-5d7ffc1c-769b-a515-3660-f877734db312""><span>Dimitri</span></span> Giannopoulos, whose combination of wan croons, melancholic strumming, and ramshackle production place the group’s erstwhile recordings in Microphones territory. <span style=""line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Like their local, recently-disbanded contemporaries Krill, Horse Jumper of Love seek to balance the intimate with the acerbic. Now, with the arrival of their full-length debut, the time has come for those two spheres to merge. Drummer Jamie Vadala-Doran and bassist John Margaris plod at a tortoise-like pace, dragging their leader’s acoustic arrangements out of the bedroom and into the open. These songs’ momentum may be minimal—Carissa’s Weird look like the Casualties by comparison—but their warmth proves deceptively hypnotic, making the deviations more attention-grabbing. On “Ugly Brunette,”the trio draw the listener into a lull by way of syrupy, straggling chords only to repeatedly trip up the beat, the whammy-wailing hook swaying like a drunkard. The leisurely arpeggios on “Spaceman,” meanwhile, spiral gently into the void until they’re swallowed up by a fuzzed-out roar. There's suspense in the slump.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Where Giannopoulos the musician seeks to pit sheltered songs against haggard arrangements, Giannopoulos the lyricist is up against the universe at large. He’s openly admitted in an interview with the <i><a href=""http://allstonpudding.com/love-much-forever-conversation-horse-jumper-love/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allston Pudding</a></i> that as a teenager, he thought “nothing was real,” angst worsened by the cultural and linguistic divides inherent in his Greek-American upbringing. Rather than tell meandering stories à la Slint, Giannopoulos repeatedly shifts his focus to hyper-specific (if awkwardly-worded) motifs: “America towels,” “July 5th,” and “i love you very much forever,” the latter two of which title transitional lo-fi interludes. He’s a natural at creating sensual, oddball imagery (""Peel an apple with your nails/and there is dirt and there is juice,” “I talk with your teeth,”) but his descriptions feel distant and needlessly vague.<span style=""line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">For a full length record, <i>Horse Jumper of Love </i>is actually pretty scant. Three of the eight songs comprising its less-than-thirty-minute runtime are inconsequential ambient pieces that serve little purpose aside from creating the illusion of momentum and progress down in the doldrums.(Their inclusion feels inevitable, given Giannopoulos’ prior dabblings with electronics in the band’s early material and with his solo project the Meat Tree.) The penultimate track, “Sun Poisoning,” proves downright unlistenable; Vadala-Doran, a serviceable percussionist on the rest of the album, suddenly fumbles around like a novice, struggling to keep in step with his bandmates’ funereal pace. The result is a meek introduction to a modest band that feels simultaneously overdue and undercooked.</p></div>"|21630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21630-horse-jumper-of-love/|5.9|Zoe Camp

That call to mindfulness, inspired by Cooper's own meditation practice, is spelled out by the one-word titles of the album's 12 cuts, which spin acoustic instruments, electric kit, and synthesizers and electronic effects into a,shifting whole that's part chamber music, part post-rock, and part musique concrète.</p>
<p>For a record that advocates stillness, <i>The Sentence </i>covers a lot of ground. It collages together many years' worth of work, from high-school home recordings to work with the Vermont Contemporary Music Ensemble to assorted rehearsal tapes and—well, who knows what, really. As you might guess from songs titled things like ""This,"" ""To,"" and ""In,"" the individual tracks on <i>The Sentence</i> function less as standalone songs than as parts of an indivisible whole, and it's well-nigh impossible to tease out which bits date to which moments. As a scrapbook, the album's timeline will be legible only to Cooper, although that's presumably partly the point of the whole exercise: to explore the way musical moments repeat, echo, and evolve across the course of a life, piling up on tape in an image of eternal now-ness.</p>
<p>The music's tone is largely hushed, with lots of breathy wind instruments and muted electric and acoustic guitar; there are five percussionists credited on the album, but their contributions tend to emphasize scrapes and thumps and the faraway thunder of reverberant tympani—sounds used more for color than timekeeping. Compositionally, Cooper tends to tease soft melodic phrases out of dissonant, abstract passages, like drawing smooth a tangle of thread in fits and starts. Occasionally, a startlingly beautiful vista opens up: The pensive guitar and horns of ""To"" sound a little like Tortoise at their most sentimental. But Cooper doesn't dwell on any one idea for very long. That lyric centerpiece is followed by a shout (""<span id=""docs-internal-guid-8bb3f6c9-7707-2b17-38e2-b31f92fb6196""><span>Yo, play the jam! We’re gonna jam, dude!</span></span>"") and a two-minute run of vibraphone, cymbal, and electronics that suggests a druggy, paranoid Raymond Scott.</p>
<p>When <i>The Sentence </i>works best, it's led forward by a combination of smart pacing and surprising ideas. But the record has trouble building and keeping momentum. ""Stillness,"" just 3:18 long, encompasses three distinct parts separated by garbed electronics and random clatter: a watery orchestral passage, a folky meditation for acoustic guitar and monophonic synth, and solo acoustic guitar bit that sounds like it was recorded on a Dictaphone. All offer nice sounds and worthy musical ideas, but lead nowhere. Too often the album seems to lack an organizing principle, a structure to make all its discrete moments make sense, and the back half of the 32-minute album drags. It's hard to maintain much investment in a record that simply rolls on of its own accord, like a stream, oblivious to the presence of the listener. </p></div>"|21616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21616-the-sentence/|6.0|Philip Sherburne

Many rock bands swear allegiance to Lizzy-inspired, booze-fueled riff rock, but Sheer Mag make the formula sound uniquely vital, which makes them uncommon amongst most rock bands in 2016. Their music stuffs hip-shaking hooks and burly riffs within impeccably structured pop songs, wrapped in lyrics both open-hearted and openly political. They're the Jackson 5 raised to play punk rock, with an F-5 tornado for a singer.</p>
<p>Earlier this month they released <i>III</i>, their third EP in the last three years. It upholds the band's gold standard as they continue to refine their formula: kick drums like rifle shots, earworm guitar riffs played with electric glee, no-frills solos no less punk rock for their existence. Halladay still sounds like she's coming through a crackling speaker, as does the rest of the band, but her soulful, gale-force voice is more legible than ever. It's thirteen-and-a-half minutes of pure pleasure.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>III </i><span>is evenly split between love songs and political songs. ""Can't Stop Fighting"" addresses the chronic violence against women in Ciudad Juarez and in the world at large, with Halladay howling for collective action. ""Night Isn't Bright"" accomplishes the astonishing task of delivering lines like ""It's plain to see these days that there's an agitation / We live and we die by a politics of simplification"" without coming off as joyless. Sheer Mag will trick you into dancing while singing about overthrowing the system. You will have </span><i>fun </i><span>as you debate whether voting for Bernie over Hillary represents true change, or just a rearranging of the Titanic deck chairs. The songs are imbued with the tangible, bleeding passion that often accompanies political awareness, lest you think wokeness to be the sole province of the dour. They remind me of the MC5, another working-class garage band who used swaggering rock as a vehicle for righteousness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The love songs find Halladay sounding more vulnerable than usual. She sings about men who've wronged her through their apathy, despite her fearlessness in seeking clarity. ""At least I tried,"" she sings on ""Worth the Tears,"" ""and the time we had was worth the tears that you made me cry."" T</span><span>he highlight might be ""Nobody's Baby,"" which is built around a clipped riff and a refrain both defiant and depressed. ""I'm nobody's baby, I'm nobody's girl,"" she sings, with the resignation of someone attempting to stay strong despite the pain they feel. The fearlessness of Sheer Mag's politics makes them stick out, but they're also unafraid to get bruised—a contrast of tough and tender that makes their music all the more potent.  </span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d4c72339-6113-fb14-507a-e76d3cabea0a""><span>It bears mentioning that Sheer Mag are strident anti-capitalists. </span><i>III </i><span>was released with no head's up and no PR, all for the price of a latte. (You can stream the EP in its entirety without paying a dime.) The lyrics are printed on their Bandcamp, lest anyone mistake their pointed intentions. They've reportedly turned down offers from plenty of labels. Their upcoming Coachella set seems hilariously out-of-place, though one imagines them concluding a furious set by burning their cash fee on stage ala the KLF. The string of EPs would naturally point toward an upcoming LP, though we can't be sure. For now, they're more than welcome in these limited bursts. They're totally locked into the sound, for all it'll give them. Pour another drink and turn it up. </span></span></p></div>"|21731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21731-iii-ep/|8.3|Jeremy Gordon

It was a surprising connection to many, but becomes perhaps less so when you realize that <i>The Last Panthers </i>show is produced by <a href=""http://warpfilms.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Films</a>, a burgeoning offshoot of the venerated electronic label. As they did with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17492-berberian-sound-studio-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/"">Broadcast for the studio’s indie horror film Berberian Sound Studio</a>, Warp have decided to release Clark's work as a standalone effort. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s worth noting that Clark and Warp have chosen to present <i>The Last Panther</i>s as another chapter in Clark’s discography rather than as an ""Original Soundtrack"" or a ""Music From..."" Clark's catalog is deep and well-respected, and <i>The Last Panthers</i> is kind of a curious entry. It presents itself with two separate tests to pass: 1) Is it an effective soundtrack to a show? 2) Does it stand up on its own, without visual context?  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To the first question, the answer is a resounding yes (U.S. viewers will get the chance to judge for themselves later this year, when the show is released Stateside). The dark, rain-soaked impressionism of the cinematography, coupled with the quiet, low-key dialogue, spoken in a variety of languages, creates a cold, gray and glassy world which the viewer feels they can observe at a distance but never penetrate. Clark’s work plays as much of a role in shaping this world as the visuals, making his cues not just appropriate but intrinsic to the show.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Answering the second question, how well <i>The Last Panthers</i> stands on its own, is a bit trickier. Clark has always been a stylistically varied artist, working in a range of tempos and textures, but<i> The Last Panthers</i> is most notable for the total absence of  the faster, louder numbers, or the incredible low-end beats for which he is known, like 2003’s ""Early Moss"" or ""Banjo"" from 2014's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19905-clark-clark/"">Clark</a>.</i>  He’s basically constructed an entire record of miniatures like ""Ship is Flooding"" and ""Strength Through Fragility"" (both also from <i>Clark</i>), or ""Pleen 1930s"" (the first track from his very first record in 2001)--tracks that typically ran short on his records and often felt more like interludes than compositions. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Coincidentally or not, many pieces feel reminiscent of the spindly instrumentals populating the back halves of Bowie's <i>Heroes</i> and <i>Low</i>. ""Panther Bass Plock"" and ""Chloroform Sauna"" practically channel ""<span id=""docs-internal-guid-11b9ebd9-67bb-be2c-8021-041103655705""><span>Neuköln""</span></span> from <i>Heroes</i> at the altar, particularly the low-end sea burbles underneath the rising synths.  Tim Hecker is evoked throughout, especially with the gently ebbing waves of ""Upward Evaporation,"" while ""Serbian Daffodil""’s warbling reverb-heavy synths recall Boards of Canada interludes and ""Omni Vignette"" is Erik Satie by way of <i>Drukqs</i>-era Aphex’s plaintive sustained piano. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But ""sounds likes…"" aside, what is most impressive about<i> The Last Panthers</i> is the way in which Clark has taken all of this incidental music and shaped it into a flowing 48-minute suite that conjures almost as much of an imagined visual story as <i>The Last Panthers</i> show itself. Due to the subdued nature of the proceedings along with short track times and a smattering of dreamily repeated theme refrains throughout, the listening experience doesn’t lend itself to tracks standing out on their own. Exceptions, however, are the awesomely titled ""Strangled to Death in a Public Toilet,"" with its beautiful dead-angel chorus reminiscent of Gavin Bryar’s ""The Sinking of the Titanic""; ""Diamonds Aren’t Forever"" and it's follow-up ""II,"" which both break down midway through fogs of noisy synth to reveal plaintive repeated piano and violin; and album closer ""Hide On the Treads 3"", whose ascending and pumping glockenspiel arpeggios provide the closest thing to sunshine on this otherwise completely gray sound collage. It's been suggested before that Clark is writing the soundtrack to the end of the world; if so, <i>The Last Panthers</i> feels like the lonely soundtrack for whatever's left after that. </p></div>"|21668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21668-the-last-panthers/|7.1|Benjamin Scheim

On <i>Trotro</i>, DJ Katapila pays homage to Accra, and on its title track, he tips his hat to its infamous minibus system. From the song's outset, a cartoonish voice exclaims, ""Makola, UTC, Kaneshie!"", imitating the mates (drivers' assistants) who lean out the side of the trotros calling out their destinations. That same kind of humor and depiction of daily life runs through much of DJ Katapila's music, which is a mix of neo/traditional Ga dance music, and old-school house and techno.</p>
<p>DJ Katapila, aka Ishmael Abbey, grew up in the '70s in the coastal district of Jamestown in Accra, <a href=""http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Ga.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a historically Ga area</a>. The now-40-something became known for his marathon DJ sets, to the point where his tirelessness earned him the nickname ""Katapila,"" after Caterpillar construction equipment. Yet it wasn't until several years ago that he started actually producing, and in 2009, he self-released his debut album, <i>Trotro</i>. Since then, a number of his tracks have circulated on bootleg tapes, which is also how Awesome Tapes From Africa found his music and ended up partnering with him to issue this rerelease.</p>
<p>The album was never actually pressed to cassette, yet it still sounds as if it were playing back through a thin layer of dust. This rawness comes in part from Katapila's own production, in part from the spirit of early Chicago house and Detroit techno, and in part from Ga music. The album is grounded as much by the four-on-the-floor thump of Chicago house as it is by the programmed son clave patterns that are common to so many genres of music across the Black Atlantic, including <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YEPyGO0ZPM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kpanlogo</a>. Kpanlogo is a type of neotraditional Ga dance music that combines older sounds like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWYV405rDjc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gome</a> drumming and street processional music with elements of highlife and '60s-era rock (ie the Twist). It also happens to be a precursor to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTUIlOudlHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">azonto</a>, whose inflections can be heard throughout <i>Trotro</i>. For instance, on ""Sakawa,"" the rhythm comes through in the snare, on ""Trotro"" through the handclaps, and on ""Cocoawra"" and ""Lalokat,"" very clearly in the cowbell.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #232323;"">Besides house and azonto though, DJ Katapila also often references other kinds of contemporary, black club music, while still</span><span> </span><span>largely</span><span> </span><span style=""color: #232323;"">staying</span><span> </span><span style=""color: #232323;"">within the sphere of Accra life. </span><span>""Nkran Dokunu"" refers to </span><span>Accra kenkey, a corn-based staple food of Ghana. The track bounces along at around 140 BPM and feels almost like a slower, crunchier shangaan electro. <span>Midway through it, as a toy Casio-like figure plinks along over a galloping snare, two cartoon-voiced characters chant in Ga, “Accra kenkey is delicious! We’re eating it!”</span></span></p>
<p><span>By contrast, ""Ice-Inc"" is a lot darker in mood. It's a direct line to old-school Detroit techno, complete with 808-sounding electrofunk cowbell, and the time-warped, intergalactic quality of a Kraftwerk song. It may not scream ""Accra""<span>like</span> some of the other songs on the album. But as a part of <i>Trotro</i> as a whole, it speaks to the multitude of musical and cultural influences that have been exported and imported to the <span>city</span> over time. That, and the propensity to approach the otherwise unremarkable with a remarkable sense of humor.</span></p></div>"|21711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21711-trotro/|7.7|Minna Zhou

The last word’s howl hovers uncertainly between complaint and celebration, but, musically, ""Gimmick"" is a statement of pure vocal power. Fake Boyfriend pits that power against ""the preconceived notions of how women are supposed to behave and process emotions,"" as band member Abi Reimold, who just put out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21522-wriggling/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">her own acclaimed solo LP</a>,<a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1861385/stream-fake-boyfriend-mercy-ep-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> recently told Stereogum</a>. If the songs ""are about giving into your feelings,"" then ""Gimmick"" gives into and lets out its rage over the inevitable equation that Fake Boyfriend is a girl band and being a ""girl band"" equals being a gimmick. By yawping their self-identification with the label, Fake Boyfriend reclaims the ""girl band"" moniker but still acknowledges the commoditizing function it otherwise performs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their debut EP <i>Mercy</i> merges post-punk with the poppier indie-rock stylings associated with acts like Waxatachee and Girlpool, full of thrashing guitar blasts and churning bass. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-1674e650-676c-ea2a-57b1-a0bdf4435ac4"">""Expire"" has the fiercest snarl on the EP, but ""Ship"" best exemplifies the soft/hard, light/dark interplay of their songwriting—a juxtaposition of screaming and soft vocals. </span> Midway through ""Ship,"" the chugging guitar and drums dissolve, leaving only bass as singer and guitarist Ashley Tryba shifts into narcotic tones for the 40-second bridge’s intonation: ""In my dreams, in my dreams…"" When the drums and guitar come back, this fugue state ends and returns the speaker to her post-traumatic reality. ""I’ve got a room of my own but nothing to write/ I’ve got an anger that burns but no one to fight,"" Tryba sings, chants, and finally shouts—invoking the classic Virginia Woolf essay and suggesting that a room of one’s own offers no reprieve.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Throughout, Fake Boyfriend make it clear they're determined to tackle bigger ills than ex-lovers<span id=""docs-internal-guid-1674e650-6778-cb48-52ac-4b72923f5627""><span>. At the </span><i>Mercy</i><span> release party, Tryba prefaced the performance of ""Ship"" with an angry redress: ""This song is about the self-blame, shame, and confusion that comes after being sexually harassed… Despite what the fucking journalists say."" They seem unconcerned with the rituals and niceties of getting covered or noticed by press, <span>a refreshing resurgence of true punk ethos within the often-sycophantic world of of contemporary indie rock. This </span> attitude has its most potent expression in their<span id=""docs-internal-guid-b827e3d3-6780-4c99-63f8-931b08b8b193""><span> clunky, obnoxious, unpolished, and often rapturous live shows: </span></span></span></span>""Sometimes we mix Trans-Siberian Orchestra with Evanescence, and that’s us,"" bassist Sarah Myers once informed an audience. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Each band member plays a different instrument than she learned prior to joining Fake Boyfriend.  Far from sounding amateurish, this quality gives <i>Mercy</i>’s four songs their special beauty, an improvisational intimacy like two new lovers undressing each other—fumbling into just the right groove.  The compositional unsteadiness to ""Bumtown,"" which seems to stumble and drag its way through its verses, only adds to the force of the explosion into the chorus. ""Bumtown"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJCDNt-fPF0&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the hypnotic ""Wax""</a> display latent pop sensibilities that best serve <i>Mercy</i> as brief flashes of contrast to the album’s abrasive swirl. But they also sounds like hints at a capacity for full-throttle pop anthems as well. Who would have thought the Hole heard on 1991’s <i>Pretty On The Inside</i> would later produce a song like ""Heaven Tonight""? On <i>Mercy</i>, Fake Boyfriend bristle with all manner of possibility. </p></div>"|21658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21658-mercy-ep/|7.8|Andy Emitt

Spurred on by this idea, saxophonist Daniel Thorne and his Immix Ensemble teamed up with Bristolian producer Sebastian Gainsborough (Vessel) to compose <i>Transition</i>. <i>Transition</i> is a four-movement suite, stylized as a conversation between concert-hall orchestration and left-field electronic production--something which in the last few years is a rapidly growing intersection. Each of the work’s four songs is supposed to highlight the historical snapshots of specific instruments (the trumpet, the saxophone, the oboe, etc) and how their contexts can be remixed or garbled with the presence of an electronic partner. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s not necessarily a groundbreaking concept. For last the decade, artists like Nils Frahm, Max Richter, or Daniel Wohl have been stretching the boundaries of the conversation between contemporary classical music and avant-garde composition that Thorne and Gainsborough are just entering. The piece is actually two years old, having been originally commissioned in the fall of 2014 for performances at Tate Britain and the University of Liverpool. The performances also stressed a collaboration between video art and orchestration, meaning it often feels like something substantial just listening to the album.</p>
<p>To its credit, <i>Transition</i> is an extremely breezy listen for a record of experimental classical music--running a little over 26 minutes, with only one song extending over eight minutes. The economy and pacing allows Thorne and Gainsborough to play with a wide range of elements without any feeling of excess or wasted space. Each of the four movements use their minutes wisely, allowing for more exploration than you’d think possible.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Starting with “What Hath God Wrought,” the artists decided to pair the bass clarinet and saxophone, the instruments whose sounds compliment and challenge each other the best across the entire album. There is something dancerly about the ways the two instruments weave around each other. Their faceoff is made interestingly discomfiting by a low drone that Vessel overlays on top of the action, something that very slowly takes over the song. His electronic touch is barely perceptible at first, but he sneakily washes out the sounds, making them feel older and less stable by generating a series of bleeps and fields of static that give the recording the character of an old radio broadcast.  “What Hath God Wrought” gets more and more crowded, allowing the analog and electronic sources to crash into each other and becoming indistinguishable. It seems to make the argument very early on that these sounds can’t exactly coexist naturally, that they always generate friction by sharing the same space. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Following “What Hath God Wrought” is “De Revolutionibus” (“On Revolutions” in Latin), a movement that furthers the tension <i>Transition</i> wants to make very apparent. Of the four movements, it seems to be the most influenced by Vessel’s history of moody and industrial productions. It’s undeniably Gothic in mood, with violins screaming in the presence of electronic squeals and hisses. There are brief horrifying moments where it sounds like insects are crawling around the recording microphones. The instruments are artfully crumpled together, adding to the texture of a song that seems to draw inspiration from bumper-to-bumper traffic and free jazz. It’s the most interesting eight minutes of the entire album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Scope” was the only one of the songs not co-penned by Gainsborough, and as a Thorne-focused affair, it lacks the same tense conversation of the two pieces that preceded it. The electronics seem to disappear for nearly six minutes, and it makes for a conventional and wan listening experience. To make up it seems they packed the closer “Battle Cry” with all the violence its title suggests--transforming the conversation between the musicians into a full blown argument. Fittingly “Battle Cry” ends abruptly. The last squeaks of the trumpet cut the rope, and curtains fall down on <i>Transition</i> almost with no warning.</p>
<p>Overall <i>Transition</i> is never as probing as it can be. It doesn’t allow for total investment from a listener because the marriage of sounds is incomplete and fitful. The thought experiment that should be at the core of the album sometimes felt lost in a confusing morass of interjections and trip-ups. But there are enough moments of pure gold that peek its head out of the morass that make the experience worth it in the end.</p></div>"|21612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21612-transition/|7.0|Kevin Lozano

The Brooklyn-based producer, who just released his second album as the Range, doesn’t do anything with the technique we haven’t heard before. Quite the opposite in fact—the songs on <i>Potential</i> touch on instrumental hip-hop, dubstep, twinkling electro-pop, and more, and they’re defined above else by their immediate familiarity. But Hinton dives into his samples with the verve of a producer who just this morning discovered the jolt of creative joy that comes from flipping a vocal fragment just so and finding a way to repeat it that brings a cascading wave of emotion. His work may not feel <i>new</i>, but it crackles with a sense of discovery.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hinton got to this point by honoring the act of listening. Most of the tracks on <i>Potential</i> were built around samples of people he found singing on YouTube. But he didn’t focus on the pop stars, or even the viral sensations, but the amateur performers whose work survives deep, deep down search holes, the videos that were uploaded in a rush of expression and were subsequently seen by almost no one. As he described in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9800-the-range-journeys-to-the-end-of-youtube/"">interview</a> with Pitchfork, Hinton found these videos, assembling phrases from them that had a certain musicality but also carried an ineffable feeling. Though he transforms the voices with the usual techniques of pitch-shifting, echo, reverb, and so on, you can get the tiniest sense of the individual behind each utterance. Pay attention to the feeling of yearning in a young person saying “Right now I don’t have a backup plan for if I don’t make it,” in “Regular,” or the extra tug of effort around each R&amp;B-inflected phrase in “Superimpose.” The voices feel anonymous but somehow closer because of that; they are faces in the crowd, just like us.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Around these voices, Hinton crafts songs, full of house piano loops, clapping drum sounds, and tightly sequenced synth patches. This is music designed for uplift, with carefully plotted builds yielding to big choruses, and it taps into electronic music's sense of possibility not by pushing things further, but by simplifying and paring back. Hinton brings to mind specific eras not from direct reference or slavish devotion to genre, but by striving to remember the historical moment when a specific element of sound first clicked—the squelching synth in “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLPQ9h659A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Genius of Love</a>,” the ghost vocal loop in “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0q1gCsZykg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Xtal</a>,” the piano in “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcxsheROd3E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Building Steam With a Grain of Salt</a>.” Because of this bedrock positivity (and, probably, because so many of the voices come from the UK) it also obliquely recalls the optimistic rave moment when the right combination of people and the right DJ could make you feel like you were part of something that mattered.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of this positivity means, naturally, there’s not a lot of darkness to explore in this music. The only pain present seems like the kind that that music is able to zero in on and explode, which is certainly not true of every kind of pain. At times, this uniformity of mood threatens to blunt the emotional pull of the album, but then there’s always a clever turn-around or defiantly catchy vocal loop to snap attention back in place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps unusually, Hinton tracked down the forgotten sources of his YouTube samples and signed them on for a share of his publishing. It may or may not lead to financial gain (though it’s pretty easy to imagine many of these tracks sounding good on TV in any number of contexts), but the gesture affirms the interconnectedness of life at this moment, how watching a random homemade video on YouTube can be thought of as a collaborative act. Hinton has an ability, not unlike the Books when they first hit the scene 14 years ago, of making shopworn techniques in sound manipulations seem strangely fresh, and <i>Potential</i> is the kind of music that makes you think about what your own part in a seemingly passive musical transaction of music might mean.</p></div>"|21563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21563-potential/|8.0|Mark Richardson

When rendered with economy, on a song like Madonna's ""Live to Tell,""  longing becomes part of the atmosphere, something unspoken that is too subtle and subatomic to see. When it's blown up to become the <i>only</i> feeling a in a song, it becomes alienating: Adele songs, for example, sometimes feel like vast deserts of longing in which she is the sole inhabitant.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">19-year-old British musician Låpsley combines something of both approaches. Her work, a kind of shimmering synth-pop that also inherits its more reptilian rhythms from trip hop, attracted the notice of the BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac in 2014, who invited her to contribute to a compilation. Now, Låpsley (full name Holly Låpsley Flesher) has been signed to XL Recordings, and her debut album for them expands on the crisp flutterings of her early EPs. Her music tends to be subtle in texture but direct in composition; “Hurt Me,” one of the singles from her debut album <i>Long Way Home</i>, is an adult contemporary pop ballad packaged in a glittering exoskeleton. It unfolds in discrete cellular units, like most songs on her record; a piano, a finger snap, the muted pulse of a kick drum, which eventually combine and flower into a small terrarium. Her vocal moves through this environment with the kind of sublimated warmth that powers Sade records and her many lesser imitators.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The unusual dependence on space in the arrangements can make the interiors of Låpsley’s songs seem uncannily empty, glassy structures with their insides removed so all that’s left is angled crystal. Låpsley’s thick, gelatinous voice is ostensibly intended to seal these isolated textures together, and she makes “Hurt Me” work almost despite itself; the melodrama of her vocal contrasts so much with the percussive decay of the backing track that it feels faintly violent. The song sounds both intimate and enormous as a result. “Operator (He Doesn’t Call Me)” employs the retrofuturism of disco and then refracts it through a second nostalgic lens, a sample of the 1975 Manhattan Transfer gospel single “Operator.” Here Låpsley’s sense of space benefits the song; the sample and the light, rolling disco collide at odd, interesting angles, like light passing through glass.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But in other instances her voice dissolves into an overabundance of negative space, and listening to the less-inspired sections of<i> Long Way Home</i> can feel like trying to remember something boring that happened to you once. Strangely, the most exciting songs on the record are both the oldest and most shapeless. On “Station,” Låpsley’s voice is processed at three different speeds, and all three vocals are arranged so that it seems she’s interacting and harmonizing with three different versions of herself. “Painter” resembles the frozen swirl inside a single marble. Both songs resist verses and choruses; instead they inhabit a central melodic idea until it is sufficiently complicated, then abandon it, while the remainder of the track drains gently away. These songs are her most direct expressions of longing, a form of desire that can be aesthetically assumed and discarded, but which is a vast and illegible universe of feeling when fallen into.</p></div>"|21667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21667-long-way-home/|6.6|Brad Nelson

Ward has admitted that the whole point of <i>More Rain</i> was to be the sort of thing to listen to when the weather is shit. As such, he's made a collection that attempts to persistently and gently wash away the negativity from, well, everything. The opening minute of pattering rain sets the mood as Ward dives headfirst into a collection of songs trying to square the big-picture ugliness of the world with its tiny details of everyday beauty. </p>
<p>The album works best when he leans all the way into his sleepy, slouchy songs. These songs might be the result of hours of careful, precise attention, but they feel magnificent in their decadent laziness: It is indeed the kind of record you put on when the day is soaked in gloom and dimness; you listen to when you’re loafing so hard that you can barely bring yourself to flip the record, much less leave the house and brave the elements.</p>
<p><i>More Rain</i> can’t reasonably be called a folk record, even with its acoustic underpinnings, but Ward does wield some folk elements to his benefit. Pedal steel—forever underrated and unfairly dismissed as a pop-country prop—occasionally lilts into the mix, with mandolin popping up, too. Album opener ""Pirate Dial"" is a mellow, patient folk-pop number that serves as the album’s high point.  On ""Girl from Conejo Valley,"" those eight strings stand in contrast with a sliding synth line, making for an unexpected complement.</p>
<p>There are moments, though, when these textures become overwhelming. <i>More Rain</i> feels smothering in its intimacy at times, like a thick down pillow pressed to your face. The mixes are so close, the reverb so heavy, and the tones so richly warm, that Ward leaves little breathing room within his songs. Staying inside on a rainy day usually starts out pleasant and slowly grows claustrophobic, and so it goes with <i>More Rain</i>.  </p>
<p>And while the instrumentation can often feel like too much, Ward’s flat lyrics feel like too little. ""Slow Driving Man"" starts with ""This is a song about a slow driving man/And I’m about to sing it just as slow as I can."" He proceeds to do just that. The cloying pattern of ""Doo wop""s, ""sha la la la""s, and ""yip yip""'s on ""Little Baby"" don’t do much good, either.</p>
<p>Ward rallies for the closing track ""I’m Going Higher,"" which slides in at the end of <i>More Rain</i> as a gospel tune disguised as a rock song. It’s solid, but resounds with the album’s over-arching theme of being a little <i>too</i> on the nose. The rain is gone and now there’s sunshine, praise the Lord!

While this was a fair description of their discordant and vicious 2014 debut, <i>Eighteen Hours of Static</i>, each note feeling like it was being forced ruthlessly into the mosh pit typical at most Big Ups shows, it is even more accurate for their sophomore record <i>Before a Million Universes.</i> While these lapses into chaos are still very much present, Big Ups place a greater emphasis on quiet moments, on gradual buildups, which of course then allow the instrumental fits of Brendan Finn (drums), Amar Lal (guitar), and Carlos Salguero (bass) to feel even more explosive by contrast. Every phrase Galarraga screams, every phrase that he does not, every burst of noise within a track’s connective fiber are carefully calculated tabs on their audience’s emotional pulse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Eighteen Hours of Static</i> spent a lot of time deep in the thick of things, questioning and distrusting society with relentless fury (""Everybody says it’s getting better all the time / But it’s bad still bad""). <i>Before a Million Universes</i> focuses on ""dissecting"" their problems, as singer Joe Galarraga explained in an <a href=""http://diymag.com/2015/06/04/moving-in-with-big-ups-recording-their-second-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. Accordingly, they spend less time directly confronting bureaucratic bullshit (One glaring exception is the seething ""Capitalized"" with its sardonic query, ""Tell me what you’re worth/Salary, two weeks off from work?/Call them benefits and perks"") and instead focus on how the macrocosm affects the individual. ""Why live in the moment/If the moment is broken? There could be hope for someone/If we fix it,"" Galarraga asks on ""Hope for Someone.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their political ideologies, meanwhile, have simmered below the surface of the music, expressing themselves in the song’s unpredictable dynamics. ""Meet Where We Are"" is largely muted, growing a little more manic for each repetition of the title and only releasing the tension at the end with an electric jolt.  ""Negative""’s moments of peace are designated for its brief intro before the chaos rolls in via sharp, punctuated shouts and rolling guitar s. ""So Much You"" hits hardest with its simplicity, its sullen comment that ""I haven’t been with myself at all."" None of these songs would have the same effect if rushed, which is what set Big Ups apart from many of their peers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Before a Million Universes</i> borrows its title from section 48 of Walt Whitman’s ""Song of Myself"" from Leaves of Grass: ""And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes."" Although the quote is never spoken verbatim on the record, Big Ups clearly understand their place within the cosmos. When their time to stand before a million universes arrives, they will approach the unknown with confidence and calmness, like the shadowy figure in Caspar David Friedrich’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog.""</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nowhere is this so apparent than on ""National Parks,"" which lies unobtrusively in the later half of the record and is perhaps the standout track. The song is a meditation on the financial difficulties faced by a woman metaphorically meant to reflect Galarraga’s own upbringing. The song concludes with the subject and narrator traveling together: ""We got on a plane and flew across the country/And saw the biggest trees /Bigger than the ones that lined her streets/Bigger than she'd ever seen/Bigger than one could think to exist/I think I saw her say to herself-/""This is everything I've missed."" It is in this moment, with an aerial perspective of the vast world, that Big Ups open themselves to a million universes and accept the sublime.</p></div>"|21642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21642-before-a-million-universes/|7.6|Quinn Moreland

And to that list we can now add Jake Webb, who launched his equally wiggy outfit, Methyl Ethel, as a solo home-recording pursuit in 2013. But while mounting acclaim prompted Webb to turn his private concern into a flesh-and-blood touring band, Methyl Ethel’s debut full-length, <i>Oh Inhuman Spectacle</i>, is reflective of the project’s humble, hermetic beginnings, with Webb handling all the production and instrumentation.</p>
<p>Webb is clearly a devout student of 21<sup>st</sup>-century art-rock, where old-school psychedelia converges with modern technology—think Radiohead circa <i>Kid A</i> (complete with a song called ""Everything Is As It Should Be""), <i>Yoshimi</i>-era Flaming Lips, Animal Collective’s <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, the more meditative end of MGMT. But he melts these sources into something more intimate and claustrophobic, with a distinct, disarming voice that infuses his deceptively serene soundscapes with a nervous tension. Through the haunted-house fog of ""Also <span id=""docs-internal-guid-12775de3-62da-96b3-c756-c4e823968288"">Gesellschaft,""</span> he delivers his mission statement with Gollum-like creepiness: ""Sometimes, I want to dig a hole and then crawl into it/ I don’t even know if I will come out again/ but I invited you inside."" The result is dream-pop for insomniacs—shadowy, nocturnal music whose surface shimmer barely conceals the fidgety, restless soul lurking underneath. </p>
<p>In spite of the obvious attention to getting the mood right, parts of <i>Oh Inhuman Spectacle</i> feel like works in progress. ""To Swim"" introduces an entrancing, quiet-storm R&amp;B groove but breaks its spell after a too-brief two minutes where ""Depth Perception"" takes its sweet time building up only to sputter out after a single verse. Webb is still working out the difference between channeling his influences and mimicking them: from its space-bound harmonies to its pulsing backdrop, ""Unbalancing Acts"" is such a blatant act of AnCo karaoke that some disillusioned fans may actually prefer it to anything on <i>Painting With</i>.</p>
<p>But if Webb is still mastering the finer points of songcraft, he’s got a handle on melody, the most important piece. The trembling guitar line of ""Rogues"" is pure ’80s dream-pop, but the song’s vacuum-sealed groove and confessional vocal hew closer to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=462lDlULSBk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreams</a>."" On the jangly highlight ""Twilight Driving,"" Webb lets in a little sunlight through the drapes. ""It’s the early morning baby, I say, why don’t you hit the snooze,"" Webb sings, before the relationship is consummated with a bedsheet-rustling sax solo. On an album that’s mostly consumed with paranoid, paralyzing 3 a.m. thoughts about unfulfilled desire, alien abductions, and fever dreams filled with ""10,000 screams,"" ""Twilight Driving"" extols the virtues of staying in bed for the right reasons: because you have someone there to share it with.</p></div>"|21691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21691-oh-inhuman-spectacle/|6.7|Stuart Berman

Allin</a> <i>and</i> <a href=""https://vimeo.com/25127592"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom Jones</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Some four decades on from his Dinah! stint, Iggy is once again <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63078-iggy-pop-and-josh-homme-chat-perform-gardenia-on-colbert/"">making the rounds on the talk-show circuit</a> with a dapper, red-haired rock-star pal who can help him gain a foothold in the mainstream: Queens of the Stone Age kingpin Josh Homme. While Iggy may no longer be paraded before national audience for the freak-show factor (he seemed positively bashful in the face of reverential audience applause on his recent Colbert appearance), he finds himself in the same position he was in during the mid-’70s, with the future of the (reformed) Stooges in doubt and the singer in need of direction. Where Bowie whisked Iggy off to Europe to be his electro-shocked ""<a href=""https://books.google.ca/books?id=RQnaE8L5bK8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=guinea+pig+bowie+iggy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YKDEd1w-Fc&amp;sig=gzqKHHjLBZg3cFU7YLBVblToCEk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY8eOzi7HLAhUHsYMKHXy7CTEQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=guinea%20pig%20bowie%20iggy&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">guinea pig</a>,"" Homme lured him out to Joshua Tree last year to take stock of his life, reflect on his legacy, and contemplate his place in a modern world where he’s <a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?q=iggy&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1164&amp;bih=461&amp;ei=_8beVvnaBObijgSGn5f4BQ&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no longer the first ""Iggy"" to come up on a Google search</a>.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The result of these private sessions is <i>Post Pop Depression</i>, a record that recaptures the avant-rock frisson of Iggy’s Bowie collaborations, in exploratory spirit if not explicitly in sound. For a frontman, Iggy has always done his greatest work as a passenger, riding shotgun with a musical force as potent as his personality (be it Bowie, Ron Asheton or James Williamson), and submitting himself to their sonic abuse just as he’s subjected himself to pelted ice cubes and batteries from his audience. Now, with the man making <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/iggy-pop/91289"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">none-too-subtle hints</a> about impending retirement,  he has found a co-conspirator that can nudge him out of his comfort zone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album may have been recorded in secrecy, but it has  become an act of public mourning. Homme's friends in The Eagles of Death Metal were caught in the crossfire of last November’s terrorist attacks in Paris, and Iggy is grieving the recent loss of his long-time champion and career savior. As the name and context suggests, <i>Post Pop Depression</i> is awash in a fog of melancholy. The title reads like a harbinger of the come-down that will kick in when he inevitably has to hang up his shirt (or, <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/graphic/iggy-pop-only-one-allowed-in-grocery-store-shirtle-9963"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in his case</a>, put one on). ""I’ve got nothing but my name… I am nothing but my name,"" he ruefully intones during a moment of quiet reflection, bracing himself for the moment when Iggy Pop has to go back to being Jim Osterberg. Essentially, <i>Post Pop Depression</i> furthers the existential conversations Iggy initiated on 2013’s (likely) Stooges swan song,<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17903-iggy-and-the-stooges-ready-to-die/"">Ready to Die</a></i>, though here he’s given more freedom to be introspective without having to overcompensate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17903-iggy-and-the-stooges-ready-to-die/"">songs about worshipping big-breasted women</a>. But unlike previous dark-alley detours like <i>Avenue B</i> or <i><span id=""docs-internal-guid-616e32d2-5d1d-0963-b799-00ca75b3b323"">Préliminaires</span></i>, <i>Post Pop Depression</i> d0esn't sacrifice his swagger. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Musically, the album is certainly not the Queens of the Stooge Age psych-punk blowout the advance billing may have suggested and, at times, the album's ruminative nature makes you long for a little less search and a little more destroy. But it <span>channels</span> Iggy’s legacy in more oblique fashion, through hypnotic, bass-battering grooves (bolstered by QOTSA/Dead Weather multi-instrumentalist Dean Fertita and Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders) that hearken back to the singer’s <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-23377160"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original Detroit assembly-line inspirations</a>. And that thunderous thump is matched by lush textures: the radiant shoegazey shuffle of ""Gardenia""; the orchestral swirl that caps the tough disco rumble of ""Sunday""; the Kraftwerkian synth shading on ""Break Into Your Heart"" and the ""China Girl"" echoes of ""American Valhalla.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record also reasserts Iggy’s facility with simple, suggestive phrases. Pick-up lines don’t get much creepier than the album’s opening couplet: ""I’m gonna break into your heart/ I’m gonna crawl under your skin"". The difference is that this time, he's singing about a culture of me-first indulgence and accordingly, Iggy spends much o<i>f Post Pop Depression</i> trying to curb his appetite for excess. ""Gardenia"" may playfully revel in film-noir images of seedy motel hook-ups, but amid the hedonistic throb of ""Sunday"" and jazz-punk swing of ""In the Lobby,"" he posits that a lustful life can only lead to a six-foot ditch. (""I hope I’m not losing my life tonight,"" he sings on the latter, punctuating that last word with genuinely terrified, ""TV Eye""-style shriek.) And the deceptively sweet ""Chocolate Drops""—a serenade worthy of early-’70s Steely Dan—packs the record’s most bitterly sardonic sentiment: ""When you get to the bottom, you’re near the top/ the shit turns into chocolate drops,"" a comment on the fleeting, phony nature of success from a man who’s ridden the bumpy roller coaster of fame many times.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The elaborate, theatrical set pieces that demand more of Iggy—like the spaghetti-western folk opera ""Vulture"" and the swashbuckling blues grind ""German Days""—feel overcooked and impersonal in comparison, and bog down the mid-album momentum. But if <i>Post Pop Depression</i>’s refined execution has you missing the more unhinged Iggy of old, rest assured, he’s not going down without a fight. The breezy west-coast strummer ""Paraguay"" may find him ready to throw on the Bermuda shorts and drive off into the sunset, but he abruptly pulls a U-turn for one final middle-fingered rant to the straight world. ""You take your motherfuckin’ laptop and just shove it into your goddamn foul mouth, down your shit-heeled gizzard, you fuckin’ phony, two-faced, three-timing piece of turd,"" he screams to no one and everyone in particular, as Homme and crew egg him on with a Queens-sized crunch and chain-gang chant. And if that proves to be the last gasp of history’s first punk, well, he’s leaving us exactly how he came in—flipping off a world that’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvRkJzVQBP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no fun</a>.</p></div>"|21586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21586-post-pop-depression/|6.9|Stuart Berman

In it, Boeing forecasts an extremely optimistic vision of 2116<span>—</span>a future where Boeing’s cutting-edge research helps create a spotless and conflict-free world replete with colonies on Mars, regular travel to the Moon, unlimited clean energy, and smiling innocent children. It's a startlingly ironic piece of corporate lip-service that sidesteps the company’s long history of <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/10/10-companies-profiting-most-from-war/1970997/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">defense contracts</a> and early pioneering in the<a href=""http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2011/The%20Military-Industrial%20Complex%20Revisited.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> military industrial complex</a>. I first saw the ad in the gym, being broadcast across an array of large flat-screen televisions<span>—</span>a dramatic commercial break that followed ominous speculations on the incoming results of the South Carolina primary.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album I was listening to at the time was Fatima Al Qadiri’s <i>Brute</i>, a piece of music ideally suited to a time of shadowy corporate manipulation and apocalyptic political theater. Qadiri started writing <i>Brute</i> last year while recovering from a knee injury in Kuwait, unable to move much for more than a month. The injury coincided with the height of the horrific news cycle that included the events of Ferguson, Baltimore, and more. Reminded of the first large-scale protest she attended as a freshman in college and shaken by the sheer scale of the police force that met the protesters, she conceived of <i>Brute</i> as a celebration of the right of protest, which is funny when you’ve listened to its 11 songs and realize there isn't all that much celebrating going on. If anything, the album runs as direct counterpoint to the optimistic future that Boeing presents in its ad.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is made immediately clear by the album’s disconcerting cover: a dead-eyed and inhuman Teletubbie in SWAT gear. The art was designed by the artist Josh Kline, borrowing from his piece <i>Freedom</i>, which the New Yorker described as an ""elegy to lost hope and broken promises."" This is an equally apt description of Qadiri's dystopian music: Starting with ""Endzone,"" Fatima creates an ominous découpé from live recordings of the unrest in Ferguson. The sounds of gun shots, walkie-talkie beeps, explosions, crowds screaming, overwhelming confusion, and the weaponization of sound via the police’s use of LRADs (Long Range Acoustic Device) is mixed together with a slow burning thump<span>—</span>resulting in a heart-palpitating minute of music. In fact, the album’s three best moments come from the songs that feature extended sample use. In ""Blows"" Al Qadiri opens and closes the track with a now-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdHzih-Bdi0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infamous report </a>by MSNBC news anchor Lawrence O'Donnell chastising the excessive police brutality at Occupy Wall Street. And in the album’s closer ""Power,"" arguably the album’s only danceable moment, she deftly inserts a cutting interview with ex-LAPD sergeant Cheryl Dorsey on the abuse of police power in the middle of a dizzyingly spacious and confident sonic environment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These moments bring Qadiri's music somewhere outside the usual purview of electronic music: <i>Brute</i> is in some ways closer to a piece of Brechtian theater than a traditional album. But outside of the successful manipulation of samples and found sounds, there are large blocks of shapeless tracks that excessively borrow from her previous projects. The descending chord progression and sweep of vocals in ""Blood Moon"" feels like it was copy-and-pasted from ""Hydra,"" a track from her <i>Desert Strike</i> EP. ""Breach,"" with its swooping helicopter sample and belching bass, is similarly a pastiche, mixing elements of <i>Desert Strike</i> and her last two albums: <i>Asiatisch</i> and <i>Future Brown</i>. There are far too many of these moments in <i>Brute</i>: ""Fragmentation,"" a moody and string-heavy track in the album’s back half, might have been cut from <i>Asiatisch</i> and retrofitted for <i>Brute</i>.</p>
<p>Overall <i>Brute</i> is a frustrating mish-mosh of middling and artful. When it’s working, there is a certain panache in the high-powered, informationally dense musical speedballs she creates. Tracks like ""Oubliette"" (a reference to claustrophobic French dungeons) and ""10-34"" (the police code for riots) are perfect examples of the push-and-pull animating Qadiri’s most interesting work. When you listen to some of these songs you feel as if you’re being followed. As a conceptual piece, it’s unlike any politically driven electronic music being made today. It illustrates how exhausting and draining it is to be attuned to the problems of the world, but also how worthwhile it is keep yourself awake and see through the artifice.</p></div>"|21555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21555-brute/|7.3|Kevin Lozano

It could have been a tossed-off or ironic remark; it’s hard to tell. But it’s easy to trace a path between Sontag’s blasé attitude regarding the long play and the shortcomings of his new record, <i>No Fantasy Required.</i></p>
<p><i> </i>A veteran of a half-dozen different styles, Tiga has never shied away from trying new sounds. But here, it’s as if he’s can’t find anything that fits comfortably, and from track to track you can feel him rejecting any kind of consistency. As a result, a good portion of the tracks here fall short of the high standards he’s set for himself with his past work. In some ways, the new record is reminiscent of Sontag’s first solo album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9714-sexor/"">Sexor</a>, </i>another fidgety collection of tracks that couldn’t sit still long enough to relax.</p>
<p><i> </i>That’s not to say there are not some glorious productions on the album. ""Having So Much Fun,"" one of the three terrific tracks here co-produced by Matthew Dear, is a strutting, vintage, electro banger, with steeplechase bass and whistles tailoring an immaculately structured, wryly romantic song. The first two songs on the album ""No Fantasy Required"" and ""Make Me Fall In Love,"" are gorgeous R&amp;B-tinged electropop, recalling the best work of Hot Chip.</p>
<p>Dear once <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2014/10/20/interview-catching-up-with-matthew-dear/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described</a> Sontag's style as more disciplined and scientific than his own. But their differences seem to help Tiga locate his own personality; as an accomplished remixer, he’s used to expressing himself through the work of others. On <i>No Fantasy Required</i>, he never seems more present than on the Dear co-production ""3 Rules,"" where his love of bass thump and sly sense of humor shine most brightly, particularly during the track’s witty coda.</p>
<p>It’s on the back half that Tiga seems to withdraw from his own album, his sense of humor curdling. Three singles in a row, two of them previously released, weigh down the album, starting with the ""Planet E"" a much-anticipated collaboration with fellow club bombardier Hudson Mohawke that feels inexplicably tame. ""Plush,"" a version of which was originally released in 2012, is a stylish production, but it sounds claustrophobic sandwiched between two bigger songs here. And there’s no bigger disappointment than the transformation of ""Bugatti"" (originally released as a single in 2014, featuring Pusha T). It’s elongated on the record, and without Pusha’s snarling ostentatiousness (""Tiga me amigo, we both follow that G code""), there’s no foil for Sontag’s chillier sneer.</p>
<p>That previously successful singles feel stale when forced into position on the album underscores the difficulty of pacing these things. Fifty minutes of music from the same producer is difficult to make interesting without a lot of thought given to pacing and cohesion. In the Thump interview, Tiga said that albums allow you to ""release different styles of music"" and provide ""a nice platform for experimentation."" Neither of those statements sounds like it comes from a producer who’s particularly interested in the elements that can make these collections special, nor does<i> No Fantasy Required.</i></p></div>"|21669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21669-no-fantasy-required/|6.2|Jonah Bromwich

The San Francisco songwriter—who also plays bass in the leaden, woozy rock outfit CCR Headcleaner—issued <i>Viles </i>in 2011, which featured similarly elliptical lyricism and oblong, idiosyncratic grooves. <i>Paid For It,</i> which was recorded in Los Angeles,<i> </i>features Don Bolles, best known as drummer of The Germs, behind the kit on some songs. Otherwise, Treise is responsible for the sounds, including power drill, broken bottle, gurgling electronics, and field recordings, but principally bass guitar, which he’d loop live in the studio and ply with effects until sufficiently forbidding.   </p>
<p>The emphasis on overlaid bass lines rather than chord patterns lends Jealousy songs strange, shifty shapes. ""Doin’ a Little Time"" is typical of the strongest tracks on account of its consistent, pulsing bass motif, which anchors an ebb and flow of hiss and noise. There are deceivingly few sonic components to <i>Paid For It, </i>but their nightmarish dub reflections swell to fill what feel like massive chambers. The six-minute highlight ""Fresh Kill,"" for instance, features little more than rhythmic pitter-patter augmented by two-or-three note melodic gestures. Like <i>Paid For It </i>overall, the song eschews conventional structure and development in favor of cyclical, rippling bass beneath Treise’s eerily enchanting voice.  </p>
<p>On <i>Paid For It, </i>Treise yearns for visceral, elemental experiences. The title track, which invokes goddesses and autoeroticism alike, seems like a fraught meditation on personal identity. Florid mythical imagery recurs throughout, but passion most often dovetails with destruction: ""And I loved hard like iron,"" goes ""Fresh Kill."" ""And bent the word ‘love’ into a crescent moon / terminal swoon."" He's a glutton for self-loathing: In one song, Treise is ""sucked up and fucked up"" and a ""sleazebag scumbag scumfuck"" whose face is a ""wretched cliché."" And yet, the track is called, ""I Want It."" If indulgence is paramount to <i>Paid For It</i>, the next most important theme is guilt. </p>
<p>Generous reverb and delay tends to render vocals soothing or spooky but indistinct. Not for Jealousy. The effects warp Treise’s weary incantations, moisten his lisp, and lend his leering murmur a sense of bleary, opiated oblivion. That means <i>Paid For It </i>is a druggy album, but few druggy albums capture the balance between blissful stupor and nausea so well. And while dull gloom is often peddled under the pretenses of chic austerity, <i>Paid For It </i>evades the trappings of stylish-but-innocuous miserablism. A couple songs feel impenetrable to a fault (including the vertiginous opener ""Been Wrong""), but the album's overall pleasures—in the terms of Treise’s spiritually conflicted lyrics—are akin to a rewarding séance: shock and awe before the medium’s ritual flair, followed by an uneasy, lingering sense of connection.   </p></div>"|21546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21546-paid-for-it/|7.6|Sam Lefebvre

Since 2005, he’s fronted hyped rock bands (the sadly defunct Tulsa), released solo records that jumped wildly from genre to genre, and collaborated with numerous top-tier indie acts, including Lower Dens, Twin Shadow, and Marissa Nadler. He's a hard worker with serious chops—as a guitarist, a vocalist, and a producer—but his career’s volatility has tended to keep these talents on the sidelines. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Jettison the Valley</i> marks a fresh start for the Baltimore native, an attempt to reintroduce Tanton as a thoughtfully earnest singer-songwriter. (Tanton considers <i>Jettison</i> to be his first proper solo album even though it’s the third he’s released under his own name.) His last effort, 2011’s admirable-if-uneven <i>Free Clouds</i>, flirted with synth-heavy electronica, country, shoegaze and Paul Westerberg-worshipping indie rock—all recorded under a lo-fi haze. On <i>Jettison</i>, Tanton’s work coheres into a single musical vision—lush Laurel Canyon folk—and a single theme: the slow destruction of a relationship. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A bad breakup can be a crutch for a songwriter who isn’t sure of his abilities, a source of lazy metaphors and cheap emotion. But Tanton handles the story (Carter and his British girlfriend move to England, where they live in a caravan outside Bristol and later in a tiny attic apartment in Oxford, before calling it quits) with nuance and compassion. Tanton wrote the entire record in Britain while the relationship disintegrated, and the sorry tale serves as a much-needed counterpoint to the record’s florid, over-bright production.</p>
<p> Jettison’s excellent first three tracks set the tone: elegant fingerpicked guitar, pedal steel, thick harmonies, and supple, kick-heavy percussion reminiscent of Neil Young’s <i>Harvest</i>—a vision of sun-dappled California as seen through rain-drenched British pub windows. On the gorgeous opener, ""Twenty-Nine Palms,"" Tanton finds himself standing in the California desert with his mind on a woman (possibly across the Atlantic, it’s not entirely clear) ""who took me rather far out of view."" While on the next track, ""Fresh Faced Claire,"" the perspective flips: Now Tanton’s stuck in ""the old empire"" living in a ""halfway home for the breaking down,"" his relationship slowly collapsing as he longs to return to the sunny West Coast. This dichotomy—California vs. England, sunlight vs. clouds, movement vs. stasis—remains in tension throughout <i>Jettison</i>, lending weight and a sense of drama to an otherwise rather straightforward collection of songs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Beck’s <i>Sea Change</i>—a shining example of the hoary old breakup record if there ever was one—would be the obvious musical touchstone here, if it wasn’t for Tanton’s emotive, breathy, very un-Beck-like tenor. It’s an undeniably beautiful thing, and Tanton has never sounded more self-assured, particularly on the languid closer ""Diamonds in the Mine"" and on ""Through the Garden Gates"" and ""Twenty-Nine Palms,"" both of which feature a welcome vocal assist from Sharon Van Etten. But Tanton’s voice is strong medicine: All that sweetness can turn cloying when the arrangements and reverb-heavy production are just as syrupy, as they are on the brooding Smiths-tribute ""Poison in the Dart.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of which leaves Tanton’s fluidly inventive guitar playing as the record’s most enduring pleasure. British folkies like Richard Thompson and Michael Chapman are lodestars, as is, oddly enough, James Taylor, whose mannered melodicism shows up on ""The Long Goodbye."" There are surprises too: The rambling title track (starring Marissa Nadler on lead vocals) stops abruptly just before the four-minute mark before embarking on an extended instrumental coda that builds to a hot rash of dueling 6- and 12-string guitars.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For his first major statement as a solo artist, Tanton could have made an entire record of jagged indie rock (see <i>Free Clouds</i>’ ""Horrorscope""), woozy shoegaze (see <i>Free Clouds</i>’ ""Fake Pretend""), or Day-Glo electronica (see anything from his recent synth project Luxury Liners). Instead, he made a fairly conventional country-folk record about a breakup.  And yet there is great satisfaction in witnessing a creatively manic artist like Carter Tanton finally settle in to himself. On <i>Jettison</i>, Tanton quietly sits down, picks up his guitar, and, without fuss or self-importance, transforms himself into a singer-songwriter. Surely that is a statement worth making.</p></div>"|21655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21655-jettison-the-valley/|6.4|John S.W. MacDonald

Among the many questions raised by <i>Glitterbust</i>—the debut noise guitar record from this California duo—the most pressing one is also, at least partially, the easiest to parse using Google. Knost is a 31-year-old pro surfer from Costa Mesa, Calif. ""I thought surfing was cool because it was an art form and a subculture,"" Knost once told an interviewer, and he has referred to his single-fin longboard as an art piece itself. <i>Surfer</i> magazine has called Knost ""unlike any other surfer in the world,"" drawing from '60s and '70s technique for a poised, imaginative, eccentric form. ""Alex looks like a beat poet,"" one journalist <a href=""http://www.surfline.com/surfnews/article_bamp_400_v03.cfm?id=20383"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> in 2008, comparing his surf style to ""a 1984 Fender Stratocaster about to be beaten against a Marshall stack. In a good way.""</p>
<p>Before she became the loft-dwelling, paint-splattering, flip-up-shades-donning embodiment of Warholian, Downtown cool, Gordon was raised in California (where she smoked weed, hitchhiked to Big Sur, and saw the Dead in San Francisco). In a sense, <i>Glitterbust</i> is the sound of the most New York woman to ever live returning to her West Coast roots. The record's five compositions have the corrosive edge and arty temperament that distinguish all of Gordon’s projects, but this impressionistic noise is often mellower, more spacious and atmospheric. <i>Glitterbust</i> has nothing to do with classic surf music, but you could imagine its ritualistic drones and white-heat mantras soundtracking a séance on the beach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Gordon and Knost have provided no context for <i>Glitterbust</i>. They quietly played a first show at a festival last fall, and they are ostensibly named after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ennrnviVew4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a blistering, alarming Royal Trux song</a> (you could imagine ""Glitterbust"" alongside ""Talk Normal"" and ""Secret Abuse"" in Gordon's ""Noise Paintings"" series, in which she renders the names of noise bands in acrylic on canvas). Knost has played in more conventional rock groups, such as <a href=""http://experimentaljelly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tomorrows Tulips</a> (also of Burger Records, perhaps explaining the curious label choice for Gordon), but his primary medium is not music. And maybe Gordon—who has often said she considers herself a visual artist first—found a kindred spirit in Knost for this reason. In limitations, they find a world.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most of these pieces (not all quite songs) use just a few primitive chords; there is a recurring air of dread. Sounds pan dramatically, filling frames like full canvases. Bits of piercing noise drill into your skull and install hooks. The grating dream logic of the dense, windy 11-minute ""Repetitive Differ"" sounds like destruction and regeneration underwater, like notes swimming at the seafloor while Gordon treads above. Its heavy, enveloping drones are busy with overdriven details that shoot into the red.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music unspools slowly. This is ambient abrasion, like no wave directed by the cycles of the Sun or Moon. The LP's nine-minute highlight is ""The Highline,"" the most conventionally composed piece here, like a collage of song fragments. It's also the only track to foreground Gordon's painterly, almost-mystical singing voice. Underscoring the whole record's shadowy mood, at the ""chorus"" Gordon and Knost speak-sing in unison of a ""shadow behind the buildings,"" their voices blending effortlessly. There are bits of spoken word on most of <i>Glitterbust</i>, but you can rarely make them out—""Sometimes I think words are not her primary language,"" Gordon’s astrologer, Peter Smith, once told <i><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/next-stage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New Yorker</a></i>, and that's not hard to believe here. ""The Highline"" shares a name with the touristy park in New York housed within a former above-ground subway platform, which now runs parallel to Manhattan's austere gallery district—the song likewise combines the industrial and the organic, with its blown-out guitar manipulations and wide-open vocal phrasings.</p>
<p>Glitterbust is not unlike Gordon's other recent duo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30653-bodyhead/"" target=""_blank"">Body/Head</a>, though less bold. Still, it feels like a gift to spend time in the oceanic space Gordon and Knost summon, letting its nuances wash over you. The experience, like all great noise music, is at once dissonant and, in a peculiar way, meditative and serene. In his epic 2015 surf-memoir, the journalist William Finnegan writes that, ""Surfing is a secret garden, not easily entered. My memory of learning a spot, of coming to know and understand a wave, is usually inseparable from the friend with whom I tried to climb its walls."" On <i>Glitterbust</i>, you hear a sonic equivalent—two professional outsiders in total communion, knowing and understanding the crest of a wave, becoming inseparable in the process.</p></div>"|21665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21665-glitterbust/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

It’s a naturally absurd pairing: At their best, both rappers’ similarly skewed perspective allows them boil down the universe into an endless supply of WTF punchlines. On Juicy J's strip club ode ""Bandz a Make Her Dance,"" for instance, 2 Chainz and Wayne deliver sometimes-head-scratching non sequiturs about their favorite pastime, and it’s representative of their combined cheekiness. It’s also the first song that comes to mind when 2 Chainz raps, ""You said, ‘You can make a million rappin’ ‘bout some pussy,’"" on ""Dedication,"" the opener to their new project, <i>ColleGrove</i>, recounting some wizened Wayne advice. 2 Chainz made a name for himself not only by listening to Wayne but also following his lead, so it’s a bit odd that <i>ColleGrove</i> has him spending so much time dragging Wayne behind him.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That isn’t by design, of course. The intention of <i>ColleGrove</i> is, as the hometown-referencing name suggests, to merge the rappers’ two worlds, and to also display 2 Chainz’s enviable respect for Wayne. ""Dedication"" is a ""Big Brother""-style narration of the duo’s longstanding friendship, with 2 Chainz paying homage to Wayne’s impact on his career. (The record is billed as a 2 Chainz album likely because of Wayne’s unresolved disputes with Cash Money, making this the ultimate outpouring of gratitude.) And in a way, <i>ColleGrove</i> is itself a dedication, to both Lil Wayne and the era of freaky one-liners he ushered in. But Wayne is now a shell of the rapper 2 Chainz revered, and here, standing beside Atlanta’s zinger king, he struggles to get an interesting word in edgewise.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At his peak, Lil Wayne was an efficient and effective puncher, taking compact swings and landing in flurries. There are glimpses of that here, but more often than not Wayne is merely trying to keep pace. At this point, he simply has trouble matching 2 Chainz’s outlandishness bar-for-bar. For every ""I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell/ These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb,"" Wayne provides, 2 Chainz delivers five delirious winners like ""I had a sitdown with Farrakhan/ Turned the White House to the Terrordome."" This unbalance becomes an issue on songs like ""Rolls Royce Weather Every Day"" and ""Bentley Truck,"" where Wayne sputters so much that you wish this was just a 2 Chainz album.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To be fair, some of it is. Six tracks are 2 Chainz-only, including two highlights—""MFN Right"" and ""Not Invited""—which originally appeared on his recent EP, <i>Felt Like Cappin</i>, where they benefitted from the shorter running time; without Wayne verses, they feel out of place here. It’s also odd that one of that EP’s standouts, ""Back on My Bullshyt,"" which features of the better Lil Wayne verses in recent memory, didn’t make it to <i>ColleGrove</i>.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""MFN Right"" and ""Not Invited"" also standout as the sonic outliers here, one minimalist, the other soulful. Everything else lies along a gradient of glazed synths that mushroom, percolate, or oscillate, allowing just enough room to accommodate both Wayne’s whine and 2 Chainz’s groggy drawl. The production credits are a road map of the pair’s collective journey, from one-time in-house Cash Money producer Mannie Fresh, to modern trap architects Mike WiLL Made It, Southside, and Zaytoven, to rap’s current all stars Metro Boomin, TM88, and FKi. Their collective effort doesn’t quite live up to their pedigree, but it’s still formidable.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That is, excepting the Mannie Fresh-produced ""Gotta Lotta,"" with its unnecessarily dense layering and nursery rhyme hook. It’s symbolic of why <i>ColleGrove</i> stalls. There are moments where everything goes right, like on the well-paced ""Bounce"" or the London on da Track-produced VIP checklist ""Section,"" and you can see how the album may have worked in theory. These rappers have an undeniable chemistry, and when they both find their best, the album is pure fun. But more often than not, <i>ColleGrove </i>plays out like 2 Chainz pulling his friend and mentor up by his bootstraps while ceding a bit of the spotlight in the process. It’s a generous gesture, but a costly one.</span></p></div>"|21706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21706-collegrove/|6.8|Sheldon Pearce

Firstly, founding member Milo Cordell left to focus on running Merok Records. Secondly, the band's frontman, Robbie Furze brought his wife Mary Charteris into the fold, on vocals and keyboards. At the center of their new EP, titled <i>Empire Underground</i>, is this notion of both separation and union, an idea of reconnecting with the aesthetic that made them popular while casting around for a viable future. </p>
<p>Try, if you can, to close your eyes and picture the environment in which the Big Pink released their first, and still best, record <i>A Brief History of Love, </i>in 2009. Bloggers are losing their grip on the meritocracy of independent music, the general aesthetic is shifting from fluorescent party attire to nouveau goth black and basic athletic wear. On the strength of two meteoric singles, ""Velvet"" and the boisterous, anthemic peak of ""Dominos,"" the Big Pink are able to bridge two eras of British music pretty much seamlessly: the boyish swagger of Britpop and the more electronic music that was going to become prevalent. It seems like they have been chasing that eureka moment ever since to diminishing returns. </p>
<p>Which brings us to ""Hightimes"" the lead single off of <i>Empire Underground</i>, which opens with the same ethereal coos and ultra-fuzzy guitar riffs that became the Big Pink's signature at their prime. And the message couched behind the layers of distortion couldn't be more clear: ""It's about high time/ Better than the last time"" wails Furze as Charteris' pleasantly smooth vocals sail beneath his. Big booming drums and rubbery basslines roll across the song, almost but never <i>quite</i> succumbing to a sheen of static. It's obvious that the Big Pink were aware that their future depended on getting in touch with the sound that made them, and while not exactly reaching the heights of something like ""Dominos,"" it's a welcome reintroduction to a band that had somewhat lost their way.</p>
<p>If Richard Ashcroft were to front the Kills, ""Decoy"" would be the result, a throwback of another kind. While perfectly enjoyable (the track's most notable aspect is its mid-career-Oasis-style chorus), it's mostly a precursor to ""Beautiful Criminal,"" the only track that hints at a new direction. It could be placed coherently on a Selena Gomez or Demi Lovato record, and I mean that with the utmost respect: Breaching the hull of mainstream pop, where some of the most interesting musical innovations are being made, is a coveted skill. It boasts an instantly catchy hook, a memorable chorus and a world-weary quality that cuts through any traces of saccharine. The band have already announced a third album in the works, and if they continue in this vein, it could definitely help push them beyond a niche that can no longer seem to support them.</p></div>"|21443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21443-empire-underground-ep/|6.5|Cameron Cook

Cleaver and Walker, who also dated, wrote sharply about suburban malaise and domestic grievances, with a knack for unsentimental intimacy redolent of Rilo Kiley and <i>Secaucus</i>-era Wrens. A breakthrough of sorts came in 2012 with <i>Buckeye</i>, a career-spanning compilation blending spry country, poppy postpunk, wintry emo, and shabby folk-pop. A fan base grew in their native Ohio without threatening to break the levees, but 2014’s tentatively anthemic <i>Attica! </i>cast a wider net.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While hardly a volte-face, <i>Forever Sounds</i>, the quintet's sixth LP, is bleaker and more difficult than<i> </i>its predecessor. The album is full of darkly valiant shoegaze, swirly chords met by solos that send the narrator tumbling into the abyss. Despite the vast scale, there remains something resolutely midwestern in the delivery: Where dream-pop vocals tend to glide along with the music, Cleaver’s voice is small yet oratory, as if he has a fascinating story to tell but is startled by the volume of his microphone. Walker taps into a similar feeling–of ennui and passion constantly thwarting each other–but dials down the gravity further. On opener ""Dropping Houses,"" she sounds eerily subdued, ready to disintegrate in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> <i>Forever Sounds</i>, then, is the work of a band less interested in telling stories than smothering themselves in obscurity and noise. ""Donny’s Death Scene,"" with its prominent pedal steel and <i>Big Lebowski-</i>referencing story, concerns mundane personal failures being reconciled on an epic scale. Walker’s lyrics (""Donny’s fading in the bright, bowling alley lights,"" goes the chorus) give Steve Buscemi’s meek character the sendoff <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ezPvzKe5M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">John Goodman couldn’t</span></a>, but like much of the album, the abiding themes are as much a product of the music as the words.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s just as well, because the discernible lyrics, particularly Cleaver’s, are knottier than usual, and sometimes overwritten. Usually adept at incisive couplets, Cleaver seems preoccupied with sounding poetic on <i>Forever Sounds, </i>to mixed results: ""Who robbed the wishing well?/ Looks like there’s nothing coming true,"" from ""Better Days,"" is several degrees too precious. And on the psychedelically inclined ""Sidewalk Sale,"" he observes his muse ""sucking on a chili dog/ Out in the desert where the heat is hot,"" which is maybe a little heavy on the exposition, desert-wise.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thanks to its stately pace and generous decorative effects, the music is cozy enough to hibernate under. The words, while sometimes clumsy, can also be disarmingly poignant: On ""Hello, I’m a Ghost,"" Cleaver laments an ex-lover who’s ""undressed 700 more times and I’ve missed every one""; Walker sings, sweetly, ""It’s not your failed endeavour/ That lights up your name forever"" on ""Majestic-12."" Where Walker sings more naturally, with easier tones, Cleaver's shy, young-old voice is a reassuring presence beneath the music’s astral blanket. That they both sound overwhelmed by <i>Forever Sounds’</i> vast scale is in fact the record’s saving grace; as ever, Wussy’s proximity to ordinariness is precisely what makes them lovable.</span></p>

An EP could easily be a throwaway project–a place to store songs that didn't <i>quite</i> fit a proper full-length thematically or sonically. A mini-LP, though, connotes the same wholeness and completion as any given album, just shorter. At seven tracks and 24 minutes, Jennifer Lee's (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29291-tokimonsta/"">TOKiMONSTA</a>) <i>Fovere</i> is just that: a brief, rounded project that does not ask very much of its listener. With its quick runtime and tight structure, it is neither groundbreaking nor entirely lacking inspiration. Though prone to drift into the background, <i>Fovere</i> is certain, reliable, and mostly enjoyable. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A disciple of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/""><span>Flying Lotus</span></a><span> (and the first woman signed to his </span><a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Brainfeeder</span></a><span> label), Lee began her career as an L.A. beatmaker, content to get lost in her own universe of kicks, samples, and smooth instrumentals.

Then on 2014's mini-LP </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19858-tokimonsta-desiderium/"">Desiderium</a></i><span>, Lee began crafting songs with room for singers to perform. With that transition, her music gained some space, but lost the hip-hop-indebtedness of earlier work. The project was not particularly memorable, nor was it terribly distinct from that of other producers creating club-ready tracks that were still cool enough for solo listening. Not even a then-unheralded </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33213-andersonpaak/""><span>Anderson .Paak</span></a><span> made much of a lasting impression.</span></p>

It's tempting to read a lot into those words; in fact, it's tempting to delve deeply into everything about his latest release. Because when the promotionally frugal, preeminent thinking-person's rapper of a generation lets forth a largely unexpected collection of demos into a click economy of hot takes and broadcasted enthusiasm, the friction of opposites is enough to spark the kind of hopes that see meaning in <i>everything</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No other rapper has taken up so much real estate in the past 12 months while releasing so little music and sharing as little about themselves as Kendrick. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>TPAB</i></a>—a Grammy-winning ride of densely knotted rhymes, tangled ideas, and deep sounds—positioned Kendrick Lamar as a reluctant messiah figure, and its dialogues with self and manifestations of God resisted quick-and-easy unpacking. Now, he’s released a handful-and-a-half of song sketches in a project that's neither album nor mixtape (or even EP or LP), and seem to have even less a chance of radio play than <i>TPAB</i> did upon its arrival. But it feels like an extension of that album's world<span>—</span>an asterisk, perhaps, or an extended coda. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's little doubt that just about all of these songs are from <i>TPAB</i> sessions—""untitled 03,"" subtitled with a date of ""05.28.2013,"" had already been performed four months before <i>Butterfly</i>'s release, during the the long goodbye of ""The Colbert Report"" with help from Terrace Martin, Thundercat, Bilal, and Sonnymoon's Anna Wise. It's classic Kendrick—a reductive-yet-sprawling fever-chill of observations on race and the music industry that mixes stereotype with history and wisdom. It's insightful and uncomfortable, if not outright offensive: Asians are linked to Eastern philosophy, Native Americans to the land, Blacks to lust, whites to greed. It's also the collection's most fully-formed song; perhaps the only one that emerges as a finished thought here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the most enchanting things about this project is hearing how Kendrick manipulates his own voice before the studio modulations kick in. His vocal tics and morphs have long been technologically-aided affairs, but on ""untitled 02"" he's full of elastic long tails—partially gleeful Lil Wayne, wholly sanctifying choir sinner. He's crying for his bosses—both Top Dawg and God—while lamenting urban addiction and dysfunction, and contemplating mortality. ""World is going brazy/ Where did we go wrong?/ It's a tidal wave/ It's a thunderdome,"" he sing-raps, sounding half-possessed, half-saved. For the second half of the song, he includes the firestarter verse he performed in January on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" But the scorching iteration of that live performance is nowhere here—he's laid-back and matter-of-fact, but his threat just as heavy: ""I can put a rapper on life support/ Guarantee that's something none of you want.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times Kendrick is joined by other voices—TDE's Jay Rock and Punch, and Wise (again) on ""untitled 05,"" which sounds like a long jazz-groove session made just to find the best parts; Cee-Lo Green shows up over the bossa nova breeziness of Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammed's ""untitled 06""—but, much like <i>TPAB</i>, <i>untitled unmastered.</i> is unmistakably about Kendrick Lamar. The song he's jokingly creating on the back end of ""untitled 07"" shows up earlier as ""untitled 04,"" and its refrain is ""head is the answer/head is the future""—which may or may not be a multiple-entendre about sex, life and spirituality. Because Kendrick is so share-averse, goofy moments like these that would be filler on other projects have the revelatory power of a posthumous recording here. It's the kind of stuff you'd find out from other artists via their social media detritus—at the end of ""untitled 02"" he asks who's doing drums, sounding like a bona fide jazz cat complimenting Max Roach's stick work—but Kendrick has a verve for taking giant steps backwards into an era where masters let the music speak for itself. It all feels like a jazz project, but not just because he's using jazz music.</p>
<p>These numbers are packed with more information and moods than the 35-minute running time suggests. On ""untitled 01"" he dons his robes as God's servant, talking to the Supreme Being: ""[You] told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you/ [Don't] say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you, or tithe for you, or push the club to the side for you."" (If the song's subtitles are indeed dates of conception, this one—""8.19.2014.""—suggests that Kendrick was having conversations with God about the course of his album a full seven months before <i>TPAB</i> actually arrived.) In execution,<i> untitled unmastered.</i> is a complete inversion of Kanye West's recent <i>The Life of Pablo</i>—it's a small and quiet statement from an artist with little to prove at this moment. Its author tempts deeper reading, but his choices and the lack of entry points—no directional song titles, no grand proclamations, no promotion—leaving nothing to deal with but the music. As with <i>TPAB</i>, <i>untitled unmastered. </i>demands to be approached on its own terms, even when you don't know what those terms are. You can't say he didn't try for you, ride for you, or push the club to the side for you.</p></div>"|21705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21705-untitled-unmastered/|8.6|kris ex

It doesn't take a huge amount of observation or wokeness to notice: we're barely eight years off from the US's worst economy and <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/07/we-ve-been-on-the-wrong-track-since-1972.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most despairing polls in decades</a>, and the news cycle cuts atrocity with farce hourly. We <a href=""https://twitter.com/moochava/status/354986725388468224?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meme that we're in a cyberpunk dystopia</a> but are actually in the more banal sort, one less suited to blockbusters than slow declines. And winter – though <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/03/01/february_2016_s_shocking_global_warming_temperature_record.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">increasingly less wintry</a> – doesn't help, casting everything in a haze of seasonal affective despair.</p>
<p>Though hard to quantify, this national mood – despite perennial handwringing about the <a href=""http://whereistheprotestmusic.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">supposed lack of protest music</a> – tends to seep into art, and it's natural that artists might feel  compelled to address broader themes such as, to quote Poliça, ""social injustice, self-doubt and isolation, the rapidly increasing urban decline in gentrification."" Where the Minneapolis group's <i>Give Up the Ghost </i>and <i>Shulamith </i>were intensely personal – claustrophobic in the good way, the way that exposes every crevice of someone's innermost thoughts – <i>United Crushers </i>is equally political, but too exhausted to exactly work as a protest album so much as an album for when all the protest's been sapped out. ""Summer Please,"" a tumbleweed lilt drowned out by pitch-shifted glumness, forecasts the album's mood: immersed, psyche-first, in the crushing malaise of winter in a sick world.</p>
<p>What's curious is that this mostly isn't reflected in the music. Though not exactly a departure from Poliça's sound, <i>United Crushers</i>' arrangements are cleaner, far less dense, and often poppier. The Reznor-like ""Top Coat,"" built atop a massive, cyanide-soaked synth riff, is the successor to ""Very Cruel"" and ""Violent Games,"" but it is also the outlier. ""Lime Habit"" almost sparkles, as if spritzed by the titular fruit. ""Someway,"" with its brass stabs, comes off as an alternate-universe pop tune, and ""Baby Sucks"" alternate-universe disco. ""Lose You,"" though despondent in the lyric, is positively cheery. It takes a close read of the lyrics – and a <i>read</i>, because Leanagh's vocals remain characteristically processed and diffuse – to grasp most of the protest themes, but the lyrics are largely oblique.</p>
<p>While this works for tracks like ""Melting Block,"" a slice of decaying suburban life, things like police brutality are perhaps not topics to be oblique about at this particular moment in time. The most outright political track, ""Wedding,"" is overt and at times searing (""all the cops want in… saying hands up, the bullets in""), yet the otherwise-roundabout lyric and flat affect of its instrumentation leaves the track feeling curiously diffident, even indifferent, which was surely not the intended.</p>
<p><i>United Crushers </i>is far more successful when it continues to explore Poliça's foremost topic: human connection and the tolls it takes on a person. ""Lately,"" unlike much of the album, is a perfect synthesis of music and message: a love song by someone suspicious of love, with a synth lead that continually skews and hesitates. ""Kind"" doesn't portray a relationship breaking so much as slowly atrophying, and the track sounds well into doing the same. <i>United Crushers</i>' other preoccupation, and its most haunting, is the alienation of the music industry, how it turns people into quasi-public figures then leaves them to fate. ""I saw this record as my last chance,"" <a href=""http://diymag.com/2016/01/05/polica-interview-united-crushers-in-the-studio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leanagh told DIY Magazine</a>, and the subtext is most palpable on ""Baby Sucks (""giving you less with each note"") and ""Fish,"" the simplest track yet by far the most haunting. Over a ""Teardrop"" percussion riff and hi-hat twitch, Leanagh delivers an eleventh-hour ballad to a distant, unreachable audience ""You see me on the stage and you think I'm strong… you hold it over my head and you watch me fall."" It's among the loneliest pieces of music Poliça's ever recorded, and it's too good to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Poliça is a group with too much collected talent for that; as in life these days, one only waits and hopes the clouds will clear. </p></div>"|21526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21526-united-crushers/|6.6|Katherine St. Asaph

Fraud is a hip-hop classicist, spinning sample-based beats from jazz, soul and funk cuts, often over mellow, indica-drenched percussion. He handles all the production on the new DZA album, <i>He Has Risen</i>, assembling a deck of diamantine, jazzy cuts, the sort of beats that often get described as ""dusty"" but that glint and often dazzle when played.</p>
<p> Smoke DZA, a confident-if-scattershot rapper, has a history of being overtaken by his production. He announces on the opening track here that he’s done with being modest, and on the first couple of listens, it’s difficult to believe him. Everything about his approach, from the low-key mobster shoutouts on “<span id=""docs-internal-guid-8ef4b4b6-52f9-952b-f4b3-fd90d76e6459""><span>Badabing’s Theme</span></span>” to the consistent recitation of his smoker’s credentials, signals low stakes. The Harlem rapper’s go-to boast is calling himself Kush God, about the least ambitious superlative imaginable.</p>
<p>DZA’s low-stress attitude functions as a smokescreen, concealing the high quality of <i>He Has Risen, </i>which slowly sneaks up on you. There’s chaff here, though it’s buoyed by the cigar-lounge cool of Fraud’s beats. But on several songs, the Harlemite rises to a level we’ve not seen from him in previous runs, where he’s been content to stay in the lane of the alternately tough-talking and wisecracking stoner. On “The Plot,” he sheds that veneer for real poeticism, evoking a world of “card swipers"" and “con artists” where criminality saturates the atmosphere. “Morningside Sunset” is driven by observation-laden bars layered over insolent sax lines, as DZA adds singular details (buying someone a prosthetic leg) to the familiar painting of a kingpin’s life. The closest DZA has ever come to this level of achievement was his 2014 album <i>Dream.Zone.Achieve. </i>But that project featured 21 tracks and almost as many producers. By contrast, <i>He Has Risen</i> is focused, digestible, and perfectly paced.</p>
<p> Make no mistake though; much of this stuff would fall flat without Fraud’s atmospherics. Squeaky brass lines on “Heard Dat” leave the track ringing in your head, while “It’s Real,” a collaboration with The Alchemist, fills negative space with a droning chorus of voices. DZA, like many latter-day New York rappers, is a mild eccentric steeped in too many traditions. Beats like these help him forget what he knows, stretching himself to stranger observations, to broader song concepts. The strange contours of Fraud’s beats on <i>He Has Risen</i> move him off the comfortable grid and onto new terrain.</p></div>"|21643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21643-he-has-risen/|6.9|Jonah Bromwich

Born from the solo project of lead singer Kristine Leschper, Mothers found its niche in the arts-saturated community of Athens, GA. Their debut is composed of only eight songs, but it covers a surprising amount of emotional ground in that short time.  Perhaps, it’s because the songs have had some time to sink in with Leschper and co.: <i>When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired</i> was written while Leschper was finishing art school two years ago and she later fleshed them out with band member Matthew Andregg.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With her high, haunted cries, Leschper evokes singer-songwriters Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten. The music runs from the delicacy of single tiny mandolin (on ""Too Small For Eyes"") to billowing, unhurried full-band roots rock (""It Hurts Until It Doesn't,"" ""Copper Mines""), but Leschper's struggles to move past two broken relationships<span>—</span>one with her lover, one with herself<span>—</span>give the album a powerful undertow. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Leschper's trembling voice often breaks into wails, ones that feel like longing stares. On opener ""Too Small For Eyes,"" she sings ""I hate my body, I love your taste/Bird stirring in my chest, you give and take away."" It’s a harsh truth to begin an album with: the idea of someone not giving you what you want or need, and the crippling analysis that comes from acknowledging it. ""I've buried you in compromise/Never mind, never mind never mind,"" she howls on ""Copper Mines,"" the song's pace quickening like an encroaching panic attack.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the agitation and raw nerves, the album feels like a therapeutic offering. The album sequencing traces an uphill battle alongside Leschper as she identifies her insecurities and musters the inner strength to fight against them. The lovedrunk lullabye ""Nesting Behavior,"" arriving at the midpoint, feels like a hard-fought breath of contentment, scored by a sawing fiddle and weeping cello. But there is a sickly pall to the song, and to Leschper's broken-yodel delivery, that gives the song an ominous tinge: ""You always made it easy/Reminding me not to bloom,"" are her parting words on the song, a harbinger of rot and death.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album title feels wistful in context, an admission of exhaustion and an invitation to join the journey that led there. ""You love me mostly when I’m leaving"" she sings next on ""Lockjaw,"" as she flippantly dismisses the idea of any reconciliation with a lover and deals with her own ego. On grand finale ""Hold Your Own Hand,"" we’re left with Leschper finding relief while floating through a late-night waltz. The melodic prog-rock fade-out of the song even reflects something Leschper utterly lacking elsewhere on the record: hope. It’s Leschper’s attempt to find strength through storytelling, and she is so transparent on <i>When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired</i> that you find yourself rooting for her. </p></div>"|21486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21486-when-you-walk-a-long-distance-you-are-tired/|7.1|Ilana Kaplan

Listening to <i>Blue Cheese</i>, his first North American release, feels like that hungover moment on a Sunday morning when you have to summon all your strength to hurl yourself out of bed and over to the bathroom. In the same way you might want to award yourself a medal for making it there without puking in the hallway, <i>Blue Cheese</i>'s tousled charm has a way of making modest acts seem heroic.</p>
<p><i>Blue Cheese</i> was recorded by Strang while house-sitting his parents’ house, but it’s hardly a reservoir of sensitive, singer-songwriterly introspection. Rather, it’s the sound of a young, restless soul taking full advantage of the empty environs by making an inspired racket and broadcasting his innermost musings to no one in particular. Kane Strang isn't just this guy's name, it's also a handily onomatopoetic descriptin of the odd jangle of his guitar. Strang actually plays all the instruments here, a fact betrayed by the sludgy, rumbling bass lines, the lumbering, drum machines, and the one-finger synths that feel like placeholders for the brass and string sections he can’t yet afford. </p>
<p>And though <i>Blue Cheese</i> is being billed as a proper debut in the wake of 2013’s demos collection, <i>A Pebble and a Paper Crane</i>, a certain slapdash aesthetic remains: songs have a tendency cut out before they even reach a chorus, and the uniformity of their sound, arrangements, and temperament suggests it was all cranked out sequentially in a single session, with the console settings untouched from one song to the next. Over its brief 28-minute run time, there are moments when you’ll be itching for a change of scenery, but Strang has a gift for pulling diamonds from the rough, and he’s careful not to let his winsome voice and finely cut melodies get overwhelmed by their surroundings.</p>
<p>In his most inspired moments, Strang comes off like Panda Bear doing a one-man garage-band remount of Pixies slow jams. He shares both acts' penchant for twisting innocent sing-alongs into bizarro meditations: On the surface, ""The Web"" is an optimistic, wide-eyed ode to blossoming romance, but it soon becomes clear Strang’s paramour is an online connection he’s never met IRL. He never quite works up a sweat—even the album’s lone rave-up ""Never Kissed a Blonde"" is more of a wallow  than a romp. As per its DIY design, this album is about doing what you can with what you've got. But like the unattainable women Strang is fond of serenading, the album’s pop potential leaves you imagining all that could be under different circumstances.</p></div>"|21623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21623-blue-cheese/|6.6|Stuart Berman

The 2012 cut was the acclaimed Scottish composer's first mainstream release after nearly two decades in the classical world, where her adventurous work often met with sedentary audiences who were polite at best, and<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/23/anna-meredith-on-classical-music-art-and-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> openly contemptuous at worst</a>. The track's imperious brass fanfares, artillery-fire percussion, and earth-quaking bass seemed designed to pummel and intimidate listeners. The song was so monstrous in scale that the EP it helmed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/""><i>Black Prince Fury</i></a>, and 2013's follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18393-anna-meredith-jet-black-raider-ep/""><i>Jet Black Raider</i></a>, trembled a bit in its wake, like going from a Jeff Koons or Louise Bourgeois sculpture to a roomful of sketches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The track won Meredith the response she was after, but her prospective debut album kept getting put on the back-burner in favor of paid commissions. Almost four years later, <i>Varmints</i> also opens with ""Nautilus,"" and actually lives up to its huge opening gambit. Meredith's electronic work has often drawn from the soundtracks and sci-fi iconography of classic arcade games, and her EPs often stuck within their characteristic limited polyphony. Here, blending synthesizers with acoustic instrumentation, she makes those 8-bit quests and battles feel completely visceral and real, as if you're strapped in her spaceship's sidecar as she goes rampaging around the universe. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Although Meredith wanted to escape the concert hall's stuffier conventions, <i>Varmints</i> still exploits every inch of these rooms' dynamic range, from womping bass and juddering low-end to piercing, starry heights. (It's important to point out that she's not abandoning her day job as a composer.) Her trademark as an arranger is intensely detailed maximalism, but with a keen sense of pop phrasing that keeps things limber, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2705-max-tundra/"">Max Tundra</a> before her, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10225-mirrored/""><i>Mirrored</i></a>. Matching ""Nautilus"" for pure muscle is ""R-Type,"" a mass of screaming arpeggios that evokes the do-or-die auto-fire moments of a classic intergalactic shoot'em-up's final level. ""The Vapours"" is equally bonkers, and sounds like a roomful of overheated machines on the precipice of exploding, while ""Shill"" thrashes like a herd of angry bull elephants romping in a lake.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Meredith knows the pleasure that can come from pushing a little bit <i>too</i> hard, and the record's few low-key, borderline-ambient instrumentals (""Honeyed Words,"" the lovely closer ""Blackfriars"") serve as welcome respites from the madness. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-7a52b66b-4364-1908-3987-f9d672df6317""><span>Meredith is equally capable of subtler assaults, which she wages with miraculous and exhilarating builds: </span></span>""Scrimshaw"" starts out sounding melancholy and graceful eventually bursts into an unrelenting cosmic endorphin rush. On ""Last Rose,"" Her plaintive, piercing vocals intensify the song's sense of loss. Her crescendos don't always lead to a drop, but she makes you feel the hunger in every one.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of these skills feel like they could serve as key ingredients of great pop songs, and, wouldn't you know it, Meredith can write those, too. The three here seem to deal with the various stages of a break-up: ""Taken"" feels like ""R-Type""'s more muted sibling, driven not by brute force but Meredith and collaborator Jack Ross' confident  ""yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh"" chorus and a skittish bass line. With different production, ""Something Helpful"" could be a massive rave-up; as it is, Meredith strips out most of the low end and spins it into a sweet and unguarded ultimatum.

So when the Spanish musician born Pablo Díaz-Reixa says that his latest album was inspired by a visit to Hiper Asia, a chain of sprawling dollar stores in Madrid that carry beads, baubles, doodads, tchotchkes, trinkets, bric-a-brac, and all manner of climate-warming, air-polluting, late-capitalist gimcrackery, you can guess what pricked his senses so. The rush of all that plastic, all those shiny surfaces; the accidental and tragic beauty of all that useless crap.</p>
<p>El Guincho was way off his album cycle at the time. His last album, <i>Pop Negro</i>, had come out in 2010. In the years since, he ended his contract with Young Turks, left Barcelona for his birthplace, the Canary Islands, to care for his mother, who was dying of lung cancer, and, following her death and a subsequent breakup with his girlfriend, moved to Madrid in search of a new direction. When the epiphany washed over him in those fluorescent-lit aisles, he scrapped the album he had been working on, which he has <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2016/02/el-guincho-interview-new-album-hiper-asia/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described</a> as a set of bass-heavy tracks in the Night Slugs vein, and set about translating Hiper Asia's sensational surfeit into song.</p>
<p>The resulting album, the most resolutely electronic work he's done yet, buzzes like an ice-cream headache: His voice is slathered with Melodyne's pitch-correction software, and he sings in strange, sing-song cadences whose melody and rhythm seem less like songwriting than the byproduct of algorithmic processes. His beats bob between the lurching rhythms of the L.A. beat scene, the snap of dancehall and reggaetón, and the shuddering, double-time pulses of jungle and footwork, and his synths recall both <span id=""docs-internal-guid-45b94dac-4345-b762-2f10-dbed22fac892""><span>Dâm-Funk</span></span>'s fat, augmented chords and Rustie's dynamics-squashing compressors. The way jagged samples are shoehorned into the mix is reminiscent, at times, of the Bomb Squad—or a tropical take on them, anyway, like an MPC that's sticky with mango and <a href=""http://www.yoamocanarias.com/receta-del-autentico-mojo-canario/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mojo</a>. Touch down almost anywhere on the record, and you'll discover details that trigger a hair-raising rush of sensation—brittle 909 snare rolls, crystalline choirs, video-game melodies, and basslines that reach frequencies most indie-electronic fusions never knew existed.</p>
<p>Like its namesake, however, <i>Hiperasia </i>sprawls. The melodies that give early tracks like ""Rotu Seco"" and ""Cómix"" their sugary kick soon turn syrupy and heavy and undifferentiated; tracks just four minutes long can seem eternal. Spanish speakers will have an edge on other listeners, because the lyrics' wordplay and surrealistic vignettes extend the songs' staying power. Some feel like riddles outsiders aren't expected, or even intended, to crack: ""Stena Drillmax,"" named after a brand of oil-drilling ship, juggles images of drones and chemtrails with a lover's lips. But scrape away all the glitter and there are moments of real pathos: ""Sega"" closes with the brutal couplet, ""You thought your father loved you/ But it was all a joke.""</p>
<p>The title song, a tribute to the retail emporium that gave the album its name and shape, asks, ""How do you get so much heart into a cement box?"" But the real key to the album's muchness might be ""Abdi,"" in which Díax-Reixas reminisces about his teenage years, shoplifting from electronics stores and then sitting on a park bench with a friend, listening to hardcore on his Walkman. His voice is squished and metallic and tinny, like something coming out of an old FM radio. ""That was a big deal for me,"" he sings. ""I know it wasn't for everyone."" In the dime store of his imagination, the shelves are stuffed so full, and stacked so high, that half the treasure is out of reach; only he can get to it. But even to the casual observer, it still sparkles brightly, and—in small doses, anyway—alluringly. </p></div>"|21603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21603-hiperasia/|6.8|Philip Sherburne

From her winsome 2008 debut onward, twee has given way to twitch, her formative folksiness gradually overpowered by funk. And with that shift, her lyrical focus has turned less contemplative and more communal, with her 2013 album, <i>We the Common</i>, inspired by her advocacy work for imprisoned women in California.</p>
<p>But her fourth album, <i>A Man Alive!</i>, is something of a full-circle move. Built from the bottom end on up, it's Nguyen's most rhythmically robust, gleefully discordant release to date. It also marks a return to the more self-analytical approach of her earliest efforts, yielding her most candid songwriting yet. These two approaches never feel at odds with each other somehow, and instead, <i>A Man Alive! </i>reinforces the symbiotic relationship between personal trauma and ecstatic physical release. </p>
<p>Guiding Nguyen through this process is her friend and occasional collaborator <span id=""docs-internal-guid-457b085c-434e-4902-e1c3-fcc9a5a0deb1""><span>Merrill Garbus (a.k.a. tUnE-yArDs)</span></span>, who's credited as the album's producer. However, her approach is more like a remixer, as she playfully manipulates the band's constituent elements and amplifies their irreverent qualities. At times, it recalls the Clinton-era alt-rock of The Breeders, Luscious Jackson, and Cibo Matto—bands that shot a distinctly female perspective on life and love through cut-and-paste productions and absurdist funk.</p>
<p>Nguyen and Garbus also share an ability to wade into messy, difficult conversations with poise and clarity. If the sound of <i>A Man Alive! </i>is informed by Garbus' unmistakable presence, lyrically, Nguyen is grappling with absence—specifically, that of her father, who abandoned her family at a young age. ""Half of all my blood in vain,"" she shouts amid the hand-clapped beat and acoustic shredding of ""Departure,"" channeling her pain into puns. Later, on ""Guts""—a cool-down strut sounds like its slinked off some mid-'70s Rickie Lee Jones record—she boldly declares, ""I've got the guts/ I don't need my blood."" The implication: It's one thing to mend a broken heart; it's quite another to extract your DNA. </p>
<p>If much of <i>A Man Alive!</i> sees Nguyen powering through her troubles with grace and groove to spare, she bravely lets her guard down on the tremolo-sparkled centerpiece ballad ""Millionaire,"" which hinges on a line that's both defiant and devastating in its simplicity: ""Oh daddy, I broke in a million pieces/ That makes you a millionaire."" Atop the blissful dub fadeout ""Endless Love,"" Nguyen sings, ""I've got an endless love/ no one can starve,"" before cheerfully adding this shockingly unsentimental rejoinder: ""I don't want it/ I don't want it/ Carve it on out of me."" The scar tissue on a healing heart inevitably hardens it, but <i>A Man Alive</i>'s great virtue is that Nguyen can still sound like she's having the time of her life even as she's recounting the darkest moments from it. </p></div>"|21415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21415-a-man-alive/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Surface noise, on vinyl or in real life, is the gnarly stuff that grounds each of us in reality and gives us a shared point of human commiseration. Jennifer O'Connor's <i>Surface Noise</i>, then, seems to be an effort reconciling the places in life that are rough around the edges. However, in her songs about handling love and fear on her sixth LP, O'Connor scrubs all the grit out of her own music, delivering a flat, fine record that never really gets out of its own way.</p>
<p>O'Connor's voice is pleasant and gentle, floating in a low-to-middle range and surrounded by warm instrumentation. The album as a whole feels tidy and timeless. The flip side of that coin, though, is that you feel like you've heard <i>Surface Noise</i> before even upon first listen. Stacked against other indie-inclined singer-songwriters of recent years, it would be tough to pick <i>Surface Noise</i> out of a lineup. The songs bleed into each other so seamlessly that it's easy to listen to half of the record without realizing you've done so.</p>
<p>The album moves at a painstakingly moderate pace. ""It's a Lie"" sounds as though it might hold something interesting as it kicks off with slightly scorched guitar riffs, but they're swiftly relegated to the background. Plenty of albums simmer gently with an even temper, but there's usually an undercurrent of intrigue: tension, anxiety, sadness, anticipation. Somehow, none of that makes its way into <i>Surface Noise</i>.</p>
<p>In the back half of the record, ""It's Gonna Get Worse"" breaks into a half-hearted peppy rhythm, but O'Connor's defeated tone as she sings a refrain of ""It's gonna get worse before it gets better"" gives little hope that anything will ever improve. The record certainly doesn't.  </p>
<p>Still, <i>Surface Noise</i> isn't a <i>bad</i> album by most definitions of the word. The instrumentation is tight and clean, and O'Connor's writing is direct. Together, these pieces make for a record that feels perfectly content, unburdened by hunger or ambition. But in its efforts to make sense of our collective earthly clamor, <i>Surface Noise</i> just feels like static.</p></div>"|21648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21648-surface-noise/|5.0|Allison Hussey

It’s a snug fit, the harp hogging all of the car’s square footage, leaving space for only one other passenger. Before she was collaborating with a legendary laundry list of artists (Sharon Van Etten, Kurt Vile, Thurston Moore, Jarvis Cocker, and Arcade Fire to name a few) she ferried the instrument to and from the odd gig, usually weddings, playing by herself, and leaving by herself. The experience of  travelling, practicing, and performing with the harp is an undeniably solitary one. And intimate doesn't feel like it does a good enough job of describing this relationship. Lattimore’s harp is more than just the wellspring for her art and her livelihood, but a life companion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In 2014 she was awarded a Pew Fellowship, so she and the harp decided to hitch up the station wagon and head out west. <i>At the Dam</i> is the travel journal of that meandering journey across the country, spread over 44 minutes and five songs. The album’s title was lifted from an essay in Joan Didion’s <i>The White Album</i> about the Hoover Dam. Lattimore tries her best to draw power from the staccato rhythms of Didion's sentences and the probing sensuality of her prose. While Lattimore never fully engenders that narcotic feeling of total surrender Didion felt on the 405, she comes close, rendering a landscape that is rich in memory and allusion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album was recorded mostly up and down the coast of Southern California from Santa Monica to Joshua Tree and also in Marfa, TX. All of the music was improvised, written in fragments, sculpted as the trip itself took shape. The opener, ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" started in Marfa, after Lattimore learned that her family’s blind and elderly black labrador Otis wandered into the wilderness outside their home in North Carolina to pass away. His body was never recovered, and the song recreates the scene of Otis’s final walk through a daisy chain of slyly processed sounds.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Otis"" sets the table for the album’s first half, which is a meditation on mourning and lingering memories. With her harp as the sole interlocutor, <span id=""docs-internal-guid-e092bc73-4324-1c4a-17a0-e644124fb7c5""><span> it’s quite a feat that Lattimore draws out such specific and poignant themes</span></span>.  ""Jimmy V,"" the track that follows ""Otis"" is dedicated to the late Jimmy Valvano, a charismatic basketball coach, famous for a life-affirming and courageous speech he gave at the 1993 ESPYs two months before his death. Somehow the tone of of these two songs is never wistful, the cloud of sizzles and pops that surround the harp are as familiar and therapeutic as an Alka-Seltzer pill being dropped into water. The grayness of mourning is colored in with the harp's dulcet sonic splatter. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>At the Dam</i>’s latter half is more concerned with explicit archiving—it’s obsessed with freezing transient or chance moments. ""The Quiet at Night,"" ""Jaxine Drive,"" and ""Ferris Wheel, January"" are environmental and diaristic, gentle accretions of sounds that bounce into each other, trail off into nooks and crannies, and bubble up towards unknown directions. Lattimore uses stray harp-string plucks to suggest the blips of a submarine’s radar throughout, a recurring touch that grounds the environment of these songs, giving shape to the world outside of the echo chamber Lattimore builds. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-e092bc73-4327-56b9-8d68-2984e2700860""><span>Her sneaky ability to morph sounds and playfully off-kilter sensibility </span></span>keeps the album from ever seeming fussy or needlessly ornate, always a risk with the harp.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music plods at times, but that somehow doesn't feel like a problem. The slowness can feel like a blessing.  As music critic Ben Ratliff has said, this kind of slowness ""invites reciprocity: it makes the listener want to fill the spaces with his own content."" The disjunctions and hiccups in the sound, a result of the dialogue between the harp and the digital effects, reminds me of converting old family VHS tapes to DVD, and how the degradation of analog technology coupled with the imperfection of digitization unexpectedly shifts how you remember those records. In some ways, Lattimore borrows from the same decaying spirit that defined William Basinski's <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>. On its face a seemingly modest project, <i>At the Dam</i> bursts with ambition and ideas, offering a meditation on the ever-evolving relationship Lattimore has to her instrument and the spaces she shares it with.</p></div>"|21624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21624-at-the-dam/|7.8|Kevin Lozano

The teen star was supposed to waltz into the Grammys, collect his ""Best New Artist"" trophy and dance triumphantly into the sunset. But instead, that award went to Spalding, the affable bassist with a bright smile and big Afro. In response, her Wikipedia page was vandalized, and the Recording Academy soon <a href=""https://www.sfcv.org/article/b6b-angry-musicians-protest-massive-changes-to-grammy-awards"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">changed its rules</a>, making it tougher for indie acts like Spalding to reach Grammy-level recognition. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The irony of this little episode is that Spalding never seemed to crave mainstream validation in the first place. She has established herself as an understated force in contemporary jazz and soul, skillfully walking the line between genres—just her and a trusty upright bass—crafting art that resonates with the older guard while maintaining a youthful exuberance. <span><span>She’s performed for the Obamas at the White House and, in the summer of 2011, I saw her perform at the Roots Picnic in Philadelphia, Pa. </span></span>There, she put fluid spins on Michael Jackson’s ""I Can’t Help It"" and the Weather Report’s ""Predator,"" playing electric bass with ?uestlove on drums. No matter where she plays, she projects the sort of self-contained ease that suggests she'd be equally content to play the local open mic. Following the release of 2012’s <i>Radio Music Society</i>, Spalding retreated to her native Portland, Ore., to de-stress from music industry pressures.<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6859134/esperanza-spalding-alter-ego-inspiration-new-album-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> She took two years off</a> to reconnect with her creative voice and regain some form of sanity. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Emily’s D+Evolution</i>, she’s reemerged emboldened. ""See this pretty girl, watch this pretty girl flow,"" Spalding asserts boldly at the top of ""Good Lava,"" the first track and mission statement. Using a dissonant guitar riff, thumping drums, and lurching time signature, it almost feels like a dare to stick around. The album has the feel of a nervy gauntlet throw, seething with the sort of ferocity that only comes from time spent alone, far away from the limelight. These are exuberant, confrontational songs, amplified in the same sort of rock/funk hybrid style that brings<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/""> Prince</a> and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/""> Janelle Monae</a> to mind. Gone is the Afro, replaced with long braids, wide-rimmed glasses, and ornate outfits.</p>
<p>Like other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/"">hugely popular musicians before her</a> who felt commercial pressures beginning to stunt their growth, Spalding has found an alter ego to speak to her more extroverted, creative side. Spalding sings through a muse named Emily, her middle name, though her reasons for doing so aren’t clear-cut. As a character, Emily wants you to buck the system, to fight for peace and tranquility. She wants you to reconnect with your spiritual center, to avoid facades. Emily ""is a spirit, or a being, or an aspect who I met, or became aware of,"" Spalding<a href=""http://www.npr.org/2016/01/08/462325734/esperanza-spalding-is-letting-emily-be-emily"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> recently told NPR</a>. ""I recognize that my job … is to be her arms and ears and voice and body."" As a child, Spalding was curious about acting and created scenarios using movement and dance. So ""in a sense,"" the musician recalled, ""I see it as a flashlight into the future."" </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The theatrical<i> D+Evolution</i> plays like the culmination of those childhood performances. Spalding's voice retains its warmth and nuance, but she’s thrown herself into these songs with a new gusto. Each song has its own identity, from the unbroken spoken-word flow preceding ""Ebony and Ivy,"" the fist-pumping call-and-response of ""Funk the Fear,"" and the opera-infused histrionics of ""I Want It Now."" Recorded in front of a small studio audience in Los Angeles, you can almost see Spalding act out these songs as the band—comprised of guitarist and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21105-stretch-music/""> Christian Scott</a> collaborator Matthew Stevens, producer/drummer<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17367-alone-together/""> Karriem Riggins</a>, and others—create thick textures that provide plenty of space for her.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">People will likely call this art-rock or performance art, but <i>D+Evolution</i> advocates an almost indescribable ethos. There are cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a> and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""> Flying Lotus</a> here, as well as nods to folk-rock, funk, and prog. Listening to ""Judas"" or ""Rest In Pleasure,"" you could imagine an alternate universe where the Dirty Projectors explored jazz fusion without too much effort, and the exuberant vocal whoops and dense arrangements won't faze tUnE-yArDs listeners. The harmonic language remains rooted in jazz, but like Emily herself, the music doesn’t seem to be ""from"" anywhere: It seems most concerned with establishing space, creating room for possibility. Even the more conventional songs like ""One,"" ""Noble Nobles"" and ""Unconditional Love"" feel expansive and rich.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This aesthetic, which doesn’t have a zip code, dovetails with the album’s overarching theme of personal freedom. On these songs, Spalding shrugs at societal constraints, urging you to ""live your life"" on the chorus of ""Funk the Fear"" and shed preconceived notions of who we're supposed to be. On ""One,"" she embraces emotion with brave uncertainty: ""I’m not lacking in love,"" she sings, ""not haunted by its pain … of romance, life’s given me enough, I can’t complain."" The lyrics are elusive at first, darting behind fast-moving songs and delivered in impressionistic, conversational bursts that recall the delivery of Joni Mitchell. But the fearless generosity behind them communicates itself loud and clear, and it's a spirit that animates the entire album. With it, Spalding has once again redefined an already singular career, dictating a vision entirely on her own terms. </p></div>"|21575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21575-emilys-devolution/|8.6|Marcus J.

The band was founded in the mid '90s as a sort of Flemish take on Britpop, only to trade grunge guitars for analog synths a few years later. Around the same time, founding members Stephen and David Dewaele began moonlighting as 2 Many DJs, whose mashup classic <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8228-as-heard-on-radio-soulwax-pt-2/"">As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2</a></i> introduced electroclash <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/arts/music-year-review-critics-10-best-albums-somber-anthems-loose-limbed-funk-536890.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to the masses</a> and featured, among other things, a conflagration of The Stooges ""No Fun"" and Salt 'n Pepa's ""Push It."" (Just think: this was four years before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9208-night-ripper/"">Night Ripper</a>.) Soulwax eventually became more or less synonymous with its side project, as the group remixed fellow dance punk acts like LCD Soundsystem and weirdly — and most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7840-nite-versions/"">successfully</a> — their own material, with 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7840-nite-versions/"">Nite Versions</a></i>. During their most active period, Soulwax had an uncanny ability to stay on trend, seeming to predict mashup culture, European electro and big-tent EDM consecutively. Today, you could either laud them for their foresight or accuse them of carpetbagging, but it'd be wrong to undersell just how influential they were at their peak.</p>
<div><span>Lately, though, the band has kept a lower profile, occupying themselves with their </span><a href=""http://www.2manydjs.com/?page=radiosoulwax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radio Soulwax</a><span> project, programming a Grand Theft Auto <a href=""http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Soulwax_FM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">radio station</a></span><span>, and laying down the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61112-soulwax-remix-tame-impalas-let-it-happen/"" target=""_blank"">occasional remix</a>.</span> The Dewaele brothers' first LP in eleven years is actually a soundtrack to <i>Belgica</i>, a Belgian film by the Oscar-nominated director Felix Van Groeningen about two brothers who run a hedonistic nightclub in Ghent, Soulwax's hometown. For the sixteen-track album, the band invented fifteen fictional personas, each with its own sound, aesthetic, and backstory that draw from different decades of club culture. <span>Genres range from Studio 1 reggae to indie rock, under pseudonyms like Burning Phlegm, White Virgins, and Noah's Dark. </span>(The Shitz do double duty – no pun intended.) That a band could attempt a project like this with such strict historical verisimilitude is a fascinating technical exercise; the fact that many of these songs are actually decent is just an added bonus.</div>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album opens with ""The Best Thing,"" a synthpop track starring a vocalist named Charlotte, who plays the role of R&amp;B diva. ""You're the worst thing that always happens to me,"" she sings, over percolating synths. The effect is more Jessie Ware than Janet Jackson, but it's a decent pop song that sounds authentic enough to be an actual, if unremarkable, '90s single. Then it's on to The Shitz with ""How Long,"" a slab of angular indie rock ripped from the pages of <i>NME</i>. (RIYL: Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines). Listening to these two tracks together provides a good idea of what you're in for over the course of the album: disparate sounds stacked together in ways that make little sense outside the context of the movie they soundtrack. Sometimes it works: There's probably no reason why Turkish pop should play next to Italian electro</span><span>, but ""Çölde Kutup Ayisi"" and ""Ti Ricordi Di Me"" are legitimately enjoyable back-to-back</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Probably because it's closest to their ""real"" sound, Soulwax seem most comfortable when they mine club music for inspiration, which is pretty often. White Virgins' ""Turn Off The Lights,"" for instance, sounds a whole lot like Ladytron, which is to say it's a decent piece of chilly synth pop. Better still are Rubber Bands, whose bongo-driven disco jam ""Caoutchouc"" could be worked seamlessly into a 2 Many DJs mix. </span><i>Belgica </i><span>could be seen as the logical extension of what Soulwax has been doing for years, but what made ""Radio Soulwax"" and <i>Nite Visions</i> great was how the band holistically united various styles with little effort. Nothing felt overthought; it just worked. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Belgica</i><span>, however, somehow scans as both too varied and not varied enough. </span>Sure, it's interesting to hear Soulwax make hardcore punk with a dude from Sepultura (Burning Phlegm's ""Nothing""), but is that really what we want from the band's first new music in more than a decade? <span>In the end </span><i>Belgica</i><span> sounds like what it is: an impressive exercise in musicology that never quite transcends its core concept. <span>Soulwax deserve to be celebrated for their ambition and their enormous contribution to the film, but let's hope the next Soulwax album is a Soulwax album.</span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;""><span><br/></span></span></span></p></div>"|21682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21682-belgica-original-soundtrack/|6.2|Nathan Reese

The touch it takes to make an electric guitar sing is unbelievably light, and there’s a strap to hold it in place. Violinists (and violists and string bassists, for that matter) not only must hold a not-insignificantly heavy wooden body up for an extended period of time, they also have to maintain a steady bowing arm and pivot carefully to maintain control of the sound. Composer and violinist Sarah Neufeld — a career-long touring and recording member of Arcade Fire — delivers her fair share of grimaces in the band’s energetic live show, and she’s clearly earning them.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In her compositions as a solo artist, the relentless physicality of her technique is part of the listening experience, and immediately central to its appeal. </span><span class=""s1"">In the short pieces that make up Neufeld’s latest album<i> The Ridge</i>, the sound of her bow moving frenetically back and forth across the bridge of her violin often settles into a blur. There is a sharp contradiction between the gossamer blocks of sound we hear, and the limber, near-constant motion that makes them possible. Neufeld presses down on the strings to create a whistle-like harmonic that surges in between notes and chords; it’s the violin equivalent of the otherworldly-sounding tones her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20289-colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/"">comrade-in-arms</a> Colin Stetson (who appears here playing lyricon) favors in his sax playing. Reverb and delay effects enhance the atmospheric effect of Neufeld’s playing, creating moments where sound seems to be coming from another room.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While Neufeld’s previous solo outing <i>Hero Brother</i> daringly explored the overlap between classical minimalism and regional American fiddling techniques, <i>The Ridge</i>’s musical vocabulary is more familiar and less transportive. </span>It starts unconvincingly with the title track, a piece of high-dramatic ""chamber rock"" which recalls the Arcade Fire-related instrumental unit Bell Orchestre in which Neufeld participated in during the '00s. Wringing out a few unsurprising chords for maximal self-importance, it’s a propulsive, amelodic piece which seems like it could work better on traditional rock instruments, or with a denser ensemble.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Neufeld largely avoids linear melodies  — her feathery, very intermittent vocals add little in this regard — in favor of rhythmic cells in the Philip Glass tradition. Often, with the help of effects, these are reduced to synthetic-sounding pulsations. Like a good several-times-removed disciple of the minimalists, her writing is best when it revels in contradictory rhythms overlaid on top of each other -- when complexity is more of a focal point. The appealing, fractured Afrobeat cadence of ""We’ve Got a Lot"" gradually falls together like gears locking into place, and the explosive pizzicato of ""The Glow"" experiment with unsteady meter changes.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though compositionally <i>The Ridge</i> feels less exploratory than Neufield’s previous work, it is still a moving document of her engaging, virtuosic playing. It’s hard to make strings-based, indie-rock-tinged instrumental music in this vein sound fresh. But as in her past work, Neufeld’s focused, restless recordings invite the listener to share in the intensity of her ritual as a performer, creating a necessary and refreshing air of intimacy.</span></p></div>"|21569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21569-the-ridge/|6.9|Winston Cook-Wilson

In his speech, <a href=""https://youtu.be/e0e_29iKdIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Converting the Unconscious to the Conscious,""</a> the radical civil rights leader otherwise known as Stokely Carmichael goes on to say that, ""You can only win freedom on reason. Therefore […] The job of the conscious""—those who react on reason—""is to make the unconscious conscious."" These are also the opening remarks of Mikael Seifu’s latest EP, <i>Zelalem</i>, which is itself a quest for enlightenment and freedom.</p>
<p>""Zelalem"" translates to ""eternity"" in Amharic, and the cover of the EP depicts an infinity sign overlapping with a pair of eyes digitally rendered in the style of old Ethiopian Orthodox Church paintings. It’s also an accurate description of the Addis producer’s musical ethos. The 28-year-old makes what he and his peers call ""Ethiopiyawi Electronic,"" which crosses Ethiopian folk and religious traditions with electronica. Seifu’s particular take recalls something of the experimental ingenuity of Mexico City collective NAAFI, with a profound respect for his own city’s historic and sonic pulse. In the past, Seifu has often used UK garage as a rhythmic template (see: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/1432-r/mikael-seifu-tuff-ruff"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Tuff Ruff,""</span></a> 2015’s <a href=""https://mikaelseifu.bandcamp.com/album/the-lost-drum-beat-digital-single"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>The Lost Drum Beat</i></span></a><i>, </i>parts of 2014’s <a href=""https://mikaelseifu.bandcamp.com/album/yarada-lij-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Yarada Lij</i></span></a> EP), but <i>Zelalem</i> moves more freely, untethered to any one temporal structure. It collapses not only the past and the present, but also different sacred and secular music forms, and, importantly, the artist’s inner and outer worlds.</p>
<p>In the first half of the five-track EP, we literally hear Seifu's focus shift from the physical world around him to the murkier one inside. ""The Solipsist"" opens with anonymous, monochromatic cafe chatter: ""<i>En'ne'NE'ga'ger, En'ne'NE'ga'ger, En'ne'NE'ga'ger</i>""—""Let’s talk, let’s talk, let’s talk."" A bass player warms up nearby, and street sounds tumble in whenever the door swishes open. Slowly, in a sort of drawn-out Proustian moment, the artist’s past rises to meet him: a low liturgical drone emerges as if from thin air; a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNIrWwFkxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">krar</a> (lyre) melody bubbles to the surface; his reverie thickens; and the listener sinks in deeper with him. </p>
<p>So it comes as something of a shock when Seifu breaks the mood on ""Soul Manifest (ft. L.A.)"" with a dramatized soliloquy: ""It was all a dream/ It was all a dream,"" he intones. ""Released from the wonders of strife/ I wander through your might/ Beginning to see the light/ I stop to wonder…"" These musings help give listeners a narrative to latch on to, but Seifu already does such a vivid job of creating this dream state, that the speechifying instead comes off as heavy-handed. Luckily, the moment itself becomes a distant memory in the wake of the tizita that follows, which is as tender as it is ardent. A tizita is a song of love, longing, and nostalgia, and Seifu’s reimagining of the popular song form acts like a portal that opens up yet another emotional dimension for him<span>.</span></p>
<p>That sense of illumination is the focus of the EP’s front half, but it is on the back half that these various spaces and memories reach critical mass, imploding and consequently expanding the scope of Seifu’s musical universe<span>.</span> On ""How to Save a Life (Vector of Eternity),"" a bowed one-string mesenqo saws through a wall of kebero drumming and rattling shakers. Flecks of washint flute catch light among colorful washes of synth. On title track and closer ""<span>ዘላለም</span> (Vector of Light)<span>,</span>"" everything comes to a head. Voices chant and exalt in wide sweeping arcs punctuated by sharp hiccuping breaths, marked by insistent repetition. At the very end, the mesenqo from earlier returns, careening into a clanging pile-up that sounds not unlike an accordion being exorcized—in the best way. The whole track, like the EP, feels like a rite of passage. But rather than landing upright, transformed yet somehow unscathed, its architect disappears into the ether, already off through the next portal to another dimension somewhere closer to freedom. </p></div>"|21534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21534-zelalem/|7.4|Minna Zhou

Take Yndi Halda, from Brighton, England. <span>They completely ignored that old rock aphorism that ""you have your whole life to make your first album and six months to make the second."" Nearly a decade after their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10131-enjoy-eternal-bliss/"" target=""_blank""><i>Enjoy Eternal Bliss</i></a>, the band are finally releasing their second LP. But post-rock bands do have their own set of boxes to check off albeit ones that are slightly more specific. Twinkling guitar and bass harmonics? Present! Songs that sprawl uniformly over ten minutes? Absolutely! Moments of quiet that build toward overwrought crescendos? Just look at the wavelengths of these songs on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/yndihalda"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SoundCloud</a>!</span></p>
<p>Although these traits are all present on <i>Under Summer</i>, they are used sparingly, alongside new aspirations of a band who are clearly challenging themselves and the very conventions of post-rock. Like its predecessor, <i>Under Summer</i> contains only four songs, each more than 10 minutes in length with distinct movements. The elegiac violin that created a niche for the band with the first album is still here too. But the biggest difference is the appearance of vocals, and not just the <a href=""https://youtu.be/pgwLMojiw7U?t=14m38s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">choral la-la placeholders</a> of <i>Enjoy Eternal Bliss</i>. The lyrics here are mostly outdoorsy and naturalistic, with moments of powerful simplicity.</p>
<p>But there are also occasional dropped articles—""We sneak out at night, in time with owl cry""—and crammed syllables. This occasional awkwardness is the only aspect of <i>Under Summer</i> that feels tentative. A heartfelt line like, ""It's something I know, not just something I believe,"" on <i>Under Summer</i>'s final track, ""This Very Flight,"" should sting with spiritual conviction, especially alongside the orchestral intensity of the moment, but the line is delivered demurely like they don't trust the importance of what they're saying.</p>
<p>Yndi Halda's growth shouldn't simply be measured by the fact that they're singing now, though. <i>Enjoy Eternal Bliss</i> felt like a band studying the post-rock playbook, and its consciously mournful songs felt forced. Here they take more risks, like taking a sharp turn at what would have logically been a swelling crescendo on ""Helena,"" the album's sole instrumental number, and deciding to pull into a Fender Rhodes piano groove. Or using what sounds like a banjo and slide guitar. How very un-post-rock! And the last four minutes of the album are gently strummed major chords on an acoustic guitar accompanied by elementary—but nevertheless inspired—piano. With a more adventurous spirit and less rigid adherence to rules than its precursor, this album seems more concerned with expressing feelings than manufacturing them.</p></div>"|21613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21613-under-summer/|6.0|Pat Healy

There are few to zero significant aberrations in the Kentucky-born country singer's 55-strong discography; no arranger or producer (admittedly, she mostly stuck with <a href=""http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/owen-bradley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the same one</a>) has ever managed to obfuscate her deeply ingrained musical personality, which is always a little bigger than the specific song she is singing. Most of her albums<span>—</span>her last, 2004's Jack White-produced <i>Van Lear Rose,</i> being the primary outlier<span>—</span>only feature three or four of her much-remarked-upon originals, and her latest, <i>Full Circle</i>, is no exception. As always, the unmistakable, self-assured perspective of her original music is present in her delivery of others' material, making her able to breathe new life into songs country fans have heard dozens of times.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are countless popular-music legacy figures out there who continue to tour and record every five years, even though they are millionaires several times over, seemingly out of habit or because they don't know what else to do. Sometimes they do so in flagrant opposition to doctor's orders, and we're left with trails of YouTube documentation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqAwTRhBvg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocal</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqsRHE5cvU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deterioration</a>. The situation couldn't be more different for the equally persistent 83-year-old Lynn, whose voice remains miraculously well-preserved. Its slight fluctuations are commensurate with her age and a lifetime of ardent performing, relatively untouched by overexertion or hard living (Lynn has always <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6844260/loretta-lynn-full-circle-plans-to-keep-working?utm_source=twitter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prided herself</a> on staying well away from that). Throughout <i>Full Circle</i>, she often hovers in the airier middle range on her voice, choosing her throaty power notes wisely.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This elegant and tenuous note in her singing provides a new poignance. Her slight, ribboning strains of vibrato make the revisits of earlier hits included here<span>—</span>""Fist City"" and ""Whispering Sea,"" the B-side from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgE-gwZDbb0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her first single</a><span>—</span>feel like meaningful recastings rather than retreads. Stripped of golden-era Nashville glitz, they affectionately and winkingly recall of the attitude that made Lynn an instant anomaly and sensation when her first records hit radio circulation at the dawn of the 1960s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Full Circle</i>'s covers also reflect back on Lynn's past. ""Always On My Mind"" was a cross-genre hit for soul-disco diva Gwen McCrae before it became a standard for Elvis and Willie Nelson; here, Lynn presents the malleable song<span>—</span>a wistful portrait of a troubled-but-passionate relationship that ended as suddenly as it began<span>—</span>in the guise of country-gospel. Lynn's controversial amour fou relationship with her husband Oliver, or ""Doo,"" has been widely documented<span>—</span>most notoriously by Tommy Lee Jones in the popular 1980 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8I2cF51Npc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film adaptation</a> of Lynn's first memoir, <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Loretta-Lynn-Coal-Miners-Daughter/dp/0307741230"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coal Miner's Daughter</a><span>—</span></i>and one can't help but recall Lynn's many bittersweet descriptions of the marriage while listening. The ballad is the most affecting of several songs on <i>Full Circle</i> which find the narrator, with an air of finality, reflecting back on a life they lived as best they knew how. Others, like the distinctly modern Nelson duet ""Lay Me Down,"" directly contemplate mortality<span>—</span>in the context of this record, somewhat discomfitingly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If <i>Van Lear Rose</i> found Loretta making a bid at updating her sound, <i>Full Circle</i> finds her assembling a time capsule. The album is a snapshot, intimate and largely acoustic, and made to sound out of time. It's fitting that the record was realized with the assistance of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnfWoSQz3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carter Family</a> relative (co-producer John Carter Cash, son of June and Johnny), since the record marks the first time Lynn has recorded early Appalachian folk and country music. '50s and '60s Singer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKleTa94dC8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kitty Wells</a> is often cited, even by Lynn herself, as the direct inspiration for Lynn's combination of traditional ""mountain""-style singing and ""honky tonk"" C&amp;W; however, it's clear from listening to the two Carter Family tunes Lynn covers here the easy command she has on their more austere, folksong-influenced style. Lynn sounds just as natural singing these centuries-old melodies as her own. The upbeat ""Black Jack David,"" recorded by the Carters in 1940, turns out to be one of <i>Full Circle</i>'s most spirited vocal performances, and the lovelorn, Autoharp-driven ""I Never Will Marry"" its most moving.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-39fbd978-0711-844e-cbf8-df3c61117c17""><span>However, you don't need to appreciate the lineage of the music, or know anything about Lynn's life or career, to sense the breadth of time and musical tradition reflected here. Lynn's deft phrasing and bold delivery, which has influenced several generations of country-pop singers from Linda Ronstadt to Reba McEntire to Miranda Lambert, is sustenance enough. Only a interpreter as shrewd and tasteful as Loretta Lynn could find the inherent commonalities in these songs, and make a grab-bag late-late-career album like this feel not only emotionally grounded, but like a powerful choice. </span></span></p></div>"|21561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21561-full-circle/|8.0|Winston Cook-Wilson

Now imagine that it's more than 30 years later, you no longer have anything in common with your former comrades, and all anybody wants to hear from you is that one glorious burst of hormonal fury you came up with as alienated kids.</p>
<p>That's roughly the position in which Violent Femmes find themselves in 2016, as they release their first album of new material since 2000. Singer/guitarist Gordon Gano has <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/setting-aside-strife-milwaukees-violent-femmes-reborn-b99674230z1-370282691.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently noted</a> that he and bassist Brian Ritchie ""don't agree on most basic things"", which is putting it mildly: Ritchie sued Gano in 2007, and snapped that <a href=""http://onmilwaukee.com/music/articles/femmeschili2.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""it is his karma that he lost his songwriting ability many years ago""</a>. Original drummer Victor DeLorenzo rejoined the group when it reunited to play Coachella 2013, but quickly left, citing <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/victor-delorenzo-speaks-out-about-leaving-violent-femmes-b9955275z1-215664571.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""disrespect, dishonesty and greed""</a>.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, Gano, Ritchie and DeLorenzo's replacement, Dresden Dolls' Brian Viglione (who departed the group at the end of last year), managed to scrape together an album's worth of tunes. Some of them were resuscitated from demo tapes dating back to the era when that meant ""cassettes""; three were co-written by Gano and a handful of song doctors; ""What You Really Mean"" is a cover of a song by Gano's sister.</p>
<p>The charitable way to describe <i>We Can Do Anything</i> is that it's a back-to-basics record: ten brief songs in the band's most immediately recognizable idiom, with Gano singing and strumming with the twitchiness of a guilty teenager, Ritchie snapping strings like he's shooting rubber bands, and Viglione's brushes smacking the hell out of a single snare drum. A less charitable perspective is that it's a pale Silly Putty copy of <i>Violent Femmes</i>, with the vocal and instrumental tone reprised precisely from 33 years ago. It touches on all of the Femmes' familiar themes: masturbation (""Foothills""), Christian awe (""Holy Ghost""), lady troubles (""Big Car"", which starts as leaden double-entendre and becomes a leaden murder ballad in its final line). The closest thing to a deviation from the formula here is ""I Could Be Anything"", a beer-kegger polka (with accordion!) about a dragon-slaying hero, which seems like it's heading toward a narrative twist but never comes up with one.</p>
<p>Violent Femmes have spent most of their career in the shadow of their debut album. (On their 2014 tour, they played it in its entirety, and last year's gigs inevitably began with ""Blister in the Sun"" and ""Kiss Off"" and ended with ""Add It Up."") But they used to get some juice out of trying to get out from under it. The most memorable recordings of their subsequent career have been the biggest departures: the industrial fever-hallucination ""Machine"", the holy-rolling shock-skronk of ""Black Girls"", the in-your-face T. Rex cover ""Children of the Revolution."" They're not trying to pull off anything like that any more; instead, they're polishing up the durable façade of their signature sound, while the songwriting that it used to support has crumbled. </p></div>"|21574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21574-we-can-do-anything/|4.6|Douglas Wolk

<p>At the time, bands like Comets on Fire, Six Organs of Admittance, Dead Meadow, and OM were ascendant, drawing both from underground American noise music and vintage psychedelic rock. The music was familiar, but strange and extreme<span>—</span>drawing from the past, but not overly reverential of it. And then it just sort of passed out of view, with true believers continuing to plug away in a slightly diminished spotlight.</p>
<p>The members of Heron Oblivion made heavy creative contributions to that scene. Singer and drummer Meg Baird performed in Philadelphia-based folk collective Espers and released three solo records via Drag City. Ethan Miller and guitarist Noel Von Harmonson both played in Comets on Fire, while Miller also lead the breezier Comets offshoot, Howlin Rain. Second guitarist Charlie Saufley played in San Francisco’s Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound. In other words, their pedigree in this small world is without parallel.</p>
<p>Though there’s plenty of common ground, Heron Oblivion is, in a way, an unlikely alignment of talents. Baird’s previous projects were hushed and pastoral, while Comets were unhinged and explosive. It’s the ability to navigate between these two extremes that makes the quartet’s debut compelling. The songs slip easily between dynamics<span>—</span>harmony to dissonance, quiet to loud. Baird’s stripped-down drumming style prevents Miller<span>—</span>a guitarist, here relegated to bass duties in an effort to keep things fresh<span>—</span>from veering into choogling territory. A shared yen for searing fuzz tones keeps extended zone-outs lively.</p>
<p>Between Kurt Vile, Solar Motel, Endless Boogie, and Steve Gunn, there’s no shortage of excellent cosmic-sounding guitar music at the moment. But Heron Oblivion is an outlier— louder, spookier, and less optimistic. The songs are moody and dark, with clear moments of guitar solo-driven catharsis. In that regard, Heron Oblivion feel more indebted to the the original wave of cosmic guitar rock, the one that crested during the political ferment of the '60s. A long guitar solo, at that time, implied a certain spiritual heft, a yearning for transformation. There's a moment at the end of album closer ""Your Hollows"" where Baird's voice ascends and hovers on a single note, blurring into what sounds like a sustained guitar tone or delay trail.

But it's fortuitous that the album, with its viscous, reverberant swirls of reeds and violin, has the same dusky resonance as the <a href=""http://www.colourlovers.com/color/18515E/petrol_blue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">color</a>. If this is an album about Anenon's native Los Angeles, the setting is somewhere just past sundown, the sky steadily leeched of color as lines of cars streak toward the horizon like rivers full of embers.</p>
<p>Anenon is Brian Allen Simon, an electronic producer and saxophone player, and <i>Petrol</i> is his third album. It represents a major step forward for him. His debut, 2012's <i>Inner Hue</i>, evoked Tycho and the Field in its shimmering ambient sketches and crisp drums; 2014's <i>Sagrada</i> went further in its pursuit of a new kind of beat music composed using acoustic instruments, Fender Rhodes, and tons of reverb. <span>But its rhythms lacked distinction—""Lights and Rocks"" was basically an Aphex Twin pastiche, and the TR-808 sounds elsewhere on the album seemed out of place—while his saxophone melodies</span><b> </b>sometimes scanned as rote. But <i>Petrol, </i>a looser, messier album, does a better job of communicating new ideas, and its emotional depth feels less gestural and more genuine.</p>
<p>The album's raw material comes from an improvisation session alongside violinist Yvette Holzwarth and bass clarinetist Max Kaplan; back in his studio, working with the drummer Jon-Kyle Mohr, he reworked those tapes, cutting and resampling them into their final, hybrid electronic form. The opening ""Body"" is typical for the album, with cool, analog-style synthesizers and the humming of distant cars creating a buoyant cushion for Simon's melancholy saxophone riffing. The mood is evocative of Vangelis' <i>Blade Runner </i>soundtrack, but elsewhere things are less placid and misty-eyed; the drums on ""Once"" and ""CXP""  recreate the head-over-heels tumble of drum 'n' bass, inspiring greater urgency in Simon's sax work. ""Mouth"" and ""Petrol,"" meanwhile, bring to mind Philip Glass' work. Simon has described how the album was partly inspired by the experience of standing on a pedestrian walkway above the freeway—""I found a sense of Zen in that as I was making the record,"" he told the <a href=""https://uk.thefader.com/2016/01/20/anenon-interview-petrol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fader</a>—and it's easy to hear parallels between the spinning chrome wheels his music evokes and the sped-up <a href=""https://youtu.be/PirH8PADDgQ?t=1m21s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">industrial choreography</a> of the Glass-scored <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>.  </p>
<p>But some of the finest moments on <i>Petrol </i>turn out to be the simplest. ""Hinoki"" is nothing but two minutes of downcast sax melody over fathomless reverb, and ""Panes"" takes a similar idea and adds a bassline fashioned from bleating bass clarinet. In the first few seconds of ""Panes,"" a human voice is briefly audible—as far as I can make out, it says ""Maybe""—before it disappears into the murk again. It's the only voice on the album, but its appearance seems fitting; if <i>Petrol</i>'s twin themes are the way that cars and distance define the experience of Los Angeles, that snippet of speech is what creates a sense of human scale before the album's lonely denouement, when everything that has come before disappears beneath the din of freeway noise.</p></div>"|21512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21512-petrol/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

During the last decade, the adventurous band has explored the astral infinity of extreme psychedelia and the grim oblivion of extreme metal. As the name Oranssi Pazuzu (essentially ""orange demon"") suggests, the band’s sound was often an even split, with the two pieces of their musical personality meant to fit like complementary puzzle pieces. Even so, they were often referred to as a metal band, albeit one with some extracurricular interests, <i>Värähtelijä</i>, a 69-minute escapist escapade, should finally, fundamentally correct that misperception. </p>
<p>Heavy metal hasn’t disappeared from their sound. ""Havuluu,"" for instance, folds great, big, back-of-the-throat yells into its fuzz and, about halfway in, pivots on a blast beat and a ghastly scream that suggest Darkthrone. ""Lahja"" is powered by a Deep Purple proto-metal riff, and ""Hypnotisoitu Viharukous"" somehow fits stoner and thrash nods into the same five-minute span. More than ever, though, those roots lurk beneath the surface, acting as the foundation for a much more open-ended approach. Tilt your ears slightly, and the title track’s gray glow seems less like funeral doom with an accelerated pulse and more like narcotized Krautrock; imagine Harmonia succumbing to seasonal affective disorder. ""Lahja"" suggests a snippet of a grueling Swans marathon, with barked imprecations and martial drums pitted against sparkling vibraphone and guitars so free and bright they recall Sonny Sharrock. With <i>Värähtelijä</i>, Oranssi Pazuzu’s music has become a refraction of sorts, so that what you hear depends on your perspective—how you listen, what you bring to it, what you expect from it.</p>
<p>On 2013’s very good<i> Valonielu</i>, Oranssi Pazuzu seemed to strive to orchestrate its opposing impulses, to make them work together through relatively concise songs with discrete structures. You could almost imagine those tunes coming through the speakers of some large outdoor festival, like the aggressive Finnish answer to Sweden’s Dungen. Here, though, Oranssi Pazuzu show no such concern for restraint or expectation. The 17-minute ""Vasemman Käden Hierarkia"" feels like an album unto itself, brilliantly twisting between noise-rock outbursts and electric Miles allusions, distorted doom passages and sinister soundtrack references.</p>
<p>Typically, when bands dig themselves out of black metal pigeonholes (or, really, metal pigeonholes at large) and fold their ideas inside other, more accessible styles, worlds of possibility and popularity can open up. See, for instance, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9633-feeling-of-horror-the-dark-aura-of-swedens-tribulation/"" target=""_blank"">Tribulation’s own turn out of death metal basics</a> during the last two years or Deafheaven’s climb toward the light across its own half-decade. Oranssi Pazuza’s step out of metal, though, finds them burrowing deeper into a world of their own creation. <i>Värähtelijä </i>is a weird, grotesque record, where genres are superimposed on one another and where eccentric choices are the rule and not the exception. Yes, Oranssi Pazuzu is out of the old black metal box and lost—wonderfully, strangely—somewhere between heaven and hell.</p></div>"|21610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21610-varahtelija/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

You Pretty Things"" where Bowie and Mick Ronson perform as a duo, from the Japanese CD, and a previously unheard version of ""The Supermen,"" from March 1970, where he's backed by the Hype. It's tempting to assume the collection of his early BBC sessions is a posthumous cash-in, except that it was announced in December, three weeks before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/9786-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">Bowie's death</a>, thus making it a viable part of his beautifully choreographed stage exit. While the rush to winkle out clues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blackstar</i></a> in the wake of his passing felt a bit like pointing out how a magician does his tricks, it's worth asking why he pushed us toward these formative live sessions as he knew his life was coming to its end.</p>
<p>Simply put, perhaps it's nothing more than a show of gratitude toward an organization whose early belief in him never wavered (and whose publicly funded existence is always under threat from Britain's Conservative government). Bowie <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/01/23/464058516/john-peels-american-connection"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recalled</a> failing a 1965 audition to work with the BBC, who stated, in their classic patrician tone, ""'This vocalist is devoid of personality and sings all the wrong notes.'"" And yet they gave him another shot, as Bowie pointed out: ""So in your inimitable manner and with tremendous enthusiasm you got me back on for another audition, which I passed the second time around, which gave me freewheeling access to a lifetime of singing all the wrong notes.""</p>
<p>This four-LP collection spans Bowie's second-ever BBC session, in 1968, through to May 1972, after which he wouldn't record another until 1991. Rather than a sign of rupture, that 19-year gap is possibly an indirect result of the BBC's support: After Bowie performed ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v342TST9tFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Starman</a>"" on the network's ""Top of the Pops"" in July 1972, his fame rose enormously, leading him to America, tax exile in Switzerland and Germany, and into periods of immense productivity (and, of course, druggy preoccupations). Manager Tony DeFries may not have seen the point in having him do more sessions.</p>
<p>Yet in the early days, back when Bowie was still an earnest Anthony Newley wannabe whose career could never get seem to get off the ground, Auntie's arms were always there to scoop him up and give him another shot. His first chances came from John Peel, and from there he trickled down through Radio 1's primetime slots; by 1970, he was being given hour-long live appearances on the station. It's an appealingly linear type of progress, and a literal one, too; unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/"" target=""_blank""><i>Five Years</i></a> and other more carefully curated Bowie box sets, <i>Bowie at the Beeb</i> is an anatomy of how he became a rock star. </p>
<p>The first session here (and second, historically) was recorded for Peel in May 1968, and finds Bowie in romantic mode, though bigger ideas are taking shape: the swoony ""London Bye, Ta-Ta"" characterizes the influx of immigrant communities to London as two lovers who don't make it. ""Karma Man"" and ""Silly Boy Blue"" both deal with Buddhism, but the latter gives the very timely fixation a Bowie spin, as he empathizes with a monk who doesn't fit in with his community. By October 1969, there's been a perceptible shift in attitudes: ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" and ""Janine"" are tougher in sound and spirit.</p>
<p>Bowie's February 1970 session with the Tony Visconti Trio—aka the Hype—starts inauspiciously. He covers Jacques Brel's ""Amsterdam"" competently, and the acoustic ""God Knows I'm Good"" is a tedious ditty about a woman being caught shoplifting. But then comes ""The Width of a Circle,"" and Mick Ronson's first-ever performance with Bowie. Maybe the subtlety of their work together here is a sign of a tentative new relationship: Ronson's riff is much more muted and ingrained in the mix than it would be on record, but still gorgeous. Their dynamic picks up steam on ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,"" as Bowie's frustrations at the loss of his father preempt a brilliantly wiggy Ronson solo.</p>
<p>As David Cavanagh's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Good-Night-Riddance-Thirty-Five-Helped-ebook/dp/B011H5IGO8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456772975&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=david+cavanagh+john+peel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">excellent book</a> on John Peel's sessions points out, Bowie was hardly gigging even by 1971, when he had had a bona fide hit with ""Space Oddity"": ""He doesn't have a regular band, his albums don't sell, and he's prone to being in a state of artistic flux."" So the hour-long, June 1971 Radio 1 performance by David Bowie and Friends at London's Paris Theater was a huge showcase, preempting the release of <i>Hunky Dory</i> that December. Never mind the size of his ensemble, however; the highlight is a box-fresh, solo rendition of ""Kooks,"" played acoustically just four days after it was written to herald the birth of his son, Zowie.</p>
<p>Bowie always called himself a ""tasteful thief,"" and the permeability of his brain becomes clear on the third LP of the set, which deals with late 1971 and early 1972. Bowie had just returned from New York, where he met Andy Warhol, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a>. In early 1972, his covers of ""Waiting for the Man"" and ""White Light/White Heat"" are a little unconvincing, but no matter; the transformative experience has brought out a new ability in Bowie to really <i>sell</i> his own songs live as he never had before, ramping up his infectious, virile energy. You can hear the Spiders From Mars hitting their stride, and a lizardy streetwise quality appearing in Bowie's voice.</p>
<p>Of course, all this nascent rockstardom comes to a head in <i>The Rise and Fall of </i><i>Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars</i>, which Bowie previewed live on Radio 1 a month prior to release in June '72, across two separate sessions. By this point, ""Starman"" had been DJ Johnnie Walker's single of the week, which earned it daily plays, and allowed Bowie to delve a little further back into his catalog for hidden greatest hits: ""Space Oddity,"" and ""Changes,"" where Ronson transforms the original's hammered piano riff. But in the here and now, Bowie's ravishing yowl makes an early appearance on ""Moonage Daydream,"" and you hear him start to reach outward, beyond the intimacy of radio into the visceral performer he would become. His May 22, 1972 session ends with—what else—""Rock'n'Roll Suicide,"" the last song he would play live on the BBC for 19 years.</p>
<p>As ever, nothing was accidental. Beyond the vinyl reissue of <i>Bowie at the Beeb</i>, Bowie reached out to the BBC one last time before he died. His last round of Twitter follows included BBC 6Music and some of the station's flagship DJs (along with a cheeky parody account: God). The new music industry ecosystems mean that bands are no longer built up by single organizations in the same way that Bowie was by the BBC at the turn of the 1970s, which made the day of his death all the more remarkable. Like thousands of other Brits, I found out by listening to BBC 6Music DJs Shaun Keaveny and Matt Everitt <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvkamQ46J1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">announce the news</a> at 7:08 a.m. Although they were clearly grasping for words, Keaveny landed on the perfect summation of what happens when the value of patronage is recognized and repaid: ""David Bowie's music is an absolutely central tenet of what we do here at 6Music."" <i>Bowie at the Beeb</i> doesn't always make for essential listening, but it represents a foundational part of British culture, and upholds the importance of public broadcasting as a mutually beneficial relationship.</p></div>"|21558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21558-bowie-at-the-beeb/|8.0|Laura Snapes

It takes its title from a term coined by the architect Paolo Soleri, best known for Arizona's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/photo-galleries/9653-festival-for-the-future-form-arcosanti/"" target=""_blank"">Arcosanti</a> community, meant to describe architecture in balance with ecology. But the album's press release speaks of alien colonies and world-building, while its cover art features a cybernetic figure wearing what look like VR goggles; a cable extrudes from the back of his skull, <i>Matrix</i>-style. (Zoom in far enough, and you may also notice a peeing-Calvin decal adorning his jack—the influence, perhaps, of Daniel Lopatin, whose <a href=""https://softwarelabel.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software</a> label put out the record, and whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21108-garden-of-delete/"" target=""_blank"">last album</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> similarly grappled with science-fiction themes through the twin lenses of adolescence and trash-culture kitsch.)</p>
<p>But, as is the case with so much electronic music to have come before it, the sci-fi conceit also feels like a red herring. Thug Entrancer is Ryan McRyhew, a Denver-based musician who came up playing punky electronic music in the DIY scene around the city's Rhinoceropolis space before moving for a time to Chicago, where he discovered local staples like juke, footwork, and acid. His debut album, 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19067-thug-entrancer-death-after-life/"" target=""_blank""><i>Death After Life</i></a>, was a snapshot of his infatuation with those sounds as he acquainted himself with the mechanics of 160-BPM drum patterns and squirrelly 303 lines. Of <i>Arcology</i>, McRyhew says, ""The album title stems from the idea of a structure or object that is entirely self-sufficient and life-generating with little to no outside influence."" But that's precisely the opposite of how the album actually functions. <i>Arcology, </i>like its predecessor, is a genre study first and foremost, rearranging familiar elements according to McRyhew's own idiosyncratic vision.</p>
<p>Those elements haven't changed much since <i>Death After Life</i>; he's still preoccupied with frenetic drum-machine workouts and lyrical bass melodies, and he's still using classic pieces of kit like the Roland TR-808 and TB-303 (or, perhaps, plug-in simulators). But where his debut album was split mostly between flickering footwork tunes and, less successfully, sluggish slow-motion sketches, he's expanded the tempo range here, and in doing so he's opened up to a wealth of new ideas and moods. The early standouts ""Ghostless M.S."" and ""Arrakis"" boast gnarled, overdriven acid lines that really sing, along with hectic-yet-nimble drum programming.</p>
<p>McRyhew shows off his considerable sound-design chops on a handful of ambient cuts, like ""ROM"" and ""Low-Life"" and ""VR-Urge,"" that come closer to the otherworldly ideas supposedly underpinning the album. The finest thing here, ""Arcology,"" also functions like an ambient track, even though it ripples away at 150 beats per minute: Its keening synth melody recalls early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>, back when they still wore their hearts on their sleeves, but it's not directly derivative of anything or anyone. Its pinging, rustling background noises, meanwhile, sound like electronic imitations of running water. Formally, it is a picture of perfect balance, all its moving pieces in perfect synchronization with each other. Within the context of the album, it operates as a kind of clearing, an oasis, where the known universe falls away. If McRyhew really is interested in world-building, it is an excellent first stab at terraforming. </p></div>"|21585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21585-arcology/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

La Sera's fourth album, its first with singer/bassist Katy Goodman's husband Todd Wisenbaker officially on board, does itself at least one disservice with it, subtly highlighting that this is La Sera's most tentative-sounding outing. Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Adams</a> in the sole week he was able to spare from a <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-ryan-adams-bromance-led-to-1989-cover-classic-la-sera-lp-20151029"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demanding schedule</a>, <i>Music</i> finds the line separating ""casual-sounding"" from ""underbaked"" and plays hopscotch.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That concentrated week with Adams produced a coherent sound, one that cleaves to Adams' alt-country wheelhouse. At their best, the duo harnesses wavering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Ennio Morricone</a> guitar and pairs it with indie pop pathos. ""That's my mistake,"" Goodman allows mournfully in ""Begins to Rain,"" as duelling bright guitars whine. Yet Adams' whims might be responsible for some of the weaker inclinations of the record: ""I was certain that I could help her lose control a little bit more,"" he said of Goodman's vocal performance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He's done that, but it wasn't a favor. On jangling opener ""High Notes,"" Goodman's trill is less poised than we're accustomed to hearing. Whether losing purchase on a sustained note or dashing off the final syllables of a verse (""I'm sorry/ Is the song too slow?"" goes one breathless, ironic phrase), the ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a> bassist's warble feels thin and skittish. Instead of embodying the pursed-lips defiance of its lyrics, the song lands like a just-OK bet thrown onto the bar. The difference between the voice pushed beyond its limits here and its smooth nonchalance on 2012's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16511-sees-the-light/"" target=""_blank""><i> Sees the Light</i></a> or the breezy multitracked comings and goings on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15108-la-sera/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2011 LP</a> is noticeable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band still has a good feel for a certain kind of song: Wisenbaker's nimble, reverb'ed guitars and Goodman's coltish vocal line makes <i>Music</i> sound like nothing so much as the soundtrack to a '90s high-school dance. From the descending bluesy riff of ""I Need an Angel"" to the languid sway of ""Take My Heart,"" the best songs recall nervous sweat, skittish dancing, and hopeful heartbreak. A notable exception to this mood is ""Shadow of Your Love,"" which echoes hauntingly as if from a jukebox somewhere in Gene Pitney's West.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wisenbaker turns a few of the record's songs into duets, with mixed results. ""I would do anything for you to love me,"" he beseeches Goodman in ""Angel,"" a boy whose snarl disguises pain. The spurning-and-supplication interplay in this duet is fun, but the song peters out, turning the time-honored two-chord guitar outro into an extended shrug. In ""One True Love"" his singing battles his guitar low in the mix, bringing to mind the guy from accounts who doesn't really want to be at karaoke. By contrast, Goodman's angelic peal soars, her counterposition distant as a mirage.</p>
<p>As with the record's title, closing track, ""Too Little Too Late"" accidentally invites you to agree with the sentiment. Over simple, pretty arpeggiation, Goodman sings with assurance, finally settled and at ease. La Sera's experiment with a new musical direction, line-up, and producer is by no means a failure, but, being the product of a logistical opportunity, comes across as more like a short stop on the way to something more solid and definitive.</p></div>"|21583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21583-music-for-listening-to-music-to/|6.7|Estelle Tang

In those moments, it seems the world passes by while you sit in painful silence. It’s a common emotion, really; one you’re ashamed to admit, one that needs time to run its course. It seems rapper/producer Quelle Chris is going through something similar, if his recent work is an indicator: Last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20795-innocent-country/"" target=""_blank"">Innocent Country</a></i> briefly touched on his perceived personal insecurities, and his new instrumental album, <i>Lullabies for the Broken Brain</i>, carefully walks us through that despair using lo-fi drum breaks and spacious beat construction. Quelle’s production has always been unorthodox, yet <i>Lullabies</i> finds him pushing for something rooted in hip-hop, though it registers further away. This isn’t your average beat tape. <i>Lullabies</i> is made of divergent sounds, loosely built to set a pensive vibe shaded with desperation and hopelessness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As the title suggests, <i>Lullabies</i> is overtly nocturnal, full of dark, disjointed sounds and cosmic clatter. It comes together like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> instrumental project in the way certain songs aren’t fully formed, but they work well within the scope of the LP, making for a coherent suite to be played all at once. Many of these tracks don’t go much beyond a minute—except for ""M-39,"" ""Peace and Pain,"" ""I’m the Bridge You Must Burn,"" and a few others, which serve as some of the best work on Quelle’s album. Compared with 2012’s <i><a href=""https://quellechris.bandcamp.com/album/jock-sin-six-beat-tape"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jock Sin Six Beat Tape</a></i>, an edgy conceptual EP dealing with societal angst, <i>Lullabies</i> is a slow burn designed to soundtrack what the mind endures when loneliness sets in. The melodies are cavernous and somewhat distant, emitting a gritty resonance that affirms Quelle’s premise.</p>
<p>At certain points on the album, we hear positive affirmations blended into the mix—like the 1970s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iset88O__qc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Most Important Person</a>"" commercial spot—offering brief glimmers of hope amongst an otherwise bleak soundscape. <i>Lullabies</i> is the album you play when you’re going through serious shit. At just the right length and tempo, Quelle skillfully blends genres, showing his great range as a composer and creative visionary. He opts for jazz fusion on ""Desire to Be,"" ""Red Buttons,"" and ""Sickum,"" sprinkling light keys and horns into the fray; the aforementioned ""Peace and Pain"" is a seething electro-rock hybrid similar to the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">OPN</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"" target=""_blank"">Trent Reznor</a>. This is easy listening, but it has all the psychedelic grit you’d expect from a Quelle release. He’s pushed beyond his usual arc, leading to a wonderfully ambient release that should be mentioned with the genre’s trendsetters.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then again, this isn’t surprising if you’ve followed Quelle so far. The Detroit native has long pushed his music to weird places, crafting art that’s equally genuine and peculiar. In recent years, though, Quelle has discussed his career path with the same level of angst we’ve all expressed in our respective fields. He ponders the road ahead and choices he’s made along the way. He's wondered why he's slept on and what it'll take to move past those doldrums. Over several projects, Quelle has always been someone you can relate to, and his music comes off as such. If <i>Innocent Country</i> trailed off without clear resolutions, <i>Lullabies</i> signals Quelle’s uncertain trek to the light. Many of us have taken that journey, or will do so eventually.</p></div>"|21582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21582-lullabies-for-the-broken-brain/|7.4|Marcus J. Moore

A rudimentary combination of beats emerges, one of which sounds like the sped-up bossa nova preset on an inexpensive junk keyboard meant for kids ages 3 and up; the other a prototypical hi-hat figure that has ""I’ve just started experimenting with house music"" written all over it. As dreamy-but-crude synth pads, hand claps, and Kedrina's vocals all join in, it's easy to mistake the song (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17960-kedr-livanskiy-razrushitelniy-krug-destructive-cycle/"">Razrushitelniy Krug</a>"") as an unremarkable piece of lo-fi house music, made by someone without a developed sense for how to arrange an instrumental backdrop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But she quickly proves that not to be the case. Her production touch is too delicate to consign this EP to the same bin as other music current music that arrives already dated because it reeks of Instagram. Where so many artists give their work the sonic equivalent of a fake tan when they try to ""warm"" it up, Kedrina captures the charm of listening to dance music that’s been taped off a late-night radio broadcast. As such, her nods to the past appear to stem from romance rather than cynical fascination with kitsch.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Winds of May,"" for example, begins with a wash of queasy synth melodrama, the likes of which Boards Of Canada turned into a career 20 years ago. Like many tracks on this EP, it sounds like it’s being played on a sluggish tape deck, but here there’s an occasional pitch-up effect, as if you were listening to a tape that sat in a basement for years and skitters forward every time one of its reels makes a full turn. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17833-kedr-livanskiy-sgoraet/"">Sgoraet</a>"" (The Burning Down) and the title track, Kedrina dons her David Gahan hat and captures the flashy brooding of <i>Black Celebration/Music for the Masses</i>-era Depeche Mode. Of course, Depeche Mode’s stock in trade was to turn personal angst into stadium-sized gestures that mimicked the collective hysteria of political rallies. Kedrina turns that vibe on its ear by catching a tiny bit of it in a bottle and setting it loose on a dingy, half-empty dancefloor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A close look at the lyrics reveals further layers of interpretation and displacement. The EP title appears on the album cover in Russian, while the song titles alternate between Russian and English. Kedrina's vocals alternate between the two languages as well, but are all listed in English. And even when she does sing in English, her delivery verges on formless much like those wordless ethereal female vocals that became Orbital’s trademark. So even when you’re reading the James Joyce verses that she quotes on ""Winds of May""—""Winds of May, that dance on the sea / Dancing a ring-around in glee / From furrow to furrow, while overhead / The foam flies up to be garlanded""—her phrasing creates a sense of distance that isn’t attributable to language barrier alone.</p>
<p><i>January Sun</i> closes with an acappella version of ""Razrushitelniy Krug""/Destructive Cycle (alternately listed as ""Cyclic Strength of Destruction"")that, even coming as it does after a bunch of songs with spartan arrangements heavy with primitive reverbs, feels like a curveball. With her voice echoing as if across a valley, Kedrina frees the EP from the confines of her home-recording setup, or the provincial Russian club where one can easily imagine her spinning records on an off night. On their own, her vocals take on a stately elegance, and her unbound Russian verses carry and drift. As a coda to her first musical statement, it is both striking and subtle. Whatever direction Kedrina chooses to move in with Kedr Livanskiy from here, the agility she shows on <i>January Sun</i> suggests that we should be watching her. </p>
<p><i><b>Correction</b>: The original version of this review referred to producer/singer Yana Kedrina as ""Kedr Livanskiy."" Kedr Livanskiy is the name of the project. </i></p></div>"|21661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21661-january-sun/|7.8|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

They are frequently namechecked as the engine behind the band: Both help run the venerable artpop boutique label <a href=""http://www.brassland.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brassland Records</a>, whose flagship act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/935-clogs/"" target=""_blank"">Clogs</a> is one of the foremost names in indie classical. Bryce, meanwhile, collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"" target=""_blank"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/68-alva-noto/"" target=""_blank"">Alva Noto</a> on the Golden Globe-nominated score to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21352-the-revenant-ost/"" target=""_blank"">The Revenant</a> </i>and recently saw his compositions <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18702-bryce-dessner-aheym-by-kronos-quartet/"">interpreted by the Kronos Quartet</a><i>.</i> Additionally, both Dessners performed in Scandinavia last year with the Copenhagen Philharmonic and the Amsterdam Sinfonetta. </p>
<p>But now it's time for the National's <i>other</i> pair of brothers, Bryan and Scott Devendorf, to show their willingness to go off the grid. Working in collaboration with fellow <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a> signee Benjamin Lanz of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>, the newly minted trio LNZNDRF recorded their eight-song debut LP in two and a half days inside of an old church in the brothers' hometown of Cincinnati. Yet from the direction the group is taking here, you'd think they transported themselves to Conny Plank's Cologne studio in the early days of Sky Records. The group chose to play Germany before New York on their brief international tour leading up to the album's release, and the pulse of motorik powers the songs here. Yet this is no aimless joyride down the Autobahn: Lanz and the Devendorfs are as much fans of the 4AD label as they are clientele, and the influence of the imprint's more psychedelic excursions are palpable, especially across the four mesmerizing instrumental cuts here, all of which were mostly improvised as producer Justin Newton rolled tape.</p>
<p>The hypnotic groove of Lanz's guitar on opening cut ""Future You,"" for instance, invokes a more visceral variation of Michael Brook's work with Pieter Nooten of Clan of Xymox. As the backbone of the National, Bryan Devendorf isn't really given the kind of material that really brings out his true chops as a drummer, but on the perpetual-motion machine of ""Hypno-Skate"" or the bubbling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a>-spiced closer ""Samarra,"" he gets to reveal himself as a student of such krautrock masters as Jaki Liebezeit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"" target=""_blank"">Neu!</a>'s Klaus Dinger in ways he never could otherwise.</p>
<p>That the Achilles' heel of LNZNDRF comes from the vocal territory should come as no surprise. But it's not as though the singing, done by both Lanz and Scott Devendorf, is no good. It's just that when you hear a pedestrian, moderately chillwave-ish song like ""Mt. Storm"" or ""Kind Things"" sitting amongst the instrumentals that tower over them, it feels woefully mismatched in the same way that cover of David Essex's ""Rock On"" sits like a wart in the middle of the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21406-the-catastrophist/"" target=""_blank"">album</a>. The two sides finally come together on the record's penultimate cut, ""Monument,"" a convincing homage to the Pale Saints.</p>
<p>The Pale Saints are ancient history to 4AD now: These days, the label is more known for their advancements in the world of next-level dance pop like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"" target=""_blank"">Holly Herndon</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>. <i>LNZNDRF </i>is a fine-if-flawed testament to the company's Thatcher years, but it could have been tremendous if they had kept it strictly instrumental. If the Devendorfs were allowed to bring some of this fried psychedelia to the National, alongside the Dessner twins' neo-classical grandiloquence, the National's next album could really be something. </p></div>"|21663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21663-lnzndrf/|6.5|Ron Hart

Using a wide array of aliases—be it Disco D, The It, Gherkin Jerks, Fingers, Inc. or Mr. Fingers—he pressed up singles like ""Mystery of Love,"" ""It's Over,"" ""A Path,"" ""Donnie,"" and ""Bring Down the Walls,"" almost all of them epochal, codifying dance music in their wake. Heard did jack, acid, and house like few before him and fewer since, to where his decades-old productions still jerk the heartstrings, from new love to <a href=""https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/dope-jams-picked-a-larry-heard-track-for-your-most-pressing-love-dilemmas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heartache</a>, well into the present.</p>
<p>If you were a rock band with that many sterling singles in your arsenal, you'd release a deluxe edition and put the band back together 30 years later to cash in, but Heard's re-emergence now feels different. Late last year, he finally reissued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21391-fingers-inc-another-side/"" target=""_blank""><i>Another Side</i></a> on his own <a href=""http://alleviatedrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alleviated</a> label, rightly considered the greatest vocal house record of all time, and this month sees his first release as Mr. Fingers since 2005. </p>
<p>Which is not to suggest that his label has been dormant in the intervening years. Just last year, Alleviated released two strong singles from newcomers Ken Gill and Lee Pearson Jr. Collective. Heard sounds emboldened by the new blood; the four tracks that comprise this EP don't scan as old tracks dusted off and spruced up for a new generation of deep house fans, nor do they sound like Heard dabbling in the newfangled so as to prove his relevance on the EDM market. ""Outer Acid,"" metered by closed hi-hats and canned claps, has the telltale gurgle of a 303 flowing underneath it. But Heard programs the track at the pace of a babbling brook rather than a Warehouse rager, acid house as dulcet and calming, with Heard judiciously adding a metallophone melody to give the track a buoyant charm.</p>
<p>""Nodyahead"" is a clattering, upbeat house track while ""Aether"" is downtempo with a nimbus about its fringes. With its spotlight sweep of chords across the patient house beat, ""Qwazars"" is luminous, from its subject matter to its melody, the sample of ""What’s going on?"" ""Quasars"" dialogue (purportedly lifted from a Neil deGrasse Tyson lecture) a nice touch. It shows that Mr. Fingers’ return isn't to rehash or cash in on his old work, but rather to elucidate it, to carry on this dialogue with his machines in a new century.</p>

Both were created by poor young people as a way to express disdain with the status quo and provide some insight into the minds and hearts of people who usually don’t get a seat at the table. Both encourage a spirit of self-reliance that allows for a kid in Small Town X to create something that can stand confidently next to an icon. Both have been co-opted by the mainstream at large when they proved to be financially beneficial. Both have been sneered at by lames for not requiring much musical ""skill"" to execute.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given all this, you'd think more punk and rap collaborations would turn out better. But usually, the people interested in uniting the genres go the laziest, most obvious route imaginable, and for every <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> you get someting like the self-titled <a href=""good-music.com/"" target=""_blank"">G.O.O.D. Music</a> debut from Nigel ""HXLT"" Holt's (F.K.A. rapper Hollywood Holt). The album aims to revisit a time when Debbie Harry and Grandmaster Flash rubbed elbows at New York’s Danceteria—creating a culture in the process— but ultimately ends up feeling like being invited to a friend's art show—you’re rooting for the guy but man, some of this stuff is <i>brutal</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's sound is uncomplicated. He could have gone overboard with screeching guitars, but HXLT keeps things spare, closer to post-punk than punk. ""Why"" is a decent dark wave homage, taking dashes of the sound (choppy rhythm guitar, disinterested vocal stylings) and forcing the synths to get along with a drum machine doing yeoman's work. There’s elements of social awareness, too. On ""Guitar,"" the Mano-produced standout, HXLT laments that he’d like to be famous solely to bring attention to real issues (the chorus: ""I wish I could play guitar/ And write all the songs to make me rich/ Use it all to save the kids""). No complaints there.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The lyrics are another story; there are a ton of eyeroll moments here. While no one expects this guy to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>, there’s gotta be something out there better than ""Rock N Roll""’s ""I wanna get into a fight in front of you and knock his lights out/ I wanna ride a motorbike, make you jump on it and we ride out."" It’s a damn shame, too, because HXLT is an undeniable live performer, full of charisma: Put him on a stage right now anywhere and he's walking out with five new fans. Somewhere in him he might have a real punk anthem, but none of the songs on the record accurately bottle that energy. Other than ""Sick,"" a song about the frustration of loving someone you honestly can’t stand half the time, the whole thing kind of ambles. Even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>-guested ""Together"" doesn’t gnash its teeth as much as you’d like it to. (Sidebar: Getting Kathleen Hanna on your first album has to be the punk equivalent of getting a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Z</a> feature on your debut, right?)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A lot of the narrative surrounding this record has been about Holt finally embracing the influences traditional rap heads considered too weird, or ""too white."" Clap for him for sticking to his convictions but speaking frankly, a lot of people wouldn’t be giving this the time of day were it not presented via the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>/G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam co-sign. The missed opportunity is the most frustrating part. What could have been a real shift in culture ends up feeling like moving into a new apartment: There’s some potential, but things are still all over the place.</p></div>"|21600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21600-hxlt/|4.9|Ernest Wilkins

Likewise, groups of songs spanning several years often fail to hang together as a coherent whole. The third album from indie/psych/folk quartet Quilt might come from old demos, but it bucks these common trends by showing that disparity can serve as a creative asset.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like a kind of musical Bermuda quadrangle, the convergence of pop-leaning indie rock, psychedelia, vintage British folk, and Americana has lulled many a band to sink into generic facelessness. Not so here. The only times <i>Plaza</i> comes across as less than convincing are the moments where Shane Butler and company tip their hand a tad too heavily, such as on closing number ""Own Ways,"" which falls just short of featuring faux English accents and sounds like Quilt’s musical answer to a '60s mod costume party.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Elsewhere, though, they steer clear of slavish recreation, cleverly revealing new wrinkles in the arrangements from one song to the next. When Anna Fox Rochinski and Butler throw in a key shift on opener ""Passerby"" that evokes a sitar-like, resonator guitar tone, it’s as if they hit the whammy bar on the song itself during playback. It’s a trick they manage several times throughout this new set, where the entire band, which also includes drummer John Andrews and new bassist Keven Lareau, will suddenly go slack before the arrangement as a whole automatically snaps back like a guitar returning to its default string tension. At these times, usually the band will be cruising along at a pleasant pace before swerving toward a jagged, seemingly out-of-place chord or element, and the overall effect is like a friend suddenly tousling your hair.</p>
<p>On ""Roller,"" Quilt re-reappropriates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29159-elastica/"" target=""_blank"">Elastica</a>’s appropriation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>, but instead of returning the angular guitar riff to its rightful owner, tosses it into a dreamlike backdrop of keyboards and Rochinski vocals that smudge out in trails of thickening reverb, simulating our semi-conscious day-to-day train of thought as it focuses on banal tasks then blurs into daydreams until those nagging bits of reality pull our attention back down to Earth. If you were to stop and take stock of how many times your mind does this in the course of a single day, you’d likely be surprised because the process unfolds so smoothly that you mostly don’t even register that it’s happening. Quilt executes these transitions with similar ease.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On the chorus of ""Your Island,"" for example, Rochinski’s reverb-drenched vocals scrape the upper stratosphere of shoegaze—only without typical shoegaze instrumentation. It’s as if the band stripped a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2564-lush/"" target=""_blank"">Lush</a> tune of its vocals and transplanted them in a stripped-down, downtempo song that could have been written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1254-the-duke-spirit/"" target=""_blank"">the Duke Spirit</a>. ""O’Connor’s Barn"" marries <i>Whip-Smart</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"" target=""_blank"">Liz Phair</a>’s cottony impressionism with the slightest touch of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>-styled guitar hook circa <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i>. ""Padova"" excavates the experimental streak that seemed so promising about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1754-gomez/"" target=""_blank"">Gomez</a> before that band surrendered to slick pop, while ""Hissing My Plea"" emulates the strings that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> stole from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"" target=""_blank"">Funkadelic</a>’s ""If You Don’t Like the Effects, Don’t Produce the Cause."" Elsewhere, jangly nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5731-fairport-convention/"" target=""_blank"">Fairport Convention</a> and barebones Americana rear their heads as well.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In all of these cases, though, Quilt either significantly expands on or reframes these references, bringing substance, character and a modern production sheen to older ideas. They have always been a quietly stylish band, with diligently crafted songs, savvy arrangement instincts, and a discreet, almost unassuming way of asserting their own voice while embracing influences. Without even trying, <i>Plaza</i> offers a rebuttal to all those people who argue that every artist steals. Wrong—some, like Quilt, know the difference between stealing and honoring.</p></div>"|21408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21408-plaza/|7.7|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

They catered to very specific demographics rather than listeners at large via ""idol pop"" groups devoted to subcultures.

Yet no pop group’s identity has been stranger than Especia’s, a five-piece frequently billed as ""Japanese vaporwave idols."" They’ve embraced the stylings of an <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/adam-harper-vaporwave"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Internet subgenre</a> infatuated with pitched-down vocals and old technology, while their primary producer has openly mentioned how influential acts such as <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/espritfantasy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Espirit空想</a> and Saint Pepsi (now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33130-skylar-spence/"" target=""_blank"">Skylar Spence</a>) have been to their sound.

Look beneath the Grecian busts and Windows 95 logos, and you’ll find many vaporwave artists using slowed-down Japanese songs from the 1980s as source material, particularly from a glitzy genre called city pop, indebted to American AOR and funk, that reflected Japan's then-decadent lifestyle. Especia’s actual music leans closer to real-deal city pop, blessed with big hooks and copious saxophone solos, than anything by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Carta</i>, the group’s third album and first for a major label, continues their brand of vaporwave-inspired dabbling—look closely at the straight-out-of-Myst cover art and you’ll see what looks suspiciously like the Enron logo—but offers a mostly straight-ahead set of mellow pop. It’s the outfit’s final release as a quintet, as three members are set to ""graduate"" shortly after its release, and even though it doesn’t reach the heights of earlier works, it’s a solid snapshot of what Especia has done so well in recent times to stand out on a purely sonic level. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The bulk of <i>Carta</i> leans toward easygoing music punched up by brass sections and bubbly synthesizer, the sort of songs that sound best as the evening is just settling in. The trio Hi-Fi City (featuring Especia’s main producer Schtein&amp;Longer, PellyColo, and saxophonist Yoshiro Nakagawa) handle most of the songwriting and production, bringing a deep knowledge of style that helps Especia’s music rise above simple recycling. ""Over Time"" and ""Sunshower"" sway at the pace of Brand New Heavies, while the squiggly bass and saxophone blurts of ""Mistake"" nail the urban drama of city pop wonderfully. These are solid recreations of retro sounds not hiding their influences—""Rittenhouse Square""'s title reveals the Philadelphia soul approximation before the first horn stab—that at their worst still sound smooth and pleasant.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Carta</i> works in a smattering of other sounds to keep things moving. Hip-hop plays a prominent role, the members of Especia breaking into rap at various points that channels the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHMVkqCKknc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">same time period </a>the rest of the album does. Less charming—and, positioned as the album opener, a horrible introduction—is ""Clover,"" an arena-sized rock ballad assembled by a trio of older Japanese rockers. It would be cheesy in any decade, but made worse by how unnatural it forces Especia to sing, their voices better suited for mellow than soaring. Also mixed in is one direct embrace of vaporwave sound on ""Saudade,"" produced by Brazilian artist <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/vhslogos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VHS Logos </a>and featuring narcotized recordings of the group’s members playing a game. It’s a nice breather. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most of <i>Carta</i> registers as simply ""solid, if a bit thin."" Yet the album—and the current version of Especia—ends on a high, courtesy of the collection’s two big pop moments, the tropical-scented shuffler ""Boogie Aroma"" and the high-stepping ""Aviator,"" the latter in particularly delivering the album’s most charged-up hook. These instances highlight what have made Especia stand out in Japan even more than the vaporwave wallpaper—catchy earworms every bit as good as the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnOwTaArdv4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">silly videos</a>.</p></div>"|21621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21621-carta/|6.5|Patrick St. Michel

But Google <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=hop%20along%20get%20disowned%20review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hop Along Get Disowned Review""</a>, and you’ll see that the band’s proper 2012 debut (Quinlan had released a solo album under the name) was as universally overlooked as <i>Painted Shut</i> was <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/music/painted-shut/hop-along"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">universally praised</a>. With its swift reissue on Saddle Creek, <i>Get Disowned</i> now feels like it could’ve been <i>Painted Shut</i>’s complicated, difficult follow-up, but one that stands to be just as beloved, because this band remains virtually peerless in indie rock.</p>
<p>In 2012, Hop Along weren’t the robust, road-tested band that could be tasked with warming up amphitheaters for heartland indie acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs"">the War on Drugs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse"">Modest Mouse</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1250-dr-dog/"">Dr. Dog</a>. <i>Get Disowned</i>'s original release also happened at least a year before any of the narratives that would either directly or peripherally benefit the band—Philadelphia emerging as the nation’s indie rock capital, the emo revival, mainstream attention to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZmNJKYejto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fest</a>, the annual October weekend in Gainesville, Fla., that serves as a proving ground for many of the bands responsible for those first two narratives. Praise would eventually start to accumulate, the most notable being a <a href=""https://twitter.com/HopAlongtheband/status/495569316163907585"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweet</a> where blink–182’s Mark Hoppus called this record’s “Tibetan Pop Stars” “the most painfully beautiful song ever.”</p>
<p>Whatever your qualms with the source, Hoppus’ words reached an audience for whom a blink-182 cosign could make a difference. And you know what? “Tibetan Pop Stars” <i>is</i> painfully beautiful, though perhaps not as indicative of any vestigial emo roots as the nearly seven-minute song written from the perspective of a talking mattress, serving as an impartial arbiter in a breakup that just won’t end (“Laments”). But along with beautiful pain and painful beauty, “Tibetan Pop Stars” is also really, really funny, with Quinlan seeking escape from being tied down in any way, especially a boring relationship. And if anyone <i>did</i> ask her about her significant other, fuck something as basic as “<a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/fake-boyfriends-from-canada"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he’s in Canada</a>”: Quinlan’s beau is a seducer of Tibetan pop stars and connoisseur of luxury automobiles. It’s the work of a whimsical, wild imagination, but it's also an alibi, one that will probably get the asker to let the subject drop and leave her alone.</p>
<p>The humor of <i>Get Disowned</i> may have deflected from just how brutally honest and devastating it is. In 2012, Quinlan described her ultimate songwriting goal as, “<a href=""http://www.phawker.com/2012/05/31/rawk-tawk-qa-with-phillys-hop-along/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">finding [a] character and creating a world,</a>” which seemed more in line with the literary, referential <i>Painted Shut</i> than it does with the songs here. The tragedies and personal failings on <i>Get Disowned</i> feel more like autobiography—“Trouble Found Me” expresses the horrifying imagery of her stepfather after suffering a catastrophic accident (“you came in with your jaw torn, still talking”), along with the vivid memories of technicalities that tend to stick with trauma sufferers. Quinlan remembers things like the chicken in the oven before arriving to the hospital and seeing nurses playing poker while a blind man convalesces in the next bed over. The account of a family friend’s death on the rollicking roots-rocker “Sally II” starts with a literally breathtaking mention of “that unsettling smell had gotten into all the tenants’ rooms,” and it’s the mundane forensic details that are even more unnerving: the apartment is littered with weightlifting magazines and a piece of junk mail with a fake million-dollar check (“you thought it was the real thing”).</p>
<p><i>Get Disowned</i> is a meditation on death and loss every bit as compelling as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18283-jason-isbell-southeastern""><i>Southeastern</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji""><i>Benji</i></a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20218-carrie-lowell""><i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i></a>, and boasts more inventive language than any of them. But Hop Along, in part because the project was so new, initially had a harder time getting noticed. And while Quinlan’s voice is unusually expressive—she often screams and restrains herself at the same time, so it sounds like her lungs might burst—it rarely sounds objectively <i>sad</i> in a way that immediately conveys gravitas or fragility to a casual listener. Play “Sally II” at a party, ask a friend what it’s about and see how close they get to “an older man dying alone in his apartment.”</p>
<p>The record’s most pressing issue may be one that was hit upon in an interview with Quinlan and her brother Mark, Hop Along’s drummer. Frances described the prevailing theme of <i>Get Disowned</i> as “baggage,” to which Mark added, “not being able to have your mistakes written off just because you’re young.” Right there, the siblings touched the nerve that rightfully triggers a shudder in anyone who’s been the target of all those “why can’t these entitled <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/millennials-literally-too-lazy-to-eat-cereal.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">millennials just wash their cereal bowls</a> like we did in the good ol’ days?”-style pieces, written by someone who refuses to take ownership of the degraded world they’ve left for the younger generation. It feels like the Quinlans were speaking to how people can be seriously damaged by their youth and still not be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Sure, kids might learn to process and turn these experiences into assets—“Hop Along” itself was a nickname given to Quinlan in high school for being a slow walker. Or they may repress them and have them mutate into something uglier and intractable that continues throughout their lives. Even if a middle-schooler is aware of what’s at stake in the upcoming presidential election or reads an article about Flint’s water crisis, if they got picked on at school, that’s probably the most important thing in the world to them right now. <i>Get Disowned</i> lends dignity to the truth that each person’s struggle and recovery is theirs, regardless of how it may present to outsiders or how it seems relative to more pervasive and global concerns. As Hop Along would soon find out, the first step to a breakthrough is just to be heard.</p></div>"|21510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21510-get-disowned/|8.5|Ian Cohen

In an age of viral rap stars thriving on the Instagram snippet economy, Fortune has taken a more methodical approach, building a cult following over several years with his two-part <i>Beautiful Pimp</i> mixtape series and a host of collaborative projects, among them YEP with rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32756-og-maco/"" target=""_blank"">OG Maco</a> and EPs/tapes with local producers Dun Deal, Childish Major, and CeeJ (from the rap collective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32792-two-9/"" target=""_blank"">Two-9</a>). You can hear the labor in his method, in the mechanics of how he puts his words together.</p>
<p>It’s fitting, then, that the self-titled <i>Jerome Raheem Fortune</i> focuses on his toils, from living in a motel with his single mother to paying back loans to missing the birthdays of loved ones due to the punishing schedule of life as an aspiring rapper. Fortune seeks to humanize and not deify, and this is the most personal he has ever been in his writing, with lyrics that are closer to journal entries than rap verses. The songs are at times almost uncomfortably autobiographical, a look behind the veil of moderate Internet-based fame: Fortune talks openly about family dynamics, being broke, and his entire life outside rap, everything from how he ended up with two baby mamas to how he plans to pay for his kids’ pull-ups. On ""Still I Fight On,"" he establishes his priorities, summarizing with ""Fuck an album placement/ I fought for survival."" For him, rap is a means to an end; he believes himself to be a dynamic artist, yes, but he’s constantly got his eye on the bottom line.</p>
<p>This desire for financial stability and proud DIY mentality fuels everything Fortune does, and here he attempts to earn his keep narrating his life. <i>Jerome Raheem Fortune</i> builds on the sound of 2013’s <i>Beautiful Pimp</i>—quick-splitting, electronic-leaning productions with snug verses that lean heavily on charismatic vocal performances, songs actively seeking to buck Atlanta trap trends—but he’s never gone this far out. The dark, coke-powered ""Heavy as Feathers,"" which whirrs like a UFO desperately trying to stay afloat, clicking and clanging and breaking apart, is the centerpiece for his sound-warping escapades. When the experimentation works, there are songs like ""Past Future,"" a collapsing multi-tone palace that pairs his best writing (""The writing on the wall was a movie script"") with his most captivating rapping.</p>
<p>Rome Fortune’s strongest attribute is his comfort with virtually any production, and that serves him well on the constantly-shifting <i>Jerome Raheem Fortune</i>. There are lush, blooming tracks scattered thought (""Alone Tonight"" builds slowly and woozily before switching dramatically into a strutting riff; ""Find My Way"" false starts into trickling synths), and he’s good at finding the open space despite all the continuous movement, sliding in and out of the grooves with intimate admissions. But while Fortune bares his soul, he isn’t a particularly gifted wordsmith and some of the storytelling gets muddled a bit because of it. Still, he’s an exceptional performer and overcomes his limitations with sheer energy. <i>Jerome Raheem Fortune</i> is the work of an artist who is still figuring it all out, a flawed but ambitious art piece that’s the culmination of several years of growth.</p></div>"|21604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21604-rome-fortune-jerome-raheem-fortune/|7.0|Sheldon Pearce

This isn’t the work of the same band that released a lovably frazzled, fondly remembered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a> in 2011. Since frontman Daniel Blumberg quit the group and guitarist Max Bloom took over as its leader, Yuck have carried on as a faded copy of themselves, retaining their devotion to '90s indie rock but losing the misfit energy that made revisiting sounds that have already been recycled many, many times before seem like a genuinely exciting proposition. Bloom and Blumberg’s voices are superficially similar enough that casual listeners might not even be able to pinpoint exactly what’s changed, but they’ll almost certainly notice the diminishing returns. The scrappy enthusiasm of Yuck’s debut has been replaced by bland, box-checking competence.</p>
<p>Given that a few of his songs on <i>Stranger Things</i> hint at the anxiety caused by the public pressure of filling in for his old bandmate, it feels mean-spirited to single Bloom out for particular criticism. But it’s hard not to. He’s the Doug Yule to Blumberg’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>, a passable enough fill in for a song or two who lacks the charisma, personality, and way with words to carry an entire album on his own. And while his flat, cheerless vocals are the type of limitation that a more self-aware band might work around, the group’s self-produced third album counterintuitively plays them up, plastering them at the front of the mix. It’s a voice you can really grow to resent over 47 minutes, and <i>Stranger Things</i> locks you in such close quarters with it that when bassist Mariko Doi finally takes her lone lead vocal turn on ""As I Walk Away,"" it feels like hard-earned relief.</p>
<p>Under Blumberg’s reign, Yuck muddled their influences together into a fluid pastiche—a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a> here, a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a> there, a big splash of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> on top of that—but Bloom tends toward more structured, predictable homages. ""Cannonball"" shares a name with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"" target=""_blank"">Breeders</a> song but plays like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"" target=""_blank"">Superchunk</a> song. There’s also a stab at an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a> song (""Like a Moth""), a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub"" target=""_blank"">Teenage Fanclub</a> song (""Only Silence"") and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4014-matthew-sweet"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Sweet</a> song (the title track, which features the extremely '90s chorus ""I hate myself,"" only none of the black humor that era’s songwriters used to cut that kind of sentiment with). The record ends with a pair of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a> rips. ""Down"" is the more effective of the two, because Bloom nails Doug Martsch’s boyish innocence—it’s one of his best performances, even if like everything else on the album it feels secondhand. He sounds way out of his element, though, on the thundering, six-and-a-half minute ""Yr Face,"" an attempt at ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCCX-E8VMJw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Broken Chairs</a>""-style gravitas that runs in circles instead of building to something. Built to Spill could pull off that kind of song because they had big ideas to convey. Yuck do not.</p>
<p>So, rough album. <i>Glow &amp; Behold </i>was no great shakes either, but at least that record compensated for Blumberg’s absence with richer instrumentation, and some smartly deployed shoegaze textures that helped conceal Bloom’s vocal deficiencies. Where that album felt like an expansion, albeit a minor one, <i>Stranger Things</i> feels like a retreat. The group recorded it themselves in an effort to reconjure the rawer, fuzzier sound of their debut, and for a band that’s trying to escape their own shadow, that’s probably the worst thing they could have done. Yuck have always invited comparisons to other bands, but these days, the one that flatters them the least is the comparison to themselves.</p></div>"|21567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21567-yuck-stranger-things/|5.2|Evan Rytlewski

In some ways, his second solo release as NA feels more like a busy construction site than a collection of dance music: It’s 21 minutes of unrelentingly hot, noisy, messy electronic thumps. Thematically, each of <i>Cellar</i>’s five songs is supposed to represent a different dark and claustrophobic room in a large dungeon, complete with its own set of problems and pleasures. The extended architectural metaphor at the heart of <i>Cellar</i> is a fitting description for an artist whose career has been defined by spatial dimensions as much as sonic ones.</p>
<p>The music’s physical tenor is steamy and crowded—it’s like a top down shot of a dance floor, with poor souls trying to claw their way out of the mass of bodies. On ""Brass Claims,"" Pineda adds aggressive horns to his wild array of percussive sounds. The middle chunk of the EP: ""Menace"" and ""Definite Sentence"" attempt to scale back the tone and lighten the mood, lowering the frenetic BPM, but the rhythmic zig-zags accomplish little more than creating an anxious block of music. There are a handful of lighter moments in ""Definite Sentence"" where it sounds like Pineda is sampling a dog’s squeaky toy. And the closer, ""NA in a Mood,"" is surprisingly open and airy. It’s a long fade out that nears ambient music in the relaxation it can somehow pull out of the metallic and mordant sounds Pineda trades in.</p>
<p>At its best, the EP’s pure visceral nature is a stark reminder of the body’s central place in dance music. At its worst, it’s a numbing and grating experience that would never be able to extend past its short runtime. The EP’s attempt at pacing is never smooth but closer to flagellating, and if it did not end at least a little bit gently, the vice-grip it clamps on to your ears would start to feel oppressive. On the whole, though, <i>Cellar</i> is a focused curation of the simple and harsh sounds that were the strongest parts of Pineda’s work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31889-future-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Future Brown</a> and Nguzunguzu.</p></div>"|21611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21611-cellar-ep/|7.5|Kevin Lozano

Is it to show how the influence of an icon has spread, seeping into and informing far-flung styles that then sprawl from the center like branches of a healthy family tree? Is it to use the star power of gathered singers and bands to raise the reputation of some underserved idol, giving a second chance to the perpetually overlooked? Or, more cynically, is it a label-based attempt to package together a potpourri of disparate artists and capitalize on their disconnected fanbases and that of the tribute subject?</p>
<p><i>God Don’t Never Change</i>, an 11-song ode to the great blues howler and gospel progenitor Blind Willie Johnson, feels a little like all of those at once. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotta_Serve_Somebody:_The_Gospel_Songs_of_Bob_Dylan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Produced by tribute-compilation veteran Jeffrey Gaskill</a>, powered by an <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blindwilliejohnson/help-produce-the-songs-of-blind-willie-johnson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ambitious crowdfunding campaign</a>, and issued by roots imprint <a href=""http://www.alligator.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alligator Records</a>, <i>God Don’t Never Change</i> attempts to grapple with Johnson’s impact on popular artists and genre purists alike. Crossover giants such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4600-lucinda-williams/"" target=""_blank"">Lucinda Williams</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3135-sinead-oconnor/"" target=""_blank"">Sinéad O’Connor</a> share the tracklist with gospel- and blues-based acts, from the institutional Blind Boys of Alabama to North Mississippi Allstar leader Luther Dickinson. It is, as with almost all tribute records, an uneven listen. Still, it's a fine homage to Johnson’s brutally honest, occasionally inspirational songs that leaves some deep questions about how far his influence goes.</p>
<p>Many of these interpretations are excellent, reflecting music’s evolutionary arc since Johnson’s time and the idiosyncratic styles of these performers themselves. Waits, for instance, is perfect for ""The Soul of a Man,"" a song that questions why we’re here and what ""we"" even are. Backed by childlike harmonies, parlor piano, and heavy handclaps, it's a joyful lecture delivered under the auspices of a sweltering summer revival. (His junkyard moan through ""John the Revelator,"" however, is so melodramatic it seems glib.) And exalting above his ragged slide work and the dainty whistle of a fife, Dickinson sounds like the Delta doppelgänger of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a>, his voice curling skyward. It’s an exquisite, personal update.</p>
<p>The real highlight arrives with Sinéad O’Connor’s ""Trouble Will Soon Be Over,"" a song that’s a sermon about how the struggles of this life will sublimate into redemption when it’s over. O’Connor sings of death as sweet relief here, her resilient voice rising over a guitar line that drones more like the blues of West Africa than those of Johnson’s central Texas. That subtle transnational nod is a sharp tribute to the durability and relevance of these songs. Nearly a century after many of these numbers were written, we’re still grappling with the worries of Johnson’s world, which he articulated with such grace and aired with such grit.</p>
<p>That realization is a damning one for <i>God Don’t Never Change</i>, a collection that leaves so much on the table in terms of possibility. Many of these selections are too on-the-nose, kowtowing to Johnson’s legacy as though kneeling before his corpse at a wake. Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks simply redeliver ""Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning,"" while Maria McKee belts ""Let Your Light Shine on Me"" as an act of historical anachronism. <i>God Don’t Never Change</i> ends with the impression that there’s work to be done, interpretations yet left to hear. Johnson’s songs were often elliptical and vague; see, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNj2BXW852g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his largely instrumental masterpiece, ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground."" </a>But <i>God Don’t Never Change</i> never really opens itself up beyond obvious Americana. What does rap in 2016 have to say about Blind Willie Johnson? Or metal? Or a sample-driven producer? Plenty, I’d wager. It’s reflexive and naïve to think his influence ends here.</p>
<p>The paleness of the entire enterprise only exacerbates that feeling. Yes, the Blind Boys ease their way through the emotional turmoil of ""Mother’s Children Have a Hard Time,"" but every other player of color here (and there are very few) is tucked into the background, like the hand-clapping Mike Mattison or the fife-adding Shardé Thomas. The only black-led act is the most polite and polished of the entire set, with Waits and O’Connor left to raise the set’s real ruckus. If the point of a tribute album is to show how an artist’s work has metastasized and impacted others, <i>God Don’t Never Change</i> allows a too narrow of a window for doing so.  </p></div>"|21639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21639-god-dont-never-change-the-songs-of-blind-willie-johnson/|5.8|Grayson Haver Currin

""I wanted you to win. You should have. It's weird and it sucks that I robbed you."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53726-macklemore-says-kendrick-deserved-grammy-for-best-rap-album/"">The screencap seen 'round the world</a> explains the duality of Ben Haggerty, aka Macklemore, whose unexpected mainstream appeal has enabled him and his music partner, Ryan Lewis, to rise to the top of the industry. At the 2014 Grammys, the duo’s <i>The Heist</i> had defeated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i></a> for the Best Rap Album Grammy, an upset that weighed on Macklemore’s conscience. He reached out to Lamar, screencapping the mea culpa for Instagram so everyone could see how just how hard he’d fallen on his sword.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Macklemore understood that the only people who thought <i>The Heist</i> was better or more important than <i>good kid</i> were Grammy voters and misguided white teenagers. But he also needed deeply for the world to know he understood. This same tension between humility and ego fueled his crossover smash hit ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Same Love</a>,"" which advocated for the very non-controversial idea that ""being gay is okay"" and made them unlikely spokesmen for easily digestible social justice. It also prompted criticisms that they weren’t ready to preach from the mount, and after a few years spent internalizing those criticisms, they’ve returned with <i>This Unruly Mess I’ve Made</i>, a blend of juvenile joke raps, inquisitive woke raps, and diaristic contemplations of Macklemore’s life that attempts to prove they belong—that they’re not just white saviors trying to project their face onto the culture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm,"" Macklemore said in a <a href=""http://macklemore.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> announcing the album. ""Start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel."" When he released ""White Privilege II,"" a sprawling monologue in which wonders if he’s an interloper and lectures about the literal definition of white supremacy, he didn’t just drop the mic and try to let the song speak for itself. Instead, he gave interviews about the song with non-white publications, and launched <a href=""http://whiteprivilege2.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a website</a> in which he and his collaborators—including Chicago singer Jamila Woods (who sung the hook on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32988-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment/"" target=""_blank"">Donnie Trumpet &amp; the Social Experiment</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ooH8frBWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunday Candy</a>""), community organizer Dustin Washington, activist Nikkita Oliver, and more—detailed its conception. There was a lot of effort to convince you he was taking the issue of white privilege very, very seriously. Call him the rap game <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelblackmon/can-we-talk-about-how-woke-matt-mcgorry-was-in-2015"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt McGorry</a>—the rare white pop star making political music with explicitly middlebrow outreach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And make no mistake, Macklemore is taking a lot of issues very seriously. ""Same Love"" wasn’t complicated, but it put a human face on gay marriage that was able to connect with millions of Americans. Here, the clattering funk of ""Kevin"" reaches for a similar understanding about the prescription drug crisis, as the accessibility of opioids like Oxycontin has devastated low-income (and white) communities across the country. Macklemore is a former addict, and his invective about the parasitic sway of drug abuse (""We play Russian Roulette/ And try to find a life where we could be content/ ‘Cause for us, we're just trying to minimize the fear of being alive"") carries the moral authority of lived experience. (In interviews, he’s said he also lapsed back into his addiction within the past few years, giving his words a different urgency.)  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33008-leon-bridges/"" target=""_blank"">Leon Bridges</a>’ hook is too moralizing, and it has the maudlin feel of a song written to solve a problem. Macklemore has more appeal as the everyman—a normal guy who who just stumbled into all this pageantry. On the opener ""Light Tunnels,"" he narrates a trip to an awards show: He feels desperately out of place in his town car and his tux, the industry’s eyes on him without his friends for support. (""I wish I had the homies with me here but nope/ Most of the artists I know don’t get invited to this show."") He waxes about how ""they"" want gossip, drama, for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>'s rant ""to go on longer."" As he accepts an award (which may be the Grammy he robbed Kendrick of), he ponders how he’ll explain ""this unruly mess I’ve made""—a slightly disingenuous ""aw shucks"" characterization of his career that nevertheless communicates some truth about the weight of his expectations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Buckshot,"" meanwhile, reflects on his days as a rebellious graffiti artist, featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7234-krs-one/"" target=""_blank"">KRS-One</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Premier</a>, and ""St. Ides"" is a tender travelogue of his days as a teenage alcoholic. On ""Growing Up,"" Macklemore dictates a comprehensive list of cool-dad lessons for his newborn child (""Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus""; ""Take your girl to the prom, but don’t get too drunk hanging out the limo."") His knowledge is slightly undermined when he recommends reading Langston Hughes’ <i>A </i><i>Raisin in the Sun</i> (Langston Hughes did not write <i>A </i><i>Raisin in the Sun</i>), but hey, nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He developed the big-tent struggle gospel sound of <i>The Heist</i> with Ryan Lewis after a decade spent as an underground rapper, and the formula hasn’t changed much here: There are still lots of choirs, dramatic string cues, and dewy pianos set to tug heart strings. Even a goofy song like ""Dance Off"" gets a swelling horror-movie organ intro before a big dancehall rhythm kicks in. It’s atypical backing music for a rap album, but Macklemore is kind of an atypical rapper. His cadence tends to fall between ""impassioned slam poet"" and ""guy talking in your ear,"" and when he’s doing the latter, the lights dim on the production. ""The Train"" is set solely to piano and the sound of a train whizzing over the tracks, as he softly raps about how his growing responsibilities have pulled him away from his family. ""St. Ides"" is almost completely muted but for a pealing guitar riff. It sounds like the reference track was Buffalo Springfield’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">For What It’s Worth</a>,"" or like, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"" target=""_blank"">the Mountain Goats</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The hit here is ""Downtown,"" which features three legitimate rap pioneers—Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, and Grandmaster Caz—and passionate vocal theatrics from Foxy Shazam’s Eric Nally. Macklemore’s verses are trivial—the opening verse details his attempt to purchase a Moped—but there’s an appealing breeziness to his low-stakes ribbing. The rap O.G.s aren’t given much to do, acting as a chanting Greek chorus and flexing in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhoLcsr8GA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, but their presence gives the song the feeling of an event and allows Macklemore to show he knows and respects his history. (<a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hip-hop-pioneers-from-macklemores-downtown-get-long-overdue-props-20150918?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According to Kool Moe Dee</a>, it was Big Daddy Kane who brokered the collaboration.) ""Downtown"" is a Broadway song, basically—rap for people who loved <i>Hamilton</i>. I hear it and imagine parades, streamers, the Super Bowl half-time show they will probably someday play.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Macklemore is also a skilled mimic. He presses hat to heart when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a> is around, spits with cocksure nostalgia around KRS-One and DJ Premier, does budget<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32756-og-maco/"" target=""_blank""> OG Maco</a>-flow trading lines with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"" target=""_blank"">YG</a> on ""Bolo Tie."" On album highlight ""Need to Know,"" Chance delivers a thoughtful verse about the pitfalls of fame—being alienated from the white girls who ""call me nigga at my show,"" feeling the pressure to strip the spirituality out of his music and ""just leave the cool parts."" (Meanwhile, Macklemore offers hashtag rap in the guise of self-awareness: ""I only think about my worth, I only think about my come up/ Capitalism."") It’s the opposite of Chance’s stint on Kanye’s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17987-kanye-west-ultralight-beam-ft-chance-the-rapper-the-dream-kelly-price-and-kirk-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Ultralight Beam</a>,"" where he exclaimed ""I’m just having fun with it!"" But Chance isn’t here to have fun, because Macklemore is so granite-faced on the serious songs that his guest stars have no choice but to match his mood.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Fun"" is reserved for songs like ""Dance Off"" (in which Idris Elba challenges you to a dance off) or ""Brad Pitt’s Cousin"" (in which Macklemore boasts that ""every white dude in America went to the barbershop: 'Give me the Macklemore haircut'""). That said, it isn’t always easy to tell when Macklemore is trying to be fun, or when we are having fun at his expense. ""Let’s Eat"" is presumably about our collective body image issues, but the jokiness prevents it from getting a foothold. Macklemore would not be the first rapper to alternate between goofiness and gravitas, but the gulf between sober analysis of Oxycontin abuse and white privilege, and the ""DEEZ NUTS"" jokes is just too wide. If he’s serious about wanting to ""start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel,"" he needs to sound as comfortable serving wisdom as he does shooting Sandler-esque wisecracks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The trumped-up portentousness of ""White Privilege II"" is still difficult to digest. It’s a messy explainer of his still-forming politics, a Facebook status come to life. His heart is in the right place, but it’s hard to justify on musical terms. He doesn’t deserve a free pass for being well-intentioned, of course. But ""White Privilege II"" is different from, say, Brad Paisley and LL Cool J’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSurzeGvPrQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Accidental Racist</a>,"" another race-focused song with its heart in the right place that nevertheless missed the mark because it made no attempt to examine its founding premises. (""If you don’t judge my gold chains, I’ll forget the iron chains"" is not a fair trade.) Instead, Macklemore is laboring to show us, brick by awkwardly-rapped brick, how he laid the foundation of his new ideology. It isn’t a link to a Wikipedia page—it’s the whole article. As a song, it’s not great. As an endeavor, it’s hard to be snide about. His credibility regarding his intellectual growing pains is the most essential part of his music, even as it’s also the part that makes him seem doe-eyed and naive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In other words: Do you want to argue that more public discussion of systemic power imbalances is a bad thing? More than one person I follow on Twitter expressed surprise that anyone needs white privilege explained to them, but Donald Trump has won three presidential primaries and counting, so maybe Macklemore has a better bead on the country than some are willing to admit. We can also dispense with the take that his motivation in writing songs like ""White Privilege II"" is cynical, because solemnly intoning about white supremacy is insistently anti-commercial, and not likely to endear him to radio markets that think Beyoncé hates the cops. It would have been much, much easier to record an album of ""Thrift Shop"" sequels; I’m sure at least one record executive suggested it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like Macklemore, <i>This Unruly Mess I’ve Made</i> is nowhere near as bad as its detractors would like it to be. It’s an occasionally inspiring, often corny rap album made for winning Grammy nominations and waking the hearts of the unwoken. The sum of this is sometimes appealing, though frustrating, if only because you’d like to imagine a world where Macklemore was not counted on to inject a dose of political consciousness into our daily proceedings. I’m thinking about Kendrick Lamar, and what he said months after Macklemore’s public apology. ""Yeah, I think it was uncalled for,"" he opined. ""But I think, for confirmation from the world, he probably felt like he had to put it out there, which he didn’t need to do... I don’t take nothin’ away from him anyway 'cause I know where his heart is at. He cool.""</p></div>"|21504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21504-this-unruly-mess-ive-made/|5.1|Jeremy Gordon

The songs, ""Dream State..."" and ""...Familiar Place,"" seem to complete each other elliptically, and approach their shared lyric through two different paths; the first describes a flood, both emotional and physical, while the second finds its narrator crawling through a dead garden. Both choruses seem to obey the physics of dreams: people are lost irretrievably, landscapes shift from domestic to alpine. Dacus conveys the warm, human perspective at the center of this turning vortex, a person trying to survive the infinite flow of change.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>No Burden</i> is an uncommonly warm indie rock record. Lead guitar lines pour in like slow columns of sunlight, and Dacus' voice itself is a comforting blur. ""I let my mind get turned inside out/ Just to see what the kids were laughing about,"" she sings on ""Direct Address."" ""And it wasn't worth understanding/ Something I could've gone my whole life not knowing."" Her perspective is sober and carefully composed, but the blur in her voice also gives her songs the casual, permissive dimension that usually slips in after two or three drinks. ""I thought you'd hit rock bottom, but I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist,"" she sings in ""Strange Torpedo."" ""You've been falling for so long and you haven't hit anything solid yet.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record is full of these candid and severe observations. ""I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore"" describes the arthritic inflexibility of social roles. ""Is there room in the band?"" Dacus asks. ""I don't need to be the frontman/ If not then I'll be the biggest fan."" Dacus herself intended to study film before focusing on music; ""I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore"" and the rest of <i>No Burden</i> seems a product of this wavering and observational focus. The people in her songs seem to naturally settle into realms of instability and ambiguity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Becoming ""no burden"" means exerting zero pressure on the world, suspending yourself in a sphere of your own consciousness, as if sealed into a dream. Of course, removing yourself from the world and others is its own inverse pressure. Your body, mind, and their obscure combinations will carry, shift, and broadcast weight from any position they take up in space. ""If you hadn’t come over, I would be so much colder,"" Dacus sings in ""Dream State…"" ""I would be much less confused."" Everything, <i>No Burden</i> seems to suggest, is burden.</p></div>"|21609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21609-no-burden/|7.8|Brad Nelson

It was previously the title of the third LP by Astrobrite, a continuation of the similarly, evocatively named lovesliescrushing, projects that approached shoegaze while maintaining a basis in electronic noise—other ""truth in advertising"" Astrobrite releases include <i>Whitenoise Superstar</i><i> </i>and <i>Supercrush</i>. It’s a style far more obtuse than the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21499-still-in-a-dream-a-story-of-shoegaze-1988-1995"" target=""_blank"">guitar-pop model</a> that spawned genre titans like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride"" target=""_blank"">Ride</a>, which also means it’s never as overexposed. In fact, more than a decade after the original <i>Pinkshinyultrablast</i>, this style sounded entirely novel on the Russian band’s striking 2014 debut <i>Everything Else Matters</i>. On <i>Grandfeathered</i>, Pinkshinyultrablast sought to go further toward the margins—noisier, more electronic, more dense, simply more. And yet, they became something much closer to a guitar-pop band in the process, their primary and really only objective to overwhelm.</p>
<p>In a literal sense, Pinkshinyultrablast’s self-described <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Pinkshiny/?fref=ts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""thunder pop""/""kung-fu-gaze""</a> is sensational and impressive: the effect is entirely based on hitting a few particular pleasure centers. And every time, Pinkshinyultrablast hits them with such force that the name becomes almost stupidly obvious. It’s the equivalent of getting showered with a firehose pumping spangly glitter.</p>
<p>From a certain angle, Pinkshinyultrablast <i>are</i> a pop band, just one that believes that pop music should work on a subliminal level. The bold hip-hop beat and sleek loops that push ""Initial"" could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a>’ laser-light anthems passed through audio and visual lo-res filters to the point of total abstraction. When they present themselves as a rock band, they’re a much heavier one than on <i>Everything Else Matters. </i>The heaving guitar riffs on ""Glow Vastly"" reimagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28571-the-joy-formidable/"" target=""_blank"">the Joy Formidable</a>’s alt-gaze colossus ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/nyzFTYGgFb0?t=4m30s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whirring</a>"" if it only consisted of its final two minutes. ""I Catch You Napping"" and ""Kiddy Pool Dreams"" maintain the propulsive rhythms of the previous record while subjecting them to a torrential downpour of distortion, similar to mid-2k bands <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/216-asobi-seksu"" target=""_blank"">Asobi Seksu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4751-serena-maneesh"" target=""_blank"">Serena-Maneesh</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2648-mahogany/"" target=""_blank"">Mahogany</a> who served as shoegaze torchbearers during a lull for the genre. (And if those names mean <i>anything</i> to you, <i>Grandfeathered</i> is required listening.)</p>
<p>While the sound on <i>Grandfeathered</i> is deep, it often feels impenetrable rather than multilayered. Lyubov Soloveva has a genre-appropriate voice that isn’t especially distinctive<span>—</span>high, diaphanous, taking on sing-song cadences to signify a chorus. Their most fitting contemporary peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow"" target=""_blank"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a> are by far the funniest band to ever get tagged as shoegaze, imbuing their music with a unique playfulness, and there are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31634-nothing"" target=""_blank"">countless</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight"" target=""_blank"">options </a>for guitar bands who take things in the opposite direction, but Pinkshinyultrablast never manages to express a personality. The rapturous cooing delivers on the promise on song titles like ""Glow Vastly,"" ""Comet Marbles,"" and ""Kiddy Pool Dreams,"" but not much else. Surely, <i>Grandfeathered</i> is impressive, but the first impression tends to be the only one it makes.</p></div>"|21453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21453-grandfeathered/|6.5|Ian Cohen

In just the last three years, the group has checked a number of boxes on the avant-rock bucket list: Releases on Digitalis Limited, NNA Tapes, Feeding Tube, and a CD on composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"" target=""_blank"">John Zorn</a>’s <a href=""http://www.tzadik.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tzadik</a> label, where they appeared as part of the Spotlight Series, a sub-imprint meant to highlight young and emerging weirdo talent. That honor is well earned. In concert, the band is wild and disorienting—a kind of punk rock ""Donkey Kong"" soundtrack with synthesizers ping-ponging against screeching guitars, the rhythm section halting and then churning in dialog with singer Kassie Carlson's animalistic yelps. They make brainy music that feels mmediate and visceral.</p>
<p>Now signed to New York's <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a>, Guerilla Toss have simmered down a little. The band’s first full-length for the label, <i>Eraser Stargazer</i>, finds them less manic and more zoned-out, augmenting pulsing repetition with heaps of gurgling psychedelic jewelry and elastic basslines. In terms of DFA’s classic catalog, they skew closer to the gonzo tradition embodied by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a> than the streamlined dance-punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">the Rapture</a>. The later favored minimalism and poise, embodying a fluid and streamlined rhythmic sensibility. Guerilla Toss' music is more like the burbling glop at the top of the Slurpee machine—viscous and messy. Think <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a> spliced with <i>The</i> <i>Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"" target=""_blank"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. No, don't laugh. That's not a takedown. On <i>Eraser Stargazer, </i>Guerilla Toss suggests funkiness without channeling the grody and ultra-masculine energy that seems forever sewn to punk-funk. Not exactly an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>In a way, their closest contemporary kin might be Baltimore's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29803-dope-body/"" target=""_blank"">Dope Body</a>—another band that has thrived on deconstructing '90s dude-rock into heady mulch. Though, Guerilla Toss’ alternative-era source material is not so much MTV as the jam band world. Which shouldn’t suggest that they are given to jamming. That kinship comes more through a lack of musical self-consciousness—the willingness to seek transcendence via improvisation and weirdo genre bending. On <i>Eraser Stargazer</i>, Guerilla Toss captures that crowd’s yin and yang—the blissed-out hippie vibe and also the druggy parking lot creep-out factor.</p>
<p>But like the jam bands of yesteryear, Guerilla Toss’ on-stage appeal is not easily consumed through the thin reed of a SoundCloud single, a YouTube video, or even a LP. In concert, the band can survive on sheer intensity. But as a record, <i>Eraser Stargazer</i> is sometimes weirdly hookless and ponderous. There’s plenty of stoner fog, but not always much to grip. It is a forward move for the band, though. Where Guerilla Toss’ music was once driven by the push and pull between abrasive elements, <i>Eraser Stargazer</i> glides by in a dreamlike gonzo haze. Gentler, but no less strange. </p></div>"|21572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21572-eraser-stargazer/|6.9|Aaron Leitko

With his 2014 full-length debut as a composer,<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19123-glenn-kotche-adventureland/"" target=""_blank""><i>Adventureland</i></a>, he displayed a facility for rich, percussive-driven works—and also a skill for writing multi-movement pieces that included parts for string instruments and electronics. He’s been equally successful as a performer in this field (as a powerhouse 2015 recording of John Luther Adams’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21205-ilimaq/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Ilimaq</i></a> demonstrated). In light of this, a collaboration between Kotche and the elite contemporary classical group So Percussion seems inevitable, in the best possible way.</p>
<p>At crucial points, the pieces that make up <i>Drumkit Quartets</i> can fail to sound as purposeful as those on <i>Adventureland</i>. The album’s opening and closing tracks give a sense of this indecisive quality, with Kotche’s ""Drumkit Quartet #51"" receiving two different presentations. The first version is subtitled ""Tokyo, Brisbane &amp; Berlin"" (indicating cities where Kotche worked on the piece, or else where he made field recordings). Here, competing rhythms for marimbas cycle through the composition amiably, without creating much tension. Kotche’s collage of pre-recorded noises is frequently spare to a point of seeming aimless. A brief haiku by Kotche (voiced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/759-cibo-matto/"" target=""_blank"">Yuka Honda</a>) has its say in the final third, and the strongest feeling it imparts is a quizzical one. </p>
<p>Texture-obsessed writing isn’t objectionable on its own, but 10 minutes of it is a lot of time for a 51-minute set—especially when the closing ""Chicago Realization"" of the very same composition generates much more excitement. In this version, Kotche’s denser background recording highlights the subtle turns of the marimba writing and preserves the delicacy Kotche is obviously aiming for.</p>
<p>Presenting different ""realizations"" of the same piece can make sense when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>-style ""chance operations"" are part of the mix. But these versions just shift around the arrangement of pre-recorded parts, suggesting compositional diffidence. In his liner notes, Kotche makes reference to these pieces being conceived during a period in which he was ""touring extensively"" with Wilco. He also admits that finishing another of the longest tracks here, ""Drumkit Quartet #50,"" was ""challenging."" The labor is audible.</p>
<p>Still, sketchbook albums from skilled artists can have their moments. Kotche’s miniatures fare quite well. Two propulsive items—""Drumkit Quartet #1"" and ""Drumkit Quartet #54""—are full of ingenuity as well as power. The brief, three-movement ""Drumkit Quartet #3"" moves from dry cymbal work to more resonant pitched percussion with a serene focus. Together with ""Drumkit Quartet #51 (Chicago Realization),"" there’s enough intriguing work here to make <i>Drumkit Quartets</i> worth investigating. Hopefully Kotche will reconnect with the players of So Percussion again at some point in the future, when he has something more clearly fashioned in mind.</p></div>"|21570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21570-drumkit-quartets/|6.6|Seth Colter Walls

""'When you nod your head yes but you wanna say no'—can we stop talking about girls who don't know what they want?"" he <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/the-1975-matt-healy-no-ones-asking-you-to-inspire-revolution-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">despaired</a>. ""Can we stop talking about nothingness? No one's asking you to inspire a revolution, but inspire <i>something</i>."" Like some of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">provocative Manchester forebears</a>, Healy has a giant mouth on him, but unlike them, he doesn't seem interested in tearing others down, just demanding more. This neurotic want drives his music, which in turn inspires wildly conflicting feelings: fervent adoration on one end, intense rage at the other.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The ire directed at the 1975's very existence seems odd, considering their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18467-the-1975-the-1975/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2013 debut</a> was basically inoffensive pop-rock pitched somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Eat World</a>. But there is something deeper at work in the objections, and Healy's rebuke of Bieber provides a hint: Although the group approaches their work with a level of ambition and self-seriousness usually reserved for rock bands like, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>—<i>The 1975</i> is 16 songs long, with three ambient interludes, including a glacial choral opener called ""The 1975""—they have the look, feel, and requisite huge teen girl fanbase of a boy band.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Pure pop has been a cool palette for left-field artists to play around with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8981-a-small-pop/"" target=""_blank"">for a few years now</a>, but the boy band model has remained terminally uncool. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6DlJXbNeE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hurts</a> are maybe as close as it's come; if PC Music really want to be transgressive, perhaps they should give it a shot. Even One Direction tried to escape the genre's sanitized connotations toward the end of their existence, when they were allowed to manifest a little authorship along with their stadium rock dreams. The 1975 don't wear matching suits or sell branded trinkets to the under-10s, yet after years of playing to nobody, they became a boy band by virtue of a voracious social media fanbase—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/881-pop-music-teenage-girls-and-the-legitimacy-of-fandom/"" target=""_blank"">not that they seemed happy about it at first</a>. Once they realized the extent of their audience’s adulation—and indignation when they reshot the monochrome video for ""Sex"" in full color after signing to a major—they played around with them, pulling <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/01/the-1975-disappear-from-social-media"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disappearing acts</a> and refashioning their iconography.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Everything about <i>I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it</i> indicates that the 1975 have embraced girl love, color, and their boy band potential. Healy likes to talk about his band as a post-modern project that creates as people consume, but this ultimately isn't that radical when it comes to pop music, always the magpie. <i>When you sleep...</i> has a much more distinct and iconoclastic character than their slick debut, drawing from the effervescent, percolating polish of early '80s Hot 100 pop that they flirted with on ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9xA1Lvd37E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heart Out</a>."" Single ""Love Me,"" for instance, flagrantly splices Bowie's ""Fame"" and ""Fashion."" The resemblance to acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"" target=""_blank"">Scritti Politti</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33184-inxs/"" target=""_blank"">INXS</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"" target=""_blank"">the Police</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"" target=""_blank"">Hall and Oates</a> also makes it feel like the X-rated cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift</a>'s <i>1989</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"" target=""_blank"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/"" target=""_blank""><i>E•MO•TION</i></a>—despite Healy's brash exterior, his primary mode is lovelorn and yearning.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That doesn't mean that <i>When you sleep</i> is consistent by any stretch. It's 75 minutes long, which could mostly be solved by trimming the four (!) lengthy ambient tracks on the record. It opens with a darker reworking of ""The 1975"" (!!) that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a>; ""Lostmyhead"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>; the title track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/"" target=""_blank"">Everything Ecstatic</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>. Their stab at emulating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCCJc_V8_MQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Big Ship</a>"" is pretty good, except that it is called ""Please Be Naked"" (!!!). But, man: when compared to the UK's current crop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21495-phase/"" target=""_blank"">milquetoast electro-balladeers</a>, the 1975's unabashed pomp and seeming imperviousness to ridicule make you want to kiss them. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It helps, too, that <i>When you sleep</i> can be enormous fun. ""She's American"" is all slap-bass fizz and clenched-fist vocal delivery; ""The Sound"" is pumping, uber-camp piano house. Although their sound is clean-cut, Healy's lyrics are anything but: On the debut, Healy was coke-addled and fucked up, but <i>When you sleep</i> finds him trying to reform, a process hobbled by the circumstances of his new superstar life. Like a lot of <i>When you sleep</i>, his lyrics dip perilously from inspiring to embarrassing. For every neatly zeitgeist-capturing couplet like ""I'm just with my friends online and there's things we'd like to change"" from ""Love Me,"" there's something like, ""Caught up in fashion—Karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion"" from the same song, which only makes Healy sound like the trustafarian street poet that he already slightly resembles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Love Me"" is <i>nothing</i>, though, compared to its counterpart, ""Loving Someone,"" which will vindicate anyone who decided to hate the 1975 on principle. Musically it's an outlier—it has the sweet, compressed insectlike burble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Baths</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a>, and is the most synthetic thing here. Healy switches from singing to sort-of rapping, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4842-lily-allen/"" target=""_blank"">Lily Allen</a>-style, in forensic, anguished detail about the superficial example that the world shows to young people. Steady yourself: ""Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity of grief and its simplicity/ But I know that maybe I'm too skeptical/ Even Guy Debord needed spectacles/ You see, I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques and I'm trying to progress/ But instead of selling sex, I think I should be loving someone."" It's like something <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Neil Tennant</a> might have written if he had embraced the ludicrousness of mid-'80s pop instead of subverting it, and thank God he did.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dropping Debord's ""Society of the Spectacle"" is a massive 'look at me!' clanger, but Healy substantiates the song's agonies with unvarnished accounts of how he's fallen prey to these pressures. He often sings about his mental health: ""UGH!"" is West Coast funk R&amp;B lite about addiction, while ""The Ballad of Me and My Brain"" is pure stadium <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7100-sting/"" target=""_blank"">Sting</a> in which he searches for his mind; he figures he might have left it in a supermarket, where it's ""flirting with the girls."" He searches for a higher power on ""If I Believe You,"" a biblical, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a>-indebted slow jam gilded with a gospel choir. The closing lines are silly on paper—""if I'm lost, then how can I find myself?""—but buried in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a>-style ecclesiastical synth washes, his earnestness becomes surprisingly affecting. </p>
<p>In ""Loving Someone,"" Healy asked who would ""show the kids that they matter."" It's a trite line, but unlike so much <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21481-this-is-acting/"" target=""_blank"">""be yrself""</a> Hot 100 pop, the 1975 never coddles the listener; instead, they respect their audience by believing them to be capable of handling everything they sing about, from coke psychosis to dead grandmothers (""Nana"") and post-natal depression (""She Lays Down""). They give them the credit to find the Easter Eggs hidden in their music, from melodies that echo old material (""The Sound"" calls back to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq9GfM9DGc8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She Way Out</a>"") to sequels of first album situations (""A Change of Heart"" follows on from ""Robbers""). Perhaps their greatest tribute is that the 1975, despite being in their mid-twenties, are just like them: messy, earnest, vulnerable, unedited, gaudy. For Britain's biggest young guitar band to ditch laddy machismo, embrace the boy band ideal, and run on feeling rather than posturing—that feels kind of radical. <i>When you sleep</i> can be far <i>too</i> much, but it's not cynical.</p></div>"|21412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21412-i-like-it-when-you-sleep-for-you-are-so-beautiful-yet-so-unaware-of-it/|6.5|Laura Snapes

On <i>In My Mind</i>, his first major-label release, he doesn’t sing as much as he coos, adoringly, at the object of his affection, whose identity is renewed in each song. He might bring on current rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">Big K.R.I.T.</a>, but the real wellspring of his inspiration is Chicago soul music, and on <i>In My Mind</i> he both honors and renews the classic form. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tenderness is as inherent to Chicago soul music as the bass drop is to EDM, and BJ is surpassingly tender here, but that doesn't mean he's shy. Some of the tracks on <i>In My Mind</i> are so overtly sexual they could redden a teenager's ears. The adult and NSFW ""Love Inside,"" for instance, is <i>not</i> about someone being beautiful on the inside, à la Bruno Mars. It is about uncensored intimacy, as is ""Resume,"" ""Church,"" ""The New Cupid,"" ""Woman’s World,"" ""Heart Crush,"" and ""Turnin’ Me Up"". That’s almost half the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These songs represent the best of <i>In My Mind</i>. Sledge is in the zone when he’s singing <i>to</i> women, <i>about</i> women, and especially in praise of women, as he does on ""Woman's World."" A clever inversion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"" target=""_blank"">James Brown</a>’s ""It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World"", the track features Sledge doing his best Smokey Robinson impression atop doo-wop tones and a frenetic, electronically rendered string section.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s one of the highlights on <i>In My Mind</i>, alongside ""The New Cupid,"" in which Sledge laments what he sees as a lack of romance infecting his generation. Above a mellow sampling of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14945-raphael-saadiq/"" target=""_blank"">Raphael Saadiq</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmKJdHeMwEc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oh Girl</a>,"" Sledge wonders where Cupid has gone, before ultimately deciding that he must be ""too busy at the club."" It’s up to Sledge, then, to play matchmaker, because ""without a love song, something’s gonna go way wrong."" Both in subject matter and style, the song is similar to fellow Chicagoans Carl Thomas’ stunning but slept on single, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NirueQsVjeo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don’t Kiss Me</a>,"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a>’s saccharine ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W0K_EkDoHk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">When a Woman Loves</a>.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Turnin’ Me Up,"" Sledge enumerates the ways in which his lover satisfies his every need over an ever-thickening beat. On ""Church,"" the woman Sledge adores is determined to ruin his Sunday. It’s Saturday night and she wants to ""drink, do drugs, and have sex,"" and she doesn’t care that Sledge has to go to church in the morning. As Chance the Rapper says in his slick guest verse, ""She always say, 'hey, I don’t wanna be saved.'"" It's an interesting dynamic for a soul song: The woman is the protagonist, and the listener learns more about her likes and dislikes than Sledge’s. She is self-assured in her hedonism, happy to be the devil perched on Sledge’s quivering shoulder. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sledge is a very straightforward lyricist; he doesn't stunt, he yearns. His lyrics favor plainspoken confessions over catchy turns of phrase, and when the album falters, it's because his words reduce a pair of lovers to their mouths and hands.  Tracks like ""Man Down"" and ""Crazy"" make clear that Sledge is at his worst when he tries to reinvent the R&amp;B wheel. He knows too well what goes into a great soul song to be able to dismember it. He’s too much of a traditionalist, stubborn in his devotion to Chicago soul music and its unpretentious approach to sex, love and everything that happens in between.</p></div>"|21544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21544-in-my-mind/|7.6|Abigail Covington

""There are certain patterns of behavior you pick up when you’re young that never leave you, moments of tranquility that you get when you’re young that are always the most valuable,"" drawls Cale in voiceover, a soft and pliable topnote to the tender folk song underneath. The camera swoons over leaves rustling under a waterfall, cattle trotting benignly through verdant fields. ""That sense of nostalgia is always with you, because it’s a way of inuring you against the passage of time."" The film then smash-cuts to a white cow wedged into a slaughterhouse warren, eyes pleading as it’s shot in the skull, its throat is slit, and torrents of dark blood stream forth. It’s a transition of cruel and abrupt apathy, a needlessly gruesome pivot—Cale isn’t even present—and one that director James Marsh must have believed embodies Cale’s volatility throughout his long career.</p>
<p>Cale has long carved mercurial paths—first in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, where his eerie bass, piano, and viola parts pushed the band toward the eccentric end of the art-rock spectrum, then as a producer, when he captured the raw spirits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"">the Stooges</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Patti Smith</a> on both artists’ classic debut albums. The 73-year-old’s 15 solo albums touch on protopunk and classical and are niche to the point that some have been out of print for years; one of those works, 1982’s <i>Music for a New Society</i>, has been <a href=""http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/wild-mercury-sound/uncut-s-great-lost-albums-part-three-35545"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singled out</a> as a pernicious lost masterpiece, the spare and depressive about-face to his agitpop screed of the previous year, <i>Honi Soit</i>.</p>
<p>When <i>Music</i> was finally reissued this year, it came bundled Jekyll-Hyde style with <i>M:FANS</i>, a new reworking of the album. The latter isn’t as hagiographic as the acronym suggests—Nick Zinner isn’t here shaking a tambourine or anything—but is rather Cale’s attempt to revisit bleak characters through a lens of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62136-john-cale-reworks-music-for-a-new-society-as-mfans-reissues-original-album/"" target=""_blank"">rage instead of sorrow</a>, as well as process the death of his occasional nemesis <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>. Hearing both versions of the album together, especially by hopscotching to compare tracks directly, is a harrowing yet rewarding spree, not least because Cale’s originals often sound more modern than the new versions.</p>
<p>On <i>Music for a New Society</i>, sparse keyboard lines languish in chilly air, arid spaces imbued with acute confidence. Cale unfurls somber, detached appraisals of miserable lost souls, including mothers on murder sprees (""Taking Your Life in Your Hands"") and loners exhaling their death rattles (""Sanctus (Sanities)""), atop deconstructed bleats of churchy organs and dissonant strings. There are wisps of tight pop melodies perched atop a confluence of oddities—""Thoughtless Kind,"" a spooky dirge, pairs a thickly processed a capella refrain (""The best of times/ With the thoughtless kind"") with rough cackling and an agitating percussion line reminiscent of a ticking clock. ""Close Watch,"" its title cribbed from Cale’s septuagenarian spirit animal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash</a>, anatomizes loneliness via plodding piano and decomposing bagpipe bursts. Aside from the lone straightforward rocker, ""Changes Made,"" on which Allen Lanier of Blue Öyster Cult plays guitar, the semi-improvised record feels meticulously plotted and borderline intrusive—the most revealing scrawls yet from the solitary confinement of Cale’s fulminating mind.</p>
<p><i>M:FANS</i> is less reclusive, just by virtue of its premise—Cale is collaborating with himself, the ultimate glum foil—but also because it fills every swatch of white space with his later-career electro-industrial leanings. That needling chronograph tick on ""Thoughtless Kind"" is now gregarious, beefy with fizzing synths and hyper-processed coos. Amber Coffman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a> joins him to sing staccato microtones on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62136-john-cale-reworks-music-for-a-new-society-as-mfans-reissues-original-album/"">Close Watch</a>,"" a brusque and R&amp;B-leaning reimagining virtually unrecognizable from its weepy source material. ""Sanctus (Sanities)"" also proves malleable, Cale intoning a requiem of personal and general-interest doom (""It was a marriage made… in the grave!"" is not the least histrionic line) over a driving mechanical stomp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> would’ve relished. It’s a lot of futurism sourced from the '90s, which highlights Cale’s prescience in the first go-‘round.</p>
<p>Cale is clearly still curious as an artist; in recent years, he’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17120-shift-adventures-in-nookie-wood/"" target=""_blank"">collaborated with Danger Mouse</a> and <a href=""http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/john-cale"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">represented the motherland at the Venice Biennale</a>. Hell, he practically flirted with Bond villainy two years ago, when he <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/14/john-cale-liam-young-cale-drone-bot-sinister-future"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commanded a horde of wasp drones</a> onstage in London. Still, there’s a greater vigor, and a real lack of vanity, to releasing a notorious lost album and upending it in the same breath. That these projects work in tandem, three decades removed, gives nostalgia a good name.</p></div>"|21619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21619-mfans-music-for-a-new-society/|8.5|Stacey Anderson

<p>Cale has long carved mercurial paths—first in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, where his eerie bass, piano, and viola parts pushed the band toward the eccentric end of the art-rock spectrum, then as a producer, when he captured the raw spirits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"">the Stooges</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Patti Smith</a> on both artists’ classic debut albums. The 73-year-old’s 15 solo albums touch on protopunk and classical and are niche to the point that some have been out of print for years; one of those works, 1982’s <i>Music for a New Society</i>, has been <a href=""http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/wild-mercury-sound/uncut-s-great-lost-albums-part-three-35545"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singled out</a> as a pernicious lost masterpiece, the spare and depressive about-face to his agitpop screed of the previous year, <i>Honi Soit</i>.</p>
<p>When <i>Music</i> was finally reissued this year, it came bundled Jekyll-Hyde style with <i>M:FANS</i>, a new reworking of the album. The latter isn’t as hagiographic as the acronym suggests—Nick Zinner isn’t here shaking a tambourine or anything—but is rather Cale’s attempt to revisit bleak characters through a lens of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62136-john-cale-reworks-music-for-a-new-society-as-mfans-reissues-original-album/"" target=""_blank"">rage instead of sorrow</a>, as well as process the death of his occasional nemesis <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>. Hearing both versions of the album together, especially by hopscotching to compare tracks directly, is a harrowing yet rewarding spree, not least because Cale’s originals often sound more modern than the new versions.</p>
<p>On <i>Music for a New Society</i>, sparse keyboard lines languish in chilly air, arid spaces imbued with acute confidence. Cale unfurls somber, detached appraisals of miserable lost souls, including mothers on murder sprees (""Taking Your Life in Your Hands"") and loners exhaling their death rattles (""Sanctus (Sanities)""), atop deconstructed bleats of churchy organs and dissonant strings. There are wisps of tight pop melodies perched atop a confluence of oddities—""Thoughtless Kind,"" a spooky dirge, pairs a thickly processed a capella refrain (""The best of times/ With the thoughtless kind"") with rough cackling and an agitating percussion line reminiscent of a ticking clock. ""Close Watch,"" its title cribbed from Cale’s septuagenarian spirit animal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash</a>, anatomizes loneliness via plodding piano and decomposing bagpipe bursts. Aside from the lone straightforward rocker, ""Changes Made,"" on which Allen Lanier of Blue Öyster Cult plays guitar, the semi-improvised record feels meticulously plotted and borderline intrusive—the most revealing scrawls yet from the solitary confinement of Cale’s fulminating mind.</p>
<p><i>M:FANS</i> is less reclusive, just by virtue of its premise—Cale is collaborating with himself, the ultimate glum foil—but also because it fills every swatch of white space with his later-career electro-industrial leanings. That needling chronograph tick on ""Thoughtless Kind"" is now gregarious, beefy with fizzing synths and hyper-processed coos. Amber Coffman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a> joins him to sing staccato microtones on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62136-john-cale-reworks-music-for-a-new-society-as-mfans-reissues-original-album/"">Close Watch</a>,"" a brusque and R&amp;B-leaning reimagining virtually unrecognizable from its weepy source material. ""Sanctus (Sanities)"" also proves malleable, Cale intoning a requiem of personal and general-interest doom (""It was a marriage made… in the grave!"" is not the least histrionic line) over a driving mechanical stomp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> would’ve relished. It’s a lot of futurism sourced from the '90s, which highlights Cale’s prescience in the first go-‘round.</p>
<p>Cale is clearly still curious as an artist; in recent years, he’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17120-shift-adventures-in-nookie-wood/"" target=""_blank"">collaborated with Danger Mouse</a> and <a href=""http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/john-cale"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">represented the motherland at the Venice Biennale</a>. Hell, he practically flirted with Bond villainy two years ago, when he <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/14/john-cale-liam-young-cale-drone-bot-sinister-future"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commanded a horde of wasp drones</a> onstage in London. Still, there’s a greater vigor, and a real lack of vanity, to releasing a notorious lost album and upending it in the same breath. That these projects work in tandem, three decades removed, gives nostalgia a good name.</p></div>"|21619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21619-mfans-music-for-a-new-society/|6.0|Stacey Anderson

The shortest of its nine untitled tracks is nearly eight minutes long, and three run to 13 minutes or more. You don't get the sense the track lengths stem from any sort of desire to grandstand; it just looks like Thomas didn't much feel like editing himself. The whole album runs more than an hour and a half, beats halting and restarting, synths drifting willy-nilly over muted basslines, and arrangements wandering free as clouds. It is a vision of ambient music in bathrobe and slippers, slurping milk straight from the carton at the all-night grocery; it is The Dude of ambient. </div>
<p>Of course, the Dude was pretty cool, and so is <i>Principe del Norte</i>, which comes across as genial, charmingly rumpled, and totally unflappable. These songs appear to have been improvised and recorded across long studio jams, and the main compositional guideline seems to dictate only that the music is limited to what Thomas can play with his own two hands—or his sequencers—at any given moment. <span>Take ""C,"" which begins with patient, parallel synthesizer lines, teases with a pitter-pat beat, falls back into a beatless breakdown—mashed keys, a wrong note or two—and then ramps back up into its full chug. There's yet another false ending at the eight-and-a-half minute mark, before the arpeggios fire up again for a four-minute denouement.</span>Disco's pulse is implicit in the four-to-the-floor beats of the album's heavier cuts (""E,"" ""F,"" ""G"") and in faintly funky basslines that crop up here and there, but the album draws most of its inspiration from '70s German electronic artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5842-manuel-gottsching/"" target=""_blank"">Manuel Göttsching</a>.</p>
<p>In his notes to the album, Thomas cites the influence of '90s ambient artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"" target=""_blank"">the KLF</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"" target=""_blank"">the Orb</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5189-the-black-dog/"" target=""_blank"">the Black Dog</a>, but for the most part, <i>Principe del Norte </i>scans as a logical extension of Thomas' previous work, just with the drums dialed way down. The lone exception is the final track, ""H,"" which might be one of the heaviest things he's ever recorded; with its thudding bass kicks, cavernous bass kicks, and monotone clatter and grind, it sounds almost like his attempt at Berghain-style techno. (""D,"" which uses some of the same elements, scans more as Thomas' interpretation of dub techno in the tradition of Chain Reaction.) Unlike proper warehouse techno, though, ""H"" retains all of Thomas' habitual characteristics—idiosyncratic, loosey-goosey, a little unkempt. Does anyone need 13-plus minutes of it? Perhaps not, but you don't come to <i>Principe del Norte </i>for concision. You come to kick back, get lost in Thomas' textures, and forget about time for a while. It's not music for airports; it's music for beanbag chairs, and that's just fine.</p></div>"|21435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21435-principe-del-norte/|6.8|Philip Sherburne

At the beginning of this decade, the Bronx-bred rapper was drifting somewhere between ""budding star"" and ""also-ran,"" hawking DVDs and mixtapes anchored by his more-famous friends. By the end of 2014, he was living a parallel life as Fitzgeraldian social climber stuck in a real-life safari of leopards and Kardashians. (Here's a<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiDOGXx_DSU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> video</a> called ""2 Chainz and French Montana Feed a $40K Giraffe."")</p>
<p>Last May, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33106-chinx/"" target=""_blank"">Chinx</a>, a Far Rockaway native who was a close friend to and collaborator with French, was killed in a still-unsolved shooting. (The NYPD has said that they believe his murder might be tied to the 2007 killing of Stack Bundles, another collaborator.) It's in the shadow of that tragedy that French's new mixtape, <i>Wave Gods</i>, begins: ""They threw me in the black hole, I had to climb up/ Once Chinx passed, I took some time off."" On the tape's cover, French is joined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29628-max-b/"" target=""_blank"">Max B</a>, his kindred creative spirit who isn't up for parole until 2042. He's finally at the top—or at least adjacent to it—but he had to come alone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Wave Gods</i> hears French bring moments of tragedy and Technicolor excess to life frequently and in equal measure. ""Holy Moly"" is all joy (""My bitch from Cuba and my lawyer Jewish""); on the ""Sanctuary"" remix, he borrows <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>'s ""Bring the drugs, baby, I'ma bring my pain."" Sometimes, they're shoehorned into the same verse: on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>- and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a>-featuring ""Figure It Out,"" French considers Chinx and Max, Eazy E, Allen Iverson, and Bill Cosby, but also slips in ""Why I fucked them both when they said they're sisters?"" and you can practically hear him grinning at the camera.</p>
<p>Until now, French had spent much of his career as the weakest, or at least most anonymous rapper in the room. Most fans push both <i>Coke Wave</i> installments into the Max B canon. His introduction to pop audiences came on ""<a href=""https://vimeo.com/34663993"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stay Schemin</a>,"" which was more noted for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>'s shots at Common and Vanessa Bryant. His 2013 Bad Boy/Maybach Music Group debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18178-french-montana-excuse-my-french/"" target=""_blank""><i>Excuse My French</i></a>, had more guests (Drake, Nicki, Wayne, Snoop) than tracks, suffered dismal reviews, and failed to sell 100,000 copies. Worse still, his detractors—many of whom were presumably unfamiliar with his earlier work—wrote him off as a relic from a dead era, a last gasp for old New York heads who couldn't or wouldn't get with the times.</p>
<p>In reality, French was never a classicist in any sense, and certainly not a '90s revivalist. His golden age was the mid- and late-2000s, when Wayne and T-Pain dominated radio, and when Max was turning Harlem into a grim, funhouse mirror version of that sound. On <i>Wave Gods</i>, French has improved his writing, sure, but more importantly has imagined a world where that sound became the dominant commercial mode, where the precision of trap or the maximalism of drill never took over, where we're left with something more stripped down, woozier, wavier.</p>
<p>And so this time, the guests bend into his orbit. Quavo's staccato triplets on ""Groupie Love"" are blunted by the Auto-Tune. Kodak Black is 13 years younger and from 1,200 miles south, but on ""Lock Jaw"" sounds like he's been locked in a give-and-go for years. On ""Jackson 5,"" he puts an original stamp on the same sort of soul loops that have been dominating the city's mixtape circuit since the early W. Bush years. The prevailing atmosphere on <i>Wave Gods</i> is so strong that the one time French does yield home court, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> on ""Miley Cyrus,"" it's jarring, despite being an excellent song in its own right.</p>
<p><i>Wave Gods</i> ends with two appearances from Chinx—""All Over"" and yet another remix of ""Off the Rip."" It's a touching tribute from an artist who was eager to share the spotlight when it was a necessity, and remains so now that he can carry songs on his own. ""Rip"" in particular is moving in this new context, at its strange intersection of celebration and memorial. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>, the song's latest guest, implores the audience to ""pay attention, I'm the main event."" That might have been true before, but it isn't anymore.</p></div>"|21657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21657-wave-gods/|7.9|Paul A. Thompson

The program came about during a relatively fallow period for the showbiz brood, after the Jackson 5 ignited nationwide fervor with hits like ""ABC"" and ""I’ll Be There"" but before Michael Jackson set out for solo superstardom. Their future success seemed in doubt, and the show—with its glaring lights, sparkling costumes, and rampant cheesiness—was a Vegas-style extravaganza that played to well-worn pleasures. One recurring segment called ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFtj6SVaqbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On the Wall</a>"" saw Michael inviting various guest hosts to sign a fake brick facade and do a little dance before everyone eventually ended up in a frozen <i>ta-dah!</i> pose. Though Michael was all smiles on ""The Jacksons,"" he later claimed that he ""hated every minute"" of it. During the show’s year-long run, he was smack in the middle of gangly teenagedom, acne and all. Raised in the limelight by an infamously strict father, Michael was painfully self-conscious, worried that he might never be able to shake his child stardom. He didn’t want to merely cling to his family’s fading notoriety. He wanted to break away from it completely.</p>
<p><i>Off the Wall</i> is the sound of that liberation. And he knew exactly what he was doing. On November 6, 1979, just as the album was starting to take off, Michael wrote a <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mjs-manifesto-penned-in-1979/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">note</a> to himself on the back of a tour itinerary, a proclamation of self so ambitious it could make Kanye blush. ""MJ will be my new name, no more Michael Jackson. I want a whole new character, a whole new look, I should be a totally different person. People should never think of me as the kid who sang ‘ABC’ [and] ‘I Want You Back,’"" he jotted down. ""I should be a new incredible actor singer dancer that will shock the world. I will do no interviews. I will be magic. I will be a perfectionist, a researcher, a trainer, a masterer… I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it. Take it steps further from where the greats left off.""</p>
<p>Those words were eerily prescient in many ways, of course, but they also highlight one of Michael’s most important dualities: He wanted to be magical—to defy expectation and reality—but he knew that such skills could not materialize from thin air. He understood that exceptionalism took hard work. Growing up in the Motown system, he would often sit in on sessions, soaking up lessons from the greats: Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations. He studied the way James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr., and Fred Astaire moved their feet onstage, in movies, and on TV. At 17, he counted hallowed masters like Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Duke Ellington among his favorite songwriters. He had released four solo albums in the early ’70s, but <i>Off the Wall</i>, which came out when he was 21, finally allowed him to flex all those hours of research into something that was his.</p>
<p>It also marked a moment of idealism. Around the time of <i>Off the Wall</i>, Michael’s musical and physical changes felt natural—joyous extensions of the black American experience. Disco was overwhelmingly popular, breaking down color lines and radio formats while offering utopia on the dancefloor. Coming from the segregated, working-class city of Gary, Ind., Jackson's achievements and acceptance represented a rosy view of the country’s future. But 1979 was scarred by the beginning of the quasi-racist ""disco sucks"" backlash; Michael also got his first nose job that year, narrowing his nostrils. And though he would become even more successful in the '80s, those astronomical heights sometimes catered to white tastes—in both appearance and sound—in a way that could seem effortful, cynical, and sad.</p>
<p>So part of the reason why <i>Off the Wall</i> remains so unabashedly fun to return to involves that lack of baggage. For 41 minutes, we can live in the eternally young Neverland Michael longed for, a universe largely without consequence or death. This lasting affection is reiterated by a new Spike Lee documentary, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F54kIhEQ7p0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall</i></a>, which is included in this CD/DVD reissue and finds Jackson family members and associates, along with more modern stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>’s Abel Tesfaye, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/"" target=""_blank"">?uestlove</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a>, paying tribute to Michael’s earliest incarnations. ""<i>Off the Wall</i> was definitely the one that made me feel like I could sing,"" says Tesfaye in the doc, which was in part produced by executors of Michael’s estate and barely mentions anything about the artist’s life after <i>Off the Wall</i>.</p>
<p>The album was released toward the tail end of the disco era and it managed to encompass much of what made that style so infectious while also pushing out its edges. ""Our underlying plan was to take disco out. That was the bottom line,"" the record’s producer, Quincy Jones, once said. ""I admired disco, don’t get me wrong. I just thought it had gone far enough."" Jones, a calm, jazzy Zen master who had worked with Dizzy Gillespie, Frank Sinatra, and Count Basie, helped Michael flesh out his own songs as well as tracks written by others, putting forth a record that is at once beautifully simple and sneakily complex.</p>
<p>Most of these songs follow the most basic disco tenet: Put all of your worries behind you and just dance. Michael took part in this type of ecstasy while filming 1978’s <i>The Wiz</i> in New York City, when he would spend his downtime brushing shoulders with the likes of Woody Allen, Liza Minelli, Steven Tyler, and Jane Fonda at Studio 54. By all accounts, Michael didn’t take part in the club’s notorious orgies of sex and drugs, but he observed it, standing by the DJ booth and noticing which songs drew the biggest reactions. And he would dance, getting high off of the music and movement around him.</p>
<p>Alongside Jones, Michael made his own disco anthems, but rather than merely copying what came before, he expanded the form with dense, orchestral arrangements that mixed in sophisticated layers of strings, horns, and syncopation while never never losing their underlying funk. This is heard on iconic opener ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yURRmWtbTbo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough</a>,"" the first song Michael ever wrote by himself and the first of four record-breaking Top 10 hits from the album, which has now sold 30 million copies worldwide. It's an ode to the power of romantic love, something Michael had little experience with at that point. But the track’s intricacies, as well as the singer’s effortlessly rhythmic yelps and phrasing, suggest a deeper understanding, one that goes beyond words. Another Michael-penned track, ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/MWnyCxva6bA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Working Day and Night</a>,"" hints at the detrimental effects of his workaholic upbringing and an encroaching paranoia, though ricocheting guitar lines and exuberant horns keep the groove moving along smoothly.</p>
<p>There are more overt experiments here, too. ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/NR9ALPjrNVo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Off the Wall</a>"" begins with 15 seconds of sinister-sounding laughter and spaced-out instrumentation—a precursor to the high-wattage oddities of ""Thriller""; co-written by Stevie Wonder and originally intended for <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>, ""I Can’t Help It"" incorporates smooth jazz and twinkling synths—its influence on Pharrell’s off-kilter funk cannot be overstated. The ballad ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/6DQJPL9Yuq0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She’s Out of My Life</a>"" risks stopping the album cold with its beat-less melodrama but ends up being a classic of the form, with Michael audibly moved to tears at the end of the song, his voice cracking. It’s an imperfect moment from a noted perfectionist, and Jones’ production handles the emotion with understated grace. ""A lesser producer would have milked all that drama for all it’s worth,"" says ?uestlove in the doc, laughing. ""Trust me, if Puffy was producing ‘She’s Out of My Life’ he would have had… Kleenex sponsor the tour.""</p>
<p>The joke resonates. <i>Off the Wall</i> is the product of a boy who was reared by his father to be a product, whose idols were often found on his TV screen, who understood his own commodification enough to want to reject it—while also aiming to sell a gazillion albums and unite the world and become the ultimate entertainer. There are many contradictions in that quest and, in hindsight, Michael’s subsequent pitfalls almost seem inevitable. But <i>Off the Wall </i>was that unlikely moment of balance, when Michael Jackson’s purity and innocence still seemed holy, not stunted or distorted. When he cried on record, he was living his art, giving us a genuine performance.</p></div>"|21548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21548-off-the-wall/|10.0|Ryan Dombal

They’ve inspected and cast aside the iconoclast cool of John, girded themselves against the snug, romantic haze of Paul. (A basic lack of sociopathy steers them from Ringo trutherism.) Harrison’s tribe is possessive because he, along with Bowie and Morrissey, was one of rock’s great shepherds of outsiders—a gentle mascot for those who also feel a bit <i>too</i> curious, a little <i>too</i> sensitive when held to bright lights. His consistent relegation to second-tier creative status inside the Beatles—one of the most famous yet undermined faces in the world, plunked courtside next to two massive egos—gave his songwriting a special undertow of empathy that his bandmates never touched. Those who identify with his dark-horse journey are a motley, loyal breed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A similar reverence runs through<i> George Fest: A Night to Celebrate the Music of George Harrison</i>, a live double album with the ramshackle, collaborative warmth of a Traveling Wilburys set. Taped at L.A.’s Fonda Theatre in September 2014, the evening cribs together a varied roster—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">the Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6300-norah-jones/"" target=""_blank"">Norah Jones</a>, Britt Daniel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"" target=""_blank"">Spoon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12459-brandon-flowers/"" target=""_blank"">Brandon Flowers</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"" target=""_blank"">the Killers</a>, and Harrison’s dopplegänger son, Dhani Harrison—for campfire spins on familiar Beatles and solo fare. It’s an amiable, unofficial sort of sequel to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj4J6i_vw0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Concert for George</a>, which was held at Royal Albert Hall in 2002 with Paul and Ringo, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, and Billy Preston—but this time, it’s staffed largely with Dhani’s peers. (He co-produced the charity event, which will also be released on DVD.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like most tributes, it’s not a particularly exploratory evening, but the parish is earnest. Song allotments are logical, and most artists hew closely to Harrison’s vocal cadences and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/overtones/9522-notes-you-never-hear-the-metaphysical-loneliness-of-george-harrison/"" target=""_blank"">cryptic guitars</a>. Britt Daniel lends some yowling panache to ""I Me Mine"" (off <i>Let It Be</i>) and the underrated folk singer/model Karen Elson adds a reedy quaver through ""I’d Have You Anytime,"" the delicate opening of Harrison’s stellar triple album <i>All Things Must Pass</i> (and a <a href=""http://www.beatlesbible.com/people/george-harrison/songs/id-have-you-anytime/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bromantic ode to Bob Dylan</a>). Norah Jones, daughter of one of Harrison’s most influential collaborators, the late sitarist Ravi Shankar—and a lovely voice who never quite gets her due for melodic winsomeness—adds subtle inversions to ""Something,"" an evening standout. Dhani Harrison, a truly uncanny vocal and visual heir, spurs on some of the night’s liveliest moments with the <i>White Album</i> eccentricity ""Savoy Truffle"" and the more contemplative solo missive ""Let It Down.""  Those not following along on the tracklist might furrow their brows to the billowing chorus of ""What Is Life""—that is, indeed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10976-weird-al-yankovic/"" target=""_blank"">""Weird Al"" Yankovic</a>, crooning the euphoric <i>All Things Must Pass</i> hit utterly straight, not even tweaking the lyrics into ""Hobbit Strife"" or anything.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The evening’s highlight, not least for rarity: Brian Wilson, tackling Harrison’s <a href=""http://performingsongwriter.com/george-harrison-my-sweet-lord/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contentious classic</a> ""My Sweet Lord,"" with support from fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine, Ann Wilson of Heart, and others. It’s fair to say Wilson wouldn’t have his legacy today without Harrison and the Beatles—his watershed <i>Pet Sounds</i> was an attempt to outshine their <i>Rubber Soul</i>, and the friendly ensuing arms race beget <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> and the <i>Smile</i> sessions. There’s welcome ardor in Wilson’s scratchy delivery; he sounds more enlivened than in many other recent projects, including much of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20367-brian-wilson-no-pier-pressure/"" target=""_blank"">last studio album</a> and the Beach Boys’ 50th anniversary tour. (As he recalls boyishly in the film’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZionmVDC40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trailer</a>, of a moment several decades prior, ""When I heard ‘My Sweet Lord,’ I just about croaked!"") </p>
<p>There are a few stumbles—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4974-cold-war-kids/"" target=""_blank"">Cold War Kids</a>’ yodeling, slack delivery of ""Taxman"" sounds borderline drunk, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29477-the-black-ryder/"" target=""_blank"">the Black Ryder</a>’s ""Isn’t It a Pity"" is a bit static for such an elegy. No one touches ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" a surprising omission; maybe Dhani is sick of hearing it mangled every time he pops into Guitar Center. But as an act of low-impact celebration, <i>George Fest</i> is a fine affair. More noise for the Quiet Beatle is welcome anytime.</p></div>"|21607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21607-george-fest-a-night-to-celebrate-the-music-of-george-harrison/|6.8|Stacey Anderson

Instead, when they started anew following a brief hiatus in the early '80s, frontman and co-founder Jon Langford chose to train their gaze across the pond, led by the spirit guides of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"" target=""_blank"">Hank Williams</a>. Their next album, 1985’s <i>Fear and Whiskey</i>, didn’t just execute a brilliant and unlikely-seeming stylistic merger, it ushered in a whole new generation of imitators, acolytes, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">icons</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Langford's continued interest in Americana has produced several Chicago-based side projects, as well: There's Pine Valley Cosmonauts, a revolving door of tributes covers for artists like Cash and Bob Wills, and then there's the Waco Brothers, a heavier group with a more deliberate populist pulse. Following a decade of dalliances—a covers album and B-sides collection here, a collaboration with songwriter Paul Burch there—the latter band’s returned with <i>Going Down in History</i>, their first studio LP since 2005’s <i>Freedom and Weep </i>and a tight (if occasionally underwhelming) set of aggressive heartland rock. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Twenty years on, the Bros’ grizzled sonics are set. Opener ""DIYBYOB,"" set off by Dean ""Deano"" Schlabowske's throaty twang and clattering axe, immediately brings us back into familiar territory. Therein lies the genius of Schlabowske's first line: ""This is the first track from the last album/ No one knows which way this ship will head."" Depending on your interpretation, the lyric could be a knowing wink to the same ol’-same ol’ of the band’s chosen style, a masochistic joke, or even a tongue-in-cheek resignation—either way, it adds a crucial twist to an otherwise straightforward bit of songcraft.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Indeed, playfulness abounds on <i>Going Down in History. </i>For a reflection on the dead-end determinism of the status quo, ""Building Our Own Prison"" proves downright chipper, with an onomatopoeiac, syncopated hook (a spirited ""Click clack clackety-clack,"" right on the beat of the jagged fretwork). Meanwhile, ""We Know It"" offers an all-purpose anthem for, well, anything; Langford’s croons of ""We know it when we see it/ We know it by its name"" could stand in for God, the Devil, or the mold beneath your kitchen tiles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s not all fun and games, though—political disillusionment and hand-wringing reflections of the working class remain a perennial concern for the Waco Brothers, and the pervading outsider’s perspective resonates strongly in a tumultuous campaign season. <i>Going Down in History </i>may not mark a sea change for Langford and company, but between the humor, the honky-tonk, and the affable, full-bodied sound, it’s an awesome chance to catch up.</p></div>"|21560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21560-going-down-in-history/|6.7|Zoe Camp

Trap-influenced drum patterns dominate electro-pop, spaced-out synths are <i>de rigueur</i> in rap, and hybrid producers have become some of electronic music's biggest stars. As what’s left of the wall crumbles, we’re seeing more extended collaborations between rappers and electro-pop artists, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>’s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"" target=""_blank"">Big Boi</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28373-phantogram/"" target=""_blank"">Phantogram</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21166-big-grams/"" target=""_blank"">Big Grams</a>.</p>
<p>AMTHST is the latest partnership in this mold. It finds Bay Area rapper and producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31117-n-the-traffic-ft-nite-jewel-and-j-stalin/"" target=""_blank"">Droop-E</a> teaming up with Ramona Gonzalez, the singer/songwriter behind L.A. synth-pop act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>. This isn’t the first time the pair have linked up--Droop-E’s 2013 song ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1R7GWh3CNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">N the Traffic</a>"" featured Gonzales on the hook—though this time around, they’re working together more closely, collaborating on the production as well as the songwriting. <i>Euphoria</i>, their debut EP under the name AMTHST, is a record that revels in distance: the distance between hip-hop and electro-pop, the distance between men and women, the distance between L.A. and the Bay.</p>
<p>Droop-E and Gonzales do have plenty in common musically, though, and they quickly find a sonic middle ground on <i>Euphoria</i>, marrying the laid-back bounce of Bay-Area rap to the gauzy atmospherics of Nite Jewel’s early work. This is nocturnal music, built from layers of synths, wet snare hits, and plenty of echo. The songs unfurl at a languid, practically chopped-and-screwed pace, and both Droop-E and Gonzalez luxuriate in the production, trading off verses and choruses with an easy cadence.</p>
<p>While Droop-E and Gonzalez are a natural fit as musicians, <i>Euphoria</i>’s most compelling moments leverage their divergent vocal approaches. ""Thug Passion,"" a smoldering trip-hop number, casts the pair as two lovers talking past one another. ""You don’t call me back,"" Gonzales sighs. ""You don’t know me."" Droop-E, meanwhile, mutters noncomittally in the background, suggesting, ""We can just chill out, relax."" ""I Wonder"" flips this script: Droop-E is in full pursuit, thirstily spitting game, while Gonzales eludes his advances. ""You tell me lots of things/ What do they really mean?/ The more I wonder,"" she chirps back. Both of these songs feel like nuanced counterpoints to the one-sided narratives that drive most hip-hop and pop songs—they’re conversations, not accusations.</p>
<p>""Over Zone,"" a meditation on intoxication and its consequences, goes further yet, digging into the ways that gender mediates our pursuit of euphoria. On first listen, the song recalls a similar anthem—its pitched-down call-and-reponse refrain is pretty similar to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13880-kendrick-lamar-swimming-pools-drank/"" target=""_blank"">Swimming Pools (Drank)</a>""—but merits a closer reading. During a set piece in the song’s midsection, Gonzales drunkenly attempts to leave a club—when she’s stopped, she insists that she just needs some fresh air. ""Nah, I saw you stumbling out there, you’re not fooling anyone,"" a sinister voice responds, as water-logged synths close in around the track. The scene then switches to Droop-E, who finds himself in a similar predicament, careening down a hallway in search of a place to vomit. ""Give me some bread and some spring water and I’ll be cool, shit,"" he raps—a bit of bravado, perhaps, but also a tacit acknowledgement that his safety isn’t in question despite his drunkenness.</p>
<p>For a five-song EP, <i>Euphoria</i> packs quite a bit of depth. Both Droop-E and Gonzalez have managed to preserve what makes them distinctive while working in tandem; the reward here lies in examining the seams where two very different approaches collide. Admittedly, there is a background music quality to these songs—the consistently drowsy pace holds the EP back from fully engaging the listener at times—though that slow simmer suits the subject matter well. Nonetheless, <i>Euphoria</i>’s five songs effectively evoke the distance of a strained conversation, even if they are clearly the product of a deep mutual understanding.</p></div>"|21608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21608-euphoria-ep/|7.1|Mehan Jayasuriya

The Seattle electro-pop duo populate their debut album <i>Talk to Me So I Can Fall Asleep</i> with distant couples who hide behind glowing screens, barely speaking, and veiling their limited exchanges in so many layers of irony that they can hardly decode each other when they speak.</p>
<p> On opener ""Crater Head,"" the duo single out a culprit behind this lonely existence: ""I blame the Internet,"" they sing. At first the line reads like a joke, a dig at the Internet using the quippy language of the Internet, but with each repeated listen it sounds more like a genuine thesis statement. <i>Talk to Me</i> is filled with lyrics like this, little asides that seem cheeky or aloof until suddenly they don't anymore.</p>
<p> Gomez and Gordon cast their stones knowing full well they live in a glass house. The Internet has fostered a generation of jaded, apathetic cynics, and they're just as driftless and disaffected as anybody else. Gomez spends ""Habits Die Slow"" drawing on a sleeping lover's face because she's bored, then getting stoned and blowing off what few weekend responsibilities she had. Mostly she just sits around, watching her relationship rot but doing nothing to stop it, like her life is a TV show and Netflix keeps auto-playing the next episode without her so much as pressing a button.</p>
<p>Crater’s music has been labeled as industrial, but that term suggests a level of aggression even the group's most beat-heavy tracks never quite muster. For the most part, <i>Talk to Me</i> is too dreamy and congenial, too good-humored, to be industrial. The album's early highlight ""Ain't Right"" is a straight pop song, so personable and deliriously catchy it could be a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"">Tegan and Sara</a> single, right down to the perky new-wave guitars and merrily self-loathing chorus.</p>
<p>That song delivers such a dopamine rush you spend the rest of the album hoping there might be another just like it. There isn't, but what follows is pretty good in its own right. ""Lucky Lucy"" rocks a heavy ""Safety Dance"" keyboard lick, while ""Summer Skin"" and ""Hardly at All"" both boil over with feverish trip-hop beats. ""Holy Ground"" and ""Sick Sad World,"" meanwhile, each rotate around frigid basslines caked in the frost of an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">Cure</a> album. The record thrives on these sorts of hot and cold extremes. Some passages swell with emotion; others are dispassionately robotic. Most songs find room for both.</p>
<p>The last record to cycle through electronic, post-punk, dub, and R&amp;B textures with this kind of assured dream logic was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28034-warpaint/"" target=""_blank"">Warpaint</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18892-warpaint-warpaint/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a>. Warpaint is nominally a rock band and Crater is nominally an electronic act, but both share a gift for creating intrigue that makes even their patchier songs fascinating to hear unfold. Both acts also cultivate cooler-than-thou personas seemingly for the sake of deflating them, letting their guard down during unexpected moments of vulnerability. One of <i>Talk to Me</i>'s most poignant ones comes on the hard-thumping closer ""Brew,"" when Gomez cuts through the bullshit and finally spells out her relationship desires: ""Won't you take good care of me and we can dance for each other?"" And while we don't learn if her request is answered, the sheer act of making it feels like a step in the right direction: no mind games, no Internet speak—just an open plea for a meaningful connection. There's no guarantee of reciprocity, but it's a start.</p></div>"|21620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21620-talk-to-me-so-i-can-fall-asleep/|6.5|Evan Rytlewski

Freshly split from her massively underrated Philly ska-punk/new wave band Stiffed, she found her way to a fresher, grimier rock-pop sound. Eight years later, <i>Santogold</i> pretty much stands as filler-free document of its time, and it maintains its integrity no matter how many <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qINu0-iWwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bud Light Limes it sold</a>. In the meantime, Santi White has released a darker sophomore effort (2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16570-master-of-my-make-believe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Master of My Make-Believe</i></a>), had a baby, took on acting jobs, and is now attempting to shed her more jaded side for a sunshine-bright pop album, shaded with biting commentary on consumerism and the price of art. It comes across as a pointed reaction to her own success over the past decade: If <i>Master of My Make-Believ</i>e was a trip down the rabbit hole post-Santogold, <i>99¢</i> tries to be the yin to its yang: a hyper-positive, yet self-aware, happy-pill remedy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The moment on <i>99¢</i> where it all comes together is on ""Banshee,"" an absolute firestorm of a track co-written with Cathy Dennis, the bonafide genius hit-maker behind chart-toppers from ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfr9bhSmfXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can't Get You Out of My Head</a>"" to ""<a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/britney-spears/toxic-(official-video)/USZM20400003"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toxic</a>."" A bubbling cauldron of handclaps and perky synths, ""Banshee"" sounds like the soundtrack to a military invasion by a chorus of anime schoolgirls. The joy is so pure that it casts a pall over actual lead single ""Chasing Shadows,"" co-written and produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12072-rostam-batmanglij/"" target=""_blank"">Rostam Batmanglij</a>, which basically plods along inoffensively until it ends. The faltering momentum grinds to a complete halt during ""Walking in a Circle,"" which resembles a trap version of the Siamese twin cats' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpPGE_SKtA4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a> from <i>The Lady and the Tramp</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>99¢'</i>s other major winning moment is ""Who Be Lovin’ Me,"" which reinforces the theory that there are few things <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"" target=""_blank"">iLoveMakonnen</a>'s soft and sleepy flow can't improve. Santi matches his rhymes beat for beat, meanwhile, revealing surprising prowess as a rapper. ""Rendezvous Girl"" is a tasty nugget of '80s synthpop (down to the lyrics about a powerful businesswoman ""sashaying through town""), driving the second half of the album into more stable territory. ""Outside the War"" begins to dip again, but luckily the end is salvaged by the ""Run the Races,"" an effectively plaintive ballad co-produced with Batmanglij that profits from wailing guitars from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>' Nick Zinner, and ""Who I Thought You Were,"" the album's upbeat rock-pop closer.</p>
<p>The album veers awkwardly like this, sometimes giving the impression that Santigold is getting in her own way. At her best, she elevates the party song to an artform; ""Walking in a Circle"" and its soundalikes lack the enthusiasm and focus that we know she is capable of, as if these lulls are the result of trying to balance out <i>99¢</i>’s serotonin rush. Self-consciousness is usually the enemy of a good party, and the downtempo moments feel like she’s pumping the brakes on her own talent. The album is presented as a consumerist critique, intentionally blurring the line between artist and product, but the quality of the songs varies too widely to pull off an actual concept album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even as a tongue-in-cheek statement, Santigold is worth more than her self-affixed <i>99¢</i> price tag, and the peaks of this record just about outweigh its valleys. But for all its colorful packaging and flirtations with bubblegum pop,<i> 99¢</i> feels constrained, like she took the cover image literally and vacuum-sealed all of her best traits—reggae-tinted riffs, candy-colored fashion, Casio synths—into one too-neat package. On <i>99¢</i>, sealed away they remain, poking through the plastic just enough to tantalize.</p></div>"|21439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21439-99/|6.8|Cameron Cook

If you listen to his first regional hit, 2000’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU3kAr2gXpk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">After I Fuck Your Bitch</a>,"" and then his recent viral breakout, last year’s ""Down in the DM,"" you’ll hear the same guy rapping about pretty much the same thing in slightly different registers. But at the age of 36, and after two decades in hip-hop (<a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Lil-Yo-Youngstas-On-A-Come-Up/release/3784169"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he first released music under the name Lil Yo when he was 14</a>), Gotti has finally firmed up his status as a major-label rap artist. And while his latest album, <i>The Art of Hustle</i>, is unquestionably the biggest of Gotti’s career, it also feels like just another notch in his belt.</p>
<p>As a rapper, Gotti is practiced but lyrically unambitious. His bars are straight-to-the-point and matter-of-fact, and it’s his willingness to open up that endears. On ""Momma,"" one of <i>The Art of Hustle</i>’s best and most personal songs, Gotti raps about being raised by six women and a man that wasn’t his father, accounting for the highs and lows of a life built on hustling and basking in the relief of going legit. For opener ""My City,"" Gotti enlists K. Michelle to lament and pay homage to their shared hometown. But for all his pride and investment in the city—Gotti’s Collective Music Group label has signed local up-and-comers like Blac Youngsta, Snootie Wild, and Zed Zilla—<i>The Art of Hustle </i>reads generically Southern.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite an impressive head count of industry heavyweights, the album doesn't fare well as a whole. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> shows up on ""Bible"" for a rote banger; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> punches in a forgettable verse on a flat trap anthem called ""General""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a> snarls appropriately on the middle of ""Hunnid."" The collaborations are evidence of Gotti’s industry footprint rather than creative matchmaking, and the only one that strikes a spark is mold-breaker ""Law,"" which folds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a> comfortably into a slinky beat with bells ringing in the background.</p>
<p>And then there’s the album’s money-maker. ""Down in the DM"" isn’t a fluke hit, but it’s enjoyed the type of viral success that can’t be forced. In the last week alone: <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2016/02/lil-mama-memes-music-video-crying-breakfast-club-watch/?utm_source=spintwitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=spintwitter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil Mama shared a video called ""Memes,""</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2614-lil-kim/"" target=""_blank"">Lil' Kim</a> enlisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31127-kevin-gates/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Gates</a> for a Valentine's Day track called ""<a href=""http://www.spin.com/2016/02/lil-kim-mine-kevin-gates-new-single-stream/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#Mine</a>"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Soulja Boy</a> offered a sleazy artwork-toting single called ""<a href=""http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/soulja-boy-lil-yachty-and-rich-the-kid-snapchat/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snapchat</a>."" All three are lame attempts to recapture what ""Down in the DM"" does so naturally, revelling in the shallowness of Instagram. The addition of two full-fledged verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a> improves on the original and also gives the album its best and most memorable burst of rapping.</p>
<p>In a recent podcast interview with<a href=""http://radio.com/2016/02/18/yo-gotti-credits-dj-khaled-as-major-key-to-down-in-the-dm-hit/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Rap Radar</a>, Gotti admitted that ""Down in the DM"" was ""just another song."" ""I’m making three, four, five songs a day,"" he said. ""To be honest with you, I’m not even dwelling into the music that long."" It’s an unsurprising piece of insight that accounts for the album’s generally low-stakes vibe. Noticeably, on the same day that Gotti released this eighth album in his catalog, another Memphis rapper released his first.

Two of the band’s members, bassist William Cashion and frontman Sam Herring, had higher profiles with their band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a>, but that outfit had yet to take off, and the Snails were just another venture with a different pack of pals. All of the Snails’ personnel committed to the group’s big bit: Onstage in Raleigh, N.C., band members donned colorful headpieces that looked like snails’ eye stalks, and Herring thanked a friend of the band for making sure the Snails got to the venue safely from Baltimore in a shoebox stashed under the passenger seat. Later, the Snails would lay down a full LP, but Future Islands’ sudden wave of success in 2014 meant the Snails and their <i>Songs From the Shoebox </i>were more or less shelved—until now, that is.</p>
<p><i>Songs From the Shoebox</i> is a rough-around-the-edges record that bursts at the seams with excitement. The record feels like it could fall apart at any moment, but it somehow never does: Everything sounds a little fried, from the fuzz-caked guitar and bass riffs that dominate to the slick, squealy saxophone parts that work their way in. Herring doesn’t so much sing as he shouts, with his vocals sometimes bordering on outright screeching. Where Future Islands has always done well at delivering sad songs you can <i>kind of</i> dance to, the Snails mostly focus on fun. ""Tight Side of Life"" is a thick, rollicking opener, with Herring bellowing, ""We’re on the tight side of life, everything is going to be all right."" The song is so forceful that you feel like you have no choice to believe it’s the truth.</p>
<p>The tracklisting is loopy, but in a way that suits the project. ""Flames"" makes for an appropriately named scorcher late in the record before sliding into the droopy instrumental ""Do Like You Do."" The downer tune feels out of step with the rest of the album, but the band picks back up again with ""Snails Christmas (I Want a New Shell)."" It’s a non sequitur, but then again, the band’s over-arching concept is songs by and about snails—so, sure, why not a Christmas song, too?</p>
<p>Though <i>Songs From the Shoebox</i>’s completion was delayed by Future Islands’ massive touring schedule in 2014, the timing of its release is perfect. We’re in the agonizing home stretch of winter, and the album carries the promise that summertime’s carefree, sunburnt Saturday afternoons are right around the corner. With <i>Songs From the Shoebox</i>, then, the Snails offer a brief opportunity to escape to that happiest place.</p></div>"|21638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21638-songs-from-the-shoebox/|7.4|Allison Hussey

Maybe it was inspired by drinking alone in a dingy apartment, but <i>Higher Power</i> is punk with high-end production values, meant for big rooms. They’re professed classic rock fans and gear snobs and it shows, as <i>Higher Power</i> is an album that sounds like it expects to be paid for. However antisocial Dirty Nil get, the music is intended to be a communal experience.</p>
<p><a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-dirty-nil-no-weaknesses-video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">They’re not really interested</a> in the philosophical restrictions and elitism that often constitutes punk rock anyway. Dirty Nil released a 7” on skate-punk stronghold <a href=""https://www.fatwreck.com/public_area/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fat Wreck Chords</a> and played the Warped Tour<span>—</span>both tend to be a point of no return for bands deciding between a captive pop-punk audience and critical credibility. But it’s all rock'n'roll to Dirty Nil: They boast equal facility with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33490-pup"" target=""_blank"">PUP</a>-style beer bongin’ with the devil (""No Weaknesses""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32314-dilly-dally/"" target=""_blank"">Dilly Dally</a>’s knee-buckling dynamics (""Zombie Eyed""), and the hectoring sing-speak of tourmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31024-single-mothers/"" target=""_blank"">Single Mothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32208-greys"" target=""_blank"">Greys</a>. <i>Higher Power</i> serves as proof that the boundaries separating ""indie,"" ""pop punk"" and ""alt-rock"" have collapsed as they’ve been drawn into closer quarters, and to send this point home, they do all of the above just within the first four tracks.</p>
<p>There isn’t really an original note here, but the massive hooks of ""No Weaknesses"" and ""Zombie Eyed"" are delivered with enough conviction that they end up sounding fresh anyway. As <i>Higher Power</i> progresses, Dirty Nil continue to expand their range, yet the sequencing makes it sound like a retreat. The satisfying brutality of ""Fugue State"" starts a run of three songs crammed into less than five minutes; the highs of Side A were bound to make <i>Higher Power</i> sound frontloaded anyway, but Side B practically vanishes before get-in-the-van anthem ""Bury Me at the Rodeo Show"" ends the record with the closest thing to a Dirty Nil love song.</p>
<p>Even when the music intentionally plays dumb, Bentham and Nardi are clever lyricists, and <i>Higher Power</i> could almost be a narrative concept record about salvation if you play it out of order. Throughout the album, Dirty Nil search for redemption in the usual places: sex (""Wrestle Yu to Husker Du""), drugs (""Zombie Eyed"") and rock'n'roll. But they have too much fun with it all to even pretend that hitting rock bottom is actually a bad thing. ""Friends in the Sky"" aligns Bentham with Satan against Jesus, and it’s as close as he gets to divinity; later on, there’s no spiritual awakening, just an acceptance of what Bart Simpson called a ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/everysimpsons/status/504246897448468480"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">life of sin followed by the presto-change-o deathbed repentance</a>."" Bentham calls out to his higher power and admits, ""And even though we never got along/ I’ll say I was wrong/ 'Cause you know we can be friends in the sky."" Despite their protestations, only a true punk band would try to pull a fast one on God.</p></div>"|21452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21452-higher-power/|6.8|Ian Cohen

The byproducts of the ongoing retrospective are still spilling into 2016 as he nears 81, and it makes sense, because it’s hard not to think and talk in gushing platitudes when looking at what Riley wrought in the last half century. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60762b34-0a42-f945-985c-b2f4f7412bd5"">Even if you don’t know his name, you’ve felt his influence via ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY5rztWa1TM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baba O'Riley</a>,"" Pete Townsend’s tribute to Riley’s modal improvisation and Meher Baba’s spiritual teachings.</span> You could even credit him with one of the earliest remixes, in 1967, with his tape loop manipulations of the Harvey Averne Dozen's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75QFsgDMHDM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You're No Good.""</a> And of course, there’s <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJPJywWfyGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In C</a></i>, which in countless performances has become a living, breathing, and self-generating monument to the minimalist floodgate Riley helped open in 1964.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the most interesting homages to Riley took place at London’s Barbican Centre and Amsterdam’s Muziekgebouw during April of last year, at a pair of events called Hello Terry Riley. British musicians James Holden and Luke Abbott were invited to compose live improvisational electronic pieces influenced by engagement with Riley’s work. The recordings on <i>Outdoor Museum Of Fractals / 555Hz</i> are taken from their <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60762b34-0a44-dd17-332f-3ee116eff514"">rehearsals prior to the Barbican and Muziekgebouw concerts</span>. In a little over an hour of continuous improvisational performance, Holden and Abbott showcase how making music in the style of Terry Riley could still produce something startlingly new and mesmerizing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To compose ""Outdoor Museum of Fractals"" James Holden designed a special sequencer for his modular synthesizer, which works on a perpetually repetitive and purposefully chaotic set of rules, generating a wide range of melodic patterns from even the slightest change in initial input. He claims that the inputs in his system, if mapped in mathematical space, could give you the picture of a fractal—that ubiquitous and eternally mysterious geometrical pattern that naturally occurs in the shape of DNA, snowflakes, ocean waves, the drawings of M. C. Escher, and in the novels of Vladimir Nabokov and David Foster Wallace.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To Holden, the 46 minutes of ""Outdoor Museum of Fractals"" is a ""a very slow tour of some landmarks in this fractal"" he created with his co-pilot Camilo Tirado, a tabla player trained in the classical Indian traditions, which Riley drew heavily from in his work. Their two instruments are in constant conversation, as Tirado’s drumming triggers James' arpeggiations. Holden’s use of a sequencer also helps generate more notes and melodies than he could physically play, extending the limitations of his keyboard skills. And if you’ve ever seen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE2CEh66gTg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> of Riley playing, Holden’s experiment makes sense, because you quickly realize that very few people have the dexterity and focus to dance between the notes of a keyboard like Riley.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Similar to the best Riley compositions, ""Outdoor Museum of Fractals"" resembles an exquisitely and almost incomprehensibly detailed model train set, its slow-moving progression unfolding with more and more information and narrative. It’s hard to believe Holden and Tirado’s improvisation sounds as smooth and pleasurable as it does, because Holden’s system is constantly inviting chaos. He described learning how to control his rig as a ""blind man feeling around in one small corner with some vague memory of what's nearby.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Abbott’s contribution, ""555Hz,"" is inspired by the numerological and mythological qualities of the number five and an interest in new age theories about the healing properties of specific sonic frequencies. His interest was stoked by Thomas Browne’s <i>The Garden of Cyrus</i>, <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60762b34-0a4c-2677-9a2c-8828b5a46826"">a Renaissance-era manifesto on intelligent design that</span> attributes fractal-like vastness to the number five’s relation to the organization of natural life, from the structure of honeycombs to the leaves of artichokes. ""555Hz"" is centered around a sine-wave drone tuned to 555Hz and a modified 26'' gong that echoes and resonate in response to slight shifts in the drone.</p>
<p>""555Hz"" veers farther from signature Riley sounds, and more closely mirrors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"" target=""_blank"">La Monte Young</a>’s exploration of drone, specifically in works like <i>Drift Study</i>. This piece is more caustic and less relaxing, but it’s also lighter and more ambient. In that way it is far more meditative than Holden’s, because the ongoing drone never forces the listener to descend into the music, but rather effortlessly float on its surface. Abbott’s piece is also less steady, its pitches shift more wildly, and the sounds climb up and down more athletically throughout. And similar to Holden’s improvisation, it’s hard not to be impressed by the smooth progression of Abbott's performance. There are many moments where the drone unravels, but Abbott’s ability to paint through the chaos of his sounds with perfectly timed gong echoes and slight shifts in the drone’s tone pulls it all together. I’m reminded of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>’s description of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a>’ music ""as a viscous bath of pure, thick energy"" when listening to the two companion pieces back to back. In <i>Outdoor Museum of Fractals / 555Hz</i>, Abbott and Holden have demonstrated quite effectively that electronic musicians don’t have to be just guys pressing play on their computers, but very serious and cognitively engaged composers.</p></div>"|21559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21559-outdoor-museum-of-fractals-555hz/|7.9|Kevin Lozano

Drawing heavily on the iconography of the original trilogy—a beached star destroyer, Vader’s crumpled helmet, X-Wings soaring—it played on a few generations' worth of treasured memories, but what sent it over the top were the stirrings of that lovely old John Williams theme: Nostalgia, ultra.</p>
<p>Even more than the visuals, the sounds of <i>Star Wars</i> are what evoke the giddy soul of the films. Williams’ score does the heavy lifting, yes, but the whirrs and shrieks of assorted creatures, the laser blasts, and endless memorable lines are almost as important. (My sister and I would rewind the VHS tape of the first <i>Star Wars</i> film to hear <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDThrTxWBmw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Jawa exclamation ""Utini!""</a> over and over again.) It’s this latter mix of sounds that animates <i>Star Wars Headspace, </i>a new album of electronic music inspired by the films. Executive produced by Rick Rubin, who was a teenager when <i>Star Wars </i>was released, the record crackles with adolescent exuberance, thanks to a well-chosen roster of producers. Neither stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest, <i>Headspace</i> aims for simple fun and hits it square, like a T-16 targeting womp rats back on Tatooine. (Sorry.)</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, who contributes a track, said in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63412-star-wars-album-to-feature-flying-lotus-rick-rubin-jj-abrams-listen-to-new-flying-lotus-rubin-and-baauer-tracks/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> on Beats 1 that the producers involved were given access to a vast anthology of <i>Star Wars</i> sound bites but were cautioned away from Williams’ music. For that reason, random chirps, whirrs, and speech fragments dominate the proceedings, and many of the producers cash in as many of these chips as possible. Big-tent EDM DJ Kaskade kicks things off with ""C-3PO’s Plight,"" a maximalist piece of novelty camp that turns one of the golden droid’s asides into a weirdly moving lament. The house producer Claude Von Stroke offers a goofy dance anthem that recalls the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Terje</a>.  </p>
<p>The musicians on the record’s latter half focus less on obvious tribute material. Flying Lotus and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"" target=""_blank"">Shlohmo</a>, both of whom have ventured outside of their comfort zones in recent years, incorporate droid bleeps and bloops into fresh versions of their older styles, as if they’ve walked into a childhood clubhouse and remembered all the best hiding places. ""I feel real close to these sounds,"" Flying Lotus said in his interview, and you can tell.</p>
<p>This cozy nostalgia is a way of avoiding risk, and much like <i>The Force Awakens</i>, most of the tracks here are not particularly adventurous: GTA imitate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"" target=""_blank"">Baauer</a> with an imperial-style banger, while Baauer himself reaches into his usual explosive bag of tricks. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp</a>, in one of the album’s few missteps, put together an 8-minute amalgamous mess that sounds patched together from their back catalog.</p>
<p>But like the new film, the tracks sound relaxed and self-assured, none more so than ""NR-G7,"" one of Rubin’s two contributions. A successful synthesis of four or so different approaches, from pounding four-on-the-floor gristle to dazzling jet-stream synths and back again, it's a testament to the idea that sometimes indecision is the best decision. Rubin’s involvement, both as a musician and an artistic conscience, elevates the collection from crass tie-in (which, of course, it is) into something undeniably greater.</p>
<p>The most ambitious tracks on <i>Headspace</i> reach for the majesty of the original score, and Rubin places them near the end of the record where they can have the strongest emotional impact. ""Sunset Over Manaan,"" produced by Attlas, has an aching melody that might remind you of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtkuZbcZORE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leia's Theme</a>."" And the epic orchestration of Breakbot's final track taps directly into the neo-Romantic essence of Williams' music. It’s one of the only tracks that turns its back on nostalgia, striking out to explore new territory.</p></div>"|21601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21601-star-wars-headspace/|6.9|Jonah Bromwich

The project also features original Stereolab drummer Joe Dilworth, who played on <i>Peng!</i>, and Holger Zapf, a synthesizer player whose resumé includes a stint in Jan Jelinek's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27477-ursula-bogner/"" target=""_blank"">Ursula Bogner</a> ensemble. They released their debut album, the out-of-print <i>Blood Drums,</i> in 2013, but <i>Void Beats /</i> <i>Invocation Trex</i> feels in some ways like a proper debut, taking the tones and drones of that release and sculpting them into mesmerizing and thrilling pieces.</p>
<p>Stereolab's DNA is recognizable from the very first beat: The record's opening song, ""Tardis Cymbals,"" begins with a ringing E chord that longtime fans may initially mistake for the opening notes of <i>Mars Audiac Quintet</i>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqdxiW7A2fY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nihilist Assault Group</a>"" (or, for that matter, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k45VWW_sYhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Three-Dee Melodie</a>"" or ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKrYdhMdBfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Transona Five</a>"" or ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksR2AnpgPo0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anamorphose</a>""—Gane clearly loves his E chords). Krautrock rhythms abound: In ""Tardis Cymbals"" it's a burbly pinging in a surprisingly natural-sounding 7/8 time, while ""Melody in High Feedback Tones"" slips into a brighter and more aerated groove, its clean-toned guitar strum and quicksilver pulse given extra shape by the faint squelch tugging at its edges. The distorted organs of ""Insect Fear"" lend it a garage-rock feel that flashes back to the <i>Transient Random-Noise Bursts </i>era, while the swinging ""Echolalia"" recalls Stereolab's '60s fascinations. And the album's period instruments—including Farfisa and Vox organs, Clavinet, and analog synths like the EMS VCS 3 and Korg MS20—contribute to the recurring sense of sonic déjà vu.</p>
<p>But those callbacks—natural enough, given the personnel—are just a small patch of the ground the trio covers here. ""Blowing My Nose Under Close Observation"" avails itself of electro's whipcrack syncopations. ""Pantechnicon"" plays winsome Kraftwerkian melodies against rolling, techno-inspired rhythms. The unifying element is the loose, jammy feeling to everything: It's easy to imagine these pieces, three of which extend beyond nine minutes, being worked out in the studio in just one or two takes, even with their many moving pieces and their counterintuitive dodges and feints. </p>
<p>Only one track doesn't fit the mold: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"" target=""_blank"">Bradford Cox</a>'s raspy, rock'n'roll delivery gives ""Liquid Gate"" a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> feeling. The only other vocal track, ""Planetary Folklore,"" is in keeping with the album's overarching aesthetic: Here, Sonic Boom gravely recites a text inspired by Victor Vasarely's monologues on the plastic arts over a muted reprise of the ""Tardis Cymbals"" groove. The Hungarian artist sought an industrialized, universal, radically democratic art, whose cell-based constructions were a direct antecedent to Cavern of Anti-Matter's method of composition. It was sometimes unclear when Stereolab's mid-century references were meant as kitsch, but here, Gane &amp; co.'s retro-futurist flashback feels optimistic, as though convinced that the key to fulfilling the promise of a new era were just one perfect rhythm away. </p></div>"|21470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21470-void-beats-invocation-trex/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

In 2012, Cox <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8887-merchandise/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Pitchfork, ""Punk is still the spiritual music of my life, but I’m not interested in being that kind of person anymore."" In 2014, ahead of Merchandise’s <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a>-released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19663-merchandise-after-the-end/"" target=""_blank"">After the End</a>, </i>he demurred to <i>NME</i>, ""I was born after punk died, so whatever."" To Noisey: ""I’m just sick of fucking punk scenes."" Fittingly then, Cox and collaborator Marco Rapisarda’s collaboration as Death Index didn’t involve rehearsal, gigging, or any other trappings of scene participation. It’s the next passage in Cox’s personal history of estrangement from punk. </p>
<p><i>Death Index </i>was recorded in Berlin, Tampa, and Italy. Cox sings on every track. Rapisarda, a regular in Italy’s hardcore scene, plays everything else. A few songs surfaced online late last year, grabbing attention from high-profile U.S. hardcore label <a href=""http://www.deathwishinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deathwish</a>. Their live lineup is forthcoming at the moment of Death Index’s release, meaning the record was made by in-studio, part-by-part layering. It's a novel way to create punk or hardcore—which typically celebrate live ensemble combustibility and recordings that capture it—and the oblique approach helps explain Death Index’s alien charms and rudderless missteps alike.</p>
<p>The recording process’s fragmentation seems to have yielded an album where Cox sounds as distant from the music as he apparently feels from punk itself. Sometimes that distance makes for fascinating contrasts, setting Rapisarda's deft, muscular performances against Cox's emotionally textured vocals. Musically, opener ""Fast Money Kill"" is rousing, concise hardcore that Antidote fans will recognize as nearly identical to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM_3EGpwhyQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Life as One</a>."" But Cox’s full-bodied singing, with its aching quiver and trill,  evokes the dreary post-punk of Manchester. His nuanced, wounded croon also distinguish the throttling ""Fuori Controllo"" and the leering ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17910-death-index-little-n-pretty/"" target=""_blank"">Little N Pretty</a>,"" the music's insular, sealed-off atmosphere allowing for the unlikely combination to flourish.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the sound skews antiseptic and clinical on songs that crave deformities. The dirge-like ""FUP,"" on which Cox professes his numbness in rather hackneyed terms, (""I’m so fucked up/ That I fall down to my knees/ Where you can’t feel anything"") and the spare synth pulsations of ""Lost Bodies"" feel like orphaned intros, over before they start. ""The Meal"" and ""We’ve Got a Number"" feature martial rhythms and rollicking riffs in the style of post-punk acts such as the Birthday Party but it's missing the dynamics, the urgency, the frantic, headlong motion, and the threat of splintering apart. Here it feels more like a grid plotted with leaden thwacks and blackened leads. In these moments, <i>Death Index </i>sounds too steady; undergirded by the metronomic logic of the studio, it precludes the mutations, even mistakes, that live collaboration instilled in its influences.</p></div>"|21545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21545-death-index/|7.0|Sam Lefebvre

Since he introduced himself in the early '00s with a brace of rapid-fire records on <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a>, Aaron Funk has carved a singular path. He once claimed to have recorded his early works while coming down from crack cocaine; he has sampled Bartók, Billie Holiday, and Elgar (all on his outstanding 2005 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8445-rossz-csillag-alatt-szuletett/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rossz Csillag Alatt Született</i></a>), and once made an entire record about his cats titled, in a rare straightforward gesture, <i>Songs About My Cats</i>. Visually, Funk in no way fits the mold of your everyday IDM egghead. A man mountain with lank hair and unkempt beard, he more resembles a burly woodcutter, or a mad monk: the Winnipeg Rasputin.</p>
<p>Still, in this case there is no suggestion we should take Venetian Snares at anything other than his word. <i>Traditional Synthesizer Music</i>, explains Funk, was created and performed live on a modular synth ""with no overdubbing and no editing."" If the result still sounds like a logical continuation of his previous work, that's probably because this sort of hardware has long been a part of his playbook. Certainly, this isn't the record where Snares starts making dreamy hippy kosmische. The abrupt opener ""Dreamt Person v3"" takes us into broadly familiar Snares territory: an unceasing torrent of squiggly, scattershot breaks pinging across the frame, pursued by slow, gloaming synths that float about like jellyfish.</p>
<p>Funk's music often sounds so meticulous and precise that it can be surprising to learn it has improvisational or random elements. But like, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>—well-known for their algorithmic tinkering—or another modular synth enthusiast, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>, Funk embraces chaos as a compositional method. A complex process of patch-building has introduced a random factor into these structures, allowing for surprises or ""unforeseen progressions."" The titles—things like ""Goose and Gary v2"" and ""Anxattack Boss Level 19 v3""—indicate that these tracks are not fixed in stone but malleable, each track charting one particular path through a chain of possibilities.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is one of the more beautiful Snares records in recent memory, relaxing some of the more tiring qualities of his music—the unrelenting abrasiveness, the taste for a certain gynecological grotesquery—in favor of moments of relatively straight prettiness. He will never qualify as ""easy"" listening, of course: ""Slightly Bent Fork Tong v2"" laces its globular synth-funk with warped chimes and ringing bell tones, while electronics groan and harrumph deep in the bowels of an inscrutable jitter titled ""She Married a Chess Computer in the End."" But even while it's being difficult, <i>Traditional Synthesizer Music</i> feels relatively palatable by Snares standards. The album's analog genesis lends it a cushioned wooziness, making the manic energy more palatable in the long haul.</p>
<p>Last year, Funk tweeted that he was in ""very serious financial trouble,"" directing his followers toward his Bandcamp (they followed his cue, filling the Bandcamp chart with Venetian Snares albums, and shortly afterwards Funk repaid their loyalty with a pay-what-you-want album titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21067-thank-you-for-your-consideration/"" target=""_blank""><i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i></a>). Looking at the gigantic rig he's assembled on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbLt0S0W5jE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> to ""Magnificent Stumble v2,"" you can sort of see where all those IDM dollars might have gone. But where some musicians get lost inside the labyrinth of modular synth building, Snares seems adept in harnessing these elemental energies and bending them to his will. <i>Traditional Synthesizer Music </i>feels not so much traditional as a refresh: a suite of music that is crafted and ferociously complex, but at its root a pure and primal thing, high on its own chaos. </p></div>"|21571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21571-traditional-synthesizer-music/|7.4|Louis Pattison

It's a romantic collection of songs, as well as a tender and sad one, but this time around Kozelek sounds less alone. Even when he has a full band, it can feel like he's playing a guitar by himself in a room, but <i>Jesu/Sun Kil Moon</i> comes off like a true collaboration. Broadrick and Kozelek are in fact longtime friends and admirers of each other’s work: Jesu’s 2009 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13600-opiate-sun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Opiate Sun</i></a> was released on Kozelek’s <a href=""http://www.caldoverderecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Caldo Verde</a> imprint; in 2013, Kozelek covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"" target=""_blank"">Godflesh</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-gQG0Flpb0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like Rats</a>"" and a year later he mentioned Broadrick by name in his song, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17231-sun-kil-moon-the-possum/"" target=""_blank"">The Possum</a>.""</p>
<p>Kozelek hasn't necessarily ""gone metal"" here, but he's definitely using his voice in different ways—he yells, he howls, he screams. The gentle guitar crunch and cymbal crashes seem to wake Kozelek up a bit, shaking him from the more soporific spoken patterns of his last couple of releases. And sometimes Broadrick's backdrop drowns out Kozelek, which offers a nice dynamic shift. His gorgeous arrangements of crunchy guitars, tender synthesizers, and soft drums are dotted by the voices of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>’s Isaac Brock, the members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"" target=""_blank"">Low</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive</a>’s Rachel Goswell, among others. And while the arrangements could stand alone on their own, there's still plenty of focus on Kozelek's lyrics. The words remain stream-of-consciousness, moving from the profound to the mundane and back, and Kozelek's still in the same emotional mode: He's facing mortality, and the mortality of everyone around him.</p>
<p>On the record, his songs often find him returning to the park outside his home, singing how hearing the children that play there makes him happy, and that he often writes his sad songs to those sounds. The references to these children become a kind of Greek chorus. There's the child he invites up on stage with him on ""America's Most Wanted Mark Kozelek and John Dillinger."" He tells us he sang while he ""held her little hand,"" told her to stop eating sweets, and then chewed the gum he took from her (""it was sweet""). He sings, too, of kids shot at school and brings up the death of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a>'s son more than once (""The news hit me like a bus into a hill,"" he says, and at another time says it's something he thinks about daily). He also names an almost unbearably sad song about grieving parents after Mike Tyson's daughter, Exodus.</p>
<p>In that almost 10-minute track he reflects again on his cousin Carissa, his father's older brother Lenny who died young (""My dad looks down at the ground and gets quiet whenever I mention his name""), and author Danielle Steel losing her son at 19 to an overdose on heroin (""On his bedroom window still remains the sticker he put there/ The Misfits/ Every time I walk past her home on Washington Street/ I look up and I glance at it."") He talks, too, about watching the Mike Tyson documentary <i>The Undisputed Truth</i>, which inspires the song's chorus (""For all bereaved parents/ I send you my love""): ""He spoke about the passing of his daughter Exodus and how he joined the bereaved parents group/ He knew when he arrived at her bed that he was not alone/ Because the parents of the other children embraced him and they cried together in the hospital room."" It all adds up to the most painful song I've heard this year.</p>
<p>Other kids grow old and then die, and he sings about them, too. We get ""Father's Day,"" in part about his 81-year-old father (he mentions, with a relief, that both he and his mother are still alive) and ""Fragile,"" a song about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4711-yes/"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a>’ Chris Squire, who died of leukemia, which reminds Kozelek of a long-ago friend named Christopher, who also died of leukemia and is buried in the same graveyard where he and Kozelek used to drink Bud Light all day.</p>
<p>Kozelek's more recent output has obviously been vulnerable, but he feels especially open here—he’s not just making fun of himself, but also deeply dissecting why he makes fun of himself, and the sadness that’s hidden within a punchline. You almost forget what an asshole he’s been on stage and in interviews until, yes, he brings up those things, too. He turns the meta into the everyday.</p>
<p>The excellent eight-minute opener ""Good Morning My Love"" is based on someone telling their partner that they need to rekindle their love, and that person not knowing what that word ""rekindle"" means, but wanting/needing to find out. So much of <i>Jesu/Sun Kil Moon</i> has that kind of unexpected profundity. In an <a href=""http://www.sunkilmoon.com/interview_rainnwilson_markkozelek.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Rainn Wilson that Kozelek did in conjunction with the record, he talked about shifting to his newer Sun Kil Moon mode after running out of metaphors. This is on full display here. (After all, the default chorus of ""America's Most Wanted..."" is ""this is an account of the last few days,"" and there's truth in that advertising.)</p>
<p>The thing you realize listening to these songs, though, is that intimate details quickly take on the feel of metaphor. There's a profound weight, whether it's a middle-aged Kozelek telling his girlfriend how thankful he is to have her (which he does a few times), remembering listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a>'s <i>Candy Apple Grey</i> with a girl a long time ago, or talking about buying a bottle of water. In those water bottle moments, you wonder if he's thinking about spiritual or physical thirst, and realize that, for all of us, it's always a bit of both.</p></div>"|21339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21339-jesusun-kil-moon/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

On one end there is their 2008 breakout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12099-the-rhumb-line/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Rhumb Line</i></a>, an orchestral pop record distinguished by collegiate literary references and scarred by trauma. On the other is 2009’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heluk42VdbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can You Discover?</a>,"" a synthy, Auto-Tuned reworking of one of their debut’s tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27811-discovery/"" target=""_blank"">Discovery</a>, a collaboration between frontman Wes Miles and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12072-rostam-batmanglij/"" target=""_blank"">Rostam Batmanglij</a>. In between these two poles, Ra Ra Riot have struggled for balance. Their sophomore record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14574-the-orchard/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Orchard</i></a> played it safe, not falling too far from the tree of its predecessor, while their 2013 foray into electro-pop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17513-beta-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beta Love</i></a>, explored an abundance of new sounds but lacked cohesion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Need Your Light</i>, they finally hit the sweet spot. Working once again with Rostam, they key back into the chirpy, buoyant electronics of ""Can You Discover?"" and blend them with the string-heavy compositions of <i>The Rhumb Line</i>. The result could sit comfortably next to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a>. On <i>Beta Love</i>, Miles’ vocals occasionally drifted into uncanny-valley territory, but <i>Need Your Light</i> brings him back down to Earth. On ""Water,"" Miles’ falsetto constricts as he sings ""Don’t punish me for what I feel"" and then tightens even further to near-desperation as he imagines crawling out the back door, ripping off his tight clothes, and leaping into the water. ""I Need Your Light"" (also by Batmanglij) is the record’s biggest showstopper, with Miles’ voice repeating the title until it swells from a wisp into a belting, burning swan song.</p>
<p>But rather than feeling like outliers, the Rostam-produced tracks fit in well with the remaining eight songs produced by Ryan Hadlock, which lean toward a more traditional Ra Ra Riot mix of tight instrumentation embellished with processed flourishes. All the synths are large and loud, the violins glittering, and any memories of calm are quickly overshadowed by the music's insistent ""dance yourself clean"" imperative. ""Instant Breakup"" blooms slowly, hand claps and heavy drums creeping in before twisting into a synthy sugar spiral. The chorus of ""Every Time I’m Ready to Hug"" is an invitation to dance until your limbs are tangled.</p>
<p>Thematically, most of the 10 tracks on <i>Need Your Light</i> suggest taking a leap of faith—in this case, putting trust in love. The lyrics tilt towards the anthemic and dramatic: ""'Cause I can’t see nothing without your light,"" ""Love will get me up again,"" ""I wanna know that love can change you."" ""Absolutely""’s lyrics, however, resemble a painful drunken New Year’s proclamation: ""It’s the year of/ Absolutely being/ Absolutely nothing/ Absolutely crushing/ Absolutely everything/ Absolutely loving."" On a bright record full of balanced sweetness, it’s the only moment that cloys, a reminder of the missteps that brought Ra Ra Riot here.</p></div>"|21523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21523-need-your-light/|6.8|Quinn Moreland

The year before, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> loudly tore into the C86 revival, declaring ""This Love Is Fucking Right!"" Emotions were strong, guitars were soft and fuzzy, and synths were sugary. But no record embraced romantic grandeur like Wild Nothing's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gemini</i></a>. The then-21-year-old's debut communicated through instrumental atmosphere and texture, jumping between dreamy pessimism and sleepy introspection, eliciting comparisons to the big influential UK bands of the late '80s and early '90s: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a>, etc.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps most appealingly, <i>Gemini</i>'s innocence and purity are heavily rooted in nostalgia. ""Do you remember the lightning storm?/ It was the first time that I really felt you,"" Tatum sang on ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2mXIfA2xNs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live in Dreams</a>,"" with the detached desire of a crush who is too afraid to say ""I love you"" but will write and perform a song for you. However, the thing about nostalgia is that it maintains the ability to quietly exist in the back of your brain, which is exactly why <i>Gemini</i> always threatens to become background music. Listening to <i>Gemini</i> today, six years after its release, it is easy to get swept away by the softness and sentiment, only to use the record as a soundtrack for one's own memories; perhaps this is why it was so loved in the first place. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tatum capped off 2010 with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14937-golden-haze-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Golden Haze</i> EP</a> and eventually released his second full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nocturne</i></a>, in 2012. Unlike <i>Gemini</i>, which was recorded in Tatum's Blacksburg dorm room, <i>Nocturne</i> received the full studio treatment. Given the appropriate tools for growth, Wild Nothing's sophomore effort is cleaner, with a more diverse array of sounds and a considerably brighter tone. <i>Nocturne</i> made clear that Tatum intended to develop his sound from his bedroom pop debut. A year later, Wild Nothing released the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18106-wild-nothing-empty-estate-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Empty Estate</i> EP</a>, which attempted to zero in on the scattered electro-pop shimmer of <i>Nocturne</i> but ultimately came across as distant due to a deficit of textural variations and engaging lyrics. Wild Nothing's third full-length offered a chance for reinvention, and while Tatum has clearly evolved as a musician, the limitations of his past releases are still with him.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From the opening, carbonated, notes of marimba on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17897-wild-nothing-reichpop/"" target=""_blank"">Reichpop</a>,"" <i>Life of Pause</i> presents itself as Wild Nothing's cheeriest record. Tatum has said that he wanted his third full-length to sound more ""organic"" or ""gelled,"" and to give his audience a sense of physical space.<b> </b>T<span id=""docs-internal-guid-9a688872-f0c7-a19f-8e81-9808e5e50dd7"">o strengthen this idea, Tatum created an actual room to represent the album's world for the cover shoot. </span>Tatum's fabricated atmosphere is a warm and groovy 1970s pad, with dashes of curiosities like a checkered teapot and a mysterious bouquet of flowers. But unlike this room, which existed only temporarily in a warehouse in Long Island City, Tatum recorded <i>Life of Pause i</i>n Los Angeles and Stockholm, at a studio once owned by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"" target=""_blank"">ABBA</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tatum admitted that he was listening to ""a lot of Philly soul, sweet soul music"" while working on the record. When these moments, particularly the notes of funk and disco, are pushed, it feels like a move in the right direction. This is the most PG-13 Wild Nothing has been on record yet: The steamy sax on ""Whenever I"" paired with Tatum's silky drawl could be a track in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"" target=""_blank"">David Lynch</a> nightclub; his voice on ""A Woman's Wisdom"" is a husky plea for intimate insight. ""Reichpop"" is stunning, with the aforementioned marimba played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4966-peter-bjorn-and-john/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Bjorn and John</a> drummer John Eriksson.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's a high-bar statement of an opener, but the album rarely reaches that energy level again. ""Japanese Alice"" brings new life to the middle of the record with psych-pop guitars reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>, and the title track's synth throbs have a hint of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a> to them. Following these two, the stoned ""Alien"" feels like a setback, but the brief, noisy breakdowns save it from being a completely absurd outlier.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So why does <i>Life of Pause</i> not completely succeed? To begin with, the record is not emotionally accessible or relatable, which isn't a huge surprise considering Tatum favors sound over lyrics. The trouble is that it's unclear exactly what <i>Life of Pause</i>'s mood is intended to be. Tonally and instrumentally, the album is a change in style, but there is no moment of surprise; it still feels very predictable. There is nothing wrong with being formulaic; it worked for…well, pretty much everyone. But there is no moment that truly grabs you, no emotional climax, no reason to truly care.<i> Life of Pause</i> is a straight, albeit funky, line.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Life of Pause</i>'s monotony is only heightened by its monochromatic songwriting. In a majority of the songs, Tatum asks some sort of question (""Can I learn to wait for my life?,"" ""Will I find a way to make sense of/ The way that you love me?,"" ""How can we want love?,"" etc etc) only to conclude during ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17845-wild-nothing-to-know-you/"" target=""_blank"">To Know You</a>"" that ""There is no answer to the question."" All this amorous, existential pondering seems to prevent him from <i>doing</i> anything, from taking a risk, from making a statement that sticks. It doesn't help that these questions are delivered in such an aloof manner that even if they pique interest for a second, they will melt away quickly. It seems like Tatum is living a lyric from ""Reichpop:"" ""The less you say the less that you get wrong.""</p></div>"|21599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21599-life-of-pause/|6.5|Quinn Moreland

Nobody outside of detergent commercials dances up to a washing machine. We sweat through clothes on Saturday night; we reluctantly clean them Sunday afternoon. But the ambient sounds at a laundromat, those wetly spiraling colors, the unconscious motions of loading and folding and wringing—are they so easy to divide away from clubbing? Not according to Matmos, whose new album <i>Ultimate Care II</i> was entirely generated by the Whirlpool washing machine of the same name. They hit the appliance, massaged it, processed it, and jolted it with samples of its own noise. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not such a strange instrument for Matmos. Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt, partners in all things, have wrung electronic music out of surgical tools, a cigarette burn, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a> reciting Wittgenstein, and quivering crayfish. Lots of it you can even dance to. Their practice became more abstract in recent years: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11492-supreme-balloon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Supreme Balloon</i></a> only used synthesizers, while 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17630-matmos-the-marriage-of-true-minds/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Marriage of True Minds</i></a> was determined by a series of parapsychological experiments. ""High-concept"" is the wrong phrase for something so tactile, but the new album does take inspiration, in classic Matmos style, from a deadpan joke: <i>Ultimate Care II</i> is the machine, and the machine is <i>Ultimate Care II</i>. (It could also be the name of a monthly rave circa 1989.) Daniel and Schmidt have always been fascinated by texture, and here they focus on it intently, exploring dozens of ways that water can fall, slosh, churn, or hiss. During calmer interludes, drones move past as if floating through an amniotic sac.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like Manuel Göttsching's techno opening <i>E2-E4</i>, Matmos sequenced <i>Ultimate Care II</i> as a single 38-minute-long track, elaborating on itself over the length of a standard cycle. The first moments are relatively straightforward, considering that we're talking about an album recorded from a washing machine: Somebody turns the dial, and the chamber floods. Polyrhythmic drumming slowly intensifies, before subsiding into amphibian breathing noises. There's this coarse timbre that resembles a wildly overblown saxophone—fingers rubbing the chassis, sensuality experienced as agony. For long minutes rhythm fades away, leaving a reverie of computer signals inside the machine's brain, and then returns to deluge them, seizing up briefly with a muffled conk. What follows must be the first piece of music braiding together free jazz and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR3Eh_516JQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the sewer level from ""Sonic the Hedgehog 3.""</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Ultimate Care II</i> ends in thrilling panic, a squall of rapid percussion moving over glitchy effects: drum-and-bass that's hard and wet, like the misted breakbeats on A Guy Called Gerald's <i>Black Secret Technology</i>. But the real un-climax comes just before that, when Matmos allow the rinse cycle to run through with only minimal filtering. It lasts for four minutes yet feels boundless. I thought of Virginia Woolf's <i>The Waves</i>: ""The spray, leaping high, spattered the walls of a cave that had been dry before, and left pools inland, where some fish, stranded, lashed its tail as the wave drew back."" Time seems to leak out everywhere, as if you looked away from Matmos' knotted loop to find, feet slickly adrift, that the machine had sprouted a river.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a> realized there was no such thing as silence when he visited an anechoic chamber insulated from the rest of Harvard and heard two sounds, one high and one low: the pulse of his nervous system and the circulation of his blood. ""There is always something to see,"" he said later on, ""something to hear."" (It was probably actually tinnitus, but that makes the omnipresence of music even clearer.) I imagine Matmos glancing around their laundry room and deciding that any space could hold a dancefloor, or a DIY noise show—a basement is a basement, after all. Caressing obsolete technology, they've parodied labor's drudgeries as play. <i>Ultimate Care II</i> is a daydream of domesticity, a chore ignored. Call it the revolutions of everyday life.</p></div>"|21017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21017-ultimate-care-ii/|7.8|Chris Randle

Last October, the 24-year-old British songwriter/producer announced a show at London's 5000-capacity Brixton Academy for this coming April. In November, he won the <a href=""http://www.brits.co.uk/news/jack-garratt-wins-2016s-critics-choice-award"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brits Critics' Choice Award</a> for 2016; last month, the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35253690"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BBC Sound of 2016</a> poll. From the other side of the Atlantic, those might look like insignificant spoils, but in the UK, it's a case of mutually assured industry triumph: Garratt dominates radio, plays sweet televised spots at major festivals, boosts live revenues, and makes the organizations that backed him look smart. Such are the perks of signing to Island, an imprint of Universal, who have had Garratt in a development deal for years—and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/19/how-do-you-become-music-next-big-thing-record-label-spend-promotion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scooped 11 of the past 14</a> BBC Sound of... polls thanks to their massive spending power.</p>
<p>Brits are cynical of being marketed to, and even more suspicious of what looks like instant success, so Island have carefully made Garratt look Very Authentic. There's a lovelorn songwriter at the heart of his music—a side he displayed when he covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>'s ""Latch"" in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Et1uDI8MIk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">earnest bluesman fashion</a>—that's been coated with lightly fizzing electronica. <i>Phase </i>seems forged from the sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14229-cmyk-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>CMYK</i></a> EP and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"" target=""_blank"">Jai Paul</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12181-jai-paul-btstu-edit/"" target=""_blank"">BTSTU</a>"": subaquatic synth motifs and juddering basslines that burst into scrunching supernova choruses. There's also lots of gospel-influenced warbling and soft, bluesy piano. Whenever Garratt plays the latter, you hear his stool squeak very clearly, as if it's been amplified for effect.</p>
<p>Marketing aside, <i>Phase</i> doesn't sound unpleasant, just generic. <i>Phase</i> starts strong enough: The delicate, swimmy first verse of opener ""Coalesce (Synesthesia Pt. II)"" suddenly goes hyperdrive, gathering nastier textures as Garratt's vocals fracture and writhe. ""Breathe Life"" is the catchiest song, with a bright, shimmying soulful chorus that owes as much to the aforementioned Jai Paul as it does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a>'s cover of ""You Got the Love."" ""Far Cry"" is also compelling, with screaming mosquito synths and agile bass driving the hectic pace.</p>
<p>Things get weaker from there: ""Weathered"" has the unctuous sentimentality of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"" target=""_blank"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> (whom Garratt has supported in stadiums), and its lyrics are the equivalent of those manipulative <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHcm1ec7CcY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commercials</a> showing a child turn into a senior citizen in 45 seconds: ""When I grow old/ The sun will cope/ Shine down on every youth stain,"" Garratt simpers. He has a tendency to reach for grandiose overstatements as shorthand for profundity, a tendency that gives his romantic lyrics an unwittingly sinister edge. His neediness is <i>intense</i>: ""To love you takes every waking thought I have,"" he declares on ""Fire."" On ""The Love You're Given,"" he sings, ""I promise if you're gonna lock me out I will stay as your ghost/ But if you take the love you're given I will leave you alone,"" and echoes the sentiment on ""I Know All What I Do"": ""If I ever leave you, eyes will remain.""</p>
<p>To give him credit, he seems to recognize a certain OTT tendency within himself. On the hard-grinding ""Chemical,"" he makes various unflattering admissions about his love: how it's ""overdone, selfish, and domineering … chemical, shallow, and chauvinistic."" But as with almost all his lyrics on the topic, it feels empty, drawing from overcooked cultural tropes about <i>urgency.</i> Somewhere within all this bombast is a sensitive man who's trying to explore his flaws and desires candidly. You sense that the thing that he needs is intimacy, a smaller scale. And it's the one luxury he's not going to get, because Jack Garratt is too big to fail.</p></div>"|21495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21495-phase/|5.6|Laura Snapes

But in 2010, Moodymann sat down for a now-legendary <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/moodymann-henny-and-kenny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talk</a> with the Red Bull Music Academy, and while the bon mots he drops across its two hours are legion—""My bitches and my hoes is my MPCs, my SP-1200, my bass, my keyboards""; ""Detroit is a dying city; well, I’m going to die with that motherfucker""; ""Hell, I thought Kraftwerk was four niggas""—whoever watched the video came away with only one image: The entourage of African-American women who walk in with him and twist his unruly afro into braids onstage and then pass Hennessy around to the audience.</p>
<p>This strategy of misdirection has cemented Dixon’s legacy in house music while also keeping his mystery intact. I’ve seen him DJ with a black veil over his face or else a hoodie pulled tight, keeping attention off of him. A set of disco and house can easily veer into White Stripes, Led Zeppelin, and Nirvana before swerving back. The <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2014/kdj-44.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of 2014’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19037-moodyman-moodymann/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a> portrayed him as a house slipper-wearing, Solo cup-swigging layabout while the music within slyly touched on heartbreak and urban decay. With his first officially licensed mix CD, for the 51st entry in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=dj-kicks"" target=""_blank""><i>DJ-Kicks</i> series</a>, one might expect a set of dusty disco and deep house, but Dixon confounds expectations throughout, detouring at peak moments, going left where he might build momentum, all of it leading to luminous results.</p>
<p>Whether he alights on underground hip-hop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31849-dopehead/"" target=""_blank"">Dopehead</a>), vocodered soul (Talc), quiet storm psychedelia, or skittering, looping grooves (Jitwam), Moody moves at a flâneur’s pace, easeful yet determinedly at his own leisure and meter. Beats might never accelerate beyond headnod speeds, but Moodymann continually changes up the drums: crisp snares drop into swinging hi-hat patterns, Brazilian congas into Rich Medina’s kickdrums back into smoky downtempo, with fellow Detroit producer Andrés’ contribution adding a Latin flare to the mix. The first half posits an alternate history of 21st century soul and R&amp;B: Passing over well-known acts, he finds jewels in the shadows, like the Pied Pipers’ remix of ""Can’t Hold Back"" and Julien Dyne’s ""Stained Glass Fresh Frozen,"" and places them alongside tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"" target=""_blank"">Jai Paul</a>.</p>
<p>It’s 16 tracks in before the BPMs enter disco territory, with Rodney Hunter’s ""Uptown Tricks"" remix of the Fort Knox Five. But not even two minutes later, that momentum veers into the solemn solo guitar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1857-jose-gonzalez/"" target=""_blank"">José González</a>, who sings ""we’ll remain after everything’s been washed away."" From there, Moodymann picks it back up, from the quickening future jazz of ""Tag Team Triangle"" to the deep house of Joeski, and where other producers might lose or confuse a crowd with such temperamental switches, Moodymann holds us calmly in the palm of his hand. Who else would suss out a Kings of Tomorrow track from 2013 (stuck on a CDR promo no less), some 20 years after their '90s heyday, to push the mix to its ecstatic peak? But that’s exactly what he does on ""Fall for You.""</p>
<p>He again deviates from trajectory for a dramatic, beatless reading of Anne Clark’s ""Our Darkness."" For Detroiters who grew up on legendary radio jockey <a href=""http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/05/electrifying-mojo-feature"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Electrifying Mojo</a>, this proto-techno spoken word track is a classic, the type of brooding synth-pop track (what you’d now deem darkwave) that in the early '80s music blurred the color lines on the dancefloor. Dropping a live, piano-only version here, Moody harkens back to his Detroit roots, and Clark’s lines about ""[an] idealistic assurance that…we'd keep our heads above the blackened water/ But there's no room for ideals in this mechanical place"" are particularly resonant. Clark’s song rails against detachment as a means for surviving in the modern era, of keeping ideals intact in the face of insurmountable odds. It might sound like an outlier in the mix, but it doubles as Dixon Jr.’s own outlook. ""I am not the hottest motherfucking DJ in the world,"" is how Moody put it during his RBMA lecture. ""I am not going to play the hottest tracks in the world, but what I will do is give you the truth on them turntables.""</p></div>"|21580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21580-dj-kicks/|8.4|Andy Beta

Before her foray into country music, the singer had led the Chapel Hill band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5862-bellafea/"" target=""_blank"">Bellafea</a> through two distinct iterations, first as a quiet/loud indie duo then as a snarling punk trio, and Mount Moriah seemed like the latest pit stop for a restless songwriter who hadn’t fully settled on a vision yet. That the band paired her with guitarist Jenks Miller, of the form-breaking metal project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"" target=""_blank"">Horseback</a>, only furthered the impression that this was a side project. Despite their obvious reverence for traditional American song styles, there was a whiff of dress-up about their act. They sounded less like a country band than an indie band playing country music.</p>
<p>Two albums on, they’ve shed the last of those lingering indie trappings. The trio is now so fluent in roots music that it passes as their native tongue, and McEntire wears the sublime twang in her voice so naturally that it’s easy to forget it wasn’t there on Bellafea’s albums. Equal parts honey and brimstone, that voice was the star attraction on Mount Moriah’s first albums, and it is on their third effort, <i>How to Dance</i>, too. But where the band’s previous records were sometimes overly careful not to crowd her, <i>How to Dance</i> gives her some welcome competition. It’s the band’s fullest, peppiest album yet, building on the wider instrumental palette that 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17590-mount-moriah-miracle-temple/"">Miracle Temple</a></i> introduced with punchier tempos, flashier accompaniments, and a little more of a fighting spirit.</p>
<p><i>How to Dance</i> is most invigorating when it sweeps the band’s easy-rolling tunes off of the front porch and drops them at the roadhouse. Miller’s guitar packs ""Precita"" tight with one plucky honk-tonk lick after another, keeping the energy up for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Olsen</a>, who shadows McEntire on vocals. His terse, blustery riffs drive ""Cardinal Cross,"" but generally he resists showboating, preferring to play off of his collaborators. On ""Fox in the City,"" his guitar gradually recedes to clear room for a waltzing violin, while on opener ""Calvander"" his brief, tuneful riffs are complemented by woozy Memphis horns, which McEntire’s voice weaves around with the limber grace of a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison/"" target=""_blank"">Van Morrison</a>.</p>
<p>Freed by the extra instruments, McEntire delivers some of her loosest, most soulful performances, even as her lyrics remain consumed by lofty matters of faith. Early on ""Calvander,"" she drops to her knees and prays ""to something for some kind, any kind of light,"" and whatever or whoever she prayed to must have been listening, because she finds it all over these 10 songs. On ""Chiron (God in the Brier),"" she discovers God underneath a water tower near Fishdam Road. On ""Higher Mind"" she meets him at the North Carolina fishing resort Oceanana Pier. She peppers her lyrics with the names of unassuming places where these kinds of revelations could conceivably occur: Grizzly Peak, Baker Beach, Okefenokee, Davis Square, Crooked River, Honey Lake, Newport River, and so on. You could lose an afternoon researching all the landmarks she mentions, getting lost in the surprisingly fascinating minutia of main streets and highway rest areas you’d never heard of before (Oceanana Pier really does look like <a href=""http://www.crystalcoast.com/oceanana-pier.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a lovely vacation spot</a>).</p>
<p>There’s some irony in a band named for one of the bible’s most holy sites setting an album about magnificent religious awakenings almost exclusively in small-town locales of no biblical significance, but the everyday backdrops are in keeping with McEntire’s inclusive view of spirituality. On Mount Moriah’s first albums, McEntire reconciled her identities as a Christian Southerner, despite being far from the textbook representation of either community, so it makes sense that she doesn’t draw all that much distinction between the fabled Jerusalem mountain where God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his second son and a beach motel whose annual fishing contest pays out $150 in cash prizes. In <i>How to Dance</i>'s worldview, celestial enlightenment can occur to anyone, anywhere.</p></div>"|21525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21525-how-to-dance/|7.0|Evan Rytlewski

First as a mash-up artist and more recently, as a rapper and producer, he’s worked to convene dissimilar sounds and musicians in service of his vision. On his latest full-length, <i>Ritualize</i>, his curatorial instincts have kicked into overdrive. ""We on that lush Primavera sound,"" Lushlife quips on the title track. And indeed, the credits for the album read like the lineup for an eclectic music festival, ranging from singer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Nadler</a> to little-known Philly rapper Yikes the Zero.</p>
<p>This time around, Lushlife has even outsourced some of the production, abandoning the warm boom-bap of his earlier, self-produced work in favor of collaborations with Philly electro trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28777-cslsx/"" target=""_blank"">CSLSX</a>. The end result is a soaring, cinematic sound rooted in live instruments that’s more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a>. There’s an impressive range on display here, from the orchestral prog of ""Burt Reynolds (Desert Visions)"" to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"" target=""_blank"">William Basinski</a> tribute ""Integration Loop."" Many of the album's guests add to the richness of the production as well. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3581-rjd2/"" target=""_blank"">RJD2</a> gets a co-production credit on the heady, multi-part ""Toynbee Suite,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29802-i-break-horses/"" target=""_blank"">I Break Horses</a> contribute swells of psychedelic guitar and spectral backing vocals to ""The Waking World,"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> stops by for some unabashed Vangelis worship, helping evoke the neon glow of <i>Blade Runner</i>’s slick, wet streets on""Hong Kong (Lady of Love).""</p>
<p>While all this music provides ample grist for the mill, Lushlife rarely manages to wrest the listener’s attention away from the backdrop. He essentially has one flow—a breathless, nasal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a>-esque cadence—but lacks Tony Starks’ charisma or storytelling ability. Lyrically, his bars are peppered with signifiers of taste: he’s shouting out Roky Erickson, Mary Timony, and Isabella Rossellini, sipping on barleywine and La Fin du Monde. Thanks to his straight-faced delivery, however, all these references feel humorless, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> without the irony. He attempts to squirm into a few interesting perspectives—for example, Mark David Chapman’s on ""The Waking World""—but largely trawls the surface, delivering punchlines like, ""He hold the heat standing outside of the Dakota watching/ While Holden Caulfield just telling him when to let the glock spit."" At one point he refers to his style as ""<i>Bottle Rocket</i> rap,"" which certainly doesn't help the perception that this is hip-hop music for the Wes Anderson set.</p>
<p>These deficiencies come into sharper focus when Lushlife is forced to share space with more seasoned rappers. Philly lifer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"" target=""_blank"">Freeway</a> sounds revitalized on ""Strawberry Mansion,"" following serious health issues last year; while his performance isn’t quite ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeEVla7PVH8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cannon</a>""-level here, hearing him rap over a sunny, synth-driven instrumental is a thrill unto itself. By his own high standards, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a>’s verse on ""This Ecstatic Cult"" sounds phoned in but even so, he manages to run circles around Lushlife without lifting a finger. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the best verse on <i>Ritualize</i> comes from the hungriest emcee of the bunch: North Carolina rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30893-deniro-farrar/"" target=""_blank"">Deniro Farrar</a>. Farrar's deliberate, grime-influenced flow sounds genuinely menacing set against ""Incantation""’s  spare backdrop of echoing snare hits and palm-muted guitar (Lushlife and CSLSX wisely let the otherwise busy beat drop out before Farrar gets on the mic). </p>
<p>While there is no shortage of interesting ideas or capable musicians on <i>Ritualize</i>, in the absence of a compelling vision, it doesn’t add up to much. As Lushlife surely knows, the thrill of a good mash-up comes from the tension of two disparate ideas rubbing up against each other and there are far too few of those moments to be found here. Ultimately, <i>Ritualize</i> feels like a party with plenty of interesting guests but little conversation—it’s hard not to blame the host. </p></div>"|21566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21566-ritualize/|5.8|Mehan Jayasuriya

But the New York/London label has evolved in the six years since its founding. Rather than gravitate toward artists whose music pours from speakers like molasses, Tri Angle is now just as likely to sign acts that mix bass music, techno, and noise in unpredictable ways (so long as the atmosphere mostly remains sufficiently chilly). ""Everyone I choose to work with, all the records have to make sense as a whole,"" label founder Robin Carolan told the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-nirenberg/conversation-with-robin-c_b_7303156.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Huffington Post</a> last year. ""I don't expect them to make sense to everyone, but for me I can connect the dots."" As its signees have been increasingly adopted by mainstream pop artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>, new acts continue to deconstruct the genre from the inside out.</p>
<p>Brood Ma, a London-based producer and recent signee to the label, joins forward-thinking artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21081-communion/"" target=""_blank"">Rabit</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21335-third-law/"" target=""_blank"">Roly Porter</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20319-lotic-heterocetera-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Lotic</a>, who seem capable of piling endless genre touchstones into a single track. <i>Daze</i> is Brood Ma's third LP and first with Tri Angle, but the artist's aesthetic couldn't be more in line with the label's current penchant for postmodern experimentation. Over the course of the album's 13 tracks, only one exceeds three minutes, and seven are less than two. Rather than maintain a singular focus, the producer skips from idea to idea, uniting decades of club music under a singular industrial umbrella.</p>
<p>Opening track ""Westerly Spawned Lamb"" is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"" target=""_blank"">the Haxan Cloak</a>'s analgesic soundscapes, while the record's political themes parallel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30056-fatima-al-qadiri/"" target=""_blank"">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>'s net-art politicking. (Brood Ma has described the record as ""a documentary of the military engagements played out amongst adults and children across worldwide server space and an attempted critique of the current obsession with survival playtime, played out through politically prosed pop references and narratives of fictional, future juvenilia""—which, OK, sure.) There are forays into trip-hop (""Sex Compressor"") and noise (""Sex Contortion""), but rarely does any singular genre tag capture the uncanniness, or uncategorizable Brood Ma-ness, of the producer's industrial synths, grime-oriented beats, and ominous sub-bass.</p>
<p>Most interesting is how Brood Ma treats pastiche as an ideology. Before joining Tri Angle, the producer released music via the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27930-untold/"" target=""_blank"">Untold</a>-run <a href=""http://www.hemlockrecordings.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hemlock Recordings</a> as well as Quantum Natives, a UK label/collective whose members embody the intersection of Internet provocation and underground rave culture. (The <a href=""http://quantumnatives.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">label's website</a> is an unofficial Google map showing an alien planet that recalls <i>StarCraft</i> and drone surveillance photography; its Soundcloud description: ""a battle for survival in the nightmare undercity (in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war)"".) Like much of the artists released by his previous labels, this is music whose technocratic aesthetic is impossible to divorce from the listening process. The album cover may recall an occult bonfire, but Brood Ma is more <i>Neuromancer</i> than necromancer.</p>
<p>Part of the success of <i>Daze</i> is how fully Brood Ma commits to his sonic palette without committing to a singular musical style. ""Molten Brownian Motion"" pounds like hardcore (of the drum and bass variety) injected with Xenomorph DNA, while ""Social Re-Entry"" is apocalyptic bass music with a twisted vocal sample that's both something soulful and sinister. Many of the tracks have a sculptural feel to them, like you're hearing the visual equivalent to one of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Bourgeois"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Louise Bourgeois</a>' metal spiders. There's also a wry playfulness to the music: ""Goldman Sax"" is 13 seconds of arpeggiated freakout, but its title is unabashedly cheeky. There's also, perhaps surprisingly, actual hooks to be found when the tracks are given time to unfurl. ""Sacrificial Youth"" is danceable enough that it could use another three minutes attached to its runtime, which is both a compliment and a criticism: How often do you wish that a club track was 110% longer? Then again, this is the sort of intellectual party where we're supposed to think about how we got here rather than lose ourselves in the music. <i>Daze</i> is one last defiant middle finger emoji to a world crumbling in on itself—scarily contemporary, often caustic, but not without a sense of humor.</p></div>"|21533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21533-daze/|7.5|Nathan Reese

It wasn’t until the advent of the Haight-Asbury-friendly ""Jesus movement"" in the late '60s that CCM (Contemporary Christian Music) became a staple in worship services. Before there were charts and public access programs full of it, the genre’s seeds were being planted by individual voices like Benny Hester’s, young singer/songwriters strumming guitars outside of makeshift chapels—Hester <a href=""http://fiveonthefive.edublogs.org/2014/12/17/five-minutes-with-benny-hester/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recalls</a> first attending a ""gigantic tent revival on [a] vacant lot."" He and his peers remained enamored with both the psychedelic sounds of post-Beatles rock <i>and</i> the therapeutic possibilities of Christ.</p>
<p>Today, Hester is regarded as one of the CCM movement’s pioneers. He wrote many of the genre’s standards, and would go on to release <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPen1jQrlhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the longest-running #1 on the Christian music charts in 1985</a>. But a full decade earlier—when Hester got his first break as a solo artist—he was poised for a more uncertain career path, and on a potentially larger scale. Hester spent the late ‘60s and early ‘70s bumming around Las Vegas. He hawked jingles and helped out at soul recording sessions before an opportunity to record his songs arose. Miraculously, the most in-demand mercenary musicians in town were part of the deal. The result of Hester’s sessions with the ""Taking Care (of) Business"" band—famous for backing Elvis during this time—was <i>Benny...,</i> a modest collection of well-scrubbed baroque pop. At this time, Hester was forming his identity: The record is not fully secular, not explicitly the Word. It’s musical schematics are about as idiomatic for the time period as one can imagine: Opener ""Give Your Love Forever"" makes this immediately clear, mirroring the melody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYUgGs9IStY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Old Man</a>,"" from that February’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13771-neil-young-everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere-after-the-gold-rush-harvest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Harvest</i></a>. Later, the likenesses pile up more and more, from the precocious neo-classic pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22319-the-left-banke/"" target=""_blank"">the Left Banke</a> to pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17499-rumours/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rumours</i></a> Lindsey Buckingham (""What’s Happened to My Friends”) to Chipmunk-ed <i>Tumbleweed Connection</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/"" target=""_blank"">Elton John</a> (""The Painter"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps the album could have gotten some modest traction, if only in nu-Christian circles. But just after a literal handful of promos were sent out, the home of his label burned down, and <i>Benny…</i>’s masters along with it. Hester would make a proper debut in 1978, but he’s called the loss of his first, non-CCM record ""the greatest disappointment that I’d ever had in my life."" One wonders if the reason for the decades-long delay in the record’s release—remastered from errant vinyl copies—was more personal than practical. Now, 44 years later, <i>Benny…</i> sounds too odd in its delivery to imagine as anything other than a collector-championed footnote.</p>
<p>Its eccentric character comes from the tension between the naivete of Hester’s agile, high-tenor vocal—mired in his pronounced Southern drawl—and the TCB Band’s adept, chamber orchestra-enhanced arrangements. One can imagine what inchoate, less convincing solo acoustic demos might have sounded like, but guitarist James Burton and his cohort improve every song’s chances. One of the record’s most cloying compositions, ""Love Never Dies,"" organizes around the Donovan-esque refrain of ""Have you seen the people there/ They are speaking words of love/ From their souls."" However, the song gains lustre from phantasmal string cushioning and a cascading, George Harrison-esque guitar solo.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Benny…</i>’s tracks are made more appealing by their sophisticated arrangements, though electric-piano-driven clodhopper ""Malcombe,"" with its fidgety, Ren Faire aspect, is unsalvageable. A few songs feel like a musical triumph on every level, demonstrating Hester’s sensitive and detail-oriented ability with a melody. On tracks like highlight ""No the End Is Not Near,"" beautifully voiced electric guitar and a lilting bassline highlight and complicate Hester’s simple strummed acoustic backdrop. The words are crammed awkwardly, avoiding rhymes that could have been pulled off with the help of a wilier co-lyricist.  But without these kinks, <i>Benny…</i> would certainly lose some of its character.</p>
<p>There is a sadness listening back to <i>Benny…</i> knowing that it would be a false start rather than a fortuitous beginning. The singer/songwriter’s most famous work would merge deathly smooth, Kenny Loggins-esque funk with the sensibility of tragic-anthemic rock opera, articulating more somber Christian messages and narratives. Much of this music demonstrates a sharp pop prowess, but the sunnier, more pantheistic <i>Benny…</i> stands in contrast to it both lyrically and compositionally. It’s the charmingly transparent work of a fledgling singer-songwriter realizing his first group of songs, which offers as utopian a vision of its decade as ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxtZpFl3pPM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I’d like to buy the world a Coke</a>."" A slight, necessary edge is provided by allusions toward a slightly unsettled sense of faith (""The Bridge""). ""I believe I’m about to change…Please let this be so,"" he sings late in the album, with saucer-eyed earnesty. Hester was indeed on the cusp of a change and a new becoming, but it was to be much more hard-won than he imagined.</p></div>"|21564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21564-benny-hester-benny/|7.4|Winston Cook-Wilson

Early on they wore <a href=""http://hypetrak.com/images/2011/03/animalcollective.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">masks</a>—a gesture that connected them not only to the lucid dreams of playtime but to traditions of shamanism and present-day Mardi Gras, where people hide their faces not to disguise their natures but reveal them. Their songs morphed and rambled and writhed with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtnSSIPCvik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the liveness of kimchi or kombucha</a>, less finished product than something that fermented and evolved as you listened.

<p>Like most seekers, they get made fun of a lot. It's actually hard to think of music whose bad reputation is more disproportionately out of balance with its good intentions than Animal Collective's without dipping into Christian radio or trip-hop. Whether the jokes—which are mostly about drum circles, jam bands and shakily understood allusions to ""shrooms""—are onto something or just contaminated by the tellers' own personal fears is in the eye of the beholder; suffice it to say that I agree with Nietzsche when he said that it is man alone who suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No doubt said jokers will be happy to hear that the band prepared for their new album, <i>Painting With</i>, by bringing baby pools into the studio and projecting dinosaurs on the wall. Like 2012's <i>Centipede Hz</i>, <i>Painting With</i> is a bright, epileptically busy piece of music that crams every element of the band's sound into a landscape without depth or recess. Instead of the aquatic lullabies of <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> or the naturalism of <i>Sung Tongs,</i> we get something like a <a href=""http://www.gagosian.com/__data/ef029d3f4bc58bdec93a6952085bc683.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1980s Frank Stella</a> or one of Jeff Koons' <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/3054170348_acabda6f57.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">balloon dogs</a>: Rad, synthetic and ready to jump directly into your face.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Depth and hiddenness become metaphors here. Watching the rockets' red glare over Baghdad in April, 2003, I was ready for an album like <i>Here Comes the Indian</i>, whose <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhaml2XQFIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nightmarish volatility</a> reminded me that whatever evil men do starts in the heart; after the 2008 election I vibed unapologetically with the optimism of ""My Girls,"" which sounded like Peter Pan taking the wheel and telling the Darling children everything was going to be all right.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Now, values and messages that once seemed implicit in the band's music—love, freedom, the general idea that modern life is an interesting but fucked-up endeavor from which something very dear has been lost—are stitched right into the sleeves of their windbreakers. ""Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home?"" goes the coda of <i>Painting With</i>'s giddy opening song, ""FloriDada."" ""The bridge that someone's fighting over / That bridge that someone's paying for / A bridge so old so let it go."" Seconds earlier, they sample the ""Wipe Out,"" just to make sure you know they come in peace and packed all the toys. Even the title ""FloriDada,"" has the quality of a joke explained. Though it pains me to say it, there are times that <i>Painting With</i> feels less like Animal Collective than Animal Collective: the Ride.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the absence of a less effable genius, there's always elbow grease. <i>Painting With</i> feels, more than anything, like a kind of construction project: Each sound meticulously built and only faintly familiar, each second crammed with doodads, as though the band was worried either they or their audience might get bored. The human voice, which in the past has given their music not just a so-called human element but a devotional, almost religious glow, has been reduced to a party trick, with Avey Tare and Panda Bear trading syllables like two anxious <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJmvBM18SiU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Globetrotters</a>. The album's best songs—""Golden Gal,"" ""Recycling""—aren't just highlights, they're breathers.</p>
<p>As someone who has no hangups about admitting that this band changed not only how I think about music but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/secondhands/9375-forever-21-a-look-back-at-animal-collectives-sung-tongs/"">how I thought about life</a>, it's easy to wonder if <i>Painting With</i> and <i>Centipede Hz</i> signal an ending, or at least a consequential lull. Fifteen years is longer than most bands last, let alone great ones. Part of Animal Collective's image—or my image of them, at least—entailed fantasy of three to four guys sacrificing themselves at the foot of their loop pedals to conjure some other, bigger, more powerful god. Now, they're parents living in different zip codes and riding the festival circuit. Panda Bear's solo albums are more interesting than they've ever been and Avey Tare has kept busy, but the time that they were a bellwether for the horizon of independent music seems in ebb. Old heads will tell you that the most exciting part of seeing them live was hearing songs months, sometimes <i>years</i> before they came out on record: I, for example, remember being in the basement of a sushi restaurant in Charlottesville, Virginia, watching <i>Feels</i> before anyone knew it existed, or wading through Webster Hall to a gorgeous, slowly dawning song they later called ""Banshee Beat."" The feeling of that moment is hard to describe, but it was something like standing in the light of a secret. Times change, life intervenes. <i>Painting With</i> was the first time the band jumped right into the studio. Work can be scheduled, magic can't.</p>

He's talking about the enormous stacks of speakers that have rocked the UK ever since they were imported from Jamaica in the 1950s, and his voiceover is part history lesson, part autobiography and part sermon. The title of the song, ""Language of the bass,"" comes from a refrain that he intones with the gravitas usually reserved for scripture, and true to form, the song's synthesized bassline writhes like a thing alive, its portamento glide and nimble syncopations as expressive as glyphs.</p>
<p>But <i>Basar </i>isn't really a sound-system album; with the exception of ""Language of the Bass,"" UK dance culture barely figures. Instead, it's an album about hybridity, about the way that far-flung styles and sounds can make excellent dance partners. Refreshingly, there is nothing didactic about the German duo's approach. Rather than reprising established histories, Africaine 808 seem determined to devise their own narrative, one that reinvents the entire concept of ""world music"" from the ground up.</p>
<p>This has been their way since the beginning. One of Africaine 808's early singles, ""Lagos, New York,"" built a bridge between Nigerian rhythms and New York disco, while ""Cosmicumbia"" linked cumbia, cosmic disco, and Afrobeat. <i>Basar </i>incorporates a host of disparate musical styles and conventions, but never in a tokenistic way: Instead, it's a joyful mélange of sounds and rhythms, all underpinned by intricately programmed TR-808 patterns. In ""Ngoni,"" a West African string instrument provides the center of gravity for a rich, evolving array of rolling hand percussion, marimba, and fat, throbbing synthesizers. ""Crawfish Got Soul"" begins with the kind of jokey sample you might expect to find on <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i>—a barking seal, a vintage recording of an MC exhorting people to loosen up and dance—and quickly launches into a sprightly, Southern-fried mix of upright bass, blues guitar, horns, vibraphone, and Farfisa organs. </p>
<p>Their hybrid approach is an extension of the DJ-friendly edits of African and Latin music that the duo's members, Dirk Leyers and DJ Nomad, have been making for their <a href=""http://www.vulkandance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vulkandance</a> parties for years. But <i>Basar </i>doesn't limit its perspective to the dancefloor: ""The Awakening,"" the album's opening track, deploys airy horns and strings in a way that's reminiscent of spiritual jazz, and the 808 doesn't even enter until halfway through the track. All of the album's songs tend to follow similarly serpentine arrangements, evolving as inscrutably and as naturally as the movements of a crowd. When they want to, they can also write flat-out beautiful songs: ""Ready for Something New"" is a tender tune featuring the vocals of the Israeli singer Ofri Brin, while ""Fallen From the Stars"" sounds like a melancholy response to Beanfield's great broken-beat ballad ""<a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x17vp7_beanfield-the-season_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Season</a>.""</p>
<p>What really unifies the album is its deep sense of musicality. The album wouldn't be the same without the contributions of the Congolese/German percussionist Dodo N'Kishi, a longtime collaborator of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/"">Mouse on Mars</a>, and the Ghanian percussionist Eric Owusu, who has played with Ebo Taylor. On ""Language of the Bass,"" the interplay between bassline, squeaky synth lead, hi-hats, and myriad other accenting sounds amounts to a dazzling feat of syncopation. Despite that song's title and voiceover, what ultimately makes it sing isn't just its bassline, but how the pieces conjure the whole. With <i>Basar</i>, they have assembled a vast glossary of fresh sounds, considerably enriching the language of contemporary dance music in the process.</p></div>"|21398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21398-basar/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

As the oldest musicians reckon with maturity in a genre that was developed for and by their young and reactionary selves, and successive generations of musicians discover the grit and power of an increasing number of subgenre styles, the dialogue about what's punk and what isn't gets increasingly tangled. At the core of every single one of those subgenres, though, and therefore residing somewhere at the core of punk itself, is minimalist force—sometimes pure id, sometimes reflexive egoic commentary thereon, sometimes both at once. Minimalist force is what Seattle's So Pitted does. They excel at it. </p>
<p>On <i>neo</i>, their debut, the trio sound like the proverbial (mechanical) bull in a china shop<span>—</span>except that bull is intentionally there to fuck up some fine dinnerware and is determined to have a hell of a time doing it. Guitarist Jeannine Koewler's melodic lines, lower on the scale and blown out through a bass amp, bulk out their nasty sound. Drummer Liam Downey, who also shares some of the vocal duties, is what a punk drummer needs to be: both a hard hitter and nimbly able to keep quick time when necessary. Vocalist and guitarist Nathan Rodriguez snarls his way through his scratchy, dissonant, percussive instrumental work just as much as he does in his robotic, distorted singing.</p>
<p>There's certainly a lot of Touch &amp; Go and AmRep (and early Sub Pop, too, which makes their choice of label perfectly logical) back catalog mining to what So Pitted does, as there is for any contemporary noise rock band. But songs like ""i'm not over it,"" which is half sludgy instrumental and half incitement to circle pit; ""the sickness,"" which slides from noise-rock gnarl to post-punk precariousness in a way that seems wholly natural; and ""holding the void,"" in which layers of noise and screel are added and peeled away to reckless effect, pay their homages without walking in the footsteps of those who came before.</p>
<p>Best of all, So Pitted sound like they move as a unit. This is where their true energy derives—from their internal communication. You don't hear the gears grinding or see the wires—you only see the bull in all its terrifying, joyful glory and the destruction it causes. </p></div>"|21465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21465-neo/|7.0|Jes Skolnik

The album, Rokia Traoré’s sixth in a career spanning almost two decades, hangs loosely around that same theme. The concept of home has long been fluid for the Malian singer/songwriter, who grew up traveling the world with her diplomat father and who today splits her time between Bamako, Brussels, and Marseille. Before that, not long after the <a href=""http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/2012322111037483270.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mali conflict</a> erupted in 2012, she relocated temporarily to Paris but continued to grapple with personal difficulties that had pushed her to consider quitting music. As a result, on <i>Né So</i>, home encompasses the personal and the political, from refuge and nostalgia, to love and freedom.</p>
<p><i>Né So</i> opens with a benediction. On “Tu voles” (“You fly”), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27487-rokia-traore/"">Rokia Traoré</a> sings in French, “You fly/ From every hurt/ You release yourself/ And you swim through the air/ You fly…” Her raspy, quavering voice floats untethered over a spritely reggae guitar and lilting blues figures. By all accounts, she’s trying to sing you, and herself, to a freer place, where, “Body and soul are aligned” and “You glimpse your ideal.”</p>
<p>Working with producer/musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3251-john-parish/"">John Parish</a> (PJ Harvey, Tracy Chapman, Eels), who also produced her last album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17846-rokia-traore-beautiful-africa/""><i>Beautiful Africa</i></a>, Rokia keeps <i>Né So</i> intimate and minimalistic. Her music is, as ever, mainly a mix of Mandingue and Western pop/rock influences. But this time around, she sounds tired, even as she doubles down on giving moral lessons throughout. On “Ile,” Rokia sings in Bambara over lithe Afrobeat guitars and a drum kit imitating calebasse rhythms: “You there/ Why inflict on others what would be woe for yourself?/ I don’t like violence.” And on “Kolokani,” she sings a soft lullaby reminiscing about her hometown of the same name while paying her respects: “Those who stayed at the source give meaning to our past.” </p>
<p>Most of the textural differences from song to song on <i>Né So</i> are slight, so they tend to bleed into one another. “Kenia” is the most dynamic track on the record vocally, as Rokia switches her airier singing style in for a more strident Wassoulou-esque sound à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28081-oumou-sangare/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Oumou Sangaré</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29937-fatoumata-diawara/"">Fatoumata Diawara</a>. The guitars buoying her alternate between Tuareg and American blues. But Traoré herself has pulled this off before to similarly charismatic effect, so while it’s a perfectly good song, it remains unremarkable outside the context of the album. It’s telling, actually, that the one standout track here is a cover. In Traoré’s rendition of “Strange Fruit,” made famous by Billie Holiday, a solitary bass lumbers beneath a guitar line that bends and wavers like heat over asphalt. Her voice aches and shudders, giving way in the end to a ngoni solo that hovers in the middle distance, like a ghostly reminder of ancestors past.</p>
<p>This is the album’s turning point; the remaining two tracks are less songs than they are speeches set to music. On the title track, Rokia<i> </i>says (in French), “In 2014 another five million five hundred thousand people fled their homes/ Forced to seek refuge in towns and countries far from home.” It’s an important message, to be sure. But the track comes perilously close to feeling like the soundtrack to a TV fundraiser special, of the kind where important people appear on screen reciting statistics and platitudes about the human condition over melodramatic background music.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that label-mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart"">Devendra Banhart</a> joins in to represent the voice of the displaced, delivering lines like, “Where to place my dreams/ Where to hold a heart opened to joy/ Opened to hope.” It only gets worse on the album’s closer, “Se Dan,” which sits somewhere between TED Talk, overwrought spoken word poem, and a lecture from your mom (who loves you but is concerned and wants you to learn some respect). On it, Rokia is joined once more by Devendra to pontificate, this time in English, about how we all have, “One world/ One destiny/ One aim/ One thing to never forget: respect."" The sentiment is heartfelt but it verges on the trite, which can be said of the album as a whole. </p></div>"|21556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21556-ne-so/|5.8|Minna Zhou

From the late '90s through the end of the Bush years, the Twin Cities were known nationally for the Rhymesayers roster above all else. Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Eyedea typified the Cities' dominant styles: self-deprecating, socially conscious, abstract. This music was sometimes cordoned off as ""backpack rap,"" but as early as <i>Lucy Ford </i>it had morphed into something weirder. In any event, this aesthetic mostly trickled down to the local scenes and the promoters who curated it. </span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But as two of the three aforementioned acts moved into middle age (and after Eyedea tragically died in 2010), it left a stylistic vacuum that artists from all corners rushed to fill. Some of the new decade's most exciting work has been tailored for the live setting: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/grrrlprty"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grrrl Party</a> springs to mind, as does <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koxVpvWmry8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wag music</a>, a glitchy, stuttering type of party rap that indulges all its best and weirdest impulses. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thestand4rd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Stand4rd</a> earned national attention with ghost-infested R&amp;B; <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mikethemartyr/sets/marbury"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mike the Martyr</a> is bringing back Starburys from the discount bin at Foot Locker; <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/findingnovyon/sets/supersaiyanep/s-Ej8i7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Finding Novyon</a> is rapping about beloved cartoon characters. And Why Khaliq, a young upstart from St. Paul, is turning out some of the Cities' most forward-thinking music, and he's doing it by circling way, <i>way</i> back. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Under the Perspective Tree</i>, his new seven-song EP, takes the visual and musical signifiers of late-'90s and early-'00s conscious rap and injects into them welcome doses of immediacy and personal detail, and at least a half-dozen new flows. Start with the cover. A black man has been hanged from a tree, from which also dangles red lingerie over scattered Hennessy bottles, piles of cash, and gold chains. Slave hymnals bookend the opening song itself. But it hones in immediately: <i>It's 3 a.m., I'm in my baby mama's mama's house</i>. And that's what Khaliq does time and time again over the course of the record—zoom in when you expect the sweeping argument.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Producer Lelan Foley can be largely credited for how loose and improvisational <i>Perspective Tree </i>feels<i>.</i> The EP leans heavily on jazz piano and pavement-hard drum programming, arranged in such a way that each part of a song feels as if it shifts into the next of its own accord. On “Knew the Half,” Foley brings in the type of rolling hi-hats that are more often found in contemporary trap music, but lays them under one of the tape's warmest melodies to hypnotic effect. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Khaliq is a precise rapper and a personal, colorful writer. To stay on “Knew the Half”: he drags your focus in and out of the drum pattern, letting his syllables fall consistently but switching where he places the emphasis in each bar. Later in that song, and in a handful of others (“For You,” “Nonchalant Interlude”), Khaliq deploys a captivating singing voice, which breaks up the sound and structure of the project. Why Khaliq is the type of rapper superbly suited for his time: one who understands how to use the past to move forward. It would be a shock if the next year or so doesn't afford him a chance to latch on to the present. </span></p></div>"|21581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21581-under-the-perspective-tree-ep/|7.8|Paul A.

Kanye, specifically, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">toasted them</a>. <i>The Life of Pablo</i>'s namesake is a provocation, a mystery, a sly acknowledgement of multitudes: Drug lord Pablo Escobar is a permanent fixture of rap culture, but the mystery of ""<a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-life-of-pablo-which-famous-pablo-has-kanye-west-named-his-new-album-after"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which one?</a>"" set Twitter theorists down fascinating rabbit holes, drawing up convincing stand-ins for Kanye's Blue Period (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i>), his Rose Period (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i>), and his Crystal Period (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"">Yeezus</a></i>). If Kanye is comparable to Picasso, <i>The Life of Pablo</i> is the moment, after a turbulent life leaving many artistic revolutions and mistreated women in his wake, that the artist finally settles down. In this formulation, Kim Kardashian is Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's final muse and the woman to whom he remained faithful (she even kinda <a href=""http://viola.bz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/portraits-by-Picasso-of-Jacqueline-Roque.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looks like a Kardashian</a>), and the record is the sound of a celebrated megalomaniac settling for his place in history.</p>
<p><i>The Life of Pablo</i> is, accordingly, the first Kanye West album that's just an album: No major statements, no reinventions, no zeitgeist wheelie-popping. It's probably his first full-length that won't activate a new sleeper cell of 17-year-old would-be rappers and artists. He's changed the genre's DNA with every album, to the point where each has inspired a generation of direct offspring, and now everywhere he looks, he sees mirrors. ""See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes, and now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes,"" he raps wryly on ""I Love Kanye."" The message seems clear: He's through creating new Kanyes, at least for now. He's content to just stand among them, both those of his own creation and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">their</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">various</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">devotees</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kanye's second child Saint was born in early December, and there's something distinctly preoccupied about this whole project—it feels wry, hurried, mostly good-natured, and somewhat sloppy. Like a lot of new parents, Kanye feels laser-focused on big stuff—love, serenity, forgiveness, karma—and a little frazzled on the details. ""Ultralight Beam"" opens with the sound of a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8jmM8lixW/?taken-by=sheisnatalie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4-year-old preaching gospel</a>, some organ, and a church choir: ""This is a God dream,"" goes the refrain. But everything about the album's presentation—the churning tracklist, the broken promises to premiere it here or there, the scribbled guest list—feels like Kanye ran across town to deliver a half-wrapped gift to a group birthday party to which he was 10 minutes late.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thankfully, he's bringing a Kanye album, and Kanye albums make pretty goddamn good gifts. His devotion to the craft of album-making remains his greatest talent. Albums are his legacy, what he knows, deep down, will endure after the circus of attention he maintains around him subsides. His ability to package hundreds of stray threads into a whole that feels not just thrilling, but <i>inevitable—</i>at this, he is better than everyone, and he throws all of his best tricks into <i>The Life of Pablo</i> to remind us. He picks the right guests and gives them idealized settings, making people you don't care about sound fantastic and people you <i>do</i> care about sound immortal. Chance the Rapper, a spiritual heir to backpack-and-a-Benz Kanye if there ever was one, is given the spotlight on the opener ""Ultralight Beam,"" and uses his dazed, happy verse to quote both ""Otis"" and the bonus track to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8768-late-registration/""><i> Late Registration</i></a>. His joy is palpable, and it's clear he has waited his entire adult life to be featured on a Kanye album. On the other hand, ""Fade"" pits Future knockoff Post Malone, of all people, against a sample of Chicago house legend Larry Heard's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJv6qBOZbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mystery of Love</a>"" and a flip of Motown blues rock band Rare Earth's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F28X8--2dFU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Know I'm Losing You</a>"" and rigs the mix so that Malone, somehow, sounds more important than both of them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This moment is also a reminder of Kanye's audacious touch with huge, immediately recognizable pieces of musical history—his best work as a producer has always drawn from iconic songs so venerated most sane people wouldn't dare touch them, from ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gold Digger</a>"" to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QcxWPB59o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blood on the Leaves</a>"" and beyond. He doesn't just <i>sample</i> these songs, he climbs in and joyrides them like the Maybach in the ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Otis</a>"" video. On ""Famous,"" he does it twice, first by matching up Nina Simone's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4xde537g1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Do What You Gotta Do</a>"" with Rihanna, who sings the song's hook before Nina does, and then with Sister Nancy's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcaPu9JPenU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bam Bam</a>,"" which gets flipped so it sits atop a chorale-like chord progression. It sounds like a dancehall remix of Pachelbel's Canon, and it's the most joyful two minutes of music on the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Waves,"" a song that made the tracklist at the last second at Chance the Rapper's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63529-kanye-west-saturday-night-live-performance-features-chance-the-rapper-young-thug-the-dream-kelly-price-kirk-franklin-and-more/"">insistence</a>, has a similar energy. You can hear why Chance, specifically, might've wanted it back: It is a throwback to the <a href=""http://www.mariowiki.com/Rainbow_Road_(N64)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainbow Road</a> maximalism of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6mVccIqq2I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Major</a>,"" and it is so warmly redemptive it even makes Chris Brown, who sings the hook, sound momentarily benevolent. ""Waves"" is hardly the only last-second change made: The Kendrick Lamar collaboration ""No More Parties In L.A."" is back on here, as is an inexplicable minute-long voicemail from imprisoned rapper Max B, granting Kanye permission to use his popular slang term ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63189-kanye-west-viciously-attacks-wiz-khalifa-in-incredible-twitter-rant/"">wavy</a>."" Such last-second fidgets seem to say something about <i>The Life of Pablo</i> itself. After years of agonizing over how to follow up the conceptually triumphant <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>, <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, and <i>Yeezus</i>, he seems to have settled upon eternal flux as a resting place, and the album plays like Kanye might still be remixing it furiously in your headphones while you listen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Father Stretch My Hands"" tosses a sample from Southside Chicago icon, activist, and one-time fraud convict Pastor T.L. Barrett into a gurgling trash compactor alongside some pigeon-cooed backing vocals and an entire undigested verse from another Future knockoff, Brooklyn upstart Desiigner. It's the least-finished-sounding piece of music to ever feature on a Kanye album. This is the logical endpoint to the sort of obsessive perfectionism that led West to make 75 near-identical mix downs of  ""Stronger,"" and in the song's lyrics, Kanye admits that the same workaholism that made his father a distant figure in his childhood now keeps him from his family. On ""FML,"" he name-checks the antidepressant Lexapro on record for the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP8FMdVcCQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">second</a> time in a year, and alludes to something that sounds an awful lot like a manic episode. The life of a creative visionary has dark undercurrents (""name me one genius who ain't crazy,"" Kanye demands on ""Feedback"") and it's possible that <i>The Life of Pablo</i> title serves as much private warning as boastful declaration.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's most humane moments come when he reaches for his family: ""I just want to wake up with you in my eyes,"" he pleads at the end of ""Father Stretch My Hands."" On ""FML,"" a bleak song about resisting sexual temptation, he sings to Kim, ""They don't want to see me love you."" ""Real Friends"" reprises his ""Welcome to Heartbreak"" role as the unhappy outsider at his own family events, squirming through reunions and posing for pictures ""before it's back to business""; it's maybe the saddest he's ever sounded on record. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tuning into the humanity in Kanye's music amid bursts of boorish static can be difficult, and the most prominent example of assholery on <i>Pablo</i> comes from the instantly infamous jab ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,"" which feels like a piece of bathroom graffiti made to purposefully reignite the most racially-charged rivalry in 21st-century pop. But there's lots more where that came from, sneaking in behind the headline: ""If I fuck this model/ And she just bleached her asshole/ And I get bleach on my T-shirt/ I'mma feel like an asshole"" is maybe the most unforgivably stupid thing Kanye West has ever rapped. And on the bonus track ""30 Hours,"" he takes a moment to sneer, ""My ex said she gave me the best years of her life/ I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At moments like this, you sense the airlessness of super-celebrity closing in around him. Even when he was being loathsome, Kanye's behavior always felt rooted in something messy and relatable. During the wild scrum of <i>The Life of Pablo</i>'s press cycle—when he tweeted ""I own your child!!"" at Wiz Khalifa in response to a minor misunderstanding, or his ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/697199554807099394?lang=en&amp;lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BILL COSBY INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!</a>"" tweet, for instance—there was a prevailing sense that Kanye had entered such a consequence-free zone that we can never truly relate to him anymore. Once upon a time, he was The Asshole Incarnate, the self-described ""douchebag"" that we couldn't look away from. But there are moments here where he just sounds like another asshole.</p>
<p>And yet, as it always does in Kanye's essentially crowd-pleasing, deeply Christian music, the light wins out over the darkness. A madcap sense of humor animates all his best work, and <i>The Life of Pablo</i> has a freewheeling energy that is infectious and unique to his discography. Somehow, it comes off as both his most labored-over and unfinished album, full of asterisks and corrections and <a href=""https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">footnotes</a>. ""It was my idea to have an open relationship, now a nigga mad,"" he jokes on ""30 Hours,"" sending up his own masculine fragility. ""I need every bad bitch up in Equinox/ I need to know right now if you a freak or not,"" he jokes on ""Highlights.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And with <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, this humor isn't just in the verses, it's in the rollout, too. Somewhere between the record's several title changes, it started to feel like Kanye had decided to turn his troubled-blockbuster-syndrome into performance art. ""We still don't have a title,"" Kim Kardashian tweeted, days before the announced rollout. The day after he rented out Madison Square Garden so he could plug in his laptop, it was suddenly unclear, again, if the album was coming out at all; the mess was so profound that a <a href=""https://twitter.com/maura/status/698149518970327041"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweet</a> noting ""Young Thug claimed on Periscope it was coming out on SNL tomorrow"" suddenly seemed like solid intel. Chaos reigned, and as the twists and turns mounted, it was hard to keep from laughing helplessly.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Around this point, the joke became clear: This whole thing—album cycles, first-week sales, release dates, the album-as-statement, the album itself—is <i>ridiculous</i>. The only other recent marquee star to allow something this messy to bear their name was Rihanna, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21540-anti/""><i>ANTI</i></a> was released into the world last month in a similarly slipshod manner. Both stars are jewels in the late-period Roc-A-Fella dynasty, their careers forged in the dying embers of the old-school music industry where promotional campaigns were telegraphed months in advance, where singles and video rollouts were executed with airstrike precision, where release dates loomed like skyscrapers. In the ensuing industry freefall, Kanye and Rihanna have weathered every absurdity imaginable—platinum plaques handed out by Samsung, <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/music/jay-z-and-kanye-west-spared-no-expense-to-watch-watch-the-throne-6624465"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">biometric suitcases carrying leakproof records</a>, artist-owned streaming services that put up their records for a few minutes by accident. Watching the sea of confusion and despair on news feeds and timelines, you can almost hear them chuckling: <i>None of this matters, because none of it is real.</i></p>
<p>If there was a larger message behind all this impulsive last-second lurching and heaving, that was it. ""We on an ultralight beam/ This is a God dream"" reads like an affirmation that we live in a world touched by divinity—but it could also mean the universe is a trick of the light, and we're nothing but a figment in a higher being's imagination. Nothing is as it seems, nothing is safe from revision, and nothing lasts: In one last rug pull, Kanye claimed that the ""Pablo"" of the title was neither Escobar nor Picasso, but St. Paul of Tarsus (""Pablo"" in Spanish). The claim slots neatly with his assertion that <i>The Life of Pablo</i> is a ""gospel album,"" and on ""Wolves,""  he offers a resonant, lonely image: Kim and Kanye as Mary and Joseph, alone in the manger and surrounded by the void.  ""Cover Nori in lamb's wool/ We surrounded by/ The fuckin wolves,"" he raps. If Pablo is indeed St. Paul, Kanye might have a passage on his mind from Corinthians, Chapter 13 verse 2: ""If I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.""</p>

Dubbed the McCombs Skiffle Players, the band playfully alloyed backwoods folk, lap-steel-infused country, and elaborate West Coast jams. The songs sprawled, the band clicked, and more shows followed, at some length. A 12-track set bootlegged last year clocked in at 100 minutes, and their debut LP, though half as long, captures the liberal, halfway-stoned spirit that’s demanded of musicians past thirty living in California.</p>
<p><i>Skifflin'</i>, an enjoyably low-stakes release,<i> </i>feels less like McCombs’ next frontier in tackling the Great American Folk Album than a leisurely sojourn. (Given the group's colorful press statement–""Peace to the spirits of the musicians who came before us and taught us the secret esoteric ways of skiffle!""–you sense an easy pace suits the rest of the band just fine.) McCombs has never been a predictable songwriter, but <i>Skifflin’</i> frees him to explore pockets of early American innovation beyond the scope of his pared-back solo work. There’s a shamanistic dirge (""Skiffle Paperclip When Science Evolves""), a quirky jam interrupted by studio in-jokes (""Skiffle Strut""), two faithful trad-folk covers (""Omie Wise"" and ""Coo Coo Bird""), and a wild freight-train skiffle called ""Railroadin' Some,"" narrated by an unhinged conductor who hollers myriad place names yet can't seem to settle on a destination.</p>
<p>Perhaps thanks to his peripatetic disposition, McCombs has a knack for silently invoking a character’s withheld details; he can be laconic, teasing, and morbid, sometimes simultaneously. Dreamy ballad ""Always,"" the first immediately McCombsian song here, complicates honey-sweet lyrics with an undertone of ambiguous resignation. ""All the way to your room/ Rising like a lost balloon ... All the way until the end/ You are my lover and my friend,"" he murmurs, before closing on a couplet that inexplicably haunts: ""No one could ever say/ We didn’t take it all the way."" ""When the Title Was Wrote"" is a perkier take on the McCombs staple, but it’s just as crafty. ""Buddha is crucified/ Another misquote,"" he sings, a loaded riddle that is conspicuous on a record concerned with the interpretation and ownership of American tradition.</p>
<p>McCombs describes songwriting as a process of ""uncovering"" ancient song forms: Folk melodies and themes, he says, are couched in our cultural fabric, waiting to be found. You see something of that worldview in the detached way he observes his characters, as if wary of imposing his truth on theirs—a wilful outsider, even in worlds of his own creation. It makes sense, then, that on <i>Skifflin’</i>’s pair of folk standards—""Coo Coo Bird"" (aka ""The Cuckoo"") and the murder ballad ""Omie Wise""—he is in his element, inhabiting stories that have gone full circle, unearthed long ago from the cultural imagination and since returned to the realm of mythology. <i>Skifflin’ </i>is full of seemingly aimless excursions, but McCombs, far from needing direction, is just finding something larger than himself to get lost in.</p></div>"|21543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21543-skifflin/|6.8|Jazz Monroe

These can take a variety of forms: Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/878-the-tide-is-high-10-records-from-the-balearic-revival/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Colours of Life </i></a>took whimsical Balearic themes—rippling marimba, ringing electric guitar, New Age keys, pitter-pat <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0tdkP4GaGg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CR-78</a> rhythms—and stretched them into a 40-minute mood piece. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16565-cfcf-exercises-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Exercises </i></a>paid tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"" target=""_blank"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>'s keyboard compositions, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18281-cfcf-music-for-objects-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for Objects</i></a> projected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a>' pulse minimalism through the lens of Japanese electronic musicians like Hiroshi Yoshimura and Joe Hisaishi.</p>
<p>Silver often gives his recordings themes linked to three-dimensional spaces and physical objects: <i>Exercises </i>was meant to evoke Brutalist architecture, and <i>Music for Objects</i>, inspired in part by Wim Wenders' <i>Notebook on Cities and Clothes</i>, took the form of impressionist renderings of everyday items—a bowl, a set of keys, a turnstile. He has a knack for flipping sound and space in counterintuitive ways: In 2010, he chopped and screwed a bunch of Quiet Storm R&amp;B into the mixtape <a href=""https://www.thefader.com/2010/08/13/cfcf-slow-rb-for-zellers-locations-canada-wide-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Slow R&amp;B for Zellers Locations Canada-Wide </i></a>(the title was a reference to a once-ubiquitous Canadian chain of discount department stores). What could have been a joke turned out to be a surprisingly effective (and narcotic) defamiliarization of the budget retail experience.</p>
<p><i>On Vacation</i>, the second in a new series of mini-albums for the Ibiza-based <a href=""http://internationalfeel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Feel</a> label, comes with no explicit concept attached, but the title does a good job of capturing the balmy moods contained within. As on <i>The Colours of Life</i>, it favors moderate tempos and the sorts of sounds associated with José Padilla's sunset sessions at Café del Mar in the early 1990s: marimbas, choral synth pads, creamy soprano sax, acoustic guitars run through shimmering digital reverb. It takes cues from Balearic staples like Penguin Café Orchestra, Wally Badarou, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>; ""Chasing,"" a gorgeous miniature for echoing guitars and accordion, is heavily indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a>, while the accordion-led ""Arto"" pays tribute to the Japanese composer Seigen Ono. In ""Vermont,"" which mixes acoustic guitars, faint piano, and understated synthesizers, I hear an echo of Joan Bibiloni, a Mallorcan fusion musician recently rediscovered by Amsterdam's <a href=""http://musicfrommemory.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Music From Memory</a> label. ""Pleasure Centre,"" on the other hand, doesn't sound far off from the slap bass and FM synths of Eric Serra's hit-or-miss soundtrack to Luc Besson's 1985 film <i>Subway</i>.</p>
<p>The album's profile is slight, with just eight songs totaling barely half an hour's running time; one of its most affecting tracks, the fretless bass and digital synth study ""In the Courtyard,"" is over in just two minutes. It would be easy to detect the faint whiff of irony in the record's more honeyed tropes; we've been conditioned to think of many of these signifiers as being somehow compromised, given their long association with call-center hold music and sauna scenes on late-night cable. But Silver's pastiche has clearly been made with genuine appreciation for the sound of, say, clean-toned guitar run through voluminous reverb, or chunky slap bass framed by gossamer keys. These kinds of musical touchstones can't be easy to reproduce, given that many of them were made in million-dollar studios with period gear; the fidelity of his imitations is no small accomplishment. And even more to his credit is that the music is so emotionally satisfying.</p>
<p>Like any record-collector endeavor, the album is partly an exercise in revisionism—an attempt to take the best bits from an underrated tradition and excise the truly corny bits. Judging from the recent revival of all manner of smooth, fusion-heavy material once dubbed <i>musica non grata</i>, from New Age cassettes heavy on Yamaha DX7 sparkle to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/magazine/does-anybody-still-loathe-phil-collins-even-in-the-air-tonight.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phil Collins himself</a>, we're enjoying a moment where taste is being rethought, and <i>On Vacation </i>plays an invaluable part in the ongoing battle to raze rockist shibboleths. A gorgeous, unassuming little record, it is Silver's most sophisticated virtual environment yet; disappear into it for a while, and you may come back with a newfound appreciation for sounds you once thought irredeemable—yes, even slap bass.</p></div>"|21494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21494-on-vacation/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

At some points, the digital manipulations were identifiable as processed versions of parts being played by the musicians, and at others, they operated independently of each other. In the <i>best</i> moments, you couldn’t tell what was live and what was pre-programmed.</p>
<p>On his follow-up, Wohl includes a pair of two-movement works that show how suited he is to larger canvases. A slowly moving, two-note drone launches ""Replicate, Pt. 1,"" and operates in the background throughout, while the live musicians work with pitched percussion figures that build on themselves slowly. Brisk electronic beats introduce the piece’s second half—though the composition never scales the frenetic peaks of <i>Corps Exquis</i>. </p>
<p>This comparative restraint pays off when a gorgeous vibraphone ostinato emerges in the closing minutes of ""Replicate, Pt. 2."" Wohl playfully manipulates the groove, letting the tempo quicken and slack unpredictably. ""Holographic,"" another piece that stretches across two tracks, also builds its momentum in a natural, relaxed fashion, underlining the subtler chops of the musicians who make up the often-clangorous Bang on Can All-Stars group.</p>
<p>The album’s initially deliberate, patient air ensures that its hyperactive set piece registers strongly. With an evident love for unusual, junkyard sonorities and febrile rhythm, ""Progression"" brings the maverick sound of mid-century American composer Harry Partch into the electro-classical present day. And its tightly interwoven writing for strings and percussion also suggests that Wohl could compose just fine in purely acoustic settings if he wanted. </p>
<p>In between these pieces are a few items that sound slight next to the more ambitious material. It’s not difficult to imagine how the singers who show up for ""Source""—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32141-olga-bell/"" target=""_blank"">Olga Bell</a> and Pulitzer-prize winner (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61695-kanye-west-shares-new-versions-of-say-you-will-and-the-weeknds-tell-your-friends/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West collaborator</a>) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/940-meet-composer-caroline-shaw-kanye-wests-new-pulitzer-prize-winning-collaborator/"" target=""_blank"">Caroline Shaw</a>—might inspire Wohl, though the meeting winds up sounding merely pleasant. Elsewhere, the Mivos Quartet—the same group who pairs up so winningly with Mantra Percussion on ""Progression""—have much less to do during ""Formless."" Still, the electro-acoustic balance on these tracks is expertly handled. It just happens to be the case that this notoriously hard-to-perfect blend might not be Wohl’s greatest talent, after all.</p></div>"|21419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21419-holographic/|7.7|Seth Colter Walls

It’s no wonder, then, that when Melynda Jackson of the defunct, long-running instrumental collective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4032-subarachnoid-space/"" target=""_blank"">SubArachnoid Space</a> launched the heavy, stripped down doom metal project Eight Bells as singer/guitarist, she had a few stories up her sleeve. Or in the case of Eight Bells, one ambitious tale. The trio’s 2013 debut, <a href=""https://eightbells.bandcamp.com/album/the-captains-daughter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Captain’s Daughter</i></a>, comprised four songs that formed a story arc about a character lost at sea; on Eight Bells’ new album, <i>Landless</i>, that character makes it home. Spoiler alert: Things don’t go well. </p>
<p><i>Landless</i> is drenched in isolation. ""Hating"" scrapes its way across a gulf of despair, with wraithlike vocals and numbed melodies hanging over pinprick prog fretwork. The riffs are meaty and vast, but the pulse of ethereal '70s rock—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"" target=""_blank"">Hawkwind</a>’s more celestial moments—haunts ""Hold My Breath,"" which nods to more modern influences with an intricate, off-kilter, Isis-esque groove. There’s an ambience to <i>Landless</i>, bottled like smoke in numerous passages throughout the album, but it reaches track-length mass on ""The Mortal’s Suite,"" an echoing exhalation of negative space and gothic grays. It’s as though Jackson has taken the flights of fantasy that SubArachnoid Space specialized in, edited them down, and folded them into an ashen doom.</p>
<p>For an album about aloneness, there’s a lush synergy to <i>Landless</i>. Dual vocal lines emanate from some unseen place, sometimes braided together in a conjoined plea for connection, sometimes adrift in solitude. On ""Touch Me,"" that dynamic is brought to a stunning culmination; Jackson and bassist/singer Haley Westeiner whisper and drone in a fugue of hushed desperation, harmonizing but always just out of phase.</p>
<p>As for <i>Landless</i>’ narrative, it’s not exactly a solid one. The album’s title track, nearly 13 colossal minutes long, sheds wisps of images and ghostly chants that melt into the ether. It’s heartbreakingly beautiful, veering between shoegaze-inflected dreaminess and blackened blurs without lapsing into metalgaze tropes. Whatever has befallen Jackson’s protagonist isn’t entirely clear; all that’s certain is that the ending, like the beginning and middle, are lost in a fog of otherworldliness and doubt. Ultimately, the narrative isn’t about the words so much as the atmosphere—and in the saga that is <i>Landless</i>, voices are just one more glorious instrument spelling out an epic, tragic fate.</p></div>"|21524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21524-landless/|7.4|Jason Heller

His anthems have won him a dichotomous fan base: one-half living off his gigantic heartfelt singles that have nil to do with pot-smoking and the other the loyal, chest thumping Taylor Gang kids with aspirations of someday affording his KK (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63189-kanye-west-viciously-attacks-wiz-khalifa-in-incredible-twitter-rant/"" target=""_blank"">that’s ""Khalifa Kush,"" Mr. West</a>). It’s worked out well for Khalifa; he’s managed to compartmentalize an audience that doesn’t need to know the other half exists as long they’re being fed a steady stream of relevant tunes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His sixth studio album, <i>Khalifa</i>, would suggest he’s splitting the difference—creating an album that is more personal (hence its partially eponymous title). After all, Wiz’s relationship with pot is a very personal thing (to him) and so is his need for success. He’s also a father, which presents another opportunity to dig deeper. But ""digging deep"" isn't really in Wiz's repertoire, and apart from some faintly nostalgic bars about his come-up here and there, listeners panning for introspection will mostly come up empty. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wiz is on a whole other plane now, thanks to perhaps the biggest hit of his career (""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See You Again</a>""), a song that wasn’t even on his album. So instead of living through the struggle like some of his previous works suggest, this project reflects on escaping it: The track ""Cowboy"" verbalizes those earliest days of cutting corners in PA, set to Jim Jonsin and his production duo FNZ’s soothing beat. He alters and repurposes that come-up tale throughout most of the album, punctuating it with an ellipsis and ""but I’m rich now"" tacked on for good measure. Like he says on the Metro Boomin-produced opener ""BTS"": ""humble beginnings, rich ass endings,"" but he keeps regurgitating that sentiment through the duration of 13 songs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That doesn’t mean the album is without bangers. The Rico Love-assisted ""Celebrate"" is a mellow ode to the good life of sex and blowing checks. ""City View"" dabbles with an '80s-skewed beat compliments of a production from Metro Boomin and Lex Luger. ""iSay"" is another one, because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a> always delivers, even over rumbling keys. The only track with hit potential, though, is ""Bake Sale"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"" target=""_blank"">Travis Scott</a>, which sounds more like a Travis Scott record than a Wiz Khalifa one. And of course the pot anthems are present. ""Call Waiting"" offers us Wiz Khalifa the singer, where he coos about marijuana like it’s his most faithful companion, and ""Lit"" where he and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> volley back and forth over who rolls and smokes the most.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But this is all to the detriment of promising a more private work, since that’s basically just ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" with a different SKU. The only real glimpse into the life of Cameron Thomaz is on ""Zoney,"" where he goes into greater detail about his life: ""Coming up I always thought I’d be the runner up / Gave my all but it felt like it wasn’t enough."" He closes the track with a sweet dialogue between him and his son, Sebastian, where it sounds like baby Bash is calling Pittsburgh ""Pixburgh"" like a true native. Maybe <i>Khalifa</i> isn’t meant to be all that personal; after all, he didn’t name the album <i>Cameron</i>. It delves as far as it can without hitting government-name territory, and for that the true fans will embrace it. But how many times can you retell the same story? Good thing stoners have a short memory.</p></div>"|21565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21565-wiz-khalifa-khalifa/|5.1|Kathy Iandoli

This is partly by design: Baton Rouge and the backwoods Southern communities that gravitated toward Boosie appreciated him for the thoughtful street rapper he always was, even as he came to fame off songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNYobSACns4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wipe Me Down</a>"" and ratchet culture, and since his release, it feels as though Boosie has committed to living up to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"" target=""_blank"">2Pac</a> comparisons those fans gave to him. The other part of this is that Boosie (government name Torrance Hatch) has been through so much strife and ill will that it would be hard to talk about anything else on record. Past the familiar story of the existential dread that comes from street hustling, he went from staring the possibility of a death penalty in the face to serving time in one of the harshest prisons in Louisiana to a freedom nobody believed he’d get to see to the discovery that he had kidney cancer.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s this diagnosis that led to Boosie’s most emotionally gripping album to date:<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21424-in-my-feelings-going-thru-it/"" target=""_blank""><i> In My Feelings (Goin’ Thru It)</i></a>, released just earlier this year. After a nephrectomy to remove half his kidney, Boosie was declared cancer-free: news that is both cause for joyous celebration and introspection on a life lived. His newest album <i>Out My Feelings (In My Past)</i> is borne of this introspection, filled with solemn musings about the old-school street life he came from, the people lost to prison, death, or just time over the years, and his inability to understand how much street codes have changed amongst the youth of today. ""We grew up youngstas on the corner, tryna make a livin/ Tryna make it back home, so we take a pistol,"" he begins on ""Takem Back,"" painting a grim snapshot of the most impressionable and vulnerable time in a young black man’s life in a rough environment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Throughout <i>Out My Feelings</i>, Boosie reflects on a life covered in scars and pain. Not just his own, but those of the people around him and people he’s interacted with; on ""Look at Life Different"" he raps about a mother with sons who are stuck in jail, one who is gangbanging and another abusing drugs. His tone is somber but resigned—he knows this story too well: ""Asked me to pray wit her and asked me can I call Johnny/ That’s her baby boy who wylin’, catchin body after body."" It's clear from his ragged delivery that he hurts for her and her sons the way he hurts for his own mother and the grief he brought her during his own wild days. ""Thank God for Boosie"" is repeated throughout the song, and the implication is that rap was the only thing that saved Torrance Hatch from these dire fates.</p>
<p><i>Out My Feelings</i> doesn’t have the rawness of <i>In My Feelings</i>, but its production is impeccable where that one was spotty, and it soars when Boosie reminisces on his pre-rap days or makes statements in line with Black Lives Matter about the murders of unarmed black people by cops. Its lows come more sporadically and feel uncomfortable—like the homophobic lyrics found on ""The Truth,"" for example—and the lecturing to young street kids about not sticking to the code of his youth is understandable but carries an ""old man yelling at a cloud"" vibe after awhile.</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of the best songs on the album is ""Wanna B Heard,"" a wistful love letter to the forgotten where Boosie raps about the pull of gang life and the cry for help that the violence and crime committed by street kids really is. The most potent line: ""I saw Glenn had something on his mind, I should’ve asked him what’s wrong/ Probably would’ve told me instead of blasting his dome."" Above anything else, Boosie’s intense popularity began with those most ignored. He was their star, because he listened and he understood and recognized that their pain was real and it mattered in a way a lot of self-proclaimed ""street"" rappers have never been able to do. Thank God for Boosie.</p></div>"|21598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21598-out-my-feelings-in-my-past/|7.6|Israel Daramola

The songs often stretch until they start to dislocate, swelling from indie rock into six- or seven-minute epics. In this way Sioux Falls can resemble early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>, though their songwriting is less tangential than either; Sioux Falls songs tend to cycle through at most two or three related ideas, just at different volumes.</p>
<p>At its best, this effect can be hypnotic and stirring. At its worst it can be exhausting. The songs build geologically, morphing from pebbles into mountains and then crumbling back into their constituent parts. ""Chain of Lakes,"" ""San Francisco Earthquake,"" ""Dinosaur Dying""—the song titles and their uncoiling inner structures seem to imply something about geology and archeology, destruction and creation. To their credit, Sioux Falls have the energy and gravity to support this kind of cinematic ambition; the band plays as if they are trying very hard to pull something up through the earth.</p>
<p>For all of its attempts at colossal scale, <i>Rot Forever</i><span> also feels very intimate. The album’s length—72 minutes—contributes to this relaxed, almost yawning aura; it occasionally feels like listening to one lone, faintly edited practice session. It can feel arbitrary, but its arbitrariness is part of the charm; songs like ""Your Name’s Not Ned"" take their shape through an application of instinct and aggression that seems more rooted in mood than method.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the album is simply too long, and it digresses through similar ideas more than it advances. Eiger seems to faint through his vocal melodies; he sings at the kind of aggressively bored frequency at which vowels tend to morph into yawns. At a certain point the album's dynamics become routine, all of the energies produced by the band hit the ear neutrally, and <i>Rot Forever</i> begins to rot itself, softly melting into a background, not of its own accord but by something built into its nature.</p></div>"|21492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21492-rot-forever/|6.9|Brad Nelson

Even now, if you attend a local show within a 30-mile radius of the city, you’re bound to hear a band who've memorized Dischord's knotty, clever post-punk paradigms, usually the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8999-rites-of-spring/"" target=""_blank"">Rites of Spring</a>. Silver Spring, Md.'s Two Inch Astronaut certainly fit the bill: a deft, bristling act whose energy stems from the uneasy suturing of uplifting, persistent melodies to an overactive rhythm section that threatens to dismantle it—and the lopsided pop hooks that result. The band’s first two albums, 2013’s <i>Bad Brother </i>and 2014’s <i>Foulbrood</i>, belie a curious magnetism, not unlike that of their heroes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"" target=""_blank"">Jawbox</a>. Perhaps that’s why that band’s mastermind, J. Robbins, signed on to man the boards for Two Inch Astronaut’s latest and best record, <i>Personal Life</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Up until recently, Two Inch Astronaut have operated as a duo: Sam Rosenberg did triple duty as a bassist, guitarist, and vocalist, recording the melodic parts individually and later tethering them to Matt Gatwood’s oscillating tempos. Between <i>Foulbrood </i>and <i>Personal Life</i>, the band became a trio, adding former Grass Is Green bassist Andy Chervenak to their ranks: an adept, aggressive arpeggiator with grooves that refuse to be ignored, not to mention a capable background vocalist, armed with a full-throated tenor. Suddenly, the cramped, crunchy sound has expanded to include more melodic counterpoints across all fronts (vocals, guitars, etc.), not to mention some much-needed embellishment. Accordingly, tracks like ""At Risk Student"" and ""Woodstock ’99"" offer a welcome respite from their peers' murky chug, as well as a departure from the preceding albums’ occasionally rote arrangements.</p>
<p>They may be a fuller unit than ever before, but compared to their previous works, <i>Personal Life </i>is the band’s most restrained album to date. The trio depends on beats, breaks, and pauses as much as any riff, and Rosenberg’s vocals rarely careen off-track like that of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a>’ Patrick Stickles. What’s more, Robbins frequently submerges them in the mix—on the ballad-ish ""Andy’s Progress Report"" and ""Good Companion,"" natch—so as to render them smooth textural complements to the jagged acoustic strums and burbling basslines. Despite their frequent reticence, the band entertain their rambunctious past on more than a few occasions: Gatwood and Chervenak throw a syncopated temper tantrum on the sardonic ""Sexual Prince of the Universe,"" while the title track nips the jam sessions in the bud in favor some straightforward screaming. </p>
<p>Every song on <i>Personal Life</i> has its unique quirks, usually lyrical: Consider the endearing resignation of the opening track, where Rosenberg mumbles ""I did good/ But it weren’t good enough,"" his self-aware grammar-botching the equivalent of a smug shrug. Equally clever is ""A Happy Song,"" where the frontman manages to turn an unflattering comparison to a dog getting scratched behind the ears into a couplet that sounds strangely sweet. But from a musical perspective, the band’s more formulaic than they let on: by the time ""Andy’s Progress Report"" rolls around, the rhythmic games of Red Light, Green Light grows wearisome, as do the jumpy, post-coda digressions, ripped from the pages of the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3316-pinback/"" target=""_blank"">Pinback</a> record. ""Topper Shutt,"" meanwhile, traces over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>’s ""Undone (The Sweater Song),"" right down to the serpentine central riff and reliance on two-syllable phrases. Nevertheless, <i>Personal Life </i>legitimizes Two Inch Astronaut as a respectable alternative to the regurgitated grunge that threatens to define rock’s '90s revival.   </p></div>"|21531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21531-personal-life/|6.9|Zoe Camp

Its looped Rhodes keys were tentative and misty, and its drum programming skipped just so; the rhythm folded in the sloshing of waves and the looped cries of seagulls, sounds that imbued the song with an unmistakable pang of wistfulness, while the title, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8EYGJNMOA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doobiest</a>,"" scanned as slightly tongue in cheek. Did it refer to marijuana? Yacht rock? (From the sound of things, probably a little bit of each.)</p>
<p>The gulls reappear on ""123,"" the opening track on <i>A Minor Thought</i>, his second LP for Hamburg's <a href=""http://www.smallville-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smallville</a> label. Once again, ruminative, dewy-eyed house music is the name of the game—one part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13181-larry-heard/"" target=""_blank"">Larry Heard</a>, one part '70s tearjerker, and as richly textured as it gets. The drum machines are apple-crisp, and the song's main riff, a rising and falling horn loop, is as soft and rounded as sandstone. Over it all, a two-bar phrase of muted saxophone flutters like a tattered flag over a beach house that's been boarded up for winter. It is so <i>him </i>that it's almost self-parody. Moomin (Sebastian Genz) joined Smallville in 2010, four years into its run, but the way he has internalized the label's aesthetic might make him their most representative artist. Every one of his productions feels like a perfect distillation of an ideal type, and the same is true here, where each track renders the Smallville universe in miniature.</p>
<p>But nothing on <i>A Minor Thought </i>feels redundant. For one thing, these songs scratch a very particular emotional itch in extremely satisfying ways: They're both melancholy and zippy at the same time, downcast yet fleet of foot. Just listen to the way the piano in ""Loop No. 1"" tumbles up and down the scale, like a daydreamer with a restless leg. His songs are twee but never sappy, flirting with sentimentality while remaining at a winking remove from it. On top of all that, he's just very good at this sort of thing. Anyone could try to write a Moomin-style track by gathering up the requisite elements: the bone-dry 808, the airy keyboard loop, the layer of vinyl hiss. In fact, all of those sounds could probably be dialed up via sampler presets. But the way Moomin massages all his favored elements together is unusually artful.</p>
<p>How does he do it? Well, his drum loops collage together both patterns sourced from classic drum machines and hits sampled from physical kits. He's particularly fond of lone hi-hat hits swiped from old records and EQed until they sizzle in the mix, and he likes breaks that leave a little something extra in, like a scrap of crowd noise or a whisper or a laugh. In ""Stotheh,"" some kind of voice lurks beneath the white-hot drums and lowing horns, and while it's impossible to tease out where it comes from or what it might be, it lends a crucial additional element of presence to the music. On ""A Minor Thought"" and ""You Neva Know,"" the looped vocal samples are pushed up in the mix, but they remain largely indistinct and unintelligible, like human fingerprints smeared back toward pure abstraction.</p>
<p>Another of Moomin's tricks is to loop a chiming glissando, often a Rhodes electric piano or a xylophone, so that it seems to shimmer in midair. He favors background elements with soft, smooth attacks, so that they seem less played than simply willed into being, set free of the usual cause-and-effect relationship. He's a clever polyphonist, too: On ""Chemistry,"" he begins with a backwards bell tone, adds wheezy organ, then paints on a high, sour ostinato that's not quite dissonant and not quite consonant, either. The bassline might or might not belong to the same key, and the same could be said of another synthesizer that he adds to the mix. The result is a cotton-candied swirl of tone that doesn't apply to the usual modal rules; severed from anything resembling a root note, the chords float in the air like colored mist, never touching the ground.</p>
<p>There is not, it is true, much variety here: All 11 tracks are paced somewhere between 120 and 125 beats per minute; all of them follow pitter-patter house beats; all of them use the same palette of cool jazz samples and Chicago house basslines and warm, watery keys. But if you're a fan of this kind of thing, <i>A Minor Thought</i> proves that sometimes variety isn't the most important quality in an album. Just like the sound of seagulls at the beach, sometimes familiarity offers its own rewards. </p></div>"|21493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21493-a-minor-thought/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

When this run ends, we can look back and sort out what was transcendent, what only seemed good, and what kinda sucked. <i>EVOL, </i>his surprise album, arrives less than a month after his surprise mixtape<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21496-purple-reign/"" target=""_blank""> Purple Reign</a>,</i> and while it has slightly more misses than hits, the highs are high—arguably higher than <i>Purple Reign</i>'s—and ultimately, the lows don't matter. The 1995-96 Bulls are one of the three best teams of all time, but that doesn't make the 1998 Bulls' championship mean less than the other five.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Purple Reign </i>went to some dark places, but something about its brevity, and the finality of its closing duo of solemn tracks, felt like an attempt at turning the page, finding a new way forward. Future had seen the dark wood, and now he was sorting it out. <i>EVOL</i> stalls at this fork. It's billed as something of a minor release (in the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/"" target=""_blank""><i>What a Time to Be Alive</i></a> was minor but they still wanted your money for it), but it's still an ""official"" one, meaning Future swings for a few radio hits here. They feel more obligatory than outright bad: Of the big brash odes to decadence Future has been doing post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Honest</i></a>, ""Lil Haiti Baby"" is the keeper, with a punishing low end recalling the extreme maximalism Lex Luger perfected in 2011. Future stretches his voice to the breaking point, and while it's often been the thing carrying his pathos, here he's screaming ""I just wanna go back to the Bentley store"" like an addict who's totally fallen off the path.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album boasts some of Future's more interesting beats since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/"" target=""_blank""><i>56 Nights</i></a> or ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEQz-BbWF0A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Serve the Base</a>,"" particularly ""Photo Copied,"" which pops and boops like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmZvOhHF85I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beez in the Trap</a>""'s cousin, and the sing-song patter of ""Xanny Family"" which uses an ultra-repetitive hook to mesmerizing effect. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17893-the-weeknd-future-low-life/"" target=""_blank"">Low Life</a>"" has the sultriness of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/"" target=""_blank""><i> House of Balloons</i></a>/<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/"" target=""_blank"">Thursday</a>-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">Weeknd</a>, when Abel still seemed like a mysterious, hedonistic force, and Future's by-the-numbers bars reinforce the feeling that it is, in fact, a Weeknd track featuring Future. It ends up an album highlight.</p>
<p>""Lie to Me,"" arguably the album's best song, scrapes the maximal, spacey landscape Future's so skillfully explored before, and it's the moment where Future communicates most clearly what's behind his tremendous output—it's not the breakup, it's not the decadence, it's not the success, it's the combination of all three. He sounds paranoid, protective, and manipulative, flatly admitting ""I got way, way too many issues."" As Future stretches this championship run as far as he can, we can wonder: How good can he get? How much longer can this last? When does this become numbing? The answers remain to be seen, but two months into 2016, two minor-yet-good releases don't show a sign of slowing down.</p></div>"|21578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21578-evol/|7.3|Matthew Ramirez

On her debut full-length, <i>Wriggling</i>, the 23-year-old Philadelphia singer wields the instrument like a crooked sword she only just learned she's rather good at using. There are surface similarities to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32541-mitski/"" target=""_blank"">Mitski</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Olsen</a>'s dark delivery, yet sticking a singer/songwriter tag on Reimold feels like a disservice. She isn't just playing her music; she's <i>living</i> it, and it sounds goddamn exhausting. The album art, an open can of worms—yes, they're wriggling—in tight focus, mirrors her sound well. There's slime, dirt, and awkwardness in all 12 tracks, and hearing her crawl through the tangle to confront depression and self-worth is both harrowing and invigorating. Statements like ""Fuck this and fuck me"" roll off her tongue mid-song easily and without emphasis, and for good reason. At 23 years old, that's a mantra, not a one-time thought.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Reimold wrote much of the material two years ago when she came into legal adulthood. <i>Wriggling </i>carries that intimacy, the wide-eyed fear of what's to come after the façade of teenagerdom disintegrates, particularly in the record's folkier moments. ""An illusion of an elevator: how we create our creator,"" she sings on ""Machine,"" somewhat hopeless, before continuing: ""Grant me my mortality, make me blind so I won't see/ That there's no scheme, there is no plan, we grow where our seeds happen to land."" On ""Vessel,"" she claws at her own organs with diaristic imagery (""Perhaps the bolts themselves will tighten/ Sit on my ass waiting for you to ripen"") and eventually turns to instruments like pedal steel on ""Trap"" to create the fullness of a '60s country-rock song. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Reimold switches to electric guitar, she locks into late '90s alt-rock mode. ""Bad Seed"" starts full throttle with help from Philly neighbors <a href=""https://mumblr.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mumblr</a> for the rhythm section. Things turn heavier with ""Clouded"" and ""Mask,"" songs that could easily be mistaken for early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"" target=""_blank"">Speedy Ortiz</a> demos, as she reverts to thick riffs and sings through a delay pedal for vocal distortion. Throughout the album, Reimold communicates the sensation that she's working through memories in real time, ones that are clearly still fresh enough to punch her in the gut. It gives her songs the feel of being performed right in front of you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Combining those two styles of songwriting can feel lopsided, but she pulls it off. The mix of rock and folk is soldered with lo-fi recordings of intimate moments: a room's silent hum while someone texts, a passing car whose music can be heard through closed windows, a playground in the distance where children shriek during a game of tag. Those poetic inserts never take themselves too seriously.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Wriggling</i>'s darkest moments recall the gloominess of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a>'s quieter material or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30970-torres/"" target=""_blank"">Torres</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20290-sprinter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sprinter</i></a>. Two-minute track ""Dust"" finds her beating herself up repeatedly. The song's only two lines (""I will learn what dust tastes like/ I am not immune"") change shape each time they leave her mouth. Each repetition is cushioned by new sounds, switching from bedroom guitar strums to guitars overcome with shrill feedback. Like many of her Philly peers, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32833-hop-along/"" target=""_blank"">Hop Along</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31468-radiator-hospital/"" target=""_blank"">Radiator Hospital</a> to every self-described DIY band in between, Reimold guards her confessional lyrics with punk attiude, but her delivery sets her apart from the rest. Her voice is just coarse enough to sound painful, but soft enough to sound private. If it weren't for the tender heart beating in her songs, Reimold's music would be brutal. Luckily for us, life has already claimed that title—and she's still in the process of learning that it won't let up anytime soon. </p></div>"|21522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21522-wriggling/|7.9|Nina Corcoran

""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO-ZsW0orlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Momma</a>,"" equal parts slow-burning soul and dazed funk, is emblematic of the producer's style: You can hear conspicuous traces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>, but an individual sound emanates through their influence. Knxwledge's ongoing <i>Wraptaypes</i> series is a good place to get a feel for his aesthetic: On these mixes, he layers a mixture of vocals and audio clips laid atop his production—vintage beat tapes with voices for added emphasis. The <i>Wraptaypes</i> anthology compiles 26 such productions created between 2011 and 2015 into a highlight reel. His sample selections are noteworthy, but his repurposing of them is the resonant accomplishment.</p>
<p><i>Wraptaypes</i> involves Knxwledge stripping original works of their elements, taking the remains he deemed useful and engraving them with his signature. It's an aggressive, dissociative process, in which he basically decapitates source material like action figures and sews the heads onto music he's composed. The face (or, rather, the voice) is the same, but the limbs, extremities, and heart are all different. As a result, the ensemble of bit players Knxwledge weaves into each web becomes part of something original.</p>
<p>Knxwledge allows each track—no matter how short or unpolished it is—to stand as its own entity. In each instance, the outcome is rewardingly distinct. ""Strtdfrmthebttm"" slows <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>'s ""humble"" recollections, trading urgency for a warm, mellow haze for the better part of two minutes. (Kudos to Knxwledge for reimagining a club anthem as a lush, scenic Urban Outfitters composition—that's a feat.) An Eazy-E verse from ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJj6hpetDdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tha Muthaphukkin Real</a>"" contrasts the lazy strings and 808s on ""Iwish"" before Carl Thomas' voice literally chirps in, accelerated to Alvin and the Chipmunks speeds, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zedl7GedEdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heatmakerz style</a>. Inebriated keys turn Sheek Louch and Jadakiss into charming lounge singers on ""Choosewun""; the first portion of ""Choppas"" does the same to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>.</p>
<p>The anthology also showcases Knxwledge's perceptive grasp of how certain instruments drive songs, namely the unrestrained '80s sitcom sax on ""21kwestions"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKvuO2RqTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ernie Isley's screaming guitar</a> on ""Allwegot."" Details count, so artifacts like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LborYcbZjmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">different parts of the same <i>Boyz n the Hood</i> scene</a> used at the beginning of ""Ignorntsht"" and end of ""Gotstaprove"" are welcome pop culture Easter Eggs for the film enthusiasts. Anthologies have no hidden messages or intricate narrative structures; they're collections meant to be taken at face value. <i>Wraptaypes</i>, however, is as much a snapshot of Knxwledge's mind as it is an aggregate of music. Each component and pairing speaks to how he interprets music and assembles his own.</p></div>"|21532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21532-wraptaypes/|7.4|Julian Kimble

Lissie, despite beginning her career working with the likes of DJ Morgan Page, sits squarely in the Hotel Café roster that’s nurtured the careers of the likes of Sara Bareilles, Ingrid Michaelson, and a pre-sales-singularity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a>—a substantial yet critically shrugged-at genre better known these days as ""songs you probably heard on 'Grey’s Anatomy' or something once."" This isn’t a criticism so much as fact: Had <i>Catching a Tiger</i> or follow-up <i>Back to Forever </i>been released in the '90s, when this sort of thing was as mainstream as pop got, Lissie might have been a star and would have deserved it. These days, unless you overload your pop with sugar like Rachel Platten or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"" target=""_blank"">Sia</a>, score a self-consciously ""authentic"" (and possibly uncredited) topline on, say, an Avicii song, or happen to be a man like Ed Sheeran or James Bay, pop-folk is a genre with a limited future.</p>
<p>Such are the concerns of ""Hollywood,"" the first track proper on <i>My Wild West</i>, a theatrical piece of goodbye-to-all-that with the sort of ""Lean on Me"" piano riff and carefully studied lyric that could only be dreamed up by someone who’s spent too long in audition rooms. Its main flaw is familiarity. Each city generates its own artform templates for people leaving it, and just as New York’s is thinkpieces, Los Angeles’ is songs. You still <i>can </i>stand out from the California-sized morass of these songs; it just takes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqa9xx2vBQc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exuberant panache</a>, a couple killer lines (the current champion: ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjSOcoDJYQg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fuck California, you made me boring</a>""), or even just a career-long dedication to writing Hollywood songs until you win over the cliché by pure attrition. Lissie’s song is thoroughly competent, yet says nothing beyond L.A. being a place where dreams happen or don’t, and where ""running wild"" means maybe not telling your mother you’ve gone clubbing a few times.</p>
<p><i>My Wild West</i>, Lissie’s first album on her own label, is full of these sturdily crafted but MOR songs. The titular conceit—complete with ""overture""—threatens an album of self-conscious cowpunk à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10959-miss-derringer/"" target=""_blank"">Miss Derringer</a>, or perhaps the Americana equivalent of <i>Eat, Pray, Love. </i>Fortunately, the album’s neither of those but comfort-food acoustic pop; unfortunately, this makes it significantly less interesting. Lissie’s voice has settled into a sedate, plainspoken croon, somewhere between Sheryl Crow and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10879-ashley-monroe/"" target=""_blank"">Ashley Monroe</a>, or at times like Sia when she sounds like she’s gulping down a faceful of air with every syllable.</p>
<p>And while Lissie remains a fine songwriter—the overture in particular is actually pretty compelling in a spaghetti-western way—she takes few risks here. ""Wild West"" is, on the one hand, an eminently competent single, one that builds from quiet, prayer-like verse to a full-throated folk-rocker where the kick drums stomp and the guitars practically yodel. But it’s also a worn formula, up to and including that wearisome ""hey!"" the Lumineers injected into seemingly every folk or pop song of this decade. Similarly, the brass-and-acoustic ""Hero"" conjures up a nice dustscape that, when it leads only to ""I could've been a hero, I could've been a zero,"" comes off as a mere set piece, with tumbleweeds blown by wind machines. (Also: ""I want my 40 acres in the sun"" is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_acres_and_a_mule"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maybe not the most appropriate metaphor</a>.) ""Sun Keeps Risin’"" even drops in a couple dozen instances of a stock coyote sample to belabor the metaphor, which is cool unless you’ve heard that exact sample somewhere else. (And if you have, you’ll spend the entire song trying to think of <i>where, </i>as the music slips too easily into the background.)</p>
<p>Like most of Lissie’s albums, <i>My Wild West </i>is most compelling at its most messy and raucous. ""Daughters"" has one of Lissie’s most passionate vocals and a wonderfully crunchy bridge; it’s one of two tracks on the album that feel <i>exciting</i>. The other is ""Go for a Walk,"" a weird, meandering little track, mostly solo acoustic save for a few playful electric guitar skips. It’s reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEwsH7fNxyk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waltz (Better Than Fine)</a>""—another track toward the end of its album that feels unplanned and refreshing, like a slice of life that just happened to get set to music. It’s the closest thing on <i>My Wild West </i>that sounds like ""going rogue in the wild, wild West,"" anyway; leaving Hollywood behind is one thing, but better yet is leaving behind the old familiar sets.</p></div>"|21468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21468-my-wild-west/|5.8|Katherine St. Asaph

Both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18651-matt-kivel-double-exposure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Double Exposure</i></a> in 2013 and the next year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19501-matt-kivel-days-of-being-wild/"" target=""_blank""><i>Days of Being Wild</i></a> sounded hushed-yet-tense, with only a few instruments creating a ripple of distress in his lovely folk melodies. Even when he had a full band behind him, they still played quietly. Perhaps coincidentally, both albums featured spare covers: a few doodles of color dotting stark, white canvases. Both the visual and the musical emphasized negative space—blankness and silence—as all-encompassing, even menacing. In that regard, even before you hear it, Kivel’s third album, <i>Janus</i>, is a change-up. The cover is saturated in color, not merely garish but brashly figural in its depiction of a Capricorn sea goat. There is barely any white at all in the image, which ought to brace you for a sound that is similarly fuller, denser, bolder, more dissonant.</p>
<p>Kivel recorded these 10 songs in Glasgow with the Scottish singer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3583-alasdair-roberts/"" target=""_blank"">Alasdair Roberts</a> producing and a small crew of local musicians backing him. Together, they emphasize friction and conflict. His songs are rigidly structured, full of deft guitar work and languid vocals that lull you a bit. Then the band comes in, sounding chaotic and noisy, disrupting his reveries with scribbles of atonal clamor. Kivel has worked with this kind of contrast before, but never quite as blatantly or as pointedly. It’s purposefully off-putting, even when it threatens to become predictable; you wait for the interruption in every song, whether it comes or not. ""Violets"" opens with him leading a small band and singing one of his strongest hooks, and you don’t even hear the instruments start ripping at the seams of the song until it ends violently. ""Prime Meridian,"" on the other hand, never even lets you get comfortable before the arrangement falls apart, with only the insistent drums and the seasick drawl of a violin to hold it together.</p>
<p>Especially when they sound like they’re deteriorating, these arrangements complement and complicate Kivel’s guarded lyrics, whose fleeting images and cryptic turns of phrase address the lonely confusion of love and lust. When he confesses on the title track, ""Even though I’ve known you for a long time/ I feel nothing close to comfort in you,"" Kivel might be lamenting the lack of intimacy, or is he celebrating a lover who never lets him settle into routine? </p>
<p>Perhaps the hardest to shake is ""Jamie’s,"" which is a very different kind of song for Kivel. It’s ostensibly a story-song, very matter-of-fact in its phrasing and frank in its detail. It features the one protagonist who isn’t Kivel—in this case, a young woman struggling to define her sexual identity and break out of the strict roles she has been assigned by her parents and boyfriend. It’s a heady take on a subject that might be beyond most male singer/songwriter’s interests or abilities, and when Kivel reaches the wordless chorus, he’s interrupted by sharp stabs of distortion that sound like they come out of nowhere. It’s violent, even disturbing, recalling the staccato guitar effects on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>’s ""Creep"" and verging on melodrama. </p>
<p>Perhaps that’s the entire point of the song. The protagonist, after all, is a teenager trying to attain some mastery over her own world, so it makes sense to underscore those overwhelming emotions as brashly as possible. It’s weirdly invigorating, especially since it shouldn’t really work at all. <i>Janus</i> is full of such gambits and experiments, most of which add a sense of risk to the proceedings. Even when everything falls apart—<i>especially</i> when it does—the sense of musical experimentation and exploration lend the album a burst of harsh, vivid color.</p></div>"|21577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21577-janus/|7.2|Stephen M.

He played football; his family went to church occasionally. He played clarinet in middle-school band and was elected Byrd Symphonic Band president in 1982; he cracked up his friends with goofy impressions. His best friend was a fellow ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" obsessive named Steve Pickering (nickname: Pickle), with whom he recorded dozens upon dozens of original songs, sometimes under silly pseudonyms like ""Johnny Panic.""</p>
<p>In the countless interviews that Smith’s friends and loved ones have granted since his death, this picture—the funny motherfucker, the expert mimic, the shameless clown, the amiable music obsessive—has remained elusive to fans, who only have his music and his public persona to hold onto. But on <i>Heaven Adores You</i>, the soundtrack to last year's Kickstarter-funded documentary of the same name, we finally get some sweet and refreshing peeks at the person behind the Sad Guy cartoon. Take, for example, ""Untitled Guitar Picking,"" from 1983. It is exactly what it sounds like—a couple of minutes of a kid who has listened to some Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd records working out what it sounds like when you arppegiate some minor chords. (Pickering, who was manning the tape deck, lent it to the filmmakers.) It's completely unremarkable, and yet its presence is unaccountably touching. </p>
<p>""Picking"" is one of the few pieces of Smith juvenilia that made its way onto the <i>Heaven Adores You</i> soundtrack: There’s also a version of the edgy, seething ""Fear City,"" included on 2007’s canonical <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10208-new-moon/""><i>New Moon</i></a> collection, except here it's ""Don’t Call Me Billy."" It's the same song, right down to the cadence and harmony of the chorus melody, except with patently ridiculous lyrics: ""You can call me Max, or Dave, or Tommy, Ron or Fred/ But just don’t call me Bill, man, cuz I go out of my head."" It’s like learning Kurt Cobain wrote a parody version of ""I Hate Myself And Want to Die,"" and it’s both astonishing and somehow healing to hear. These aren’t exactly the most <i>lasting</i> contributions to Smith's recorded works, but like watching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles </a>goof off in the studio in an era when they were purported to have all hated each other, or hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">Biggie</a> rap the ""buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons"" line from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2614-lil-kim/"">Lil Kim</a>'s ""Queen Bitch,"" they help rewrite the details of an important story.</p>
<p>There is much more to <i>Heaven Adores You</i> than endearing scraps, however, and none of them are more important than the version of ""True Love"" that appears here. The song dates from the early Jon Brion sessions of <i>From a Basement on a Hill</i>, before Brion allegedly confronted Smith about his escalating drug use and Smith packed off, with his then-girlfriend Valerie Deerin and all of the two-inch reels from the sessions, to producer David McConnell’s Satellite Park studio. The song, with its graceful pirouette from major to minor every few bars and Brion’s glimmering mallet percussion in the background, is one of Smith’s few true unreleased masterpieces, and although it has floated around on YouTube for years, it is gratifying to see it on an official Smith release.</p>
<p>Like all of Smith’s material from this period, ""True Love"" plays on a glassy mixture of beauty and sickness, a sound Smith was chasing out of a love of <i>The White Album</i> but that so many of his friends and fans heard as the sound of rock bottom. His lyrics, in the brutally frank tradition of this era of his songwriting, didn’t discourage any bleak readings: ""All I need is a safe place to bleed/ Is this where it’s at?"" he croons, allowing the pits and crags in his voice to show. Along with ""True Friends/See You In Heaven,"" it is one of the few missing puzzle pieces from the darker end of Smith’s life story, and having it restored here is a kindness. </p>
<p>For those are really invested in Smith arcana, there are the requisite strange omissions and inclusions to gripe over: Why include an untouched version of <i>Figure 8</i> album cuts ""L.A."" and ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" when there are so many alternate versions of the same songs being circulated on bootlegs? As the rock version of ""Christian Brothers"" or the rough-but-still-revelatory version of ""Coast to Coast"" here demonstrate, Smith was a constant reviser, as alive to the mutability of his musical ideas as anyone this side of Elvis Costello. You could rework his songs over and over and over again; the melodic and emotional DNA that was in them would show through every time.</p>
<p>But traveling in this direction leads always to the same tiresome spot: The rueful zone of What-Ifs, the <i>lingua franca</i> of dead musicians. Let’s clear the air once more, once again using a young Steven Paul Smith recording on <i>Heaven Adores You</i> to do so: ""I Love My Room."" It is over five minutes long, and Smith recorded and wrote it when he was <i>thirteen years old.</i> It is, without question, the silliest five minutes of music that will ever have the name ""Elliott Smith"" affixed to it. Here are some of the lyrics: ""When I was thirteen, I was in a marching band, there were so many loved ones/ They used to flock around me and tell me all my plans/ They all loved my hands."" He absolutely <i>belts</i> it, his voice landing somewhere between John Lennon singing ""Dr. Robert"" and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic singing ""My Bologna."" The song has something like five different sections, several key changes, backing harmonies, the whole nine. This is Smith’s untrammeled musical gift, bounding freely and unencumbered. It is gawky and innocent and heartbreakingly pure.</p></div>"|21410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21410-heaven-adores-you-soundtrack/|7.3|Jayson Greene

Its eight songs, which never move at too hurried of a pace, recall some of the most consistently likeable rock bands of the past 20 years in their most easygoing phases: There’s the rootsy shamble of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>, the wiggly guitar solos and general guilelessness of pre-prog <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a>. Songwriter Evan Stephens Hall’s voice betrays his New Jersey roots, taking on a geographically non-specific drawl than nonetheless makes you feel welcome wherever you are. Still, it doesn't scream ""rootsy"": the slow songs are the ones where Pinegrove sound like they’re <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvv3VatXlXM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">waiting to derail</a>, whereas ""Visiting"" and ""Then Again"" have the sentiment and aerodynamic thrust of pop punk.</p>
<p>All together, you might call it alt-country, though it’s more in the spirit of Saddle Creek circa <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Execution_of_All_Things"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Execution of All Things</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year"">Album of the Year</a></i>, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/937-lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground"" target=""_blank"">Lifted</a></i>—there’s banjo and twang and formalist structure. But unlike the trad-leaning No Depression style, this music sounds like it was made by young people, artists who created a dialogue with their fans by speaking to their specific concerns in an effusive, colorful language that mirrored their own.</p>
<p>It's only when you spend time soaking in this language that<i> Cardinal'</i>s deeper themes emerge. The character Hall plays is a familiar one within lovelorn indie rock—he’s the well-read, verbose guy doomed to recount time and again the failure of words to express what he really wants. ""Cadmium"" was inspired by a <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353683.I_Send_You_This_Cadmium_Red"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book</a> compiling letters sent between two authors, the first of which was a square of the titular color. As a seemingly sturdy barroom shuffle collapses, Hall yelps about the impossibility of just telling it like it is. ""Aphasia"" references a speech and language disorder, though it appears to be more of an emotional hangover that Hall shakes off on his way toward clarity. ""So satisfied, I said a lot of things tonight,"" he sings, the victory not in what he said or even <i>how</i> he said it, just that he was willing to do so in the first place and put his pride on the line.</p>
<p><i>Cardinal</i> includes some material from Pinegrove's <i>Everything So Far</i> compilation, which might initially disappoint longtime fans. But ""Size of the Moon"" and ""New Friends,"" which reappear here, scan as completely different songs in their new context<i>:</i> The cutesy reference to Nancy Kerrigan has been cut from ""Size of the Moon,"" and the experience of playing the song live dozens, if not hundreds, of times has led to a newfound confidence of Hall’s vocals and a tighter performance. The full-band surge added at the bridge, when Hall screams ""I don’t know what I’m afraid of!"", seems to tacitly acknowledge the big-room anthem they’ve created.</p>
<p>Pinegrove's Bandcamp bio describes them as ""<a href=""https://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hard at work in the promotion of introspective partying!</a>"", which might sound silly at first. Indie rock typically presents introspection as the <i>opposite</i> of partying, after all, and as an activity it is supposed to be incompatible with things like band promotion and exclamation points. But <i>Cardinal</i> feels like one big determined push outward, an album-length fight against solipsism without losing your sense of self in the process. There's nothing frivolous about that, and nowhere does the band make the seriousness of their mission more apparent than in album-closer ""New Friends,"" the other song that originally appeared on <i>Everything So Far</i>.</p>
<p>Here, it draws a closed circle around <i>Cardinal</i> by commenting on the album opener ""Old Friends"": Hall resolves to make new friends—""I liked my old ones, but I fucked up, so I'll start again."" It sounded wistful and clever on <i>Everything So Far</i>, but set off on ""Old Friends,"" where he admits ""I should call my parents when I think of them/ I should tell my friends when I love them,"" it cuts deeper. And then Pinegrove’s mission finally makes sense. ""Introspective partying"" may sound frivolous, but it deals with one of the most important things imaginable: how to make our friendships really matter.</p></div>"|21507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21507-cardinal/|8.0|Ian Cohen

None, however, have taken the metaphor quite as far as Sicko Mobb, whose bubbly, hyper-melodic sound evokes few things more than a cartoon world rendered in bright hues. To be sure, this is still street rap, albeit street rap that’s engineered for fast-paced, expressive dancing; ""party music,"" as member Lil Trav <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9647-sicko-mobbs-never-ending-party/"" target=""_blank"">put it last year</a>. In their native Chicago, they’ve become posterboys for the bop scene, serving as a counterpoint to the darker drill music associated with the city’s south side.</p>
<p><i>Super Saiyan Vol. 3</i>, the third in Sicko Mobb's series of ""Dragonball""-themed mixtapes, finds the duo further extending their reach beyond the confines of bop. They're working with established producers from outside of Chicago, drawing in collaborators from the neighboring footwork scene and landing high-profile features. They’re imagining what it would be like to truly break out and workshopping the sounds that might get them there.</p>
<p>For all of its experimentation, though, <i>Super Saiyan Vol. 3</i>’s strongest songs find the Mobb doubling down on the aesthetic they’ve distilled over the course of three years and just as many mixtapes. Tracks like ""Spazz on Ya"" and the west-side anthem ""Out West Chicago"" display the group’s gift for giddy speed runs over syrupy, day-glo beats. More impressive yet are the songs where they manage to pull other artists into their sonic orbit. Take the tape's lead single, ""Expensive Taste,"" which features a hook from fellow Chicagoan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih</a> over a bed of shimmering synth arpeggios. Jeremih disappears, chameleon-like, into the Sicko Mobb sound, adopting Lil Ceno and Lil Trav’s rapid cadence so readily that he’s barely recognizable. Even so, he manages to sneak in some of the song’s best lines (""Got lobsters on my plate/ Got oysters in my Rollie"").</p>
<p>A few of the trial balloons here push the signature Sicko Mobb sound in interesting directions. ""Eaters"" coaxes an uncharacteristically airy chiptune beat out of footwork legend DJ Nate—squint and you’ll hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>'s ""All of the Lights"" rendered in miniature, trumpet fanfare and all. On the anthemic, 808 Mafia-produced stomper ""What You Sayin,"" Trav and Ceno completely forego the gooey Auto-Tune vocals that have become their trademark, proving that straight-ahead trap-pop is more than within their reach.</p>
<p>Sadly, not every attempt to inch toward rap's center pays off. Tracks like ""Throwin Money"" and ""Won't Take Long"" are undeniably catchy but veer toward generic radio fodder—there’s not nearly as much here to distinguish Sicko Mobb from their peers. Even worse, the tape’s back half is weighed down by repetitive, lethargic songs like ""Going In"" and ""Last Time."" The latter aims for the sort of introspective number that might cap off a Kanye or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> record but with the exception of one pensive Trav verse, feels like a tedious retread of the same old boasts. Projecting energy has rarely been an issue for these guys but it sounds like they haven’t yet figured out how to do so at slower speeds.</p>
<p>In ""Dragon Ball"" lore, Super Saiyan refers to a series of evolutionary transformations a character can undergo in order to become more powerful; just when a hero seems to have hit a wall, a new level of Super Saiyan is revealed. Evolution seems to be a key objective of the <i>Super Saiyan</i> series: with each new mixtape, Sicko Mobb continue to refine their core sound while branching out in new directions. <i>Super Saiyan Vol. 3</i> is a bit of a mixed bag, despite the fact that it features some of the duo’s strongest work yet. Thankfully, something tells me that this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h0GRhIKgD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">isn't even their final form</a>. </p></div>"|21554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21554-super-saiyan-vol-3/|6.8|Mehan Jayasuriya

That is, they hope to produce a trance for the listener through sheer activity, with shifting rhythms and repeating riffs forming a sort of blanket of busyness.</p>
<p>In interviews and press releases, the former black metal dudes often speak about mysteries and mysticism, summonings and spirits, submitting to the music and sealing off the world. Maybe that sounds like mumbo jumbo or even sonic snake oil. But on <i>Voix</i>—the best and most incisive album the band has yet made—that last bit actually happens. Their carefully coordinated commotion becomes overwhelming and atmospheric somehow, a cocoon of activity. Not in nature but in effect, <i>Voix</i> feels meditative like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/293-bardo-pond/"" target=""_blank"">Bardo Pond</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"" target=""_blank"">Ash Ra Tempel</a> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5660-les-rallizes-denudes/"" target=""_blank"">Les Rallizes Dénudés</a>. This is, as intended, music meant for submission.</p>
<p>The 43-minute <i>Voix</i> zigs and zags through six untitled, interlocking, and loud pieces. The songs are separated by, at most, a tension-ratcheting full rest, though many slide right into the next through beats that don’t shift and melodies that don’t stop. This maintains the athletic trio’s momentum but also the listener’s state of mind—you hang in this space with them, waiting for the next wave. Aluk Todolo achieve this fugue state by keeping up a sense of constant motion, even when they’re indulging in repetition. During the back half of the second piece, for instance, drummer Antoine Hadjioannou and bassist Matthieu Canaguier march dead ahead with the insistence of something like heavy metal krautrock. But some element is always morphing. Here, it is guitarist Shantidas Riedacker, dancing with his instrument and amplifier and sculpting several sheets of low-level feedback into a rainbow of musical grays.</p>
<p>More often, though, the trio slyly slips between disparate parts, webbing together separate elements with skills that suggest an interest in the symphony and perhaps <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"" target=""_blank"">the Grateful Dead</a>. There is so much going on in these songs, with so many icons and influences distilled into each moment. But at their best, Aluk Todolo force you not to think about what they’ve heard in the past and what you may be hearing now. You notice the specific choices and changes less than the music’s overall embrace and intensity.</p>
<p><i>Voix</i> will, no doubt, appeal to fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30997-sannhet/"" target=""_blank"">Sannhet</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20098-revisionist/"" target=""_blank""><i>Revisionist</i></a>, the 2015 album that best positioned itself at the restless, roiling intersection of heavy metal tenacity and post-rock sweep. <i>Voix</i> shares many of the same tones and feelings, and the French trio can be every bit as thrilling and heavy as their American counterparts. But there is an essential distinction: Where Sannhet’s music seems like a soundtrack to the city, where busily interconnecting parts score the machinations of some place that never sleeps, Aluk Todolo somehow offers a shield from much the same, a place to hide out while the band takes care of the busy work. How they do that, exactly, remains a little mysterious—maybe it’s those radiant, circular drones that sneak between the beats or the judicious repetition in certain parts. Either way, Aluk Todolo creeps closer to its goal of turning the combined swagger of rock and metal inside out without losing its essence than ever before on <i>Voix</i>. This band works hard so you don’t have to.  </p></div>"|21529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21529-voix/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

The predominant sound is cheerful, celebratory, welcoming, sincere, just like the Greek people: Throughout the nation’s history, woe—the invasions of Persians, Turks, and Nazis, starvation and famine, sickness or death—results in revelry. When times are tough, Greeks break out the booze, sing louder, and dance more fervently. And it shows in the music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Unlike the rest of contiguous Eurasia, Greece’s unique geography has enabled it to remain impervious to Western influences: the northern border is shaped by treacherous mountain ranges, while the south and east is dominated by hundreds of rocky, isolated islands. These barriers have also enabled each individual village to retain its unique cultural identity in relation to the broader canon of <i>demotika, </i>or Greek folk music. Such is the focus of <i>Why the Mountains Are Black</i>, <a href=""https://thirdmanrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Third Man</a>’s two-disc collection compiling over 50 years of ""primeval Greek village music"": Remastered from Grammy-award-winning producer Christopher King's expansive archive of 78rpm recordings, this compilation traces the lineage of <i>demotika </i>through the mountains and across the sea. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The 28 tracks King’s assembled for <i>Why the Mountains Are Black</i> sound nothing like the chirpy, cheery music of those Athenos feta commercials—in fact, it sounds downright inhospitable at times, closer to free jazz or even drone music. The instantly-recognizable bouzouki is largely absent, as is any distinguishable melodic patterns, with fiddles, lutes, and thunderous drums kicking up a maelstrom in its stead. The pipiza (a blaring, needle-sharp wind instrument) takes on a role akin to a jazz saxophone, screeching stream-of-consciousness phrases above the din like a furious harpy. And yet—these are celebratory songs with clear form and purpose, defined dances that continue to be performed to this day, if not on a national scale then a local one. The steady 4/4 beat of contemporary dance music, after all, is a Western creation. Greek musical tradition is instead rooted in time signatures (7/8, 5/8, and so forth) that date back to the Byzantine era—so, while songs like ""Enas Aetos - Tsamiko (An Eagle ? Dance)"" and ""Syrtos Haniotikos (Syrtos Dance from Hania)"" are likely to make a non-Greek throw up their hands in confusion, anyone who’s ever attended a Greek dance will recognize the constancy latent in these eccentric tempos.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Speaking with the <i>LA Times</i>, King <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-ca-ms-chris-king-20160131-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">argued</a> that suffering—rather than celebration, or simple expressions of hometown pride—provides the spark in these maddened, frantic songs. ""The function of music among the countryside-dwelling Greeks was both to ameliorate an often short, hard and somewhat isolated life,"" he noted, ""but also to protect against….'Dangerous Hour': the times of crisis, danger, uncertainty, pain, longing and death that faced rural Greeks for millennia."" From the shoddy recording quality of this collections’ tunes (made all the more abrasive by King’s remastering) to the aforementioned howls of fiddles and pipizas gasping into the din, every square inch of these songs brims with primal indignance, no matter how formally sequestered they may seem. Every ""Opa""—a globally-recognized expression of joy and excitement—doesn’t just feel like an order to pick up the pace, but an affirmation of life in spite of all that these musicians had to endure. It is this spirit—and King’s awareness of it—that enables this initially baffling collection to transcend its esotericism and connect with a global audience, perhaps even with those who’ve never had a sip of ouzo in their life. After all, from the mountains of Greece to the hills of Appalachia, to dance in spite of certain doom is to be human.</p></div>"|21413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21413-why-the-mountains-are-black-primeval-greek-village-music/|7.4|Zoe Camp

When he isn’t sending <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63332-young-thug-calls-lil-wayne-his-idol-appears-to-diss-future/"" target=""_blank"">thinly veiled shots</a> at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> on social media or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip8dztJp840"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">planning to smack Plies</a> on the radio, he’s releasing music rapidly and without regard for quality control;<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21099-slime-season/"" target=""_blank""><i> Slime Season</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21262-slime-season-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Slime Season 2</i></a>, a pair of hour-plus long mixtapes, were filled with promise, but undoubtedly packed with filler.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The new nine-song mixtape <i>I’m Up</i>, meanwhile, was meant to be <i>Slime Season 3</i> until days before its release,  and was even on Spotify as SS3 for a day (Thug has since announced that a SS3 is still on the way.) These antics make Young Thug who he is, a dynamic free spirit who isn’t beholden to much outside his immediate brotherhood; as he raps on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17822-young-thug-hercules/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules</a>”: “Okay first of all, I was doing this shit 'fore I was rich/ I don't care at all, I'll go do a dolphin for my clique.” He revels in the mayhem, and leaves others to pick up the pieces left in his wake. As Lyor Cohen, head of Thug’s label, 300 Entertainment, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3pog5d/ama_hi_im_lyor_cohen_ceo_of_300_entertainment_ask/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once explained</a> while trying to rationalize the disappearance of the missing <i>HY!£UN35</i> album (and the cancellation of the corresponding tour): “What makes Thug such an interesting artist is his lack of predictability and if I knew, I'd be happy to tell you.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s that chaotic energy that makes Young Thug such an unmistakably bright personality fit for a camera crew, a skilled performer on par with Ric Flair: “I’m Rey Mysterio, my life on HBO,” he squeals gleefully on opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17956-young-thug-f-cancer-boosie-ft-quavo/"" target=""_blank"">F Cancer</a>” (a song that, in typical Thug fashion, isn’t even remotely about cancer). But with <i>I’m Up</i>, he is more than a stylist treating individual songs as sonic catwalks; he strings together thoughts, ideas, and concepts in arcs over the course of the project. Amid calls for an armistice and shots at police corruption, there is a pervasive theme: nurturing support systems. There's the ode to a fallen comrade who was gunned down last year on ""King TROUP"" with a near-whimpering hook. Songs about a fraternal sense of loyalty are lumped together (“My Boys,” “For My People,” “Ridin”). “My Boys” is essentially a treatise on brotherhood with rapper Ralo, who admitted he once tried to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmSh5YTRpHo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shoot and kill Thug</a>. The closer, “Family,” features Thug’s sisters, Dora and Dolly. If there's any central message, it seems to be honor those you love and those you've lost.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It all makes for a less thrilling listen, but a stronger, more complete experience. <i>I’m Up</i> doesn’t muster up the highs of the <i>Slime Season</i> series<span>—</span>the infectiousness of “Best Friend,” the sublime structuring of “Draw Down,” or the woozy euphoria of “Raw”<span>—</span> but Thug manages to compile many of his best attributes into a tightly-wound 38 minutes: his knack for zingers, his impish demeanor, and his ability to slink through productions of all shapes and sizes. The production comes courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"" target=""_blank"">Mike Will</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32198-metro-boomin/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Metro Boomin</a>, and Thug’s in-house producer Wheezy, among others, and it is a diverse array of sounds with nods to the dark and distant productions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/"" target=""_blank""><i>Barter 6</i></a> (""Ridin"" is the fraternal twin of ""Never Had It"") and Atlanta's minimalist wave (""Special""). There's everything from a steady 808 chug (""Bread Winners"") to church organ soul (""Family""), and Thug twists and contorts to find interesting ways to fit into them. He’s engaged throughout, making the most of each opportunity. The rapper seems to be venturing toward a more sustainable mode of operation, one that won’t burn him out before his talent can receive the attention it deserves. But, really, at this point, who could guess?</p></div>"|21579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21579-young-thug-im-up/|7.6|Sheldon Pearce

The emotional clarity, however, is new; the song is an ode to redemptive love, delivered with full earnestness and complete surrender. “You saw the stars in me,” Deheza sings, and her often-glassy voice and SVIIB’s usually-huge mixes turn into something more plaintive, almost a cappella: “You told me how you saw the stars/You told me that till I believed.” It’s among the most life-affirming five minutes of pop music in recent memory. It is quite possibly perfect.</p>
<p>“Ablaze” is also the first song on <i>SVIIB</i>, making the album’s first words “how could I have known?” The subtext is unavoidable and wrenching. Deheza’s former bandmate and creative-and-more partner Benjamin Curtis died in December of 2013 from T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, and understandably, SVIIB took a long break; the only song they released was a cover of Joey Ramone’s “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55691-school-of-seven-bells-share-final-song-joey-ramone-cover-i-got-knocked-down-but-ill-get-up/"">I Got Knocked Down (But I’ll Get Up)</a>,” recorded from Curtis’ hospital bed. The songs that comprise <i>SVIIB</i>, though, had existed for a while; specifically since 2012, recorded during a couple idyllic sessions. “We were finally in this place of just perfect peace, just being best friends,” Deheza <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1840511/out-of-the-desert-school-of-seven-bells-final-chapter/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in an interview last year</a>. So she wrote the lyrics to <i>SVIIB</i> as a largely biographical memorial of their relationship, romantic and platonic, through breakups and hardships and emotional pits. Even the title, its faux-Latinized shorthand (and it being the group’s only self-titled release), now reads like the heading to a last chapter, a deliberate final statement.<b></b></p>
<p>School of Seven Bells have aways made tweaks and refinements from their essential sound, and <i>SVIIB </i>doesn’t depart from it. But where their earlier material sometimes seemed detached, or more concerned with mystic metaphors than emotional clarity, <i>SVIIB </i>is viscerally felt. Every track on <i>SVIIB </i>is one Curtis had worked on before his death, and the conceit—and the fact that Deheza followed it through to the album’s completion—lends eerie resonance to lyrics like “open your eyes, love, you’ve got me crying.”</p>
<p><i>SVIIB </i>is undoubtedly a hard listen at times for those who have followed the group, particularly when its context breaks into the songs. “Confusion"" is bleak and tremulous—the exhaustion in Deheza’s vocals is not acting—and in the right mood, completely gutting. But while it’s remarkable that <i>SVIIB </i>exists at all, let alone in such fine form, what’s even more remarkable is how resilient, even joyful it is. These are generous songs, the product of deep caring. “A Thousand Times More” surges and reassures, the musical equivalent to a personal cheering squad; even the lover’s tiff of “On My Heart” is devoid of sour notes, collapsing into a swoon after its bridge and staying there.</p>
<p>Nor is the album stuck in the heady, bodiless realm. “Signals” is deadly serious and deadly dramatic, God, guns, glitches, snakes, bass choirs and congregations all making lyrical appearances, but all before a sledge of a riff in the chorus that hits as hard and sure as sudden attraction—a huge hook, right to the nerves. “Open Your Eyes,” though it retains some of the group’s typically idiosyncratic songwriting and meandering phrasing, is the most straightforward pop ballad SVIIB have recorded—Deheza’s speak-singing resembles a number of current radio hits, and change a few chords and the piano and percussion would evoke closing credits. But the song would not work any other way. SVIIB’s career, from beginning to likely end—has been a process of paring down their sound, jettisoning all extraneous material until all that’s left is emotional truth. And <i>SVIIB </i>is not only the group’s most technically accomplished work, their perfected swan song—it feels <i>true</i>. You couldn’t ask for a better memorial than that.</p></div>"|21511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21511-sviib/|8.1|Katherine St. Asaph

He's been bold enough to release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20471-solo/"" target=""_blank"">albums of spare, fully improvised solo piano material</a>; last year, he decided to flout both copyright and John Cage-ian practice by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61106-nils-frahm-covers-john-cages-433-in-new-video-from-late-night-tales-mix/"" target=""_blank"">performing a version</a> of the notorious avant-garde composer's silent work, <i>4:33</i>, with plenty of sound. Rules and guidelines have never been hard and fast things for Frahm, and his latest album with his childhood trio nonkeen highlights that Frahm is best when he's having fun: proposing limitations but then pushing back against them when the musical moment seems to call for it.</p>
<p><i>The Gamble </i>loosely explores and repurposes old informal recordings Frahm made with fellow bandmates Frederic Gmeiner and Sebastian Singwald in Germany in the early '90s. The recently reunited nonkeen recorded over and sampled mixdowns from the original, often degenerated '90s 4-track tapes, and used the same type of primitive recorders to record their new parts. The complex and troubleshooting-filled process gives the record both a welcome warmth and oddly brittle quality. The drums sound hollow and far off, occasionally like toy models of themselves. However, there is a richness to the analog-plus-digital method which easily transcends the characterization of ""lo-fi.""</p>
<p>The short record's unusual production style is essential because it helps shape and enhance its raw musical building blocks. Some of these pieces might sound a touch too non-descript if they had been realized in a more polished way. It's the cleaner, more straighforward pieces which feel the most aimless. But when the band restricts themselves to dense, blurry rhythms and unidentifiable timbres, the album shines. On hyperactive jams like ""Ceramic People,"" the source of sound becomes uncertain and dizzying, giving the music a constantly destabilized feel.</p>
<p>The use of bottom-shelf, my-first-recorder-type equipment isn't just an aesthetic choice. It's also a huge source of the music's elements of chance or spontaneity. The finicky materials result in feedback and odd bursts of incidentally rhythmic noise which often become the highlights of the songs. On ""Pink Flirt""—featuring Frahm's electric piano and organ—the tape slows down suddenly to create a majestic sweep. It's the album's central, disruptive climax. It's no accident that rather than listing the instruments they played on their Bandcamp credits, nonkeen chose to list the various dated recording devices used in their album credits; these machines are <i>The Gamble</i>'s most important soloists.</p>
<p>Despite all the preoccupation with recording technique, the album mainly succeeds because it sounds like the work of a small group of musicians, jamming and building off of one another's cues in real time. This is not ""serious,"" process music, and it doesn't sound like it. The classical reference points of Frahm's work as a soloist are evident in the music—Cage, the minimalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>, the humor and plaintiveness of French turn-of-the-century composers like Erik Satie and Gabriel Fauré, and dignified, semi-New Agers like Keith Jarrett and George Winston. But in the context of the propulsive ensemble, points of inspiration are never pulled out and highlighted one by one; each of the three players seems to be culling from different places at once.</p>
<p>Influences that are new to Frahm's catalog crop up here to provide welcome reference points. Frahm's seething Rhodes piano, which recalls Joe Zawinul or Herbie Hancock, is a necessary arbiter of tension throughout the album, a playful element which helps to distinguish nonkeen from your average krautrock-indebted, experimental rock band. Centerpiece ""This Beautiful Mess""—dominated by electric piano scare cues—sounds like something between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a>, Mulatu Astake's noir world-jazz, and exotic slow-wax fusion that could have been pressed on ECM. Like all the best tracks on <i>The Gamble</i>, the live band sounds more and more unreal as the track builds.</p>
<p>Nonkeen's vocabulary is very familiar, sometimes verging on lackluster. But the band knows its own limitations, and charms across the record's duration. They quickly establish moods—appealing, slightly disparate shades of pensiveness, rueful theme music for some hypothetical arthouse drama—and then cut straight into the next well-realized idea. We aren't forced to listen to long pieces that are hoping to introduce hypnosis, as in the minimalist music or traditional krautrock that comes to bear on nonkeen's vocabulary; each song is simply a quick burst of energy. <i>The Gamble</i> sounds like the peek into a group of friends' private rituals that it is—as charmingly patched together and messy as it is well-paced and dynamic.</p></div>"|21530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21530-the-gamble/|7.5|Winston Cook-Wilson

He presented a gorgeous collage of scenic landscapes and rolling clouds, set against an equally riveting score. The movie said everything it needed without any spoken dialogue, which can be nearly impossible in cinema and music.</p>
<p>Jazz trio <a href=""http://gogopenguin.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GoGo Penguin</a> rescored the film in a one-off event this past fall, which makes total sense the more you assess the band’s art. Drummer Rob Turner, bassist Nick Blacka and pianist Chris Illingworth fuse classical and electronic elements while keeping with jazz’s improvised nature. Much like <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>, GoGo Penguin’s music is full of subtle shifts that allow its composers to shine equally. For <i>Man Made Object</i>, the band’s third album, many of its 10 tracks started as electronic compositions, created on Logic and Ableton by the group’s percussionist.</p>
<p>GoGo Penguin opts for an energized sound on <i>Man Made Object</i>, conjuring pastoral imagery while loosely exploring scientific concepts. Between its title and multifaceted sonic approach, the LP seems directly influenced by <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>, bringing to mind the same sorts of aerial views we see during the movie’s 86 minutes. The album comes on the heels of a revival of sorts for jazz music, where artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32915-kamasi-washington/"" target=""_blank"">Kamasi Washington</a> fused the genre with their own blends of rap, rock, electronica and soul. The success of their respective LPs brought jazz back into mainstream view and made it more accessible for younger listeners.</p>
<p><i>Man Made Object</i> resides in similar space. Much like the band’s first two albums—<i>Fanfares</i> and <i>v2.0</i>, the latter of which was shortlisted for a Mercury Prize Album of the Year—the band’s new album takes hold right away and sustains an upbeat groove. Even in its quieter moments, like those on “GBFISYSIH” and “Initiate,” they carry a reflective vibe without losing momentum. GoGo Penguin creates jazz in the same vein as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Robert+Glasper"">Robert Glasper</a>: It’s a piano-driven blend with all the traditional aspects you’d expect from the genre while still scanning as something refreshingly vibrant and contemporary. Theirs is a percussive strain of frenetic drum breaks and rock-infused instrumentals, like on “Smarra,” where a fluttering bass line takes center stage, ramping up the rhythm until it burns to a smoldering heap. It’s the best moment of an album filled with unique creative twists.</p>
<p>Yet despite these details, <i>Man Made Object</i> is largely devoid of standout, calling-card tracks. “Smarra” and “Protest” hit hardest at first glance, but the other tracks take longer to build up, one leading to the next for a unified listening experience. <i>Man Made Object</i> is tailor-made for laid-back enjoyment, to be consumed at a moderate volume without much fuss. It marks a nice step forward for a group that lives comfortably beyond artistic restraints.</p></div>"|21463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21463-man-made-object/|7.5|Marcus J. Moore

Prepped and primed to be a star with ""indie"" sensibilities, Foxes (aka Louisa Rose Allen) debuted in 2013 with <i>Glorious</i>, a synth-pop record that didn't quite manage to win over international hearts. Though the record and its singles charted decently in the UK, Foxes is perhaps more recognizable when you realize she’s the voice on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32956-zedd/"" target=""_blank"">Zedd</a>’s 2012 pristine EDM super hit ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxstCcJlsc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clarity</a>."" As a solo act, Allen was set to be a low-key star without any fuss; she had the vocal talent without any of the frills of a generic pop star. No dance routines, matching outfits, or expensive-looking music videos. Maybe Allen and her team hoped this sort of 'realness' could appeal to a generation that prefers One Direction’s lack of conformity to boy band standards like, say, the Backstreet Boys.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Two years later, Allen’s sophomore effort <i>All I Need</i> shifts the focal point from synths to her vocals. However, they're still not enough for this record to be memorable. All the ingredients for a pop hit are latent, but unrealized. Tracks like ""Feet Don't Fail Me Now"" have a repetitive hook, strong vocals, and a familiar story of lost love, but it just doesn't stand out the way a meticulously crafted earworm should. After listening to <i>All I Need</i> for the first time, nothing remains or sticks with you, which is maybe the most damning thing you can say about a pop record aimed at big international markets and radio takeovers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record has cohesion and was clearly written to generate hits, but it’s lacking almost entirely in <i>oomph</i>. Co-written with Dan Smith of Bastille (another band that churns out synth hits but similarly manages to underwhelm), ""Better Love"" manages to hark back to '80s sensibilities, something monotonous and exhausted within the modern British synth-pop sphere. There are inevitable shifts in tone on <i>All I Need</i> but they prove to be small risks that don't pay off. One instance is marked with insipid piano ballad ""On My Way,"" which was co-written by Jesse Shatkin, one of the collaborators on One Direction’s rather weak single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho32Oh6b4jc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perfect</a>."" Another example is R&amp;B and dancehall crossover ""Cruel,"" which just sounds cheaply produced—think SoundCloud bro with a MacBook Air and a pirated copy of Logic Pro X.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s unclear as to what Allen’s (and her label’s) objectives are for her career—is she supposed to be a mainstream hit or are they just fine with her doing reasonably well? Working with a ""<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-rise-of-the-mindie-artist"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mindie</a>"" artist like Smith and a One Direction collaborator like Shatkin makes this record feel lost. Additionally, the middle-of-the-road ""mindie” shtick proved to be close to career suicide for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"" target=""_blank"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a> with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/"" target=""_blank"">E•MO•TION</a></i>, but the difference here is that Jepsen had good songs (and much-deserved critical acclaim) by her side. Being successful without seeming successful is a difficult medium to achieve and maintain; it’s why Frankmusik is nowhere to be seen despite propelling Myspace protégé <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding/"" target=""_blank"">Ellie Goulding</a> to global superstardom.</p>
<p>As much as you want to root for Foxes to find her feet, there’s nothing rule-breaking or remotely interesting about this record. Of all the shifting demands on pop stars and hits over the years, catchiness is the one element that remains unchanged, and it's completely missing here. Anonymity isn't a virtue: Even singers who aren't nearly as gifted as Allen (Jennifer Lopez, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"" target=""_blank"">Kylie Minogue</a>) have managed to break into the music industry with a lot of success because they had catchy tunes behind them. What makes <i>All I Need</i> even weaker is that it doesn’t offer you something else in lieu of big, brain-sticking instant anthems. It's just kind of a ""nothing"" record. Considering Allen hails from a country that has bred synth-pop darlings like Ellie Goulding and the inimitably cool <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> in recent years, <i>All I Need</i> had the potential to be so much more than mediocre and forgettable.</p></div>"|21521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21521-all-i-need/|4.9|Sarah Sahim

They bounce basketballs, play ping-pong, strip down to share a bubble bath, activities that might take place at a party thrown for the very idle rich. Near the halfway mark, they stare into the camera like the Children of the Corn, barely mouthing along to words in a way that will make you suspect they have either an awful or incredible sense of humor. The song is about whether Maine wants to be apart or a part of it all—and the sight of five hip youngs looking sad at a social event leads you to think he’s stuck in between.</p>
<p>Mopey New Yorkers are endlessly renewable in independent music, but here’s the thing: You can sort of dance to ""Be Apart."" On <i>Pool</i>, his newest record and first for Domino, Maine has shed the murky folk of previous recordings for a homespun electronic sound that consciously pulls away from the ""rock"" elements. (Call him another indie kid who sold his guitars and bought turntables.) Fittingly for a record titled <i>Pool</i>, it sounds like it was recorded with one in the room. Oceanic synths, wobbly basslines, and precise snare drums cohere into a crisp pop sound, while his high, expressive voice bobs brightly above the surface.</p>
<p>Also fittingly: Water is a recurring theme throughout the LP. Maine watches people slip into swimming pools (""Underwater,"" ""Pool""), envisions black water surrounding him as he weighs depression against the need to go out (""Be Apart""), and fantasizes about washing his car (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17963-porches-car/"" target=""_blank"">Car</a>,"" which is the closest thing here to a rock song). Getting stoned is a theme, too. Sometimes, he lights one up and hangs out by the metaphorical pool, as on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17746-porches-hour/"" target=""_blank"">Hour</a>,"" whose dark electronics evoke the dinginess of a locker room at the Y.</p>
<p>In an interview on Pitchfork Radio, Maine said he wanted to make something ""more positive"" that could be energetically performed live, and that he wants people to dance to his music. The shimmering groove on ""Braid"" and ""Mood"" will make you believe in his ambitions—people will at least be swaying—as does the boogie that breaks out at the end of the title track. The singer Greta Kline, who fronts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Cosmos</a> and is also Maine’s girlfriend, loans backing vocals or basslines to the half-dozen best songs. Her plucky strumming on ""Mood"" and ""Glow"" creates the record’s most genuinely funky moments, when you can imagine the shy kids thrusting hips in their living rooms.</p>
<p>Maine isn’t an involved lyricist, but his melodic instincts connect the gap between intent and outcome. He has an alien-yet-captivating way of phrasing syllables that recalls the unblinking stoicism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"" target=""_blank"">Majical Cloudz</a>’ Devon Welsh, or the weirdo brooding of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a>. The melodramatic sigh in the chorus of ""Be Apart""—""And I-I-I-I want to be apart""—reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a>, as does the lyrical preoccupation with whether or not to go out that night.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You could also observe that Morrissey had the gumption to rhyme ""rusty spanner"" with ""play piano,"" and that some of that spirit might be missing here. The piercing clarity of Maine’s voice imbues his relatively simplistic lyrics with profundity, but you might wonder how much is going on in his brain at times. At least one Pitchfork co-worker gasped when I suggested <i>Pool</i> sounded like a chillwave record, but it does remind me of how that micro-genre enabled listeners most likely to get lost in a K-Mart to wade through shallow depths.</p>
<p>But a wading pool can be a perfect meditative space. <i>Pool</i> is an introspective record, tailormade for lonesome nights. It was made in Maine’s apartment, and while the record has a noticeably professional pop sheen, there are still vestigial hints of amateurism (such as the sound of fingers squeaking against the strings on album opener ""Underwater"") that convince me of its ideal setting. Anyone who lives in a city knows how easy it is to be pulled between lonely apartments and lonelier dance floors. By the end, the appeal of water becomes clear. You immerse yourself in it, disappearing from the rest of the world, but you’re still close to land.</p></div>"|21514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21514-pool/|8.3|Jeremy Gordon

The record goes against the popular grain in every sense, from the production—sample-based, replete with chiming vibraphones—to the duo's explicit allegiance to capital-L Lyricism. It's a concept album that seems less concerned with its concept—Chris $pencer is ostensibly a fictionalized fusion of the two MCs—than in world-building, in craft, and devotion to an acerbic, pointed sensibility. <i>Who the Fuck Is Chris Spencer??</i> draws attention to lost traditions, evoking forgotten and under-explored tributaries of rap<span id=""docs-internal-guid-f0ab5f2d-bf06-107a-f841-7bcb14f7865e""><span>—the freestyle- and battle-rooted styles of </span><span>Lyricist's Lounge </span><span>CDs and classic hip-hop radio (Stretch and Bobbito, Sway &amp; King Tech).</span></span><b> </b>It plays not on what we remember from the past, but on what we've forgotten.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Both Vic and Chris' solo work is worth exploring, but together, their powers are magnified. These are not radio records; they are not ""bangers."" Their songs take up space, as if the duo were less interested in persuading listeners to jump on the bandwagon than in drawing a line between their Backwoods-smoke-filled living room and the one outside. Needless to say, their songs are also not paeans to positivity. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-f0ab5f2d-bf06-eb23-4008-758b97955709""><span>(Vic: ""Y'all got an A plus for suckin' balls/Leave your ass blind in your house, left you touchin' walls."") </span></span>Yet they are invigorating, the kind of music which gives voice to all our righteous suspicions that the wider world is smugly disingenuous—an especially resonant, if unpopular, sentiment in an age built on friendly alliances. Chris enjoys a good conspiracy theory, and Vic is the self-described ""rapping bastard."" Both rappers revel in playing the heel. Where other artists seem obligated to veer experimental or populist, they choose neither.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yet the album is bold, forward-thinking, and singular nonetheless, because it treats hip-hop as a lineage inherently worthy of celebration, with no other justification needed. Like high school cafeteria battles taken to their outer limit, <i>Who the Fuck Is Chris Spencer??</i> focuses on the art of rapping not as a technical exercise but as a freewheeling session of shit-talking. This is the dozens on steroids. Songs are shaped by verses rather than the other way around. Their flows never fall into familiar patterns, nor do their twisting narratives, which weave in and out like a boxer, defiantly unpredictable. On ""What's Saturday?,"" Chris Crack's tale of breaking and entering suddenly goes left, as he fantasizes about being smothered by ""big girls,"" before glossing over the story's expected climax (""we got the money, nobody was hurt"") and hitting the highway. The story arc is incidental. This is lyrical rap which reclaims the word ""lyrical"": no longer a trap for those who would fetishize arbitrary formal techniques, it is reborn as a synonym for freedom—where verses operate by their own volatile logic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The closest thing to a ""single"" on the album is ""No Biggie,"" a record which flips the same Screamin' Jay Hawkins sample as Biggie's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNwvHEme_JE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kick in the Door</a>."" Even there, the underlying ""pop"" impulse of the DJ Premier flip is cut into jagged shards, while Vic's corkscrew baritone and Chris' raw, high-pitched sneer move at hard angles. The album's main compositional framework comes not from the immediacy of the pop song, but from the smoky, expansive comfort of its atmosphere. Chris and Vic's world is never entirely exposed to the light: The tranquil ""Cement,"" for example, with its melodious chorus from C. Rich, makes one feel as if they've nodded off in a beanbag chair at the recording session, lyrics filtering in while flitting in and out of consciousness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their work expresses a contradiction: Chris $pencer cares too deeply while not giving a fuck. Something important is at stake, and yet Chris and Vic live precariously, as if truth and provocation are the only things worth holding onto. If there's a theme which unites W<i>ho the Fuck Is Chris Spencer??</i>, it's one of perpetual skepticism: distrust of ideologies, of consensus, of hype, propaganda, publicity, and bullshit. This oppositional spirit is best captured by a younger generation in the sardonic, cutting perspectives of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"" target=""_blank"">Vince Staples</a>. But unlike the stoned mumble of the Odd Future-affiliated, Vic and Chris' vocals carve through beats with a wiry, manic, animated energy—best described in the sampled interview with Chicago rapper Drunken Monkee on the song ""Drunken Monkee"": ""It's a lot of niggas that can rap over ill beats but they don't know how to bring that shit to life. And that's what we do, we bring the motherfucking beats to fucking <i>life</i>, dawg.""</p></div>"|21520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21520-who-the-fuck-is-chris-spencer/|8.1|David Drake

The music <i>industry</i>, however, is a loosely regulated crap shoot which, while occasionally lifting a creative genius to godlike status, leaves a trail of decimated bands under its boots. For every <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>, there are a dozen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"" target=""_blank"">Mudhoney</a>s; for every Marc Bolan there is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32341-jobriath/"" target=""_blank"">Jobriath</a>; an artist of essentially equal opportunity that for whatever reason—timing, money, plain old shit luck—gets left behind on the path to superstardom. However, if those artists are lucky, they can accumulate years and years of goodwill among music fans who excavate and polish these diamonds in the rough.</p>
<p>Milk 'N' Cookies are the latest such group to benefit from this history-revising eye. They formed in the early 1970s in Woodmere, Long Island, a short drive from the bustling proto-punk scene in New York City, where the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4889-new-york-dolls/"" target=""_blank"">New York Dolls</a> reigned supreme and their brand of glam-influenced gutter rock was already beginning to burn out under its own brilliance. While most of the local bands around them were steeped in stadium rock, Milk 'N' Cookies, still in their teens, decided to record 4-track songs influenced by the British glitter rock of the era—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">Bowie</a>, Sweet, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>, et al.—and perhaps unwittingly became precursors to U.S. power pop. They have a major hand in creating the ""tough glam"" aesthetic, a sort of blend of UK androgyny, N.Y. grit and L.A. glamour that continued to rear its sequined head from the New Romantics to hair metal to Britpop, and beyond.</p>
<p>In their very first photo shoot, Milk 'N' Cookies sport long manes of brown hair, wearing novelty bowties and clutching teddy bears, yet the songs compiled on their first LP, reissued here by <a href=""http://www.capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>, are all about girls, sex, and letting loose, still slightly scandalous subjects for suburban America at that point. Frontman Justin Strauss uses a sing-song, breathy voice, like a lovesick schoolboy taunting his crush on the playground. It's not emasculating at all, more of an assertion of desire that makes every Milk 'N' Cookies song seem ripped from a teenager's diary (which they very well may have been). </p>
<p>Somewhat self-prophesying, ""(Dee Dee You're) Stuck on a Star"" addresses a girlfriend more interested in chasing a famous popstar than seeing her boyfriend's band, and the song launches the compilation on a strong note, with searing riffs from the kind of super-dry guitars and wobbly bass that scream ""'70s garage"" to hardcore fans. The pop sensibility is immediate: <i>Milk 'N' Cookies</i> rarely lets up on powerful melodies, and it's a potent throwback to a time where bands put out albums in which literally every song could be a conceivable single. The band's only official single, the mid-tempo ""Little, Lost and Innocent,"" coyly begins with the line ""She was underage/ And so was I,"" which is so much more disarming when sang by well-scrubbed all-American boys who would not have looked out of place in the pages of a vintage <i>Tiger Beat</i>. The barely legal theme reaches its apex with ""Rabbits Make Love,"" which even has a six-bar breakdown of heavy breathing by Strauss. Despite all this heavy panting, petting, and leering, Milk 'N' Cookies never feel sleazy, just funny and playful and sexy.</p>
<p>After a few years of delayed album releases and relocations to London and Los Angeles (the minutiae of which are rigorously documented in <i>Milk 'N' Cookies</i>' 60-page booklet), Milk 'N' Cookies star ultimately fizzled, which is a shame; tracks like ""Just a Kid"" and ""Tinkertoy Tomorrow"" are tight and delicious, and hint at a career that could have rivaled the best power pop bands of the decade. This career anthology is about as complete as a collection can get, compiling pretty much everything the band ever committed to tape. A few very rough demos by guitarist Ian North are concise and enjoyable, the kind of sound that indie pop bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4753-television-personalities/"" target=""_blank"">Television Personalities</a> would release on purpose less than 10 years later. An entire surviving band practice tape from 1973 is also present, which is a little trying to get through, but there's also a scorching demo of a song called ""Randy Slut,"" which rescues disc 2 from diehards-only purgatory. For the non-connoisseur, Milk 'N' Cookies may not hold an immediate appeal, but for even the most casual '70s rock enthusiast, this collection is nothing short of essential.</p></div>"|21485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21485-milk-n-cookies-box-set/|7.9|Cameron Cook

But in the 1960s, the harmonies of country music were big in Jamaica, as can be heard most explicitly on comps like <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Various-Noah-Found-Grace/release/2598889"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Noah Found Grace</i></a>. Or, as the owner of reggae specialty shop Deadly Dragon Sound once <a href=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a>: ""You can always tell when a collection of Jamaican LPs is bona fide when you come across a copy of Marty Robbins' 1959 smash hit <i>Gunfighter Ballads.</i>"" This strange hybrid continues on in the work of multitasking singer/songwriter Jeb Loy Nichols.</p>
<p>Nichols—born in Wyoming but now based in Wales—boasts a peculiar skill set that includes doing artwork for the reggae reissue imprint <a href=""http://www.pressure.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pressure Sounds</a> as well as curating the <i>Country Got Soul</i> series. So it’s no real surprise that country and reggae commingle on Nichols' eighth album <i>Long Time Traveller</i>, previously only issued in Japan in 2010 and now re-released on <a href=""http://on-usound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On-U Sound</a> with a second disc of alternate mixes. Produced by Adrian Sherwood and since-deceased Roots Radics drummer Style Scott, <i>Traveller</i> has an ease about it that stems from Nichols’ long familiarity with both forms.</p>
<p>A dribble of keys and guitar upstroke introduce ""To Be Rich (Should Be a Crime),"" a song that replicates the classic sound of Studio One right down to the Jackie Mittoo-esque keyboard solo taken midway through. Nichols’ drawl is just behind the beat, as easeful as classic rocksteady crooners like Ken Boothe or Errol Dunkley. So closely does Nichols replicate the music of that bygone era that the songs can sound like standards, even though they are primarily originals. Nichols and his mates backing him up aren’t trying to push the envelope so much as just enjoy a mild, swaying lilt, as on ""97 Miles."" It’s relaxed to the point of narcolepsy, and while the cool ruler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8438-gregory-isaacs/"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Isaacs</a> no doubt figures into Nichols and his vocal delivery, he often just sounds drowsy. There’s a sprinkle of dub effects added to the drums of ""Salt of a Fallen Tear,"" while there’s a dash acoustic guitar twang on ""Lonely King of the Country,"" but rarely do Nichols’ country and roots actually entwine. It avoids the weed-infused gimmickry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"" target=""_blank"">Willie Nelson</a>’s own stab at reggae on <i>Countryman</i>, but <i>Traveller</i> could stand either more splinters or more spliffs on its too-smooth moves.</p></div>"|21515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21515-long-time-traveller/|6.4|Andy Beta

Montreal duo Essaie Pas are just one of a scattered network of contemporary groups reviving the sound and aesthetic of a lost generation of DIY-minded synthpop artists of the '70s and '80s, who either by accident or design ended up too rudimentary, too melancholic, or too plain odd to fulfill the ""pop"" part of the equation. You might, if you chose, chalk this up to another case of retromania, of modern musicians mining post-punk history in lieu of looking forward. But in a club music demimonde that holds up druggy hedonism and flashy maximalism as guiding principles, there is something attractive about minimal synth's severe, austere poise. This music got few props at the time, but at its best—and certainly, <i>Demain Est Une Autre Nuit</i> captures the modern sound more or less at its best—it feels alluringly other: a secret, shadowy wormhole that tunnels through layers of electronic music history.</p>
<p>Essaie Pas are the husband-and-wife duo of Marie Davidson and Pierre Guerineau—she a solo recording artist, he a music engineer who has worked with Montreal musicians such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Beaches</a> and Femminielli. This, their fourth album and debut for <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a>—the title of which translates as ""Tomorrow Is Another Night""—was born out of long winter nights rehearsing at one of Montreal's deserted industrial complexes, which the pair occupied after returning from tour to find their studio and practice space had been shuttered.</p>
<p>Some of this sense of frigidity and dislocation has found its way into Essaie Pas' music – or perhaps more accurately, has intensified and authenticated a spirit that was already there. Moments like ""Dépassée par le fantasme"" and ""Carcajou 3"" recall their New York peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29947-xeno-oaklander/"" target=""_blank"">Xeno &amp; Oaklander</a> in their skittery analog intricacy. But Essaie Pas are also wise to dance floor imperatives: deeper into the record, ""Facing the Music"" locks into a mute, driving techno redolent of DFA labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"" target=""_blank"">Factory Floor</a>, while ""Lights Out"" is a twilit acid pulse through which Davidson periodically announces the title, voice smothered with echo.</p>
<p>The more song-centered moments on <i>Demain Est Une Autre Nuit</i> offer a sense of the pair's influences. Vocals are largely delivered in French, Guerineau dourly intoning longer, narrative passages and Davidson singing choruses, or just holding long, trilling notes that dissolve into texture. Singing in French gives Essaie Pas an umbilical link to earlier continental synth and coldwave groups such as Elli et Jacno (who Essaie Pas covered on their previous album <i>Nuit de noce</i>) and Asylum Party, groups whose lyrics often tipped beyond lovelorn melodrama to a place of bereft existentialism. ""Retox"" is a tale of romantic separation riven with violent imagery, nights spent battling insomnia, and fantasies of screams that bruise flesh; at one point we hear Guerineau lift a receiver and key in the Montreal area code before apparently perishing from the sheer ennui of it all. On ""Le port du masque est de rigueur"" (""Wearing a Mask Is Mandatory"") he picks morbidly over the bones of a love affair. ""J'ai tenté de t'oublier/ Comme on noie une portée de chatons,"" he sings—""I tried to forget you/ Like drowning a litter of kittens""—as electronics gurgle away maniacally on one chord.</p>
<p>""La Chute"" ends the album on a dreamier note, a bloody Valentine with just a hint of yacht rock gleam to the synths, and listening to it, it's not hard to imagine Davidson and Guerineau working together at night, as frost collects on windowpanes and breath clouds in the air. Back in the late '00s, while minimal electronic music was the toast of underground Manhattan thanks to Veronica Vasicka's Minimal Wave imprint and the club night Wierd, DFA's attention was elsewhere, on the pneumatic house moves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2244-the-juan-maclean/"" target=""_blank"">the Juan MacLean</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6175-shit-robot/"" target=""_blank"">Shit Robot</a>. Yet <i>Demain Est Une Autre Nuit </i>feels not just a good fit for the label's vintage-modern aesthetic, but a culmination of something. Perhaps it's simply that this weird, mannered synth music is no throwback, but merely a style ahead of its time, and one that only now is coming of age. </p></div>"|21516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21516-demain-est-une-autre-nuit/|7.7|Louis Pattison

They were probably guaranteed to weather some tough times after the turn of the millennium, and they did. Their once-genre became a punchline, and band members splintered off one by one, leaving only Robert ""3D"" Del Naja, his increasingly claustrophobic production style, and a cloud of drama.</p>
<p>Times are friendlier to Massive Attack now, though. Half a decade on, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13864-heligoland/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heligoland</i></a> holds up surprisingly well, and ""trip-hop"" isn't quite the epithet it used to be. This year, one of the biggest new crossover pop stars cross-audience is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">a guy</a> who used to be produced by Doc McKinney of—of all people!—Esthero. As such, Massive Attack have spent much of the decade in a long, protracted process of getting the gang back together. The group's been occupied with soundtrack work for documentaries on <a href=""http://www.theukgold.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tax evasion</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62386-massive-attacks-3d-teams-with-young-fathers-to-score-climate-change-themed-film/"" target=""_blank"">global warming</a>, and a live show that skewers, in Del Naja's words, ""utopian tech companies""; that live show featured both longterm vocalist Horace Andy and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"" target=""_blank"">Tricky</a> collaborator Martina Topley-Bird. And Tricky himself appears on <i>Ritual Spirit</i>, an EP produced entirely by 3D from material on remix-your-own app <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61596-massive-attack-launch-app-containing-new-music/"">Fantom</a>. (A second EP, with songs by Daddy G, is due later this year.)</p>
<p>It's instructive to think of just how many ways this EP could be awful, how many gimmicky collaborators or landfill house vocalists could be on the album. But Massive Attack play it mostly conservative. Aside from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30771-young-fathers/"" target=""_blank"">Young Fathers</a>—whom Del Naja called ""<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/29/massive-attack-someone-ready-to-bash-head-in-tour"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">currently the best fucking band in the world</a>""—and newcomer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31723-azekel/"" target=""_blank"">Azekel</a>, the personnel on <i>Ritual Spirit</i> have been around: British rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2672-roots-manuva/"" target=""_blank"">Roots Manuva</a> and Tricky himself, whose single ""Take It There"" is such a return to form it almost works best as speculative history: What if Tricky had stuck around for <i>Mezzanine</i>? It's also the most diehards-only track of the four—suffice it to say, if you always found Massive Attack's post-'97 schtick contrived and 3D's lyrics ridiculous, you probably won't get through this one without some eye-rolling.</p>
<p>""Dead Editors,"" with its EKG opening, begins like a <i>100th Window </i>cut, but reveals itself as something with more interesting things to say: In 2010, Marshall rejoined the group with a vow that he would ""<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/04/massive-attack-heligoland-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bring the black back to Massive Attack</a>,"" and the line that appears near-verbatim on ""Dead Editors""; it's also noteworthy that <i>Ritual Spirit </i>features entirely black collaborators and engages significantly more with rap than <i>Heligoland</i>. Feverish ""Ritual Spirit"" hangs somewhere between meditative and heatsick, Azekel's vocal like a smoke curl; meanwhile, ""Voodoo in My Blood"" captures its collaborators' best impulses: a more driven version of Young Fathers' polyglot rock, a more dynamic version of Del Naja's often-of-late meandering work. Massive Attack were always equally as good producers as they were curators; it's promising that, as much of their old sound as they've retained, they've kept this as well.</p></div>"|21553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21553-ritual-spirit-ep/|7.0|Katherine St. Asaph

The Swedish DJ and producer broke through in 2004 with ""Call on Me,"" a fizzy filter-house anthem that sampled Steve Winwood’s ""Valerie"" and came complete with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQSYo_pC-QA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> aimed at horny boys. For many EDM acts, once they go pop, they stay pop, but Prydz’s career since then has represented a kind of balancing act between overground notoriety and underground cred. At Ultra Music Festival in 2013, he performed on the same stage as Calvin Harris, Avicii, Tiësto, and David Guetta, but that same week he also played <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a>’s Hotflush party at Miami’s 300-capacity Electric Pickle club. And while Prydz’s catalog over the years has been peppered with programmatic, over-the-top heartstring-pullers like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOLd4jl0uQ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Every Day</a>,"" last year’s proggy epic ""Opus"" found an unlikely fan in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, who publicly asked to remix the song (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61467-four-tet-remixes-eric-prydzs-opus/"" target=""_blank"">eventually got his wish</a>). Fellow big-tent Swedes like Steve Angello, Axwell, and Sebastian Ingrosso may pay lip service to the underground, but they can only dream of getting that kind of co-sign.</p>
<p><i>Opus</i>, a 19-song album collecting new material, heretofore unreleased fan favorites from Prydz’ own DJ sets, and even a few singles dating back as far as 2012, is Prydz’s second album, and it confirms him as both a master craftsman and a masterful manipulator of emotions. He’s got a real way with neat four-bar chord progressions and elegant counterpoints that spin as naturally as mobiles, and his mixes are as uncluttered as his drums are crisp and loud. He favors big, bold melodies pitched somewhere between yearning and euphoria; his melodic sensibility is a lot like that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>, whose ""Midnight City"" Prydz <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4bZp6pqJo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixed</a> in typically grand fashion in 2011.</p>
<p>Even with the showiness, Prydz is probably the subtlest DJ ever to headline Madison Square Garden. One of his favorite tricks is to hypnotize listeners with a reassuring chord progression and then, after three or four minutes of eight-bar cycles, to suddenly pivot into a new variation, breaking the imaginary space of the track wide open. He wisely avoids the over-the-top pyrotechnics of main-stage EDM in favor of hypnotic arpeggios and long, teasing filter sweeps; instead of his peers’ Pavlovian sucker-punches, he prefers to seductively blur the line between tension and release. And where big-room DJs deploy rushing snare rolls and vertiginous glissandi to create tension at the close of a 32-bar segment, Prydz uses a single, reverberant snare drum, a sound so imitated that it has come to be called the ""Pryda snare,"" after one of Prydz’s alter egos. (In theory, each of his aliases has its own sound—Pryda leans toward pure progressive house, Cirez D is reserved for techno, and Prydz’ bigger crossover tracks come out under his own name. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/alter-egos-pryda-vs.-cirez-d/idpl.2fa9a77f214f4006b76217c45e0483db"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In practice</a>, however, the lines between them are often blurry.)</p>
<p><i>Opus</i> oscillates between two poles. On the one side are entrancing progressive house numbers like the bookending ""Liam"" and ""Opus,"" in which lessons learned from decades’ worth of electro-pop are sculpted into lean, elegant shapes that arc effortlessly toward the horizon. ""Black Dyce,"" one of the album’s highlights, fashions its bassline after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Moroder</a>’s octave-jumping throb and its synth lead after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>’s naïve melodies; there’s a little bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> in there, too. ""Floj"" proceeds along similar lines, with an Italo-inspired bassline eventually evolving into a spine-tingling breakdown reminiscent of fellow Swede Tomas Andersson’s 2005 electro-house anthem, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLW8duTZg4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Washing Up</a>.""</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum are songs informed by Prydz’s pop instincts, and these can be more of a mixed bag. The slow, snaky ""Breathe"" boasts an excellent synth lead reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>, but the vocals from Knife Party’s Rob Swire take the song deep into generic, post-grunge stadium rock territory; they’re as faceless as Prydz’s own style is distinct. And ""Every Day,"" a cover of a 2002 song by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33418-mood-ii-swing/"" target=""_blank"">Mood II Swing</a>’s John Ciafone, sounds more like an electro-house rendition of Van Halen’s ""Jump,"" and the over-the-top emoting of the vocals do the song no favors.</p>
<p>But sometimes he gets it just right: On ""Moody Mondays,"" a singer named the Cut does his best Phil Oakey impersonation, striking a balance between effortless cool and faintly ridiculous—a balance that’s even more effectively managed on the '80s-tinged ""Generate,"" where singer Tom Cane’s falsetto evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4711-yes/"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a>’ Jon Anderson. Yes, there’s something faintly corny about those songs, and also ""Liberate,"" a shimmering vocal anthem meant to elicit closed eyes and raised cell phones. But corniness—the willingness to let go, to be not cool, to escape judgement—is deeply woven into the fabric of EDM. And it’s to Prydz’s credit that he makes even these moments of excess sound far classier than any of his peers.</p></div>"|21409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21409-opus/|6.2|Philip Sherburne

Their music's presence on Bandcamp, the stalwart American site that has become the new A&amp;R for the country's best bands, got them their start, but the husband-and-wife duo of Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski didn't land their deal with <a href=""http://www.badabingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ba Da Bing Records</a> until Cross sent a CD of their music with a note to label owner Ben Goldberg after meeting him at a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31052-lady-lamb-the-beekeeper/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Lamb the Beekeeper</a> show. <i>Wabi-Sabi</i> marks the first proper album Cross Record has created as Ba Da Bing artists, and indeed indicates a marked sense of sonic growth from the duo's early Bandcamp recordings, which boasted a desolate, folk-born sound akin to Smells Like-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3003-nina-nastasia/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Nastasia</a> à la <i>Dogs</i>.</p>
<p>Much ado has been made about where Cross and Duszynski recorded <i>Wabi-Sabi</i>, which is a Japanese term for the acceptance of imperfection. And yes, the relatively remote locale on the outskirts of Austin, Texas in the little town of Dripping Springs surely played a role in the Chicago-born group's desolate acoustic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau</a>-isms, particularly in the quieter moments of tracks like ""Something Unseen Touches a Flower to My Forehead"" and ""Lemon."" Additionally, the incorporation of a women's choir across a number of tracks adds another layer of airiness to this LP's sound.</p>
<p>But it's the presence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> drummer Thor Harris, who more than makes up for his absence on the latest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3762-shearwater/"" target=""_blank"">Shearwater</a> album, that helps<i> Wabi-Sabi</i> stand out from anything Cross Record has done in the past. The rhythms he achieves working with marimba, kalimba, and what's described only as ""the mysterious black box"" gives the group a heft that is absent on their earlier material. ""Two Rings,"" for instance, may remind some of <i>Tin Drum</i>-era Japan, while the loping gothic stomp of ""Wasp in a Jar"" smacks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Dry</i>. ""High Rise,"" meanwhile, sees Duszynski himself channeling the power of Thor on the drums, counterbalancing his own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1807-robin-guthrie/"" target=""_blank"">Robin Guthrie</a>-on-steroids guitar attack.</p>
<p>Yet, the partnership between the guitarist and Harris on percussion forges a solid foundation for Cross and her choir of singers: Julia Lucille, Liz Baker, Anna Milk, and Sarah Duncan. Within the album's most inspired moments, they hit atmospheric heights they've never reached before as a group. On ""Basket,"" the dreamy vocal harmonies collide with Harris’ dense rhythms before collapsing under the weight of a divebombing wall of dirge from Duszynski’s strings, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"" target=""_blank"">FKA twigs</a> produced by Michael Gira. It's an inspired fusion of wispy and visceral, a combination that doesn't seem like it should work as well as it does here. Throughout <i>Wabi-Sabi</i>, Cross Record thread their way between graceful and sinister, unfiltered beauty with heavier and uglier sounds, and tap into a dark well of energy that has potential to grow more powerful the further they explore it.</p></div>"|21482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21482-wabi-sabi/|7.8|Ron Hart

Nap Eyes frontman Nigel Chapman attends mixers—which are basically parties for people who don’t get invited to many. But even those are a bit much; two lines into ""Mixer,"" the elegant, cocktail-clinking song that opens the Halifax quartet’s second record, Chapman is already craning his neck for the exit. ""When I look at myself on the right/ I’m wondering if I’m really here,"" he sings, like someone who’s pinned up against the wall of an overcrowded bar. That lonely-in-a-crowd feeling permeates the entirety of<i> Thought Rock Fish Scale,</i> but rather than communicate feelings of disillusionment and alienation, Chapman seems remarkably calm and content—because, in this case, social isolation is the first step toward self-actualization.</p>
<p>Nap Eyes sound like the kind of slacker-rock band that plays while slumped over on half-folded futons, but even in its quietest moments, <i>Thought Rock Fish Scale </i>is an album brimming with passion and protest. It finds confidence in humility, power in relaxation. Its lethargy feels like an act of defiance against the hyper-speed pace of modern life. Its pledges of sobriety and good health constitute affronts to peer-pressured intoxication and food-blogged indulgence. And its purity of vision amounts to a declaration of war against a culture that encourages mass distraction. If your idea of a perfect night is sitting on your sofa, reading a listicle on your laptop with Netflix on in the background while carrying on a conversation on your smartphone as you reply to a text, then let this record be the first step in your rehabilitation from information overload.</p>
<p><i>Thought Rock Fish Scale</i> arrives mere months after <a href=""http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise of Bachelors</a> introduced Nap Eyes’ debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20718-whine-of-the-mystic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Whine of the Mystic</i></a>, to Stateside audiences, but they’re already a very different band. While <i>Whine</i> introduced Chapman as one the most intriguingly idiosyncratic lyricists in Canadian indie rock this side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Bejar</a>, the album betrayed competing desires to engage its audience intellectually while cranking out rave-ups that could sate a Saturday-night bar crowd. <i>T</i><i>hought Rock Fish Scale</i> does away with any such concessions—as Chapman observes early on, ""If you go around trying to please everybody/ It only becomes your crutch."" Though clocking in at a mere 34 minutes, it’s the sort of album that takes its sweet time going where it wants to. While it wields a lighter touch, it strikes a deeper chord, by placing Chapman’s richly detailed ruminations front and center, and cutting the jammed-out clutter. It’s as if their favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvets</a> song has suddenly shifted from ""Foggy Notion"" to ""Pale Blue Eyes,"" forsaking the visceral, fleeting thrills of rocking out to savor the sustained beauty of lingering on. </p>
<p>Chapman has one of those voices that feels immediately familiar, yet is bracingly distinct. You can hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a> in his conversational verses; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Malkmus</a> in the voice-cracking choruses; Jeff Mangum in the fantastical, quasi-religious imagery; and (again) Dan Bejar in the tendency to hurriedly overstuff his stanzas while retaining perfect enunciation and rhyme schemes. But his winsome, observational perspective is his own—and not just when he’s referencing the pitfalls of having to work his day job in biochemistry while school’s out (""at the lab, they have turned off the hot-water heater/ from the month of June right through until July""). His lyrics can take the form of self-help mantras (""And now I know who I really, really am/ I’m going to stay on track""); they also speak to more peculiar personal insecurities (""Can you tell me, do I have a glass eyelid?/ Can you tell me, do I have a glass forehead?""). But even his most bizarre musings sound like emotional breakthroughs achieved amid moments of great clarity—""Stargazer"" may speak of of serpent kings and laser beam blasts, but it uses those storybook devices to battle real-life demons.</p>
<p>Chapman particularly excels at writing two kinds of songs. There are perfectly minimal jams like ""Lion in Chains"" and the aforementioned ""Stargazer,"" each nothing more than a beautifully languorous verse melody—mirrored by gently-weeping guitar refrains—repeated over and over again until they feel like choruses. At the other end of the spectrum are sublime, intricately constructed turns like ""Click Clack"" and ""Alaskan Shake,"" each a long, winding hallway lined with many doors that open the songs up to surprising new directions at the precise moment when they seem like they’re going to ramble off aimlessly. Appropriately enough, the last words we hear Chapman sing on the record are ""trust, trust, trust, trust me,"" a plea for redemption doubling as an assurance that, even in the most circuitous, fanciful Nap Eyes song, Chapman will eventually steer you back on course. </p></div>"|21451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21451-thought-rock-fish-scale/|8.0|Stuart Berman

In his more than decade-long career, his mixes and productions have veered far from the main drag of club and dancefloor appeal. More important for Smoke, in all of his work, was emotional exploration. It’s obvious that he has the disposition of a sensitive soul, and on his first outing with <a href=""http://www.rsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S Records</a>, <i>Love Over Will</i>, Smoke swings for the fences, trying to complete a vision which could really create a puncturing and memorable experience.</p>
<p>Apparently the title of the album is a playful inversion of British occultist Aleister Crowley’s law of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thelema</a>, a thoroughly ambiguous holy writ. In similarly opaque and broad terms, Smoke has described the album as ""a statement on the times we are living in, but with an optimism relating to ways forward that are possible."" But does he deliver on such lofty statements? Probably not, but in over 13 tracks and 33 minutes, Smoke tightly packs a myriad of concepts and ideas, ranging from ontology, loss love, the carceral state, and Edward Snowden. The resulting project is contemplative, relaxing, and elegant on a sonic level, but often uneven and clunky lyrically.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The unevenness comes from Smoke’s heavy reliance on his singing, which cannot carry the album's thematic weight.  His vocals dominate, featuring in eight of the 13 songs. Throughout, he sings in a low register, mostly in a monotone, and his voice is always Auto-Tuned or pitch-adjusted. Sometimes the vocals are the perfect complement to his sparse, buoyant productions, and at other times they are far too brittle and inflexible to match the rich sounds around him. The freezingly tender and liquid wall of sound in the album’s opener, ""Fair Is Foul,"" favorably recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23356-mica-levi/"" target=""_blank"">Mica Levi</a>’s palette of quavering synths for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/"" target=""_blank"">Under the Skin</a></i>, but the track is nearly ruined by the interjection of lines like ""I never really care about you anyway/ You’re always on the way.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When his songwriting and singing fit together, Smoke comes very close to the emotional resonance he is striving for. In ""LossGain,"" as he whispers ""Don’t tell me how I feel when I’m myself,"" there is an aching sense of strength and affirmation amidst the melancholy. When he sings ""All my atoms/ Struggling to fight them"" in ""All My Atoms,"" the blunt lyrics propel the energy of the song’s bright keys. Smoke is a sentimentalist at heart, and in the album’s best track, ""Dust,"" he submits to old desires and calls out to a lover: ""Don’t want to be with anyone else/ Don’t want to be separate.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"" target=""_blank"">Holly Herndon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"" target=""_blank"">Jam City</a>, Smoke attempts to politically radicalize his music. Unlike the other two artists, he is hesitant to go full hog, and only devotes two tracks to explicitly political themes: ""Fall Out"" and ""Yearning Mississippi."" ""Fall Out"" is partially inspired by the trials and tribulations of hacker folk hero Edward Snowden. As he sings ""you’ll never know they’re watching you...you’ll never even see,"" his voice is drowned out by a landscape of computer sounds, not unlike the ones featured in Laura Poitras' film about Snowden, <i>Citizenfour</i>. As the album’s final track, it serves as an almost cheerful acquiescence to the grand scariness of the surveillance state, in favor of ruminating on less dizzying concerns. For ""Yearning Mississippi,"" he explored ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax’s <a href=""http://research.culturalequity.org/get-audio-ix.do?ix=session&amp;id=PR47&amp;idType=abbrev&amp;sortBy=abc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cultural Equity Archive </a>and sampled prison songs from Mississippi. This is an interesting detail, but it would be impossible to notice on its own, making the potential critique of the prison system miss its mark.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Overall, Smoke still gets over on his ability to craft rich, moody soundscapes, although almost all the tracks on the album would have worked better as standalone instrumentals. Unlike his last project, <i>Wraetlic</i>, a woefully dreary and depressive piece, <i>Love Over Will</i> projects a hopeful sense of growth for Smoke. The sadness here is somehow more buoyant and more comforting. It leaves a kernel of warmth on otherwise very cold days.</p></div>"|21539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21539-love-over-will/|7.0|Kevin Lozano

It's his great gift, really. ""I look like I’m balling 'cause I’m really balling,"" he correctly points out on his radio single ""Really Really."" As a rapper, he's perfectly comfortable reeling off ""lyrical-miracle"" technical displays, but his best music is rooted strongly in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"" target=""_blank"">2Pac</a> tradition of blunt-force honesty, and all his best songs emerge straight from the gut.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Gates' major-label debut <i>Islah</i>, released this week on Atlantic Records with few pushbacks and (even more astonishingly) almost no big-name guest spots or features, suggests that no-holds-barred candor is working for him. Someone, somewhere, correctly deduced that the appeal of Kevin Gates is that he offers the maximum amount of Kevin Gates, and they’ve left him alone to turn out as much of that product as he’ll offer. <i>Islah </i>is a sustained and triumphant outpouring, and Gates gives every good, bad, and ugly thing he has. It's by far the best single release of his career: It's more melodic and more focused; fiercer and more playful; funnier and sadder.  It's also probably the best pure rap release of the first quarter, and the best-case scenario for how a locally famous rapper can make a great album for a wider audience without getting lost in a corporate ledger. </p>
<p>His music scans unquestionably as gangsta rap, but then he puts in lines like these: ""I used to tease you about your feet, we would laugh and we’d giggle/ And having breakfast on the beach, you don’t know how much that meant to me"" (""Pride""). The line zeroes in on something important about Gates: In his personal life, he is <a href=""http://theboombox.com/kevin-gates-attack-jhonni-blaze-instagram/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">decidedly</a> <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/10/kevin-gates-islah-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not a model of human decency</a>, but on record, he is not just vulnerable, but <i>tender</i>, maybe the rarest of pop-music currencies. ""Baby hit this weed cuz it might calm you down/ I rub your feet listening to everything you talk about,"" he offers sweetly on the sex jam ""One Thing.""</p>
<p>The moody music, full of minor-key piano and delicate synths, feels pitched somewhere between dramatic alt-rock (Gates is a professed fan of Lifehouse and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"" target=""_blank"">RHCP</a>) and traditional street rap, staggering this way or the other depending on Gates' weathered, changeable voice. The new age synthesizers on ""Ain’t Too Hard"" could plausibly be sourced from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a> mixtape or a Belinda Carlisle single: ""I’m commitment-shy, so when feelings get involved, I tend to run,"" Gates admits. He bursts into melody almost as often as he raps, which has led to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> comparisons, but his closest analog might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32924-fetty-wap/"" target=""_blank"">Fetty Wap</a>, if he were stuck on an uncontrollable crying jag in the bathtub.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite this, you could never call <i>Islah</i> (named after Gates' eldest daughter, who often appears on camera with Gates in the rapper's <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamkevingates/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram videos</a>) mournful or depressing. Like any street rapper determined to survive the late-'00s rap-album-budget implosion intact, Kevin Gates has become his own best hook singer, his best songwriter, and the best (and usually only) rapper on his songs. On <i>Islah</i>, his hook-writing is sterling. The chorus of mid-album track ""Time for That"" has the rhythmic playfulness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5o642Jvp70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pass Dat</a>,"" while ""2 Phones,"" in which Gates struggles with the mobile-phone implications of the ""keep your business and family completely separated"" Crack Commandment, is deliriously good, the sort of hook you plunk down in front of an A&amp;R rep and immediately collect house-down-payment money. But it's all Gates.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His emotional appeal, along with his ear for affecting melodies, makes him an odd sort of crossover star. His music has everything hardcore rap fans look for—emotional immediacy, a compelling voice, unimpeachable integrity—but he lacks some things that can reliably be counted on to draw in interested outsiders: a novel style, a flashy or ""weird"" persona. Gates is <i>weird</i>, yes, but not the kind brands typically attach themselves to. Imagine the chipper associate social media manager trying to build a ""strategy"" around Gates' famous admission that he discovered he was <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2015/01/09/kevin-gates-having-sex-with-cousin-dating-rapper-instagram-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">accidentally sleeping with his cousin</a>, and feel a twinge of pity and horror.</p>
<p>And yet when you listen to the sure-to-be upcoming single ""Hard For,"" you start to see it: The unlikely but powerful Gates fan coalition. The song is tremendously unusual—with its acoustic guitar backing and chorus chant ""you’re the only one that my dick’ll get hard for,"" it’s practically an Uncle Kracker song about erectile dysfunction. But it’s also improbably beautiful: The second line of that couplet is ""I’m confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?"", a line that cuts painfully to the core of heartbroken post-relationship confusion. This is the humanity that brings out the best in Gates: His music paints a picture where life is messy, where close friends cross uncrossable lines all the time. Out of love and out of a healthy appreciation for the workings of karma, you massage your temples and forgive them.</p></div>"|21287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21287-islah/|8.5|Jayson Greene

In the five years since their excellent fourth studio album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15507-its-all-true/"" target=""_blank""><i>It's All True</i></a>, they've moved past the introverted electro-pop of their previous records into territory that feels both fresh and pointedly familiar. On<i> Big Black Coat</i>, you hear some mid-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>, a big debt to Detroit techno, that sweet spot in the mid-'70s when krautrock met disco, several of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a>'s many house aliases, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> circa <i>Controversy</i>. It's an impressive juggling act, and most importantly, it never lapses into pastiche or boredom, wearing its influences squarely on its sleeve while standing as one of the highlights of Junior Boys' discography.</p>
<p>The album is purposefully sexy, but never orgiastic: Like actual, real sex, it's a mix of abandon and introspection. When frontman Jeremy Greenspan sings ""C'mon Baby,"" it's a plea, a supplication, not a wanton come-on. On ""No One's Business,"" the line ""When I kiss you/ I'm on fire"" sounds as painful as it does lustful. The ultra-warm synth stabs of album opener ""You Say That"" offers a cocooned sense of security, paired with the kind of driving cymbals you feel in your legs before your ears. But  the song ends abruptly with Greenspan hacking a cough into the mic, as if he's just taken this new, dancier version of himself to its absolute limit. It's funny, irreverent, and refreshingly self-aware: In other words, it's pure Junior Boys. </p>
<p>A handful of tracks even delve boldly into techno, like the epic ""What You Won't Do for Love,"" Greenspan's understated falsetto bubbling up from beneath a sea of arpeggiated tones. Follow-up ""And It's Forever"" would fit perfectly in a comedown house set, down to its repetitive vocal edit and pulsating bassline. It sort of sounds like if your friends tried to take you to the club after a breakup, but you cancelled on them last minute and spent the night cruising Discogs for old vinyl.</p>
<p>On the title track and closer, they sum up both where they've been and where they're going. It's a sprawling melting pot of a song, and you can hear techno, house music, bedroom pop, IDM, disco, and more, all packaged smartly into seven minutes. It's impressive and frankly unusual to see a band five albums into their career experiment with new sounds and actually make it work, but Junior Boys have pulled it off. Career longevity looks good on them. </p></div>"|21513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21513-big-black-coat/|8.0|Cameron Cook

So it’s commendable that on their second album, the duo (now going by the slightly less confusing moniker DJDS) decided to chuck the proven formula and try something new.</p>
<p>For <i>Stand Up and Speak</i>, the pair have rethought nearly every aspect of their collaboration, from the overall sonic identity all the way down to the way it was recorded. Instead of mining old records for samples like they did so effectively on <i>Friend</i>, they created nearly every element on <i>Speak</i> from scratch, going as far as hiring vocalists off Craigslist and recording live instruments.</p>
<p>Leaning on organic sounds and performances that aren’t computer-controlled gives the album a warmer feel throughout. The streaks of heartbrokenness that ran through <i>Friend</i> have mostly been scrubbed away and replaced by a more uplifting mood. There’s a hint of sadness in the chopped-up vocal melody that ""In the Flames"" revolves around, but it’s more than sufficiently offset by the nimble, burbling bassline behind it. The penultimate track ""I Don’t Love You"" is as much of a breakup anthem as the title suggests, but it’s less the ""wallow in your own misery"" type and more the ""get out to the club and dance it off"" kind, building over its succinct three-and-a-half minutes to an emotional and sonic climax that’s downright triumphal.</p>
<p>The pair also seem to have shifted their influences from club culture’s earliest, most underground days to the period shortly thereafter where it first began to make inroads into the pop mainstream—less Paradise Garage and more ""Club MTV."" References to late-'80s/early-'90s club pop and vocal house abound. Sometimes it’s explicit, like the vocal loop, syncopated synth-tambourine, and brightly digital-sounding piano riff that underpin the hooky ""You Don’t Have to Be Alone."" Sometimes it’s more subtle, just a touch of breakbeat on the snare parts and a hint of the same exultant mood that groups from Deee-Lite to Black Box rode to surprising crossover success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pair’s willingness to mess with a proven formula doesn’t translate into a more satisfying experience. For every ""You Don’t Have to Be Alone' or ""I Don’t Love You""—instantly memorable anthems that pretty much every type of dance DJ could find room for in their sets—<i>Speak</i> offers one or two tracks that just don’t generate a spark. And unlike <i>Friend</i>, which still stands up as a solid front-to-back listen, their use and reuse of the same few production techniques—most noticeably two-bar vocal loops and snare rolls—gives the album the feel of a couple great singles packaged with the half-baked demos that led up to their creation. <i>Speak</i> isn’t exactly a step forward or a step back, but more to the side, onto a new path with plenty of potential, as well as room for future improvements.</p></div>"|21552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21552-stand-up-and-speak/|6.7|Miles Raymer

What looks like the honing of craft and technique via repetition can easily be confused for homogeneity and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Cussler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clive Cussler</a>-esque predictability. You run the risk of being trapped on an artistic treadmill if you don't decide to throw some of your old tricks in the garbage. And it's awfully hard. But in all arts, be it writing, or the making of psychedelic pop music, sometimes you have to kill all your darlings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Last time we saw Black Moth Super Rainbow it was 2012, and they were riding high off the spoils of Kickstarter booty and an album that was an index for how far they had come. In<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17134-cobra-juicy/"" target=""_blank""> Cobra Juicy</a></i>, Tom Fec and his merry band of freaks seemed to have finally revealed the intimations of a more mature musical project. Fast forward to November of last year: With no sixth album in sight, Black Moth Super Rainbow decided to unload, in their own words, ""neon flavored outtakes from a 6th album that doesn't yet exist."" <i>SeeFu Lilac</i> is just that, outtakes and fragments, musical ephemera at best, perfectly suited for the rabid BMSR fanbase but not much else.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Clocking in at a scant 19 minutes, <i>SeeFu Lilac</i> is a collection of nine songs which slavishly adhere to the sounds and tropes which made BMSR famous in the first place. The ubiquitous vocoder vocals and the patina of vintage synths are all here, along with the same self-satisfied, isolationist nostalgia, which to some paints BMSR as refreshingly authentic and to others gimmicky cranks who haven't listened to an album made after the year 1993. When the band released a stream of the record on Facebook, they proudly rallied against trendiness or marketability, proclaiming ""no glam shots, no press releases, no problem.""</p>
<p>The one thing that separates<i> SeeFu Lilac</i> from previous BMSR efforts is the noticeable change in disposition. The record as a whole feels sunnier and the nostalgia is less sinister and somehow saccharine. Gone is the seething pop evil that coated<i> Cobra Juicy</i>. Instead of toeing the line between beautiful and grotesque, in these sketches of songs BMSR is trying to sound more subdued and much prettier. <i>Seefu Lilac</i>'s most exciting moments come in small instrumental bursts that are calming and melodic. In the album's title track, a ruminative acoustic guitar is put in conversation with a wall of warm synths, and the result is nicely organic and effortless. It gives a hint of the sound BMSR might want to work with in future records.</p>
<p>They benefit from uncluttering their music and removing the fading drapery of distorted effects and wonky inversions, because it showcases what made BMSR so interesting earlier in the 2000s: vintage gear and earnest analog sentimentalism. But this sentimentalism is the very reason why this record is so uninteresting: It's a love letter to their previous work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I wonder if Fec should toss the vocoder aside. The same suite of effects used to achieve the throaty and warbled vocals hasn't changed at all since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10246-dandelion-gum/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dandelion Gum</i></a>. At this point, it wouldn't be unfair to say that it's become a gimmick, especially when deployed to tackle subjects like love or loss. The vocoder flattens and parodies whatever emotions a song might be meditating on. In ""Since You've Seen Her,"" it's hard to take Fec seriously as he sadly croons ""make a wish"" over and over again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In a recent interview addressing the album, Fec said that he thought a lot of contemporary music felt ""so desperate."" He made sure to backtrack and soften this statement, saying that: ""Maybe I am kind of a recluse, and maybe..I don't have the greatest perspectives of everything."" Fec has painted himself as an outsider for years, and it's not surprising that he finds so much of music just outside his lair unrelatable; you can hear it in the music he makes. It's the product of living in an echo chamber and not paying attention to the changes in both DIY and synth-driven music in the last four years. Fec has admitted to a certain amount of frustration with the sixth proper BMSR album, and the release of <i>SeeFu Lilac</i> is music he ""needed to get out of [his] head"" because it didn't fit in where he was going artistically. Hopefully Fec and friends have exorcised their nagging demons with <i>SeeFu Lilac</i>, and move forward into something very different.</p></div>"|21464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21464-seefu-lilac/|5.5|Kevin Lozano

Making good use of a minimal backing band—often just their own guitars and an upright bass, with flourishes of pedal steel and electric guitar—they updated the downcast vocals of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6270-the-carter-family/"" target=""_blank"">Carter Family</a> and wrote songs set in some alternate-reality American past. It seemed like there was a ghost or a corpse on every album. Freakwater had a simple, yet powerful palette to match the Appalachian gothic tone, and that combination has kept the band alive and relevant even as many of their alt-country peers have fallen by the wayside. Their best albums—especially 1995’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3184-old-paint/"" target=""_blank"">Old Paint</a></i>—sound less like products of a particular scene and more like the sepia-toned recordings of eccentric artists dislocated from history.</p>
<p>Even when they’ve put a full decade between albums, Bean and Irwin have never strayed far from their recognizable sound or their bleak subject matter. But on <i>Scheherazade</i>, their eighth album overall and their first since 2005, they overhaul it dramatically: For the first time since they recorded demos in the Bean's parents’ basement, they ventured out of Chicago and recorded in Louisville, the city with which the band has long been identified. They also recruited a slew of Northern Kentucky musicians, including Sarah Balliet from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4820-murder-by-death/"" target=""_blank"">Murder by Death</a>, Morgan Geer form Drunken Prayer, and Evan Patterson of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5106-young-widows/"" target=""_blank"">Young Widows</a>. Noted Louisville resident <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a> doesn’t show up, disproving my theory that he is required by law to play on every local release. On the other hand, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1332-warren-ellis/"" target=""_blank"">Warren Ellis</a> of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Seeds</a> does play violin and flute.</p>
<p>It’s the largest cast and crew they’ve assembled under the Freakwater banner, and as a result, <i>Scheherazade</i> sounds fuller and looser, a bit rougher around the edges, with more rock in the arrangements. It’s their most cinematic album yet, with the music functioning almost as a soundtrack to Irwin and Bean’s short, violent songs. On the very first song, ""What the People Want,"" somebody throws a baby down a well, accompanied by tense swirls of strings. On ""Down Will Come Baby,"" they rewrite the old, twisted lullaby ""Rock-a-bye Baby,"" and the band navigates a series of key changes that lends a vertiginous effect, as though the cradle is in freefall. </p>
<p>The presence of so many imperiled infants on <i>Scheherazade </i>is oddly reassuring, a nice reminder that this is a Freakwater album after all. The tight harmonies that marked their previous efforts here come slightly unraveled; they sing against each other as often as with each other. These are some of their most visceral performances, as rough-hewn on quiet numbers like ""Ghost Song"" as one heavier numbers like ""Take Me With You,"" which features roof-raising hollers by Bean. There’s something invigorating about hearing two alt-country veterans take apart their tried-and-true sound and reassemble it slightly askew, and <i>Scheherazade </i>is not only their most modern-sounding record; it might be their best since <i>Old Paint</i>.</p></div>"|21484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21484-scheherazade/|7.5|Stephen M.

Just as the corny reference of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>"" was wiped away by the band’s might and majesty, ""shoegaze"" became a phonetically evocative word—those oozy vowels and soft sibilants—that suited the blurry sound. The literal meaning—and the fact that it was initially intended as a derisive term— disappeared.</p>
<p>The compressed accusation in ""shoegaze""—coined by someone at <i>NME</i>, a music paper less supportive of the genre than its rival <i>Melody Maker</i>—is that these were bands too bashful to meet the audience’s eyes. Unlike the attention-seeking egos that typically front British bands, the shoegazers were self-effacing, hiding behind their hair and glancing down at the array of effects pedals at their feet. Shoegazers were insufficiently invested in the performative aspects of rock: the genre was all about sound, not show.</p>
<p>Despite starting as a slur, ""shoegaze"" fit the genre like a glove and soon supplanted the competing descriptors. ""Dreampop,"" an invention of A.R. Kane’s, enjoyed small and short-lived currency in the U.S. The other contender was The Scene That Celebrates Itself, coined by a <i>Melody Maker</i> editor. A tautology, of course—show me a Scene That Denigrates Itself—but it did convey the incestuous vibe of the early movement. Most of the bands knew each other and fraternized, and they generally hailed from the Thames Valley (London, Reading, Oxford). </p>
<p>Remembering shoegaze’s other name made me think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>’s ""scenius"" concept: the idea that music evolves through collective processes, in an incremental and reactive way, rather than through heroic innovators making giant steps that everyone else follows. A sound emerges and everyone wants in; the style—usually a mixture of new technological possibilities and aesthetic choices—becomes the idiom through which you express what you have to say. Like all languages, the style stipulates and restricts possibilities as much as it creates them. </p>
<p>The first few discs of <i>Still in a Dream</i>, a new 5xCD box from <a href=""http://www.cherryred.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cherry Red</a>, make a good argument in favor of scenius. Picking almost randomly, one example of the <i>perfectly</i> generic here is Pale Saints' ""Sight of You."" It is not <i>ur</i>-shoegaze (that would be MBV’s ""You Made Me Realise""), but it is <i>echt</i>-shoegaze. The name Pale Saints vaguely gestures at the Pre-Raphaelites and mystic devotion; the song title proposes love as a rapture of the gaze rather than a fever of the flesh; the sound is choirboy-pure vocals and guitar that works as a billowing curtain of texture rather than propulsive riff. Two other absolutely typical, absolutely lovely specimens of shoegaze here are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2564-lush/"" target=""_blank"">Lush</a>’s ""De-Luxe"" (like being buffeted by flower petals in a wind-tunnel) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive</a>’s ""Slowdive,"" where the slightest of chord sequences ripples the silvery guitar wooze. Where the genre’s progenitors My Bloody Valentine—mystifyingly absent from the box despite providing its title—churned with dizzy-making desire, the effect with second-wave shoegaze tends to be more virginal. Slowdive certainly emit none of the dark erotic energy of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33171-siouxsie-and-the-banshees/"" target=""_blank"">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a> song from which they took their name.</p>
<p>Along with ""scenius,"" another Eno thought sprang to mind when listening through the box: Eno hailed MBV’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LseSx_hPJyQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soon</a>"" as ""the vaguest music ever to have been a hit."" That got me musing: why would ""vague"" be a good thing for music to be? How would you distinguish between the deliberately indistinct and the merely insubstantial? And how does this sonic vagueness relate to life?</p>
<p>Shoegaze’s nebulousness has to do with its slightly ""off"" relation with both rock and pop. The genre fetishizes the <i>sound</i> of the guitar, but is relatively uninterested in the other things that guitars have traditionally done—riffs, solos, grooving. Shoegaze introduced a new generation of guitar heroes who weren’t dramatic. Rather than the spotlight of a solo, there would be a mid-song caesura of abstract carnage. The heroism took the form of explorations into texture. Kevin Shields was the scene's Hendrix figure, but the contrast between Jimi the showman and Shields the shy man is telling. No guitar-face or swaggering about the stage. The music was designed to overwhelm in the live context, but in a way that was impersonal—as though the band were victims of the sound as much as the audience, or simply conduits for the torrential noise.</p>
<p>What also made shoegaze such an indeterminate proposition as regards proper rock and proper pop was the way it used rhythm and the voice. It’s tempting to say that this is a genre consisting of non-drummers and non-singers. Certainly, re-listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"" target=""_blank"">Ride</a>’s ""Drive Blind"" was a bit of a shocker: how did a group get so big with such a shaky voice upfront, with a drummer that could barely hold a beat? But mostly the subdued rhythm and buried vocals was a deliberate aesthetic choice rather than a matter of deficiency. Voices were mixed to be half-obscured by the blizzard of sound; the rhythm section just about kept up with the guitar tumult. Shoegaze was as not-quite-pop as it was not-quite-rock. The melodies harked back beguilingly to a hazy, half-remembered '60s, but had little to do with what '80s chart-pop considered ""a tune."" Shoegaze’s brief stint as the reigning alternative sound in the UK was ended by Britpop, and it’s the emphasis on ""pop"" there that is significant. Groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">Oasis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a> mixed the voice upfront and above the instrumentation; songs acquired anthemic choruses; singers got cocky and in-your-face.</p>
<p>Shoegaze, in contrast, made a fetish of the swoon. The sighing vocals, the sickly drooping drones and melodic descents, the wavery timbres—these signature sonic effects induced listener responses like rolling your eyes back in your head or swaying slightly as if about to faint. The feeling transmitted by shoegaze at its most compelling combined surging urgency and heavy-lidded languor. It suggested threshold states: drowsily slipping into a nap in the mid-afternoon, not being able to shake off the dream in the morning. The connective thread with all these sensations is the relinquishing of control, the scary bliss of losing orientation and agency.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s too much of a reach to imagine that this had some kind of semi-conscious resonance for a generation that felt powerless. It’s quite hard to reconstruct how bleak things seemed in the late '80s and early '90s; in both Britain and America, conservative governments were in third-term ascendance, and mainstream popular culture from hair metal to Hollywood seemed be in sync with the rightward shift. For many—not all, but many—this encouraged resignation, a withdrawal verging on hibernation. That’s why American nu-punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2399-l7/"" target=""_blank"">L7</a> wrote their anti-slacker anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAdlZ2F-fs8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pretend We’re Dead</a>"" as a wake-up call from apathy. That’s why Welsh nu-punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2660-manic-street-preachers/"" target=""_blank"">Manic Street Preachers</a> declared that they hated Slowdive more than Hitler—for being so dreamily disengaged, advocates for reverie rather than revolution.</p>
<p>This anti-politics of vagueness comes through clearly on one of <i>Still in a Dream</i>’s more unusual and surprising inclusions, a lost classic that I would never have filed under shoegaze: AC Marias’s ""One of Our Girls Has Gone Missing."" AC is Angela Conway, an associate of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> (whose Bruce Gilbert was involved in the sculpted-snow sound of ""One of Our Girls,"" which ought to thrill anyone who loves <i>Chairs Missing</i> and <i>154</i>.) Drawing on the John le Carré genre of ice-hearted espionage fiction and the idea of the agent who goes AWOL, Conway’s lyric imagines a strategy of dissidence through disappearance:""“She has lost her color/ And faded away/ Moved into thin air.""</p>
<p>As a frontline journalist covering much of this music at the time, I recall that the '60s allegiances of shoegaze seemed obvious and paramount. They were harking back longingly to the '60s as a refusal of the '80s—the decade of Thatcher and Reagan. But that necessarily meant a return of '60s sounds without any of the hope or confident dynamism of that decade; change would <i>not</i> be coming, change in fact was being reversed. That’s one reason why the word ""dream"" was so emblematic of the era (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10326-daydream-nation-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Daydream Nation</i></a> being only the most conspicuous example). Rather than turn dreams into reality, now it was more like dreaming your life away, assisted by recorded relics from that lost time. Rather than ""we want the world and we want it now"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"" target=""_blank"">the Doors</a>) or even ""we’re all normal and we want our freedom"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29530-love/"" target=""_blank"">Love</a>), the spirit was crestfallen and crushed: ""There’s a place I’d like to be/ There’s a place I’d be happy"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a>’s ""Tugboat""), or the murmured, barely audible ""much rather be"" in ""All Different Things"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/572-bark-psychosis/"" target=""_blank"">Bark Psychosis</a>.</p>
<p>Listening today, though, the '60s-ness of shoegaze recedes to a surprising degree. Especially on the first disc—which includes shoegaze-spawning but not-really-shoegaze greats like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28570-the-house-of-love/"" target=""_blank"">the House of Love</a>, A.R. Kane—I don’t hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"" target=""_blank"">the Byrds</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvets</a>, I hear the glassy textures of John McGeoch, Vini Reilly, or Clive Timperley of the Passions (the glorious glistening echoplexed intro to ""I’m in Love With a German Film Star""). Yes, the ""ba ba-ba-ba ba"" bit in ""Christine"" by the House of Love harks back to '60s pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13150-the-turtles/"" target=""_blank"">the Turtles</a> type, but Terry Bickers' crystalline cascades are totally modern in their moment.</p>
<p>In other shoegaze groups, a surprisingly large amount of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a> is discernible: the processional glide-rhythms, the high-toned droning basslines. Despite being swathed in prismatic guitar-miasma, Kitchens of Distinction sound like Modern English more than anything on ""3rd Time We Opened the Capsule."" Even with the overtly classicist outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a>, for all the signposted allusions to the Velvets, Beach Boys, Stooges, and their refusal of '80s tropes (gated drums, Yamaha DX7 synth—i.e. the very things that groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> now deliberately redeploy), a record like ""Hypnotized"" could only have been made at that particular time. If you placed it alongside records actually made in the '60s, it would jut out jarringly.</p>
<p><i>Still in a Dream</i> takes a wide trawl approach to its genre, which has upsides and downsides. The stricture of only one track per artist means that the inessential gets inevitably over-represented and the defining greats get short-changed and effectively demoted. A five-disc box set of shoegaze organized around quality and innovation as criteria would be about 1/3 My Bloody Valentine. As with Rhino’s goth box <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9814-a-life-less-lived-the-gothic-box/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Life Less Lived</i></a>, shoegaze is generously interpreted to include antecedents and formative influences, which bulks up the quality. After that you get the influenc<i>ed</i>: the second and third waves, as well as fellow travelers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/854-cranes/"" target=""_blank"">Cranes</a>), outliers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Rev</a>), and offshoots (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5164-seefeel/"" target=""_blank"">Seefeel</a>). Shrewdly, the compilers cut off in '95, and don’t attempt to corral any of the shoegaze homages or revivalists of the last 20 years.</p>
<p>I had a great time with the first disc (late '80s), a good time with the second and much of the third (lovely to remake the acquaintance of Moose and the muscular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4017-swervedriver/"" target=""_blank"">Swervedriver</a>, who had a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"" target=""_blank"">Thin Lizzy</a> in their make-up), but by the fourth, the trip down memory lane took on a purgatorial aspect. ""More of the same, only slightly different"" is good up to a point, but with any genre you can have too much of a good thing. Although primarily a UK genre—and in some way reflective of British character traits like diffidence—the Americans did join in: sometimes inventively warping the MBV blueprint (the blow-torched beauty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2729-medicine/"" target=""_blank"">Medicine</a>’s ""Aruca"") and other times cloning it (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4021-swirlies/"" target=""_blank"">Swirlies</a>). You can always quibble about choices (why ""Rollercoaster"" as opposed to two dozen other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a> candidates?!). But overall <i>Still in a Dream</i> is a job well done: an accurate portrait of an era that, while it can’t really be described as a lost golden age for rock, nonetheless provided sorely needed radiance and refuge during a particularly grim period. </p></div>"|21499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21499-still-in-a-dream-a-story-of-shoegaze-1988-1995/|8.0|Simon Reynolds

But no matter; the album is a smoothly executed pitch deck of exactly what will perform on pop radio in 2016, and Puth—pronounced ""Pooth,"" and the slice through his right eyebrow is from a childhood canine attack, if you’re wondering—will do just fine. The 24-year-old Berklee College of Music graduate and former YouTube star of the acoustic-cover variety has already had three top 40 singles, all since last February: first, the demonic Meghan Trainor duet ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igNVdlXhKcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marvin Gaye</a>,"" then, the Paul Walker Memorial Beanie Baby track ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See You Again</a>"" (featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a>), then ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxuY9FET9Y4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One Call Away</a>,"" an ocean of syrup that sounds exactly like ""See You Again,"" and is the first song on the LP.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Charlie Puth is extremely talented, it must be said. There’s that Berklee degree, of course, and the fact that he wrote so many theme songs for famous vloggers before he signed to Atlantic. Puth co-wrote every song on <i>Nine Track Mind</i> and produced much of it solo, and the songwriting and the arrangements and the engineering are shockingly proficient, proficient to the point of insensation. Also, there is Puth’s voice, a beautiful tenor/falsetto soaring out of a throat that never coughs that frog out and as such must be magical. In other words, Charlie Puth is a truly excellent product, the type of artist that inspires wildly confident emails from anyone getting a cut. ""Wrote the hook in 10 minutes,"" you can imagine his A&amp;R tapping out on an iPhone (Puth did, he says, for ""See You Again""). ""Video’s going to be just Paul Walker clips and the Wiz verse, guaranteed smash, gonna do a billion on YouTube."" And it did.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like the best-selling (i.e. blandest) model home in the up-and-coming suburb, <i>Nine Track Mind </i>is demoralizingly well-constructed as a means to an end, and it’s <i>because</i> of Puth’s considerable abilities, and not in spite of them, that the album induces such despair. It doesn’t help that <i>Nine Track Mind </i>is all ballads except for three tracks, two of which are duets (Trainor, a sleepy Selena Gomez) that somehow still feel like ballads. Puth cannot fill this frame of sentimentality with any genuine sentiment: The album’s emotional range covers the spectrum from light longing to light infatuation, contributing to the overall sense that <i>Nine Track Mind</i> is aimed exclusively at hairlessness: children, prepubescents, the discomfitingly waxed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As he showed us in ""Marvin Gaye,"" Puth lives for retro flourishes: doo-wop rhythms, sock-hop melodies, finger snaps, arpeggiated singalong piano. The album doesn’t deviate much from this safe spot; when it does, it goes blander (""Up All Night"" is completely self-effacing) or, pleasantly, Ryan Tedder-er (""My Gospel"" is a nicely rumbling One Republic facsimile), or, even more pleasantly, somewhat close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a> territory. ""Suffer"" is a credibly lustful piece of pleading, and ""Losing My Mind"" begins with a lovely, distorted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>-lite riff that rings like a bell over Puth, who gets to take a welcome break from his falsetto. The latter track sounds like the work of an award-winning college acapella group; it is the album’s strongest track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As for the rest? ""Left Right Left,"" a love-ish song that sounds like accidentally holding hands with a coworker, is a ballad that assumes no one will listen to it. If you did, you’d hear Charlie Puth encouraging his romantic interest—""We’re almost there, baby, one more step""—to bravely overcome the obstacle of Charlie Puth, who is dealing with a set of problems that includes ""walls,"" ""long roads,"" and ""climbing."" There is a classic track in the So Sweet The Neg Will Be Invisible genre (it’s called ""Then There’s You,"" and the chorus goes ""There’s beautiful and then there’s you""). There is also a series of increasingly unnecessary vows scattered throughout the album: Puth promises to save the day, to never sleep alone, to stay perfectly still when the world is on fire, and then, in ""My Gospel,"" he goes nuclear. ""I’d stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on and walk out with a million bucks,"" he blusters. ""Then I’d burn it in a pile out on your front lawn, just to prove it didn’t mean that much.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That lyric couplet has the approximate relationship to joy and meaning as the rest of this album does, generally. Later in the same track, Puth promises to ""carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_1804627072""><span class=""aQJ"">midnight."" What a tempting offer, and a typical one, in which your best case scenario is unconsciousness. You’d have to be completely sensible to pass.</span></span></p></div>"|21502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21502-nine-track-mind/|2.5|Jia Tolentino

He is most effective making phrasing and imagery work for him in tandem (think quips like ""Might valet park a Brinks truck"" or ""Got a pocket full of dead prez/ Attached to your girl like a .jpeg""). His recent releases have struggled to duplicate the formula, and he has fallen by the wayside as a result, all while a new crop of artists from his city pop up. Just as it seemed 2 Chainz might be swallowed up by the current, he returns to form with a surprise release,<i> Felt Like Cappin</i>, which is essentially a singles bundle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At just about 20 minutes, <i>Felt Like Cappin</i> is a natural progression from 2014’s underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19361-2-chainz-freebase-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>FreeBase </i></a>EP<i>,</i> with last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20926-trap-a-velli-tre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trap-A-Velli Tre</i></a> mixtape serving as more of a stopgap.<i> Trap-A-Velli Tre</i> had its moments, but it was way too drawn out and scattershot,with a few songs that were as weird as they were unnecessary. 2 Chainz cuts out the filler here, and is better for it: His trifle-heavy rap style works better in condensed space, and at six tracks that’s exactly what we've got. The brevity allows him to be the entertainer who captivated audiences with jokey, absurd runs of guest verses again. ""I don't care about the tats on your faces/ Them bitches cost $15/ I don't care about the pills that you're taking/ Them bitches cost $15!"" he raps on the title track, hamming it up with phrase-punctuating tonal shifts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Too much 2 Chainz can be a bit like eating icing directly from a pastry bag: fun at first, then nauseating. This go around, his raps aren’t only funny, they’re balanced, and he peppers them in over a wide-ranging assortment of sounds from producers Cardo, Mike WiLL Made-It, Zaytoven, FKi, and Timbaland. On ""This Me, Fuck It"" (which also appeared on Timbaland’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21403-king-stays-king/"" target=""_blank""><i>King Stays King</i></a> mixtape), he raps in compact bursts over one of Timbo’s signature, slithering flute loops, slinging zingers together. The TM88-produced ""Not Invited"" finds him wading through wailing synthesizers and organ flecks, reveling in his exclusivity. ""I don’t have to front/ I park in the front with the trunk in the front,"" he raps, and it’s hard not to revel in his flair and flamboyance.</p>
<p>He tags on two clean versions of the likely singles at the end, as if to remove any doubt what demo he's appealing to: These are for radio rotation, for packing dancefloors. On ""Back on the Bullshyt,"" he packs raps into a spiraling, woozy synth progression, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Wayne</a> turns in one of his stronger performances of late. The one curveball is ""Mindin My Business,"" a staggered, minimalist cut that showcases some of his most clear-eyed writing (""<i>Resident Evil</i> around these parts/ Peanut got killed in his front yard""). It teases at an ability to stray from his formula without drifting too far out of his lane. This is the best he's been in a long time and the most self-aware. For a while, it seemed like 2 Chainz’s hit making days were over. If nothing else,<i> Felt Like Cappin</i> proves he is still quite capable.</p></div>"|21541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21541-2-chainz-felt-like-cappin/|7.2|Sheldon Pearce

The group worked with singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"" target=""_blank"">Bilal</a> for a song on his 2013 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17816-bilal-a-love-surreal/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Love Surreal</i></a>, and with jazz pianist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Glasper</a>, on his <i>Black Radio</i> LP. By 2014, at the FYF Fest in Los Angeles, the singers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60921-solange-dev-hynes-moses-sumney-cover-nina-simones-to-be-young-gifted-and-black/"" target=""_blank"">covered</a> Nina Simone's ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black"" alongside Devonté Hynes, Moses Sumney, and Solange. The trio—comprised of Anita Bias and twins Paris and Amber Strother—has seen its stock rise significantly, although it didn't have a lot of music to speak of. Their EP had only three tracks—three <i>wonderful</i> tracks—but a short playlist nonetheless. Behind singles ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/weareking-1/in-the-meantime"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the Meantime</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/weareking-1/mister-chameleon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mister Chameleon</a>,"" KING was set to release its long-awaited first LP in 2014, but the year came and went without a full-length project. So there's plenty of interest in <i>We Are KING</i>, even if the singers are just on the periphery of larger mainstream circles.</p>
<p>Fusing dream pop and R&amp;B, KING floats through its debut album, making easy atmospheric blends akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"" target=""_blank"">Janet Jackson</a>. <i>We Are KING</i> is rich and transformative, centered on hazy mid-tempo grooves that calmly evoke a surreal ambience. KING harkens back to a time when there were clearer distinctions between R&amp;B, pop, and hip-hop, when acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32845-jodeci/"" target=""_blank"">Jodeci</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWV"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SWV</a> ruled the airwaves, and the music was lighter and more sensuous. <i>We Are KING</i> recalls the best of that era without completely rehashing it. These sounds are remarkably modern, yet as it plays, you find yourself thinking of simpler times—that homecoming dance or first kiss—as the singers keep their voices supplanted in the backdrop. This isn't an LP of long runs or over-the-top vocal solos. It's a light touch, built to establish a meditative mood. On ""Love Song,"" for instance, the vocalists hum softly without their words taking shape. The compositions are equally vital, and throughout the album, KING does a stellar job of letting the music breathe for its roughly 60-minute runtime.</p>
<p>Over its 12 tracks, <i>We Are KING </i>slowly reveals itself through sweet one-liners that waft in from distant places, like on ""Supernatural,"" one of three holdovers from the group's EP. After a brief intro of scenic wails, the song becomes a synthesized ode to puppy love: ""There's magic in <i>everything</i> you do… I'm in love with <i>everything</i> 'bout you."" <i>We Are KING</i> entices us to get away from the mundane, to spend time in grand spaces without smartphones and social media. Among other things, Paris, Amber, and Anita want you to reconnect with real people on real levels, to study their nuances and embrace their intricacies. They'd rather you appreciate what's in front of you, not the artificial world just beyond your passcode. ""Red Eye,"" a transitional cut near the album's beginning, is about pushing beyond your comfort zone. ""Native Land,"" the album's closing track, envisions a grand journey to remote shores.</p>
<p>At times, the singers address worldly, more grounded issues, stuff we can all relate to. ""Mister Chameleon"" is a tale of smoke and mirrors, of falling in love with a person you thought you knew. ""Oh, Please!"" depicts a romantic chase: It's the album's most overt display of personality, and the lyrics are more pronounced. As a whole, <i>We Are KING</i> is seamless: It properly showcases the group's breezy aesthetic and has the feel-good creativity of black music's great luminaries. Sure it took some time to get here, but unhurried art has its own special rewards. <i>We Are KING</i> has long-lasting impact, much like the music it emulates.</p></div>"|21469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21469-we-are-king/|7.8|Marcus J.

Besides, i</span></span>t’s an insular world, built on obsessive minutiae and indecipherable jokes, and is usually defined by a focus on lyrics over song structure. If you have ever cared about underground rap, you have not only thrown the word ""lyricism"" around with abandon, you’ve also debated what it really means for 27 years of your life, even if you are only 16. It’s a commitment so heavy that it transcends space and time.</p>
<p>In recent years, though, that’s changed. Thank <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>. Or thank <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>. Or the new generation of ears trained on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF DOOM</a>'s every move. Let’s thank <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>, too, while we’re at it. The perma-stoned Oxnard producer has been tirelessly working with obscure samples for years, pushing them away from their source material so they take on strange new lives. He’s been a guiding light for a whole new wave of rappers and producers, directly and indirectly helping them shake off the arbitrary rules of a genre that thrives on breaking them.</p>
<p>Enter Chester Watson, a Florida teenager who sits so comfortably and skillfully amongst his influences that he already feels like their peer. His latest release, <i>Past Cloaks, </i>from a new label called POW Records—a project of Pitchfork contributor Jeff Weiss—is an actual cassette, which means that the more you play it, the more it’ll degrade, before eventually breaking down entirely.</p>
<p>But you’ll probably stream this somewhere—I’m streaming it right now—and the beauty is that you don’t lose much of the crust and murk when you listen to it digitally. That’s largely thanks to the production: a hodgepodge of repurposed beats, some done by Watson himself, and some done by a crew of in-house producers like Psymun, Art Vandelay, DRWN, and a bunch more. They’re all working within similar parameters: cracked psychedelia, off-kilter weirdness, and a dedication to a lifestyle with time built in for Saturday morning cartoons, cereal, and pontificating about the world through blunt smoke.</p>
<p><i>Past Cloaks</i> is, in a way, a very necessary compilation tape. True to underground rap fashion, Watson’s discography is already daunting, but by pulling together material he’s recorded over the past few years—unreleased or otherwise—he’s dialed in on the mythology that he’s been building, focusing it in an unexpectedly breezy 19-track sequence that pulls warbly samples from damaged-beyond-repair records and snatches of TV dialogue, flipping them into compositions that fit together like melted puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>Watson is a formidable rapper, and wastes no time making sure we know that. On opening track ""Phantom,"" his blunted voice bounces like a half-deflated basketball over keys that sound like they’re being played through an inch of dust. He’s a stream of consciousness rapper, letting vivid moments emerge and then quickly disappear. The entire tape feels like a casual studio session, with guests occasionally flitting in and out, and Watson holding court next to a stack of paperbacks, rapping about the virtues of getting stoned and seeing the world in sepia. It’s the kind of unbridled creativity that feels somehow untampered with.</p>
<p>Watson’s still in the early stages of what will hopefully be a long career. Which means that sometimes, like on ""Purple Leaves,"" he sounds so much like Earl Sweatshirt that it’s a little distracting. But he’ll continue to develop, and there’s so much promise and endlessly re-playable material here that even the overly referential stuff is a pleasure to listen to. Besides, Watson could do a lot worse than look to Earl for inspiration—especially when he casually drops lyrical gems like ""sippin' syrup in my room and all my clothes are out."" This is the kind of mundane-yet-telling detail that feels bound to cultivate a loyal fanbase.</p>
<p>Speaking of loyal fanbases: There’s another thing you can do with tapes besides listen to them degrade. You can pass them around. Pocket them. Lend them to people. Make dubs of dubs until the original takes on a near-mystical quality. <i>Past Cloaks</i> isn’t perfect enough to be canonized, but it’s strong enough to form a small cult around.</p></div>"|21528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21528-past-cloaks/|7.2|Sam Hockley-Smith

It didn't signal that Smith would follow through on his proposed indictment of guitar-based music’s lack of originality and relevance. It <i>was</i>, however, the most sharply written DIIV song to date, making a promise <i>Is the Is Are</i> actually keeps: While it’s mostly about getting high and it sounds exactly like DIIV, it finds more interesting ways to do both of those things.</p>
<p>Though not the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16075-tago-mago-40th-anniversary-edition"" target=""_blank""><i>Tago Mago</i></a> or <i>Tusk</i>-style double album Smith originally planned, <i>Is the Is Are</i> makes unusual demands for an indie rock record. With each of the five singles in its protracted rollout, DIIV confirmed they were making their proprietary sound deeper and more immersive. The revelation of a 17-song tracklist promised scatter and sprawl, like a hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11887-the-top-the-head-on-the-door-kiss-me-kiss-me-kiss-me-blue-sunshine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition"" target=""_blank"">Disintegration</a>. </i>However, this is more in the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seventeen Seconds</i> to <i>Pornography</i></a>:  gray, gloomy textures, depressive fatalism. And like those records, <i>Is the Is Are</i> doesn’t engage in fantasy or open up new worlds—it builds a nearly impenetrable wall around the self. Call it <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>-pop, dedicated to a gorgeous yet unglamorous portrayal of addiction.</p>
<p>DIIV's signature trick is conflating the treadmill momentum of habit with the false hope for escape, and this was about the only trick they had going on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16749-oshin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Oshin</i></a>. Written and performed entirely by Smith with every instrument mixed evenly, <i>Oshin</i> relied on its cumulative effect, soft-selling its hooks. Whereas <i>Oshin</i> was meditative and static, ""Dopamine"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17876-diiv-under-the-sun/"" target=""_blank"">Under the Sun</a>"" are transportive and intricate, taking mid-song off-ramps to more interesting vistas. Even ""(Fuck)"" serves its purpose as an 17-second cleanse between the record’s murky midsection and its luminous final stretch. Now functioning as a road-tested, democratic band in the studio, every member of DIIV has to assert himself, and the slightest alteration to their usual sound brings out new features—a brief glimmer of piano cuts through an enveloping humidity on ""Healthy Moon"" similar to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>; the jumped-up rhythm of ""Valentine"" is sourced from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a> while retaining DIIV’s clenched-teeth tension; Devin Perez’s melodic basslines function as a lead instrument and allows Smith and Andrew Bailey’s guitars to search out more interesting textures and harmonies.</p>
<p>An hour of this ensures there are times where DIIV threaten to become too in love with their own sound, particularly toward the middle. But beyond lending <i>Is the Is Are</i> a necessary heft to back Smith’s claims, these songs are convincing portrayals of checked-out living. We don’t get to find out much about the Roi and Grant to whom ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17799-diiv-bent-rois-song/"" target=""_blank"">Bent</a>"" and ""Mire"" are dedicated; DIIV’s obsessive tinkering turns everything outside of Smith into a hall of mirrors, false friends and true loves reflecting back on his own struggles. On ""Bent (Roi's Song),"" Smith sighs, ""When it feels right, you just lost the fight,"" a deflated admission of defeat before ""Dopamine"" echoes the same sentiment with a false sense defiance. ""Mire"" repeats ""I was blind but now I see"" as an epiphany, and Smith immediately regrets awareness thereafter by meeting the ""Incarnate Devil.""</p>
<p>You can make legitimate guesses as to whom <i>that</i> song might be dedicated<span>—</span>scene guys in Brooklyn, drugs themselves, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63017-dirty-projectors-amber-coffman-best-coast-and-more-accuse-publicist-of-sexual-misconduct"" target=""_blank"">people once in his inner circle</a>? Smith’s measure of quasi-celebrity might give him unfair advantage over his stylistic peers, but it’s an advantage all the same, so when his conversational lyrics feel insular, we at least know who’s having the conversation. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira"" target=""_blank"">Sky Ferreira</a> contributes lead vocal on the exhaust-huffing ""Blue Boredom,"" deadpanning sing-talk beat poetry that imagines the two as Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore rather than Kurt and Courtney. She’s just as present when DIIV allow themselves fleeting hope on the awestruck ""Under the Sun"" and resignation on the heartbreaking ""Loose Ends""<span>—</span>""Does it feel watered down/ Do you feel older now?"" appears in quotes on the lyrics sheet, implying it’s a talk between people stuck having the same conversation over and over again.</p>
<p>Immediately after ""Loose Ends,"" <i>Is the Is Are</i> goes on the opposite of a victory lap, trudging toward its finish with no hint of optimism. Penultimate track ""Dust"" has been kicking around since 2013, and the lyric ""I’m fucked to die in a world of shit"" immediately jumped out of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51247-watch-diiv-rehearse-new-song-dust-at-their-practice-space/"" target=""_blank"">practice space</a>. I expected it to be a placeholder, a sentiment to be expressed more artfully at a later date<span>—</span>unlike his heroes, Smith doesn't allow for humor or irony. But the line remains on ""Dust"" and introduces a hint of nihilistic sarcasm that, along with its title, evokes an unintentional grunge-era classic: Alice in Chains’ <i>Dirt</i>, the most harrowing document of smack-addled myopia to ever sell five million copies, the scariest aspect of which was its narrator’s utter refusal to acknowledge outside help, let alone seek it. And immediately after ""Dust,"" Smith spends <i>Is the Is Are</i>’s eerie closer warding off interventions with a hopeless mantra: ""It’s no good, it’d be a waste of breath.""</p>
<p>Even if DIIV turns its morose self-indulgence into a virtue, it’s unlikely to change the conversation amongst their detractors: those who see DIIV as an embodiment of everything insular and insufferable about Brooklyn indie rock will probably find that Smith is no more capable of filling his ambitions to be a true generational artist as he is one of his oversized T-shirts. But Smith’s willingness to open himself up to criticism by making statements<span>—</span>fashion, musical, or self-promoting—make discussions of DIIV more divisive <i>and</i> passionate than those surrounding similarly positioned bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs"" target=""_blank"">War on Drugs</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>.</p>
<p>This aspect of DIIV aligns with songs like ""Dopamine,"" ""Dust,"" and ""Waste of Breath,"" ensuring that <i>Is the Is Are</i> hits on a visceral, teenage level similar to that of the Cure or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, bands who were also mercilessly mocked in their day by gatekeepers of cool as both <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/three-pandering-sluts-and-their-music-press-stooge/Content?oid=883689"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">social climbing posers</a> and ""<a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/pornography-19820902"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stuck in the terminal malaise of adolescent existentialism</a>."" It’s the same immediacy that inspires thousands of high schoolers to rock <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11624-unknown-pleasurescloserstill/"" target=""_blank""><i>Unknown Pleasures</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> T-shirts as well, even if they might not understand their cultural impact. But they relate to the disillusion, doubt, and confusion of a compelling, controversial frontperson because those things never go out of style.</p></div>"|21462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21462-is-the-is-are/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Since the Toronto duo Majid Jordan wrote and and co-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15834-drake-hold-on-were-going-home/"" target=""_blank"">Hold On, We're Going Home</a>,"" they've seen every new song and video of theirs given the same treatment as if it were new material from the 6 God himself. The co-sign led to a major-label signing and an eager, supportive audience for their self-titled debut album. But it also means that Majid Jordan are immovably situated in Drake's shadow, and their self-titled debut doesn't really serve to extricate them. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Majid Al Maskati and Jordan Ullman (the group's singer and producer, respectively) aren't run-of-the-mill Drake copycats by any means: They're pop enthusiasts, first and foremost. Witness the synth pads on ""Hold On, We're Coming Home,"" which were cheesy and irresistible enough for us to take Drake's desire for ""hot love and emotion"" seriously. This sense of fun is often missing on their solo material, where they too often experiment with darker, self-consciously deeper sounds that fall flat. 2014's <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-place-like-this-ep/id894246532"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>A Place Like This</i> EP</a> begins at breakneck speed before devolving into easily ignorable background music. <i>Majid Jordan</i>, likewise, mixes brisk pop efforts with moody cuts that blur together. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album begins promisingly with ""Learn from Each Other,"" which is kept afloat by pulsating bass and uptempo drums. Standout single ""Something About You,"" produced with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a> architect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31588-illangelo/"" target=""_blank"">Illangelo</a> (and featuring background vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"" target=""_blank"">Vince Staples</a>' secret weapon <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Snohofficial/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snoh Aalegra</a>), deftly samples Al Maskati's distorted vocals. But for every ""Something About You,"" there seems to be a dud, whether it's ""Pacifico,"" ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/4zAMt7h5oB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King City</a>"" (2016 OVO muzak at its flimsiest), or ""Shake Shake Shake"" (a ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/yRYFKcMa_Ek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maneater</a>"" update). ""Day and Night"" sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> castoff.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And so the question remains: Why bother with Majid Jordan? They are occasionally brilliant—""Something About You,"" ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/oRVFM6dNylw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Every Step Every Way</a>,"" ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/eqJ-Shv3kEw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Love</a>,"" ""Small Talk,"" and ""Warm"" could make for a tremendous EP—and a full-blown pure pop LP would be welcome. Unfortunately, the duo's apparent ambitions to be something <i>more</i> hold it back from reaching serotonin-peaking heights (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"" target=""_blank"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/"" target=""_blank"">E•MO•TION</a></i>). Drake may have propelled Majid Al Maskati and Jordan Ullman to heights they may have otherwise never achieved. His specter, however, keeps them grounded.</p></div>"|21506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21506-majid-jordan/|6.8|Matthew Strauss

Listening to them reconfigure tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Shop Boys</a>—and somehow making an overly covered song like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Leonard Cohen</a>'s ""Suzanne"" sound weirdly alien—only proved how much Field Music operate on their own strange frequency. At their best, the experience of listening to Field Music is akin to moving into a beautifully designed house in which there are no right angles—everything just slightly and perfectly <i>off</i>.</p>
<p>Alternately slick and herky jerky in its delivery, <i>Commontime, </i>the band's sixth full-length<i>, </i>plays like post-punk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"" target=""_blank"">Steely Dan</a>—jazzy, elegant, and ultimately satisfying, but not always in the ways you expect or necessarily want. It opens with ""The Noisy Days Are Over""—a slyly funky missive that both acknowledges and rejects the pains of growing older. ""The noisy days are over/ And here we are instead,"" harmonize the brothers. ""Why don't you go to bed like everybody else? Why don't you grow old like everybody else?"" It's hard to know to whom exactly the two are singing—or if the song is somehow self-directed—but it introduces a sentiment that flourishes throughout <i>Commontime</i>. The album's 14 tracks function like bits of shared conversation, the brothers' interweaving voices shedding some of the obtuseness of earlier releases in favor of songs that openly address the perils of the everyday—the often mundane nature of relationships, the gravitational pull of childhood memories, and accepting one's own shortcomings.</p>
<p><i>Commontime</i> is brimming with ideas, splitting the difference between the artful leanings of 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13917-measure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Measure </i></a>and the more conventional post-punk pop immediacy of their 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3344-field-music/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a>. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17912-field-music-disappointed/"" target=""_blank"">Disappointed</a>"" ranks among the catchiest and most jubilant pop songs the band has ever recorded, even if the track itself is about managing one's expectations: ""If you want this to be more/ Then you've got to let me know/ But if you want me to be right every time/ You're gonna be disappointed."" The best songs here—""Don't You Know What's Wrong?,"" ""The Morning Is Waiting,"" ""How Should I Know If You've Changed?""—are both clever and refreshingly earnest, unafraid of shedding some of the band's now trademark ambiguity in favor of relatable feelings. It's surely not a coincidence that one of the record's best songs includes the lyric, ""This is as close to perfect as we were wishing for.""</p>
<p>Even though it is generously filled with orchestral flourishes and a kaleidoscope of synths and nimble guitar lines, <i>Commontime</i> rarely feels overstuffed or, as was often the case on previous Field Music releases, busy to the point of sounding incoherent. Instead, the album balances the Brewis brothers' predilection for unusual song structures and unconventional instrumentation with a decidedly grown up narrative. It's a kind of album-length conversation best summed up in the record's final track, ""Stay Awake,"" which could appropriately read like a dialogue between the band and their listeners, a lover, or maybe even with each other--""I might seem a little reticent / Sometimes I can be miles away, days away / And I'm sorry if I'm ever short with you / I don't mean it / It's a good job that you know me so well.""</p></div>"|21483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21483-commontime/|7.8|T.

After a string of splits and EPs, Black Tusk were hard at work on their first full-length in five years, the follow-up to 2011’s roiling <i>Set the Dial. </i>One November evening, the bassist and vocalist Jonathan Athon decided to take a break from recording and take his Harley through the cypress-lined streets of his native Savannah with his girlfriend Emily.</p>
<p>A driver ran through a stop sign and into his motorcycle, critically injuring both riders. While Emily recovered, Athon incurred irreparable brain damage, requiring an induced coma. You can't take positives from a tragic situation like this, but Athon died upholding the ideals that made the sludge metal band he co-founded so great: careful risk-taking, hometown pride, unconditional (if unconventional) love, and most importantly, a bullheaded devotion to living life as if it could end in an instant.</p>
<p>When a key member of an active band dies, the entire venture incurs trauma, often accompanied by creative moratoriums and existential crises. This is especially true for Black Tusk, a trio of lifelong friends who have distributed the musical weight equally and distinctly among themselves from the get-go: guitarist Andrew Fidler and drummer James May are the scathing screamer and middle-range complement, respectively, to Athon’s mucky growls, and their tripartite howls instantly set them apart from their peers. It would have been understandable if they'd followed the lead of their idols <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"" target=""_blank"">Motörhead</a> and laid down their instruments, to have resigned out of respect. But Athon’s tracks were completed before his death, enabling his bandmates to finish the record and tour behind it (Corey Barhorst, of Niche and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a>, will take Athon’s place on the road). <i>Pillars of Ash</i>, then, should be considered Black Tusk’s latest album first, tribute second: this is not a somber funeral, but a joyous wake, not to mention the band’s strongest album yet.</p>
<p><i>Pillars of Ash </i>doesn’t alter the formula of the past two albums, but rather accentuates them with doubled-up aggression; slip on a pair of headphones for the album’s 35-minute duration, and your ears’ll be ringing for an equally long period of time. With a fellow sludge-punk—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31196-toxic-holocaust/"" target=""_blank"">Toxic Holocaust</a> frontman Joel Grind—behind the boards, Black Tusk’s sound is in the hands of a talented technical wizard, and his mix ramps up the volume without obscuring the churning melodic backend, or the high-low contrasts of Fidler and Athon’s vocals, which take center stage on tracks like ""God’s on Vacation"" and ""Still Not Well.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, source material is everything, and Black Tusk’s refusal to repeat themselves makes for a dynamic, diverse listen: a welcome respite from the paint-by-numbers paradigms that often dominate the modern inclination of the ""swamp metal"" the group helped pioneer alongside fellow Savannah natives Kylesa and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a>. Despite the after-the-fact uneasiness of ""Walk Among the Sky""—a barnstormer that reimagines death as a chance to take a transcendent stroll, rather than a six-feet-under slumber—the track sprints circles around the reaper, its rapid-fire key-changes and frequent, furious digressions never letting up. At the same time, ""Desolation of Endless Times"" and ""Punkout"" honor the group’s punkish roots, making ample use of Fidler's yelps and Athon and May’s pogoing percussion. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The band may toss an occasional nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"" target=""_blank"">Slayer</a> (""Born of Strife"") and Motörhead (""Bleed on Your Knees""), but there's no cribbing of influences here. Rather, Black Tusk's combination of sludge, rock, hardcore, and death metal remains fluid, fertile, and most importantly, full of life, in spite of the tragedy that threatens to define it. Far from funereal, <i>Pillars of Ash </i>has plenty of love for good ol' heavy-metal melodies: ""Black Tide"" packs in all the sugary stomp we’ve come to expect from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a>, while the Athon-dominated ""Desolation of Endless Times"" (particularly its intro) could soundtrack an MMA highlight reel. With Athon’s passing, this LP may mark the end of the Black Tusk we fell in love with—but it’s the highlight of the band’s catalog, and the best tribute they could have imagined. There’s no telling what the future will hold for Fidler, May, and Barhorst as they soldier on without their friend and anchor, but judging from the sound of <i>Pillars of Ash</i>, their spirits are far from crushed. And Athon’s? Well, he’ll live forever, with every press of the play button.</p></div>"|21498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21498-pillars-of-ash/|8.2|Zoe Camp

This may sound like the sort of high-concept postmodern hook that only a brainiac seeking to liberate dance music from the oppression of the dance floor would employ. But<i> Jream House</i> doesn't sound like that at all; it turns out to be a euphoric trip that doesn’t shy away from more direct types of gratification.</p>
<p>The name of the opener, ""Durutti Gottsching,"" suggests that the beat was possibly generated from the names of the British post-punk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"" target=""_blank"">Ash Ra Tempel</a> leader Manuel Göttsching. It follows the conventions of Detroit techno, down to the cavernous reverb on the handclaps, except for the way that the hi hat, synthesizer arpeggios, and bassline abandon its straight 4/4 time signature in favor of interlocking complex rhythms. This might sound overcomplicated, but it's kept grounded by an extremely funky bassline—a busy, warm-toned lead that nods at the more organic-sounding end of the krautrock spectrum.</p>
<p><i>J</i><i>ream House</i> shifts from ""Durutti Gottsching""’s jubilant funk to the otherworldly house of ""Arthur Russel"" (another track that does justice to its namesake), to the densely composed, deeply blissed-out flurry of noise on ""The Order of Things,"" a track that might make you wonder why ""Balearic shoegaze"" isn’t a genre already. ""Grace"" uses cascading, jazzlike breakbeats to ride ""The Order of Things""’s energy close to the edge of sensory overload. </p>
<p>After that cacophonous peak, Hurst lets the album drift gently back to Earth, through clouds of Balearic mood. (""Slow Channel"" sounds like it was made to watch the sun rise to, with waves of atonal metallic sound washing over it.) By the time ""Am Me Evol Eye"" drifts off into ambience, the album’s energy has returned to the same near-resting state that the intro to ""Durutti Gottsching"" opens it with, giving<i> Jream House</i> an elegant overall symmetry, not to mention a subtle but powerful hypnotic effect. For someone so interested in playing conceptual name games, Hurst’s choice of pseudonyms, like the most gratifying aspects of <i>Jream House</i>, is surprisingly straightforward.</p></div>"|21519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21519-jream-house/|6.7|Miles Raymer

<p dir=""ltr"">Yet somehow, those hijinks don’t lessen her seriousness; they merely amplify it. Rihanna’s sureness regarding her presence in the world—in the work that she’s made, in the ways in which she has earned the right to palm a cocktail and chill on a beach—is bold and motivating, like Actual Confidence always is. Hearing her deliver a line like ""Don’t act like you forgot/ I call the shot-shot-shots"" (from 2015’s ""<a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/rihanna/bitch-better-have-my-money-(explicit)/QM5FT1590005"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bitch Better Have My Money</a>"") with a kind of preternatural calm—it’s hard to imagine anything ever feeling better than that. It is hard to imagine anyone inhabiting a pop career with more ease or aplomb.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, <i>ANTI—</i>her very-long-awaited eighth LP—arrived tentatively, almost meekly. The build-up, of course, was extraordinary. There’d been rascally fake-outs, three singles (none of which made it onto the actual album), whole social media accounts teasing its release. Then, last Wednesday afternoon, a track listing appeared (that a gang of disembodied song titles still constitutes a noteworthy breach surely indicates something about our desperate times), followed by the announcement that <i>ANTI</i> would be streaming exclusively on Tidal for its first week of release (who cares)—two meager dribbles of intel that were quickly overshadowed, perhaps rightly, by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63189-kanye-west-viciously-attacks-wiz-khalifa-in-incredible-twitter-rant/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West hollering about pants</a>.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the album appeared in full. Anyone hoping its delayed release might suggest something about its ambition, that the three-years-in-the-making <i>ANTI</i> might be Rihanna’s opus, a grand declaration of intent, is likely to be underwhelmed. <i>ANTI</i> is a rich and conflicted pop record, at its most interesting when it’s at its most idiosyncratic. It’s not crammed with bloodthirsty, dance-oriented jams and feels distinctly smaller, more inward-facing than her previous records, as if it were intended as a kind of spiritual stock-taking, a moment of reckoning for both Rihanna and her fans. Her grainy, mesmerizing voice is paramount here, the sun in <i>ANTI</i>’s universe, the thing everything else orbits: ""I got to do things my own way, darling,"" she announces over a stuttering, distorted beat in opener ""Consideration,"" a prickly collaboration with the R&amp;B singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31140-sza/"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>. The sentiment feels deliberately placed, meant as a way to read everything that follows.</p>
<p>Ironically, if the album has a narrative arc buried underneath the fuck-off, broad-strokes empowerment now so omnipresent on pop radio, it’s about disappointment: The ways in which the people you trust can still come up short in the end, and how catastrophically lonesome that can feel. It’s also about self-isolation, and how being good at being on your own (""I can be a lone wolf,"" she sings on ""Desperado,"" her vocals deep, crackly) can become its own kind of albatross, a cage that bars from the inside.</p>
<p>The dancehall and dub-indebted single ""Work"" hints at an intimacy in what is otherwise a fairly transactional Rihanna single: Drake is here, sounding weirdly buttoned-up and too articulate, like a grown man wandering onto the beach in a pair of ill-fitting jeans. The hook is Rihanna babbling about getting it done—""work-work-work-work-work-work""—her vocals devolving into something more instinctive than language, as if it gushed forth from some underground spring instead of her throat. But the words suggest that another Rihanna, a more wounded and wary version, is hovering nearby.</p>
<p>Do we need access to that girl? Maybe not—there’s plenty here that feels high-stakes and revealing. Rihanna talks more convincingly about sex than almost any other pop star, and some of <i>ANTI</i>’s most striking tracks are also its nastiest: ""Love on the Brain"" is a retro-leaning doo-wop jam with a crew of backing vocalists that takes an unexpected turn toward the dark: ""It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good,"" Rihanna chants, her voice suddenly flinty. Her deployment of ""it"" feels deliberate, painting her partner as a disembodied force, less a person than a ghost she can’t escape.</p>
<p>""Yeah, I Said It,"" co-written and co-produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>, is a crawling, steamy ode to two people slamming up against a wall (literally): ""Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it/ I want you to homicide it,"" Rihanna purrs over a sparse, hazy beat. ""Never Ending,"" which nicks a vocal melody from Dido’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TO48Cnl66w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thank You</a>,"" is a gooey, vulnerable dirge that reiterates how Rihanna experiences love, how it helps her navigate and recognize her physical self, the way she feels its absence physically: ""I knew your face once, but now it’s unclear,"" she sings. ""And I can’t feel my body now.""</p>
<p>But it’s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17947-rihanna-higher/"" target=""_blank"">Higher</a>,"" the record’s penultimate track—it really should be its coda—a two-minute imploration to a distant lover, asking him to just come over, already, that feels the most revelatory. The track was co-written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33317-bibi-bourelly/"" target=""_blank"">Bibi Bourelly</a>, the 20-year-old electropop artist from Berlin who also wrote ""Bitch Better Have My Money."" ""This whiskey got me feelin’ pretty, so pardon if I’m impolite,"" Rihanna sings, her voice raked, raspy, desperate over collapsing strings. Whatever had been holding her together until then—it broke. ""I wanna go back to the old way,"" she admits. ""But I’m drunk and still with a full ashtray, with a little bit too much to say."" And then, as if it had never happened—as if she deleted the text, pulled the blankets up and went to sleep—the song ends, unresolved.</p>

She, too, is an inarguable pioneer of what has become Americana, with her sophisticated songwriting bound to composite foundations of blues and honky-tonk, gospel and soul, folk and rock since the start of her career nearly 40 years ago. But the single unifying thread for Williams’ very circuitous career might be her own resilience.</p>
<p>Indeed, Williams’ doggedness pushed her from a blues-and-country cover artist in the '70s to an aspiring songwriter with a string of broken record deals in the '80s to, in the '90s, a 45-year-old singer who suddenly began to win Grammys,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mlp7N3t1fs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> appear on ""Saturday Night Live,""</a> and be mentioned alongside forebears and contemporaries named Dylan, Young, and Springsteen. Several years ago, the dissolution of her longtime home, Lost Highway Records, empowered Williams to launch her own imprint and audaciously issue consecutive double-albums. As if to spite an industry with which she’s forever wrestled, 2014’s <i>Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</i> and the new <i>The Ghosts of Highway 20</i> rank among the best works of her career.</p>
<p>Williams recorded much of the material on <i>The Ghosts of Highway 20</i> during the same prolific sessions and with the same sterling band that yielded the 20-track <i>Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</i>. Surrounded by understated guitar god Bill Frisell, pedal steel master Greg Leisz, and a rotating rhythm section, Williams focuses largely on the nuances of her singing. She aces the challenge, switching between roles with the precision and skill of a method actor. During the soft and sweet ""Place in My Heart,"" where she offers a friend consolation even when it’s a burden to bear, she conjures Patsy Cline, had the country singer survived past the age of 30. But for ""Dust,"" her second update of a poem written by her father, Williams’ voice indicts someone she’s grown tired of tending to. ""Even your thoughts are dust,"" she seethes in the refrain, extending the simple syllables until her voice collapses in exasperation. Still, she seems to smile and wink her way through ""Can’t Close the Door on Love,"" the sharpest ode to romantic devotion she’s ever made.</p>
<p>As she did on <i>Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</i>, Williams plays stylistic hopscotch here, jumping between brooding rock and bouncing gospel, swaying balladry and drifting folk. But these 14 songs hold together as a set because they offer a dozen different perspectives on perseverance. She’s an honest survivor, as capable of empathizing with friends tempted by the dark side of the partying life (the slinky ""I Know All About It"") as she is condemning her own miseries and shortcomings (the flinty ""If My Love Could Kill""). During ""Bitter Memory,"" a spirited throwback to the acoustic barnstormers of her youth, she shouts down nostalgia completely, her voice cracking as she demands that the past just let her be.</p>
<p>Even death seems incapable of daunting Williams: At one point, she smirks at suicide, subverting a gospel-blues mold to dare heaven to try and take her. And both ""Death Came,"" a stunning reflection on mortality that rivals some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a>’s best work, and ""If There’s a Heaven"" wrestle with the itinerant loneliness of those who outlast the ones they love. She’s not scared of death; she’s scared of more misery. ""I’ve seen the face of hell/ I know the place pretty damn well,"" she sings, delivering the words with conversational conviction. ""But when you go, will you let me know if there’s a heaven out there?""</p>
<p>In the past, Williams aspired to make a double album, but she says now that record label executives typically dissuaded her, citing sales figures and shortened attention spans. Now that she’s issued two of them in less than two years, it’s clear that she can manage such long stretches just fine; even listening to the 34 songs of <i>Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</i> and <i>The Ghosts of Highway 20</i> in sequence feels less like a chore than a long trip led by an expert navigator with good stories to share. (She and the boys do settle into the occasional rut, so there are five or so tracks that do feel redundant.) By and large, though, the ups and downs, successes and failures, loves and losses of Williams’ six decades have allowed her to embody and express a range of characters with candor, honesty, and faithfulness. She’s a singing testament to sticking around and, at 63, she is more versatile than she’s ever been. </p></div>"|21472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21472-the-ghosts-of-highway-20/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

He’s largely kept that promise. Though bred in New York’s '90s spoken-word scene, and prone early on to shouting his verse in a declamatory speech rendered like cipher freestyle, he quickly transitioned into a career that resists easy categorization. His underrated 2001 debut, <i>Amethyst Rock Star</i>, summoned the ghosts of the Black Rock Coalition and Living Colour; his incendiary 2007 collaboration with Trent Reznor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10885-the-inevitable-rise-and-liberation-of-niggytardust/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</i></a>, spun from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"" target=""_blank"">Public Enemy</a>-inspired industrial hip-hop to a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>’s ""Sunday Bloody Sunday.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, Williams remains a poet at heart. He wraps his recordings in metaphorical language and allusions to themes both subtle and pronounced. He’s a good songwriter—his Nike-approved 2004 single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDMtaIcrfQ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">List of Demands (Reparations)</a>"" proves that—who sometimes gets lost in the clutter of his ideas. That was the problem with 2011’s<i> Volcanic Sunlight</i>, a thrilling yet enervating work that patched together a post-disco ditty (""Dance"") with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"" target=""_blank"">Janelle Monáe</a> cameo, a feminist sing-along called ""Girls on Saturn,"" and uneven hip-hop-inflected pop-rock like ""Rocket.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Volcanic Sunlight</i> was primarily produced and mixed by the French producer Renaud Létang, who is known for his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5428-manu-chao/"" target=""_blank"">Manu Chao</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a>, and the new <i>MartyrLoserKing</i> also finds Williams working with one producer, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4147-she-wants-revenge/"" target=""_blank"">She Wants Revenge</a> frontman Justin Warfield, for a meditation on social justice and protest in the Internet Age. But this time, the results are more harmonious. Williams continues to hop across genres as usual, but the album’s tonal qualities remain consistent. ""Horn of the Clock-Bike"" consists of two piano bars looped into a motif. ""Ashes"" filters his voice like an AM radio transmission while the beat quickens into a bass-y techno thump. On ""The Noise Came From Here,"" Warfield underlines a Rwandan Twa melody, ""Bigirimana,"" with synthesizer accompaniment, and Williams portrays the undiminished spirit of his neighborhood despite the ""police, sirens, guns."" ""All Coltrane Solos at Once"" evokes Justin Warfield’s '90s trip-hop tracks like his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28553-bomb-the-bass/"" target=""_blank"">Bomb the Bass</a> number ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trbvx1U6Ry8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bug Powder Dust</a>.""</p>
<p><i>MartyrLoserKing</i> doesn’t necessarily rise or fall on Williams’ ability to clarify his thoughts into a clear, memorable hook. When he simply repeats, ""Fuck you, understand me"" on ""All Coltrane Solos at Once,"" he doesn’t need to say anything else. But it’s noticeable when he drifts amidst the industrial-tinged alt-rock of ""Think Like They Book Say,"" and he has nothing but an enthusiastic shout of the title to anchor him. Throughout the album, he offers some wonderful turns of phrase, like when he sings on ""Burundi,"" ""Nike swoosh on bare feet/ Whitney Houston’s crack pipe/ The greatest love of all/ Watch me rise to watch me fall."" He evokes an image of poverty-stricken neighborhoods before settling on a somewhat tired metaphor of ""hacking"" into and disrupting societal disparities as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28034-warpaint/"" target=""_blank"">Warpaint</a> vocalist Emily Kokal accompanies him.</p>
<p><i>MartyrLoserKing</i> may be a call to 21st-century activism, but it also seems anachronistic. Williams’ vision of the Internet as a kind of new frontier resembles a scene from <i>The Matrix</i>, and Warfield’s serrated industrialism is pure '90s. We now know that technology enables our capitalist lusts, and our desire to have every ethnic and gender variation reflected in our culture is often reduced to a mere call for better customer service. Despite his occasionally dazzling wordplay, Williams doesn’t offer a solution for how we can evolve beyond our own inherent narcissism. He’s too optimistic for that.</p></div>"|21517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21517-martyrloserking/|7.1|Mosi Reeves

Even if you’re only fleetingly familiar with acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"">AlunaGeorge</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28590-quadron/"">Quadron</a>, you probably have a good sense of what to expect from this kind of singer/producer pairing: posh, slightly left-field R&amp;B with one foot in the past and the other in future. And sure enough, that’s more or less what Lion Babe deliver—except that compared to their similarly styled peers, their sound isn’t actually all that left-field at all.<br/> <br/> On their debut album <i>Begin</i>, singer Jillian Hervey (the daughter of actress Vanessa Williams) and producer Lucas Goodman (who records under the deceptively Def Jux-y sounding <i>nom de plume</i> Astro Raw) shuffle between disco, house, and neo-soul. And while they update these styles with the airy, wide-open production aesthetic of modern alternative R&amp;B, their songs are rooted squarely in pop. There are no experimental digressions that might alienate the dance floor, no nods to the salad days of <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> or <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2521"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ice Cream Records</a> simply for the sake of bolstering the duo’s music-nerd cred. Lion Babe aren’t after cred. They’re after hits. <br/> <br/> So far they don’t have those hits, of course, but they’ve come up with enough passable facsimiles to fill a pretty likeable album. ""Wonder Woman,"" an anti-cat calling song produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a> (his atonement, perhaps, for ""<a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/robin-thicke/blurred-lines-(unrated-version)/USUV71300526"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blurred Lines</a>""?), doesn’t ping the brain’s pleasure centers like his top-shelf work, but it’s pleasantly slinky, a nice throwback to the snappy R&amp;B tracks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">the Neptunes</a> used to pump out in the mid-'00s. ""Jump Hi""'s kinetic funk loop makes up for a lazy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Childish Gambino</a> guest verse, pasted onto the track like a placeholder for a better substitute the label never delivered. Opener ""Whole"" doubles down on the funk, with a jabbing groove that feels like a 2016 update of Nikka Costa’s forgotten hit ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm_pTkWH4ZQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like a Feather</a>."" There’s no rigid vision tying together this grab bag. Lion Babe are open to any style that might lend itself to a personable, three-minute song, and that flexibility generally works for them.<br/> <br/> In some ways it’s refreshing to see that, after a half-decade of aggressive experimentation, sometimes seemingly for the sake of experimentation, alternative R&amp;B is returning to the basics. Why take R&amp;B to strange new places, Lion Babe seem to be saying, when it’s already in a good place to begin with? That conservatism might be a little easier to appreciate, though, if Hervey’s voice wasn’t a near dead-ringer for one of R&amp;B’s great risk takers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a>. There’s no mistaking the similarities: the jazzy flutter, the way her voice glides under words then curls around them to pull them closer. It’s as if Hervey prepped for each session by listening to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqN0jsSeqPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bag Lady</a>"" on loop, and that resemblance can work against her. It’s a constant reminder of just how safe Lion Babe play it, as well as the shortcuts they take. Where Badu cultivated a voice that’s distinctly her own, Hervey is content to simply borrow somebody else’s.</p></div>"|21459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21459-begin/|6.2|Evan Rytlewski

That's all well and fine, except the album was made in 1981. It's a playful admission that what African Head Charge was doing to dub, post-punk, Afrobeat, industrial, and world music might make more sense 10 years down the road.</p>
<p>It's now 35 years later and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/"" target=""_blank"">Adrian Sherwood</a>'s deconstruction of the music of Africa, Jamaica, and Great Britain might have finally found its proper decade and century. With pop stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> grabbing at Brazilian baile funk; dubstep practitioners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22892-mala/"" target=""_blank"">Mala</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5922-pinch/"" target=""_blank"">Pinch</a> favoring tracks that sound like pulled taffy; and the spare electronic contortions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"" target=""_blank"">Arca</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, and the <a href=""http://fadetomind.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fade to Mind</a> crew, Sherwood’s tracks are more relevant than ever. Last year, his <a href=""http://on-usound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On-U Sound</a> imprint revived itself and began reissuing a wealth of material, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20535-sherwood-at-the-controls-vol-1-1979-1984/"">a survey of Sherwood's decades of dub-punk productions</a> to the dizzying Trevor Jackson-curated <i>Science Fiction Dancehall Classics</i> comp. The music could have dated from 2015, no problem.</p>
<p>Now comes the reissuing of the first four albums of his most heady and vital project, AHC. Taking issue with (or maybe just the piss out of) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Eno</a>-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">Byrne</a>'s fake ethnography <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i></a>, Sherwood created a studio entity along the lines of Eno’s oft-used quote for a ""vision of a psychedelic Africa."" In much the same manner that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"" target=""_blank"">Fela</a>'s greatest bands had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"" target=""_blank"">Tony Allen</a> set as the heart, AHC's pulse comes from African percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah, Sherwood’s co-conspirator throughout AHC. And titling their debut album <i>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</i> was no euphemism, as Berry Street Studios, the space that Sherwood utilized for his early work, was below street level.</p>
<p>Sherwood's work in UK punk and Jamaican expat dub is crucial to understanding post-punk of that era (around this same time, he produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a> and many others), and he was at his finest in African Head Charge. The first album is by far the most experimental of the bunch. Take ""Elastic Dance,"" the opening track on <i>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</i>. A jaw harp twangs and flanges, a sinewave wheezes up and down, a skittering and skeletal drum and bass pattern emerge. And then all of it gets bandied about the stereo field by Sherwood. Always stretching his components to the breaking point and finding rubbery new spaces between these elements, Sherwood used dub techniques to explore the outer regions of punk, reggae, Indian classical, belly dancer motifs, and more.</p>
<p>And once you're this far beyond a certain genre's gravitational pull, Sherwood realized that these disparate forms could be melted back together into fucked-up shapes. Years later, ""Far Away Chant,"" featuring the vocals of thunder-throated Prince Far I, even appeared during a violent moment in David Lynch’s <i>Wild at Heart</i>. The emphasis on negative space is such that when <i>Ground</i> standout track ""Stebeni’s Theme"" recently came on my ear buds during rush hour, the introduction of two percussionists on the train blended into that rubbery beat no problem. </p>
<p><i>Environmental Studies</i> appeared the next year and was also recorded underground, yielding a similarly claustrophobic, dank feel. More so than the first album, <i>Studies</i> scans as the nexus between free improvisation and dub reggae, less interested in melodic fragments and more about exploring the dark space between the two musical forms. The rotating assemblage of players included Jamaican session players like saxophonist ""Deadly"" Headley Bennett and drummer Style Scott, who was part of the riddim team that backed everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8438-gregory-isaacs/"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Isaacs</a> to Black Uhuru, but it also made room for members of the Pop Group and Rip Rig + Panic, as well as UK free improviser Steve Beresford. ""Beriberi"" showcases a swinging horn line that’s as close to ska as the virtual group ever got while ""Crocodile Hand Luggage"" pits Bonjo’s nyabinghi drums against the sounds of running water and animal cries.</p>
<p>By the time of <i>Drastic Season</i>, their third album in as many years, Sherwood, Bonjo, and cohorts had moved above ground, setting up at Southern Studios and exploring the digital hardware the studio provided. By then, Sherwood had moved beyond the dub template and began to mince the sounds into ever-smaller pieces. The croak of an actual fish becomes the central element of ""I Want Water,"" as Sherwood drowns it in all sorts of severe, whiplashing effects. Even the smallest of musical gestures, such as the short bass figures and drum taps of ""African Hedge Hog,"" get amplified until they become labyrinths. At times, the tracks scan more as experiments.</p>
<p><i>Off the Beaten Track</i> struck the perfect balance between the mad professorial experiments of Sherwood and the crack live band that had Bonjo at the helm, but it also marked the end of the group for the next five years. The dub explorations hewed closer to the rhythms now, a sound that would soon be called ""ethno-beat"" and ""tribal."" Didgeridoos and gypsy violins get turned into gnarly buzzes, African chants turn into incants, Prince Far I’s chopped declamation mixes into Bonjo’s big beat drums, and the barking dog of ""Some Bizarre"" is the most psychedelic canine until <a href=""http://sfist.com/2016/01/26/guatemalan_insanity_pepper_vision_quest.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that ‘shroom-chewing coyote</a>.</p>
<p>Without as many heavy FX at Sherwood’s mixing desk (but an uptick of Fairlight and Synclavier noises), the grooves come to the surface.

<p>It's now 35 years later and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/"" target=""_blank"">Adrian Sherwood</a>'s deconstruction of the music of Africa, Jamaica, and Great Britain might have finally found its proper decade and century. With pop stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> grabbing at Brazilian baile funk; dubstep practitioners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22892-mala/"" target=""_blank"">Mala</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5922-pinch/"" target=""_blank"">Pinch</a> favoring tracks that sound like pulled taffy; and the spare electronic contortions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"" target=""_blank"">Arca</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, and the <a href=""http://fadetomind.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fade to Mind</a> crew, Sherwood’s tracks are more relevant than ever. Last year, his <a href=""http://on-usound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On-U Sound</a> imprint revived itself and began reissuing a wealth of material, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20535-sherwood-at-the-controls-vol-1-1979-1984/"">a survey of Sherwood's decades of dub-punk productions</a> to the dizzying Trevor Jackson-curated <i>Science Fiction Dancehall Classics</i> comp. The music could have dated from 2015, no problem.</p>
<p>Now comes the reissuing of the first four albums of his most heady and vital project, AHC. Taking issue with (or maybe just the piss out of) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Eno</a>-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">Byrne</a>'s fake ethnography <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i></a>, Sherwood created a studio entity along the lines of Eno’s oft-used quote for a ""vision of a psychedelic Africa."" In much the same manner that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"" target=""_blank"">Fela</a>'s greatest bands had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"" target=""_blank"">Tony Allen</a> set as the heart, AHC's pulse comes from African percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah, Sherwood’s co-conspirator throughout AHC. And titling their debut album <i>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</i> was no euphemism, as Berry Street Studios, the space that Sherwood utilized for his early work, was below street level.</p>
<p>Sherwood's work in UK punk and Jamaican expat dub is crucial to understanding post-punk of that era (around this same time, he produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a> and many others), and he was at his finest in African Head Charge. The first album is by far the most experimental of the bunch. Take ""Elastic Dance,"" the opening track on <i>My Life in a Hole in the Ground</i>. A jaw harp twangs and flanges, a sinewave wheezes up and down, a skittering and skeletal drum and bass pattern emerge. And then all of it gets bandied about the stereo field by Sherwood. Always stretching his components to the breaking point and finding rubbery new spaces between these elements, Sherwood used dub techniques to explore the outer regions of punk, reggae, Indian classical, belly dancer motifs, and more.</p>
<p>And once you're this far beyond a certain genre's gravitational pull, Sherwood realized that these disparate forms could be melted back together into fucked-up shapes. Years later, ""Far Away Chant,"" featuring the vocals of thunder-throated Prince Far I, even appeared during a violent moment in David Lynch’s <i>Wild at Heart</i>. The emphasis on negative space is such that when <i>Ground</i> standout track ""Stebeni’s Theme"" recently came on my ear buds during rush hour, the introduction of two percussionists on the train blended into that rubbery beat no problem. </p>
<p><i>Environmental Studies</i> appeared the next year and was also recorded underground, yielding a similarly claustrophobic, dank feel. More so than the first album, <i>Studies</i> scans as the nexus between free improvisation and dub reggae, less interested in melodic fragments and more about exploring the dark space between the two musical forms. The rotating assemblage of players included Jamaican session players like saxophonist ""Deadly"" Headley Bennett and drummer Style Scott, who was part of the riddim team that backed everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8438-gregory-isaacs/"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Isaacs</a> to Black Uhuru, but it also made room for members of the Pop Group and Rip Rig + Panic, as well as UK free improviser Steve Beresford. ""Beriberi"" showcases a swinging horn line that’s as close to ska as the virtual group ever got while ""Crocodile Hand Luggage"" pits Bonjo’s nyabinghi drums against the sounds of running water and animal cries.</p>
<p>By the time of <i>Drastic Season</i>, their third album in as many years, Sherwood, Bonjo, and cohorts had moved above ground, setting up at Southern Studios and exploring the digital hardware the studio provided. By then, Sherwood had moved beyond the dub template and began to mince the sounds into ever-smaller pieces. The croak of an actual fish becomes the central element of ""I Want Water,"" as Sherwood drowns it in all sorts of severe, whiplashing effects. Even the smallest of musical gestures, such as the short bass figures and drum taps of ""African Hedge Hog,"" get amplified until they become labyrinths. At times, the tracks scan more as experiments.</p>
<p><i>Off the Beaten Track</i> struck the perfect balance between the mad professorial experiments of Sherwood and the crack live band that had Bonjo at the helm, but it also marked the end of the group for the next five years. The dub explorations hewed closer to the rhythms now, a sound that would soon be called ""ethno-beat"" and ""tribal."" Didgeridoos and gypsy violins get turned into gnarly buzzes, African chants turn into incants, Prince Far I’s chopped declamation mixes into Bonjo’s big beat drums, and the barking dog of ""Some Bizarre"" is the most psychedelic canine until <a href=""http://sfist.com/2016/01/26/guatemalan_insanity_pepper_vision_quest.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that ‘shroom-chewing coyote</a>.</p>
<p>Without as many heavy FX at Sherwood’s mixing desk (but an uptick of Fairlight and Synclavier noises), the grooves come to the surface.

Since then, their struggle to advance from curiosities to superstars has been threefold: They've had to remind everyone who popularized the flow, prove to naysayers that they're great at rapping, and log follow-up hits to galvanize the listener base at retail.  Subsequent releases tended to succeed at addressing one of these points at the expense of the others: 2014's <i>No Label 2</i> was riddled with scathing rebukes for imitators, while the same year's <i>Rich Nigga Timeline</i> was an excellent display of the trio as pure MCs. Last summer's debut studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20843-yung-rich-nation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yung Rich Nation</i></a> reached for hits and succeeded marginally with ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrI-3vt5VnE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One Time</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g2KKGgK-0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pipe It Up</a>,"" though the commercial success of the album was hampered by its sequencing and a too-abrupt release campaign borne out of an arrest, incarceration, and tour cancellation. For every advance, it seemed, there was misfortune lurking in the distance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Migos' return to the <i>YRN</i> franchise this month might seem like a retrenchment, a rejuvenating dip in familiar waters, but the spirit <i>YRN 2</i> most shares with its predecessor is its foregrounding of fun and chemistry. With little to prove (except a stake in the ownership of the meteorically popular dab dance), the group lets loose a relentless volley of absurdist humor and cartoonishly aggressive threats. <i>YRN 2</i> is an hour of these three bouncing oddball pop culture references off each other, racing breakneck flows through unpredictable turns of phrase.</p>
<p>As such, it's possible that this mixtape makes a better collection of verses than a body of songs. These exercises don't always come affixed to easy hooks or inviting beats. The production comes from frequent Migos collaborators Dun Deal (""Hannah Montana""), Zaytoven (""Versace""), Murda Beatz (""Pipe It Up""), and more, but most of the sounds here revolve around dark, minor key melodies. ""Chances"" and ""Commando"" have a stark, glacial beauty that recalls early-'80s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">Cure</a>. Zaytoven's ""Bars"" beat outfits impish piano with a bassline so deep and flat that half of it sounds like kick drum hits. It suits the trio's lurid plug talk just fine, but doesn't stand to invite anyone in that wasn't already hip to the inner workings of the Migos universe.</p>
<p>That's not a setback so much as a smart read on the group's strengths. While sunnier outings like <i>Back to the Bando</i>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxeSTO4P7YU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Look at My Dab</a>"" and <i>Yung Rich Nation'</i>s ""One Time"" helped increase the group's national profile, these records don't feel as natural on them: The songs from the first <i>YRN</i> tape that hit did so out of sheer force of personality, not calculated pursuit of urban radio. It happened naturally, which is a difficult set of circumstances to recreate. </p>
<p>Like its predecessor, <i>YRN 2</i> is a carefree swing between transgressive tough talk and morning-after reflection, and the extremes have never been more extreme than they are here. Early in the record, ""Plan B"" unveils the group's crass paternity contingency measure: offering sexual partners emergency morning-after contraceptive medication (""I gave my bitch a Plan B cause she was my plan b."") It's a mortifying, too-real glimpse into the logistics of being a nouveau riche party animal in a field where your clout can bend morality to suit your desires and just, honestly, several steps south of fun. On the other end of the tape is the closer ""Chapter 1,"" where the team spells out the specifics of the struggle to make it out of poverty and the precarious business of staying up and out of trouble in gripping detail. It's no coincidence that the latter is perhaps the closest thing <i>YRN 2</i> offers to a surefire hit; two years on from their first nationwide exposure, the Migos continue to shine the brightest when they're not trying too hard.</p></div>"|21480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21480-young-rich-nia-2/|7.4|Craig Jenkins

This kind of development is all over Sunflower Bean’s full-length debut, <i>Human Ceremony</i>. It's most evident in the frenetic variety of the album, as the Brooklyn trio—singer/bassist Julia Cumming, singer/guitarist Nick Kivlen, and drummer Jacob Faber, all in their teens when they recorded it—try on genres throughout 11 tracks.</p>
<p>There are bits of psych, moments of metal, and lots of guitar sounds from an era when major labels threw lots of money at alternative rock. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">The Cure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2564-lush/"" target=""_blank"">Lush</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHsip5xOenQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Sundays</a> are somewhere in their record collection. And you can practically hear the practice space discussion of the band composing the songs: ""Okay, we'll do the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Pumpkins</a> part eight times and then go into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Sabbath</a> part.""</p>
<p>But even if they're doing things that have been done before, it sounds like they're discovering these things for the first time, and that excitement is palpable on <i>Human Ceremony</i>. Sure, the excitement occasionally results in childlike naiveté, but that's also part of the fun. A seasoned songwriter would <i>probably</i> be too self-conscious to title a song ""Space Exploration Disaster,"" and if Sunflower Bean had somebody with a heavier hand advising them, we might not be treated to such a decodable album cover. (Is that a Frida Kahlo button near the Dalí melting clock? What do the 12 clocks even mean? Kivlen's look is totally <a href=""http://www.bobdylan.com/sites/bdylan/files/5701847_147.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bringing It All Back Home</i></a> Dylan!)</p>
<p>The band’s diverse influences sound best when Kivlen's voice serves as a darker echo of Cumming’s angelic optimism, especially in a call and response. But the band's hodgepodge approach doesn't always work. Kivlen occasionally feels out of place adding a second vocal to some of the songs, especially when he's delivering clunky quasi-mystical lyrics like ""in your right hand is the magic potion/ You can drink the elixir now/ Don't forget the notion"" on the title track. The band especially fall flat when they try to do both dreamy and nightmarish within the same song. It just sounds silly when after a few minutes of prettiness during ""Creation Myth"" they delve into one of those aforementioned Sabbath bits. Sunflower Bean rock out and they can also be trusted to handle more fragile material, but it's best to keep these traits separate from song to song. The band may find their identity by mixing these contrasting elements, which, it must be said, is the reason that being a teenager is so interesting. It's the time in your life when mixing it up like this can actually work.</p></div>"|21471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21471-human-ceremony/|6.9|Pat Healy

He's long represented one of the most forbidding corners of the techno scene; just consider the name of his turbulent duo with Regis, British Murder Boys. But even at its most bruising, his music is marked by its formal inventiveness and formidable intelligence. The beats on his late-'90s Tresor trilogy—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20625-basictonalvocabulary-balance-force-form/"" target=""_blank""><i>Basictonalvocabulary</i>, <i>Balance</i>, and <i>Force + Form</i></a>—seem unusually alive, like the shuddering birth pangs of AI; when people talk about electronic music having ""organic"" properties, this is what they mean.</p>
<p>While he once titled a mix CD <i>This Is for You Shits</i>, Child has been dialing down the screwface lately. Recent years have found him trading dungeon pummel for beatless soundscapes: His ambient sets at the Freerotation festival have become legendary for their lysergic drift, and on albums like 2013's <i>The Space Between People and Things</i> and last year's <i>Electronic Recordings from Maui Jungle Vol. 1</i>, both released under his own name, he has turned his hand to experimental electronics—cerebral, austere, and unconnected to anything as carnal or compromised as a dancefloor.</p>
<p>With his new album, <i>From Farthest Known Objects</i>, he wades back into techno's roiled waters. All eight tracks employ four-to-the-floor rhythms, flickering triplets or 16th-note syncopations, and studiously greyscale atmospheres. There are no melodies, just gnarled one- and two-bar loops that wend their way across the tracks' blasted expanse like inchworms through radioactive ash. ""z8_GND_5296"" swings like Kompakt's slinky ""<i>Schaffel</i>"" releases; ""GN-108036"" barrels forward as inexorably as Jeff Mills' most single-minded rollers. (The track titles all reference distant galaxies <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer20111221.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at the dawn of time</a>; Child imagines the tracks themselves as waveform transmissions from these faraway star clusters, which is itself an idea that goes straight to <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Jeff-Mills-Waveform-Transmission-Vol-1/master/5943"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">techno's roots</a>.)</p>
<p>On closer inspection, though, nothing here resembles conventional techno: for one thing, save for the anchoring kicks, where are the drums? This is not your usual percussive array: There are no snares, no hi-hats, no claps, no toms—just knots of metallic whine and white noise. The low tones grumble like weary old men; the high ones scatter like drops of water in an oiled pan. Even the kick drums barely register as such; on the opening ""EGS-zs8-1"" they crumple like paper bags, and on ""BDF-3299"" they might be gargantuan oil drums struck by a felt-tipped mallet.</p>
<p>The more time you spend with the album, the more it begins to feel like a universe of pure texture. But to say that there are no drums is also to acknowledge that there are no ""notes,"" either: Put another way, it's <i>all </i>drums, just not the usual sound sets we've become accustomed to. Despite the softness of their attacks, every element here is essentially percussive in nature, which imbues the music with an unusually primal sensibility: The gnarled ""A1703 zD6,"" with its wooden clunk and spongy texture, suggests early humans thwacking gourds and logs, and it heaves like a rotten tree trunk spitting termites.</p>
<p>One of the things that distinguished <i>Maui Jungle</i> was its sense of discipline: Most of its tracks sounded like they had been made using just one machine or process, and <i>From Farthest Known Objects</i> is no different. Despite its greater density and complexity, it represents the same kind of rigor. I have no idea how Child made the music—he has said only that he explored ""new production techniques using old and unlikely hardware""—but it doesn't sound like the output you'd get from a standard array of gear, with drums and bassline down below, and pads and leads on top. It sounds like one source being spun in nearly infinite ways, like a single electrical signal being channeled down a long, convoluted pipe and emerging like a live wire spitting sparks. It feels elemental, which is appropriate, given the subject matter—like a techno tribute to Carl Sagan's famous maxim: <i>We are made of star stuff.</i></p></div>"|21450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21450-from-farthest-known-objects/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

As a jingle writer, the North Carolina musician set Captain Morgan’s skeezy ""Got a Little Captain in You"" slogan to music, penned tunes for Verizon and GE, and assisted in giving Nelly’s ""Ride Wit Me"" a cereal-themed makeover for a Honey Nut Cheerios commercial (""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt2IoRdesW4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ay, must be the honey!</a>""). For some artists, this advertising work might serve as an interesting bit of trivia—no more relevant to their music than any other day job. But Hughes’ frequently silly <i>Songs in the Key of Animals</i> really does sound like the work of somebody who ghostwrote a jam for a cartoon bee.<br/> <br/> <i>Animals</i> is Hughes’ follow-up to 2008’s <i>A Love Extreme</i>, a double album packed tight with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>-esque party rock, wry AM pop, and piano-based love songs of varying degrees of sincerity. That record was a labor of love, and for those who could get on board with Hughes’ detached sense of humor—a big qualifier, to be sure—it was generous with its charms, proof that beyond his bearded-goofball shtick, this guy could actually write a song. <i>Animals</i> doesn't have nearly so much to prove, and it shows. Hughes wrote the album on the spot in the studio, and he makes no qualms about the fact he’s just fucking around for much of it.<br/> <br/> A parade of animal puns, ""Peacockin' Party"" starts the record with a <i>Midnite Vultures-</i>on-a-budget strut and introduces some of the many giggly backup singers who shadow Hughes throughout the record. ""Why are we here?"" they sing, before answering their own question: ""For a good time."" Especially in its opening stretch, the record is paced like an episode of vintage sketch show ""Laugh-In""—a succession of zany conversational snippets and surrealist injections that often seem to amuse the performers more than the audience. It's fun if you're on its wavelength and obnoxious if you aren't.<br/> <br/> On the electro-pop farce ""Girls Love Shoes,"" Hughes’ chorus of women offer the preface that they aren’t <i>only</i> into shoes—they’re also into boys, yoga, dancing, and the beach—but the track mostly just riffs off its title. And like a lot of Hughes’ songs, it’s hard to pinpoint precisely what the joke <i>is</i>. Is he mocking women for their vanity? Presumably not, because Meshell Ndegeocello is one of the women singing on the track, and that's not something she would get behind. Yet for listeners less privy to Hughes’ intentions, it’s easy to walk away with that impression. In general, the women that populate Hughes’ world aren’t very complicated. ""Sometimes I just want a cupcake,"" one professes on ""Fall Me in Love."" ""I'm always looking for a good time,"" another responds dryly. So, yes, <i>Animals</i> technically passes the Bechdel test—but it takes some shortcuts.<br/><br/>Though the album runs just 41 minutes, Hughes split it into two CDs for its physical release. On its mellower second half, Hughes dials down the funk, reins in his backing singers, and starts crooning in a low, Stephin Merritt register as he turns toward matters of the heart. Even in this less jocular mode, though, the songs feel more like early sketches than finished works. The instrumental ""Song for Nancy"" is six minutes of pleasant piano and not much else, a solid foundation for a track that’s never built on. The old cliché about double albums is that most could be greatly improved if edited down to one disc, but that doesn’t hold true here. <i>Animals</i> is an anomaly: a two-disc set without enough solid material for even a single LP.</p></div>"|21382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21382-songs-in-the-key-of-animals/|4.8|Evan Rytlewski

And who could blame them? After all, the chameleonic outfit are responsible for two of metal’s greatest albums: 1995’s folk-steeped, hellish <i>Bergtatt</i>, and 1997’s <i>Nattens Madrigal: atte hymn til ulven i manden—</i>a searing, lo-fi suite devoted wholly to the mighty <i>Canis lupus</i> (""Sopranos"" fans might recognize its cover art from a poster in Meadow’s room). By the end of the '90s, the band moved on from black metal to albums influenced by Wagner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>, prog futurism, and modern classical, belying their sole stylistic constant: inconsistency. Rygg’s restless, morbid creative spirit has enabled Ulver to expand their dark horizons outward and mine sorrow from any style they choose, teaming up with such disparate collaborators as Mysticum and Norway's Tromsø Chamber Orchestra along the way.</p>
<p>Ulver's 16th album, <i>ATGCKVLSSCAP</i>, provides proof of their initial ferocity, even after countless incarnations. After 2014’s plodding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> collaboration <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18861-sunn-o-ulver-terrestrials/"" target=""_blank""><i>Terrestrials</i></a>, Ulver have sprung back to life with a krautrock-leaning collection derived from several live improvisational pieces the band performed at various shows two years ago. Gone are the classically-inspired arrangements and sound effects resembling dying flies; in their stead stand waterlogged bells, torrential percussion, and frog noises. Spiritual energy abounds; the album’s centerpiece, ""Om Hanumate Namah,"" pays tribute to a powerful Hindu monkey god with a meditative structure that becomes more and more animated with each recitation of its mantra.</p>
<p>With plenty of thrills tucked away inside <i>ATGCKVLSSCAP</i>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>-y first half—""Glammer Hammer""’s cinematic crescendoes and anxious keyboards; the metallic, clanging drums that stamp out ""Moody Stix""; and the rugged psychedelic freak-outs of ""Crogmagnosis,"" to name a few—it’s a shame that the album’s static, drone-intensive second half wipes out the guitars, bass, and drums that made the first six tracks so rich-sounding. ""Desert/Dawn,"" ""D-Day Drone,"" and ""Gold Beach"" make for nice background music, but seem weak and uninspired when compared to the record's energetic upswing.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, Rygg’s taken on a more prominent vocal presence in Ulver, showcased most recently on 2011’s <i>War on the Roses</i>. His impressive bass register and haunting tone work well within the band’s grim palette—and yet, he’s got but two opportunities to show off his pipes on <i>ATGCKVLSSCAP</i>, just as the album nears its conclusion. ""Nowhere (Sweet Sixteen)"" marks the closest the band’s come to pop so far: a seething ballad peppered with spoken-word passages and trembling guitar chords. On the following song, ""Ecclesiastes (A Vernal Catnip),"" Rygg surrounds his tenor with bongos, pianos, and synths, but without a clear structure, the frontman's left to wander about aimlessly. As a result, the late-album arrangement of these two outliers feels unnecessary and out-of-place. Two steps forward, one step back: such is the dance of courting other genres, even if the risks have helped keep Ulver vital.</p></div>"|21456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21456-atgclvlsscap/|6.5|Zoe Camp

By the time ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16920-sia-chandelier/"" target=""_blank"">Chandelier</a>,"" one of the best Top 40 pop ballads of the decade, made her a global superstar, she had already been frontwoman of Australian '90s jazz-fusion band Crisp; vocalist for crossover lounge act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4733-zero-7/"" target=""_blank"">Zero 7</a>; and  a modestly popular solo artist, whose 2006 song ""<a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/sia/breathe-me/GB0700400017"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Breathe Me</a>"" was featured in the finale of the HBO drama ""Six Feet Under."" That's a <i>lot</i>, so when ""Chandelier"" took off, there was an excitement to seeing this relative underdog succeed so wildly in a traditionally sexist and ageist industry, all without bowing to cookie-cutter concepts of what pop stars should be.</p>
<p><i>This Is Acting</i>, the follow-up to this surprise attack on the Billboard charts, can't help but feel like the big-budget sequel to <i>1000 </i><i>Forms of Fear'</i>s sleeper hit. As the much-hyped backstory makes clear, almost every song on the album was written by Sia but rejected by another artist, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>. Most songwriters would perhaps choose <i>not</i> to draw attention to the fact that they've had an album's worth of material passed over by some of pop's biggest names, but to Sia's immense credit,<i> This Is Acting</i> doesn't necessarily sound like a slapdash collection of demos or B-sides. It's a complete piece of work, and one that serves as a commentary on the intersectionality of art and fame by someone who has recently acquired a new level of notoriety. But the sacrifice here is the personal flair that gave her previous album a spark of creativity and set it apart from the songs she had already been writing for other pop stars. In a few short years, Sia has gone from subverting the mainstream to <i>being</i> the mainstream, and in light of that transformation, you'd expect more than a play-by-play recreation of her most recent highlights.</p>
<p>She remains a vocal powerhouse, capable of injecting vitality into even the most formulaic numbers. That aching, slip-sliding, cracked voice reinvogorates the military-drums-and-anthemic-chorus formula on lead single ""Alive,"" and even amidst the record's slow moments, the character of her voice reels you back in: ""Broken Glass"" seems like a typical, by-the-numbers ballad, until not one, but <i>two</i> belted key changes rescue it from blandness. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>-produced ""Reaper"" falls a little flat, missing the punch that its intended artist would have provided (Rihanna, in case you were wondering), but it's balanced by the pseudo-reggae lilt of the charming and pleasant ""Cheap Thrills.""</p>
<p>""Sweet Design,"" however, hints at the epic-banger party record Sia could put out if she so chose. It's an explosion of the playfulness Sia became popular for (sort of a spiritual cousin of ""Buttons"" from 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11158-some-people-have-real-problems/"" target=""_blank""><i>Some People Have Real Problems</i></a>); when she sings ""Word travels fast/ When you've got an ass like mine[...]/ Where the mens at?"" it's strangely hilarious, irreverent, and above all, fresh-sounding, a song that definitely fares better in her hands than anyone else's. As her star continues to rise, hopefully Sia will concentrate on just that: saving the best for herself.</p></div>"|21481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21481-this-is-acting/|6.8|Cameron Cook

After moving to California in the early 1960s and making some interesting records with subpar musicians, Hazlewood scored big in 1966 with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8324-nancy-sinatra/"" target=""_blank"">Nancy Sinatra</a>’s feminist flip of a song he wrote called ""These Boots are Made for Walkin'."" In those days, hit-making songwriters and producers for other artists were rewarded for their hard work by getting to make albums themselves—see Carole King, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, and Hazlewood’s own collaborator Jack Nitzsche. So though Hazlewood was still recording with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Sinatra</a>’s fledgling label Reprise, MGM offered him a deal following the release of ""Boots"" to put out some ""writer’s records"" of his own, even though his previous solo outings had sold next to nothing. Prior to his stint at MGM in 1966 and 1967, his own recordings had been modestly arranged, acoustic-guitar-based recordings in the pop-country vein. The MGM deal gave him the leverage to do something very different, making tracks that sounded as big or even bigger than the hits he’d produced for others.</p>
<p>Though these albums were recorded in the space of less than two years, they sounded very different from each other. <i><b>The Very Special World of Lee Hazlewood</b></i>, one of the most straightforward albums in his career, serves as a primer on his style and showcases all of his contradictory impulses. It’s Hazlewood at his most maximalist, building a wall of sound to rival Phil Spector’s. Most of the tracks on <i>The Very Special World</i> feature full orchestras passing ideas back and forth in flowery counterpoint, choirs instead of backup singers, and contributions from the in-demand studio musicians known as the Wrecking Crew.</p>
<p>Of all the MGM recordings, the songwriting on <i>The Very Special World</i> is by far the most consistent, and features a handful of the most subtle and sensitive songs Hazlewood ever wrote. ""I’m Not the Lovin' Kind"" is a beautiful bossa nova with unusually sensitive singing, a triumphant string and horns call-and-response from arranger Billy Strange that manages to anchor just off the coast of faux-Jobim parody while retaining its humor. ""I Move Around"" is a travelogue Lee would re-record several times later in his career, most notably on his 1972 classic <i>13</i>. Here, in a simple folk arrangement, it explodes into the kind of sweeping, cinematic climax Hazlewood seemed unable to talk himself down from during this time. His vocal performance is controlled and wistful instead of bitter and stoic—as his renditions of so many songs would become when left to his own devices. But the album’s most important contribution to the Hazlewood songbook is the lethargic, lounge ballad ""My Autumn’s Done Come,"" which embodies his ethos as well as any standalone recording ever has.

<p>The kitschy experimentation at the sidelines of <i>The Very Special World </i>comes fully to the fore on its follow-up, 1967’s <i><b>Lee Hazlewoodism: Its Cause and Cure</b></i>, a record that finds Hazlewood backing away from traditional songwriting while still widening his musical palette. The first half of record, featuring a series of character sketches, is one of the weirder sides in a discography chock full of them. Two of its biggest production numbers are tragic narrative recitation songs that are very much products of another time, shaped by particularly elaborate and exotic charts from Strange. ""José,"" the Flamenco-styled story of a poor Mexican boy who develops a life-enveloping passion for bullfighting (""He lived for one thing and nothing more/ He had to be the very best matador"") and ""The Nights,"" steeped in the percussion of Blaine and insistent interjections from a wraithlike studio choir, tells the picaresque story of a white woman who runs off with a Native American who lives a ""hard"" life hunting buffalo in the Dakotas. Despite the dated storytelling, these arrangements are indicative of the almost comically expansive vision Hazlewood and Strange had for these sessions. The ethos is borne out further in the bonus tracks: recordings billed to ""Lee Hazlewood’s Woodchucks"" that read like a bid on the part of Lee and Strange to get their foot in the door in the mood instrumentals market.</p>
<p>Hazlewood productions never got bigger than on the aggressively disparate <i>Hazlewoodism</i>; even the most half-assed of these songs—say ""Suzi Jane Is Back in Town,"" a gag-filled novelty record that would have fit right in on the Dr. Demento show—has five to six Wrecking Crew guitars stacked on it. Though it frequently feels like Hazlewood sent ideas to Strange to be charted before he had more than a sketch, <i>Hazlewoodism</i> nonetheless adds a handful of excellent entries into the Hazlewood canon. The most essential track is its biggest outlier: ""After Six,"" a stripped-down, two-chord showcase for the guitar playing of his frequent collaborator Al Casey that’s also an alcoholic’s rant to the bartender in the vein of the Sinatra (Frank) ""One for My Baby."" It’s Hazlewood’s dry, dark humor and conversational phrasing at its best (""I’ll give you my shoes for a glass of booze/ If you won’t tell that they don’t smell/ No better than I do after six"").</p>
<p>The irreverent small-combo approach showcased on ""After Six"" would be the entire focus of <i><b>Something Special</b></i>, the one Hazlewood MGM album that sounds like a demo, and the most patently uncommercial of the lot. The songs on the miniature record were all done with the same septet: guitars, upright bass, drums, and Hollywood jazzer Don Randi’s invasive hard-bop piano and—yes—throaty scatting. The sessions were done in just two months in 1967 and they had a distinctly live, sloppy sound. Multiple songs have the air of partially-improvised lyrics, the most patent example being ""Stone Cold Blues,"" a five-minute goof which ends up with the verse: ""If Martoni’s is such a good place to eat and drink and be good/ Why do they call the steak Sinatra, and the hamburger Hazlewood?"" The whiskey-soaked atmosphere was indicative of the looser, more sentimental direction Lee was to take on his later records, when he was answering to no one but himself. Songs like ""Fort Worth"" take in a more wistful, sad-sack quality: ""Don’t know if I can forget you/ Don’t know I’m even gonna try/ But you’re gone and I let you/ Guess I’m not much of a guy."" The reissue improves this head-scratcher of an album: Bonus tracks ""Moochie Ladeux"" and the hilarious ""The Lone Ranger Ain’t My Friend"" are among the most carefully wrought and unusual songs on the record.</p>
<p>This group of albums, along with his final Reprise album, 1968’s <i>Love and Other Crimes</i>, would prove to be Hazlewood’s long farewell to the major studio system. He was already making moves to broaden his eccentric empire with his own LHI label. In a way, everything after this was Hazlewood sliding slowly toward the full-on retirement he had been contemplating before ""Boots,"" while making some of the greatest music of his career along the way (see <i>Requiem for an Almost Lady</i> and <i>Cowboy in Sweden</i>).</p>
<p>With music like this, the question always looms: To what extent do we become enamored of it based on its cultural novelty alone? Becoming a diehard Hazlewoodian requires romanticizing this hectic time, when major corporations were gladly funding unabashed insanity in music and film. But Hazlewood’s personality is too overbearing to make this the type of music one loves simply because it was allowed to exist. Whether he’s fulfilling a bar-room, surrealist-Johnny-Cash raconteur role, or embodying the consummate professional and pop craftsman, Lee Hazlewood never sounded like he was posturing or overreaching. The capriciousness of these albums feels like a direct reflection of a split, contradictory consciousness: He was resistant and sometimes openly defamatory toward hippie rock'n'roll, yet always at pains to not fall behind, clad in floral shirts and flamboyant suits.

After moving to California in the early 1960s and making some interesting records with subpar musicians, Hazlewood scored big in 1966 with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8324-nancy-sinatra/"" target=""_blank"">Nancy Sinatra</a>’s feminist flip of a song he wrote called ""These Boots are Made for Walkin'."" In those days, hit-making songwriters and producers for other artists were rewarded for their hard work by getting to make albums themselves—see Carole King, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, and Hazlewood’s own collaborator Jack Nitzsche. So though Hazlewood was still recording with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Sinatra</a>’s fledgling label Reprise, MGM offered him a deal following the release of ""Boots"" to put out some ""writer’s records"" of his own, even though his previous solo outings had sold next to nothing. Prior to his stint at MGM in 1966 and 1967, his own recordings had been modestly arranged, acoustic-guitar-based recordings in the pop-country vein. The MGM deal gave him the leverage to do something very different, making tracks that sounded as big or even bigger than the hits he’d produced for others.</p>
<p>Though these albums were recorded in the space of less than two years, they sounded very different from each other. <i><b>The Very Special World of Lee Hazlewood</b></i>, one of the most straightforward albums in his career, serves as a primer on his style and showcases all of his contradictory impulses. It’s Hazlewood at his most maximalist, building a wall of sound to rival Phil Spector’s. Most of the tracks on <i>The Very Special World</i> feature full orchestras passing ideas back and forth in flowery counterpoint, choirs instead of backup singers, and contributions from the in-demand studio musicians known as the Wrecking Crew.</p>
<p>Of all the MGM recordings, the songwriting on <i>The Very Special World</i> is by far the most consistent, and features a handful of the most subtle and sensitive songs Hazlewood ever wrote. ""I’m Not the Lovin' Kind"" is a beautiful bossa nova with unusually sensitive singing, a triumphant string and horns call-and-response from arranger Billy Strange that manages to anchor just off the coast of faux-Jobim parody while retaining its humor. ""I Move Around"" is a travelogue Lee would re-record several times later in his career, most notably on his 1972 classic <i>13</i>. Here, in a simple folk arrangement, it explodes into the kind of sweeping, cinematic climax Hazlewood seemed unable to talk himself down from during this time. His vocal performance is controlled and wistful instead of bitter and stoic—as his renditions of so many songs would become when left to his own devices. But the album’s most important contribution to the Hazlewood songbook is the lethargic, lounge ballad ""My Autumn’s Done Come,"" which embodies his ethos as well as any standalone recording ever has. With its hypnotic pacing, odd chord changes, and dreamy but crystalline production, it’s easy to see how it would influence <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a>’s Dean Wareham, who sang the song’s particular praises <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/%E2%80%9Csometimes_we_have_to_wait_30_years_to_be_discovered_dean_wareham_interviews_lee_hazlewood_biographer_wyndham_wallace/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a 2015 interview</a>.</p>

The song itself might have been based on the infamous Moors murders of the 1960s, but it also served to cement Morrissey's home city in the cultural imagination. ""Oh, Manchester, so much to answer for"" rang like a bell, forever positioning the Northern city (at least for mopey Anglophiles such as myself) as a place where creative melancholy always wins out—a city in which the industrial gray, bitter cold, and ceaseless rain helped to forever nourish great, hopeless art.</p>
<p>On their 2013 debut, <i>The Shadow of Heaven</i>, Manchester’s MONEY upheld this vision, simultaneously playing up to the city's melancholic legacy while also grandly skewering it. (The record’s release involved billboards emblazoned with the words ""Manchester Is Paradise."") By turns dour and swooningly romantic, self-destructive and charmingly fey, the songs on <i>Heaven</i> were sprawling, guitar-driven affairs that often stretched beyond the five-minute mark and sounded as if they might have been recorded in a candle-lit cave. It was the sound of a band <i>almost </i>living up to the scale of its own grand ambitions.</p>
<p>On their second album, the intensely titled <i>Suicide Songs</i>, MONEY appear to have weathered what must have some harrowing sophomore anxieties. The album opens with ""I Am the Lord""—a nearly seven-minute long opus involving Indian dilruba, hushed gospel singers, and gently-employed shakers that sounds more like <i>Storm in Heaven</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"" target=""_blank"">Verve</a> than the echoey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29071-wu-lyf/"" target=""_blank"">WU LYF</a> squall of their earlier efforts. ""You are not the same as me/ I'm up there in the clouds,"" Jamie Lee sings. ""I am the Lord/ He gave me his eyes to see through."" It’s a suitably epic opening for an album that deals largely in seeking transcendence via self-imposed oblivion. And while another record of young Brits singing songs about despair and getting smashed at the pub isn’t <i>exactly</i> a novel concept, MONEY manage to make the prospect of weathering your own personal apocalypse sound not only beautiful, but transformative.</p>
<p>The cover art of <i>Suicide Songs</i> features a black-and-white photo of Lee with a knife that appears to be balancing on (or slowly burying itself into) his forehead. That image—paired with the record’s oblivion-seeking lyrics—makes for what should be a pretty heavy listen. (""I wanted the album to sound like it was ‘coming from death’ which is where these songs emerged,"" explains Lee in the promo materials). Still, the nine tracks on board never <i>feel </i>oppressive. Even ""Suicide Song,"" the album’s centerpiece (whose chorus is literally, ""This is your suicide song"") is weirdly more merry than maudlin.</p>
<p>It’s to the band’s credit that this despondency feels exploratory—occasionally even celebratory. Lee, along with bandmates Billy Byron and Charlie Cocksedge, emerges with a record that shines light on the crisis of identity that often befalls creative folk during their late twenties (or, occasionally, their thirties or forties)—<i>Who am I? What do I really have to say? And how can I figure it out without somehow destroying myself?</i> It seems grimly fitting that the album ends with a song called ""Cocaine Christmas and an Alcoholic’s New Year,"" which is just as much of a glorious drunken bummer as the title would suggest. Alternately making comparisons to both Marilyn Monroe and Jean Genet, Lee allows a sense of levity to permeate even the messiest of moments: ""I've wasted all my time on cocaine at Christmas and bottles of wine,"" sings Lee, ""And I’m as happy as a child/ Because you don't have to ask me why."" Much like records by the Smiths, <i>Suicide Songs</i> is both consoling and encouraging,<i> </i>revealing itself fully only after repeated listens and paying dividends each time. Manchester should be proud.</p></div>"|21479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21479-suicide-songs/|7.7|T. Cole Rachel

So it stands to reason that Keely releasing his first solo album this far into his career wouldn’t serve the same purpose as most ventures of this sort, i.e., to provide a safe space to play with ideas too indulgent for the main gig. <i>Original Machines</i> does the opposite, a clearinghouse for modest songs nowhere near indulgent <i>enough</i> for Trail of Dead.</p>
<p>At the very least, it confirms the sneaking suspicion that Keely could’ve been a Buzz Bin hitmaker had he been born a decade earlier. He writes zippy melodies perfectly suited for his keening, try-hard voice, one that cuts through any amount of distortion and compression with nasal EQ-ing that can recall either Billy Corgan, Liam Gallagher, or Perry Farrell. The mere hint of bongos throughout the breezy ""Warm Insurrection"" is apparently all it takes for a Keely song to pass as Porno for Pyros.</p>
<p>In addition to the extravagant musical ideas expected of Trail of Dead, <i>Original Machines</i> rids Keely of the necessity to attach high-art pretensions to his lyrics. It’s likely that Keely would consider every Trail of Dead song to be <i>personal</i> to some degree, though the emotions were often filtered through another's perspective, be it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk8g-jFQWvo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maxfield Parrish</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhBm-8hhnXA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a>. Nothing hits as squarely as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/182-worlds-apart/"" target=""_blank""><i>Worlds Apart</i></a>’s overtly autobiographical ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvwkuSE-Ys0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Summer of ‘91</a>,"" though there are allusions to travels through his current home in Cambodia, while ""Warm Insurrection"" and ""In the Words of a Not So Famous Man"" immediately establish Keely’s muse as the process of songwriting itself<span>—</span>this just lets you in on the fact that Keely has been living in Cambodia and writing a bunch of songs, information that requires no familiarity with <i>Original Machines</i> beyond its tracklist.</p>
<p>There’s only so much talk of restraint that can surround a record that also happens to contain 24 tracks. Then again, the longest (and slowest) track is three minutes and 48 seconds and everything careens into each other in a way that reminds you that Keely is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices"" target=""_blank"">Guided by Voices</a> fan<span>—</span>the highlight of otherwise career nadir <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9630-so-divided/"" target=""_blank""><i>So Divided</i></a> was a cover of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zTC94XpfQs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory</a>"" that imagined if Robert Pollard spent his Matador advance money on a string section <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Guided_By_Voices_Alien_Lanes?id=Bpr4w26i7jjukcvunrnxmwt5sqm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rather than beer</a>.</p>
<p>Keely can write songs every bit as punchy and abrupt as GBV, but while the latter’s were frequently, if not always, dashed off, they always sounded <i>done</i>. <i>Original Machines</i> doesn’t necessarily face the presumption that these are meant as demos, yet every aesthetic choice (or limitation) keeps raising the question that otherwise wouldn’t have been asked. Drum machines, keyboards, thumbed bass<span>—</span>just about everything besides Keely’s guitar and vocals<span>—</span>have the eerie inhumanity of synthesized presets, the appearance of placeholders chosen for their immediacy rather than texture. The production as a whole should be familiar to anyone who’s played a demo on a mid-to-high-range home digital recorder, providing a clean, crisp, but flat character that renders an unfortunate double meaning from ""CD Quality.""</p>
<p>There’s not much friction in really any aspect to provide for a spark on <i>Original Machines<span>—</span></i>the forays into trip-hop, psych rock, and folk are far too tentative for a record that has to answer to no one besides its creator and the diehard Keely fan who will pay for it. But what’s truly missing from <i>Original Machines</i> is a sense of stakes; this quality is what distinguishes his best work in Trail of Dead’s as well. <i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i> arrived in the middle of the ironically named New Rock Revolution holding the torch for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1152-drive-like-jehu"">Drive Like Jehu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth"">Sonic Youth</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>, ready to burn down the whole thing down. <i>Worlds Apart</i> was maligned for having its facile, Clear Channel-friendly hooks, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reeIjeqLBqY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">anti-Clear Channel sentiments</a>, and batshit visual ideas coexist in the same space, but its brash self-assurance in the face of astronomical expectations from both the Internet and Interscope was admirable. Since Trail of Dead is still chugging along with a more streamlined approach not all that dissimilar to Keely’s here, what’s at risk? What does he have to prove? The ephemerality of <i>Original Machines</i> assures that Keely never gets bogged down in any bad ideas, but often times, those are his most interesting ideas.</p></div>"|21433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21433-original-machines/|5.7|Ian Cohen

The Suffolk band's anguished romanticism continues to resonate with fans, primarily because it’s packaged in brooding rock tunes just sweet enough to get stuck in your head, but woozy and frequently dissonant enough to avoid sounding overproduced. After a two-year break, they’ve returned even more eager to explore that melodic direction with their third full-length, <i>Promise Everything</i>. It’s less Warped Tour and more KROQ Weenie Roast: the depressive offspring of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2777-mineral/"" target=""_blank"">Mineral</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Eat World</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Andrew Fisher’s fluid baritone is easily Basement’s best instrument. It’s plush on the ears, complementary to the guitars, and distinctive in its quivering tone—but on <i>Promise Everything</i>, it becomes the band’s crutch. The frontman relies on little more than his scratchy melisma to fuel the album, wringing every sustained note he can out of vaguely-worded howlers like ""All I need for flight/ Is feeling from inside"" and ""Tear my heart off my sleeve/ And tell me you believe in me.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">His bandmates don’t help things, churning out garden-variety grunge riffs as if on autopilot (now and again, they’ll toss some atonal notes into the mix, a bit of catnip to distract from the incessant mid-tempo buzz ballads). When the title track’s chorus rolls around —if your eyes haven’t rolled back in your head <i>first</i>, that is—it’s smirk-inducing: ""When I’m high, I’m high/ When I’m low, I’m low."" It’s <i>low </i>all right: no manic energy in sight, a cardinal sin on an album rooted in aggression.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Occasionally, the dull roar manifests in some solid rock songs. Awash in knotted fretwork and lilting melodies, ""Brothers Keeper"" is as good a kick-off–or maybe a kiss-off?–as any, a textured introduction to the album’s acrid ambivalence (epitomized in the chorus' don’t-call-me-I’ll-call-you refrain: ""Feelings come and go/ I will let you know."") The fuzzy torch song ""Aquasun"" delights as well, swathing a vulnerable chorus in bleary, blanketed guitars that recall Disc 2 of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i></a>. Lastly, there's ""Submission,"" the best show of songcraft by far: At last, the band perk up a bit and play with contrast, pitting airy <i>oo-oo-oo</i>s against palm-muted guitars, screams against whispers, lover against lover. But while these standouts quash fears of Basement's creative stasis, they're stilll not enough to give them the gravitas of a great band.  </p></div>"|21489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21489-promise-everything/|5.0|Zoe Camp

Each songwriter commanded his own archetype—back-alley dreamers Pete and Carl, suave epicure Alex Kapranos, misfit idealogue Kele Okereke—and took a unique grab-bag of influences from the British canon<i>. </i>Alex Turner once said he walked ""the lyrical tightrope between Jarvis Cocker and Mike Skinner,"" and while it’s fair to say Okereke, a clumsier wordsmith, is not a lyrical tightrope-walker, he’s a master of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_diving"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shallow dive</a>. His grand proclamations (""I am trying to be heroic/ In an age of modernity,"" began <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9859-a-weekend-in-the-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Weekend in the City</i></a>) scale queasy heights, plummet theatrically, and manage improbable landings.</p>
<p>Bloc Party's<b> </b>last record, 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16944-four/"" target=""_blank""><i>Four</i></a>, was billed as a return to form but lacked the cool menace of the early stuff, which channeled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2660-manic-street-preachers/"" target=""_blank"">Manic Street Preachers</a> as much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silent Alarm</i></a>, their 2005 debut, wasn’t the best UK indie record of its era, but it was one of the savviest, and maybe the angriest. On follow up <i>A Weekend in the City</i>, Okereke wrote boldly about subjects he took seriously—the isolation of modernity, upper-crust London's coke-fueled opulence, the absurdity of MTV, the disappointing political views of teenagers in shopping malls, the selfishness of ex-lovers, and, perhaps underpinning it all, the ""2nd generation blues"" of a black twenty-something living in a city that wanted to destroy him. Despite occasional misfires, Okereke won us over because he embodied a role his contemporaries wouldn’t touch: that of the outsider genius making sense of a corrupt world through music—music he believed, or refused not to believe, would improve it.</p>
<p>Inspired by a Hanif Kureishi talk Okereke saw in London, Bloc Party’s serene fifth LP observes the void of evangelism in present pop culture, and tries to fill it. But the notion that our jaded generation needs nothing more than a dose of devotional art is tired, and while last-ditch religion per se isn’t Okereke’s ticket here, there’s an awkward sense that the 34 year old is clutching at spiritual straws, rather than relating an honest-to-God epiphany.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The good news is that ""The Love Within,"" Bloc Party’s comeback track, an indie disco-pop hybrid that is somehow both garish and bland, is comfortably the worst song on <i>Hymns</i>. A little better is ""So Real,"" which trails a <i>Silent Alarm</i> throwback riff over low-key soul and hangover-soothing deep house; on ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_News_Bible"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Good News</a>,"" a similarly midtempo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a> pastiche, a down-and-out narrator trudges from ""the Gospels of St. John"" to the ""bottom of a shot glass.""</p>
<p>That Okereke writes clunky lines by choice is conceivable, and you see why he might: a ruthless commitment to writing economically; overcompensation for the tryhard smartassery of youth; or a self-fulfilling paranoia that jarring sincerity is Bloc Party’s redeeming gimmick, and fixing the leaky roof would require tearing the whole thing down and starting over. It's more likely, though, that between long band hiatuses and sporadic immersion in DJ culture, the songwriter in Okereke has been displaced by some other existential component. ""These words will fall short/ But I must try,"" he sings earnestly on ""Exes,"" and you scratch your head, wondering if that’s what trying sounds like.</p>
<p>In fairness, that song—borne along by sighing chords and a gospel choir—is enjoyably soothing, a highlight on an album that, ""The Love Within"" aside, hangs together well enough and is never unpleasant. As ever, Okereke’s lyrically inspired moments are not perfect but richly specific and poignant. On ""Living Lux,"" a shattering post-breakup lament, he sings, ""I want to spend my money on you."" It's a nicely judged line, the kind of faintly pathetic confession you'd expect from the vanquished high-roller we met on <i>A Weekend in the City</i>. Sadly, nine years on, that seems to be the only character he can play with conviction.</p></div>"|21384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21384-hymns/|5.0|Jazz Monroe

The trio of frontmen were to be joined by visual artists the Chapman Brothers, two members of the Young British Artists movement, whose job was to translate the music to a visual medium. Seven years of silence later, the Chapmans are out, along with the project's multimedia ambitions. But not this 10-track album; they've kept their word.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Nevermen may only be a trio (and a trio of frontmen, natch) but each member of the group brings an unexpectedly diverse stylistic palette to the record. Adebimpe represents the weird-yet-relatable world of indie rock, while Doseone offers lyrical abstractions like ""barbed wire on pollen"" and ""man hands on fire"" as if they've been on his mind for days. And, of course, there's Patton: As the ringleader of a hard rock band known for genre experiments—not to mention a chronic collaborator who's worked with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6300-norah-jones/"" target=""_blank"">Norah Jones</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"" target=""_blank"">Dan the Automator</a>—there's nothing the chameleonic Patton can't do, and his fingerprints are all over <i>Nevermen</i>: on ""Non Babylon""'s extended, faintly-operatic outtro (a freakout that wouldn't feel out of place on Faith No More's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20339-sol-invictus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sol Invictus</i></a>), on the carnal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10332-slick-rick/"" target=""_blank"">Slick Rick</a>-referencing ""Treat Em Right"" (the chorus? ""Treat 'em like a prostitute"") and all over the mixing boards, which belie Patton's penchant for sinister contrasts (glitzy funk against distorted industrial samples, seas of guitar strata that engulf all rhythm and melody).</p>
<p class=""p1"">Indeed, <i>Nevermen</i>'s a very Patton-y album, coming off alternately as the poppy spiritual descendent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2848-mr-bungle/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Bungle</a>, or, on the weaker tracks, an unfocused, ornery answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4899-peeping-tom/"" target=""_blank"">Peeping Tom</a>—but where Patton yowled all over those releases, he's less of a vocal presence on <i>Nevermen, </i>which gives Adebimpe and Doseone's voices more attention. Rather than encourage his partners' cartoonish mischief, Adebimpe acts as referee, constructing his melodies to act as both common ground and common sense. As with TV on the Radio, his role in Nevermen lays in function rather than finesse, clarity over crescendoes—so it doesn't come as a huge surprise that his humble hooks on tracks like ""Mr. Mistake"" and ""Tough Towns"" rely on chirpy, garden-variety melodies. Were it not for Adebimpe's restrained, ever-so-atonal hook, ""Shellshot"" would collapse under the weight of its own edginess long before the ghastly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6159-linkin-park/"" target=""_blank"">Linkin Park</a> outro; a similarly glam, glib refrain redeems ""Treat Em Right,"" and his adamant ""to the hell <i>NO</i>!"" on ""Dark Ear"" is the closest Nevermen come to a fist-pumping, lighters-up moment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Nobody's accusing the band of being short on ideas—after seven years, they've assembled an extensive playbook indeed—but flitting from one chrome plaything to another gets exhausting quickly, especially when the toys in question are post-grunge, glitchy rap-rock (remember <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLUX0y4EptA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flobots</a>?), and impassable swathes of steel-wool synths. Imagine three demonic, wailing brats yanking you by the wrist through the toy store, straining in every direction to grab every last bauble off the shelves and shove it in your face: That's what listening to <i>Nevermen </i>is like. The album's best songs (""Tough Towns,"" ""Fame II the Wreckoning,"" ""Treat Em Right"") temper the stream-of-consciousness and ramp up the atmosphere instead. When they resist the urge to troll (tell me a sardonic chorus that goes ""Just like a tactical maniac/ I WANNA SHOOT YOUU"" <i>isn't</i> trolling), Nevermen possess a deadly grace befitting Doseone's beloved hydra metaphor; for now, those necks are tangled.</p></div>"|21449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21449-nevermen/|5.8|Zoe Camp

While it's been a number of years since Porter abandoned not only the dancefloor but beats altogether, his music remains loud and visceral, full of seismic sub-bass and metallic shudders and black-hole reverb that swallows up everything around it. It's also head music, with stark post-classical elements—a somber scrap of strings, a mangled choir—hinting at a narrative lurking beneath the abstraction. Since the beginning of his solo career, Porter has nodded toward big themes: The 10 tracks on his 2011 debut, <i>Aftertime</i>, each referenced a different celestial body from Frank Herbert's<i> Dune</i>; his 2013 album <i>Life Cycle of a Massive Star </i>aimed squarely at the sublime, on a truly cosmic scale.</p>
<p>Porter's new album, <i>Third Law</i>, is his headiest yet; it also punches harder than anything he's done, contrasting waves of charred, overdriven texture with high, lonesome tones drifting across inky emptiness. Force and stillness are its twin poles. Its title references Newton's third law of motion (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction), while the cover art pictures the profile of an eyeball in extreme close-up, so close that the play of shadow across its glassy surface looks like the broad sweep of the night sky. Is it a coincidence that the image so closely resembles certain shots from Alfonso Cuarón's <i>Gravity</i>—both <a href=""https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://aub.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/george_desktop_1920_1200.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://aub.ac.uk/news/story/gravity/&amp;h=1200&amp;w=1920&amp;tbnid=wkrQEDVWuGOebM:&amp;docid=Qi2ORj-aFcDnMM&amp;ei=EYqXVoOGJse2evLPrrgN&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=safari&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD0o30nKnKAhVHmx4KHfKnC9c4ZBAzCBQoETAR"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clooney in his space helmet</a> and the <a href=""http://static.dramastyle.com/images/3/5/20158/Gravity__47.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">glinting curve of the earth itself</a>? That film, with its violent chain reactions of exploding debris, was a harrowing case study in Newton's third law, and Porter's album similarly revels in both the kinetics of destruction and the ecstasy of weightlessness.</p>
<p>Just as he avoids repetitive beats, Porter rarely repeats musical elements as the album winds through its 52-minute run time, aside from the sub-bass rumble and elegiac strings. ""Mass,"" a study for bouncing-ball kick drums and plucked synthesizers, plays out like a series of explosions in reverse, clouds of shrapnel snapping back into their shells over and over again. ""Blind Blackening"" swings the pendulum back toward the suffocating overdrive and wordless choral samples of the opener, ""4001."" ""High Places,"" the album's quietest track—either headphones or a very good, very loud home stereo are recommended— shows off Porter's dynamic range while exploring the texture of scraped strings. ""In Flight,"" the most obviously ""electronic"" thing here, plays with trembling pulses, while the final two cuts, ""Departure Stage"" and ""Known Space,"" veer back into soundtrack territory.</p>
<p>To make music this abstract work, pacing is key, and Porter's proves masterful throughout—that's as true of individual tracks, which heave like massive bellows, as of the shape of the album as a whole. It seems significant that the first real melody we hear, a clarion synthesizer reminiscent of mid-'70s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>, appears only in the album's final five minutes—a reward, perhaps, for having made it through nearly an hour of edge-of-your-seat intensity. <i>Third Law</i> suggests that big-budget sci-fi directors who ignore Porter's work are seriously missing out. But he doesn’t need the silver screen to get his ideas across; this album has all the drama you could ask for on its own.</p></div>"|21335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21335-third-law/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

That's the title of the first single from <i>Night Fiction</i>. To begin, the Irish guitarist delicately strums the same chord five times, one for each time he sings a word in the title, demonstrating quite plainly that no, things don't change that fast. This ethos applies to Nugent's career—<i>Night Fiction</i> is his third album, but his first as a singer/songwriter—as well as his technique. On his earlier instrumental releases, he sometimes let the spaces between notes breathe so long that you'd be likely to find yourself checking the headphone jack to make sure you hadn't somehow become disconnected. These spaces don't appear much on <i>Night Fiction</i>; instead each song unwinds unhurried and the members of his backing band, the Cosmos, take their time making their presence known. </p>
<p>Nugent is the type of guitarist who can dazzle with his attention to detail on the fretboard, as on the album's sole solo instrumental track, ""Lucy,"" but he is also content to ride out on one chord for several measures if the song calls for it. At first, the guitar feels too high in the mix—it's appropriate that the leadoff track is called ""Lost Your Way""—and the licks he plays sometimes feel like muscle-memory fills that could have come from the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kag0TsZzxpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Healey Band</a>, incongruous with the rest of the album. His voice is an ""if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a> can do it, so can I"" approximation, but Nugent makes braver and more inspired melodic choices. Even if his voice doesn't hit all of the right notes, there's an appealing warmth and conviction to his singing.</p>
<p>Nugent also makes up for those irritating suburban-blues licks with his exquisite chordings and inspired solos. It also helps that the Cosmos are an especially dynamic backing band, sounding alternately as ferocious as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a> or as mellow as <a href=""https://youtu.be/ajaR7JwtjL0?t=18m10s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Section</a>. His subject matter seems mostly to be interpersonal strains, and his words are simple, but wise and wide open for interpretation. The aforementioned ""Things Don't Change That Fast"" could be a monologue a practicing addict delivers to a recovering addict: ""There may be only one difference between the hopeless and the brave, one's too specific and the other's too vague,"" he sings. </p>
<p>As with Nugent's previous releases, many of the songs start in one style to become something else altogether. ""Year of the Snake,"" the glorious final track on <i>Night Fiction</i>, spends its first minute with the guitar gradually uncoiling before the organ and viola eventually enter the fold. The cymbals and bass arrive by the third minute, and by minute four it has morphed into a ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53214-listen-the-velvet-underground-19-minute-version-of-sister-ray-live-at-the-gymnasium-1967/"" target=""_blank"">Sister Ray</a>""-like rave-up. Nugent is singing out by the seven-minute mark, sounding more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Shelley</a> than the occasionally flat voice he uses on the rest of the record. This is the catharsis promised at the beginning of the album: Things don’t change that fast, but when they do, they change dramatically, and for the better.</p></div>"|21383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21383-night-fiction/|7.3|Pat Healy

Even then, we only catch it in glimpses: <a href=""http://www.rbmaradio.com/shows/rbma-radio-a-tribute-to-japanese-underground-house"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An RBMA Radio show </a>dedicated to pioneers like Ecstasy Boys and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Knuckles</a>' production partner Satoshi Tomiie; Rush Hour's illuminating <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Soichi-Terada-Sounds-From-The-Far-East/master/792525"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sounds From the Far East</i></a> compilation, which gathered the crucial productions of Soichi Terada. But there is a wealth of Japanese deep house and dance music that never made it off the island, much less across the Pacific. Add to it now this set from two French DJs, Brawther &amp; Alixkun, who have dug up their favorite tracks for <i>ハウス Once Upon a Time in Japan</i>, spanning the heyday of the Major Force label in the early '90s to the late '90s.</p>
<p>Scrub the ID tags off of the 15 tracks that comprise this set and you’d be hard-pressed to differentiate between these tracks and their U.S./UK counterparts, so expert is their mastery of house music tropes of the era. For new listeners unacquainted with early '90s house, the set could easily scan as just a dope set of unheralded tracks that thumped far from the fare of ""Club MTV."" T.P.O.’s opener ""Punk Inc. (Hiroshi's Dub)"" dates from 1989, when the group was pivoting away from conscious rap toward hip-house (and a few years on, into deep house). Those hip-hop drums are subsumed on the remix in favor of a percolating kick and a phase high enough to give you a nosebleed.</p>
<p>Dig into some of the backstories behind these tracks and it gets slightly odd. The vocalizing that goes with Yutsuko Chusonji’s ""Blessing (Magic Ware Remix)"" scans as gospel house in the vein of the Sounds of Blackness, made all the more baffling by the fact that Chusonji is known as a famous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangaka"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mangaka</a> rather than as a dance music producer. For those taken in either by the pan flutes and saxophones of Mood Hut (or, you know, <a href=""https://youtu.be/DK_0jXPuIr0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biebs</a>), check YPF’s lone single, ""Trance of Love (Tokyo Offshore Mix)"" which scans as Balearic house complete with sax solo. Or else check the lovely flute that wafts over Akiko Kanazawa’s ""Sawauchi Jinku (Terada Mix)."" Tethered to a tough beat courtesy of Soichi Terada, it’s the most overtly Japanese-sounding track here, as Kanazawa is an enka singer whose career dates back to the mid-'70s.</p>
<p>The echoing piano figures that opens the Ecstasy Boys’s transcendent 10-minute epic ""Chi Chi Chi Gan Kanon"" could slot into almost any attendant Frankie Knuckles remix of that era. Which makes sense in that the trio of Mitsuru Kotaki, Shiro Amamiya, and Tatsuro Amamiya did have singles on N.Y. house labels Quark and Strictly Rhythm, and could have factored into the sets of the day. Throughout the track, the snares stutter, dive and then climb skyward, building until the midway point, wherein that piano returns and takes the track even higher. And even as the track slowly ebbs away, those drums reverberate and shoot up and down like swallows at play. As these 15 tracks suggest, no one comp can serve as a catchall for that country's dance history, but it's a thrilling overview nevertheless. One hopes that the story behind <i>Once Upon a Time in Japan</i> continues to be told. </p></div>"|21396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21396-brawther-alixkun-present-once-upon-a-time-in-japan/|8.0|Andy Beta

Some good can come of this: smashing up the canon, rediscovering some classics that got left out of pop culture’s ongoing ""I Love the '90s""<i>-</i>ization, recognizing that Diane Warren is <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/doree/un-break-my-heart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">actually kind of a national treasure</a>. Some good albums have come of it too—Solange’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17373-true/"">True</a></i>, Jessie Ware’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19913-jessie-ware-tough-love/"">Tough Love</a></i>, Dornik’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20967-dornik/"">self-titled</a>. But this stuff is harder than it sounds. Done right, you salvage everything timeless and nocturnal about the genre and leave the fustiness behind. Done wrong, you’ve written more of the filler songs you’d have found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ofF6tmyAo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">buried around track 12 of a Monica album</a>, or the ballads that used to be near-contractual requirements for pop starlets needing ""mature"" cuts for their records.</p>
<p>Enter Wet, a Brooklyn three-piece that has flitted around synthpop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a>-ish folk, '90s R&amp;B, and modern alt-R&amp;B without quite committing to any of them, which nevertheless positions them perfectly for starring roles in <a href=""http://babysallright.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baby’s All Right</a> showcases, BBC Radio 1 playlists, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/mTsu7IBRqO/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hair-whipping clips on Khloe Kardashian’s Instagram</a>. (This is how we 2016.) The uninformed listener might think Wet would be fun. Their band name may or may not be a gag. Their former online presence, squashed for legal reasons, was @kanyewet—it’s goofy! It’s Yeezy! It’s<a href=""https://twitter.com/wet/status/445896733412040704"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> maybe a grab for those typo clicks</a>, if you want to get all cynical about it! Debut album <i>Don’t You, </i>however, is a downbeat, decidedly unfun affair—this is the kind of album where early single ""U Da Best"" turns into ""You’re the Best,"" from which you can extrapolate a lot.</p>
<p>The main problem with <i>Don’t You</i>: if you set out to be an amalgam of beloved styles, you’d better equal and preferably outdo at least a couple of them once. Wet cite Usher and SWV as touchpoints in almost every press story, but seem to have forgotten all their exciting songs, as well as everything uptempo; most of <i>Don’t You </i>aims for Babyface but lands somewhere around <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8RnTK7CbRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surfacing</a></i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8RnTK7CbRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">-era Sarah McLachlan</a>, except nowhere near as good. Instrumentalists Joe Valle and Marty Sulkow reproduce the slick sounds of background music—synth pads, polite rhythm guitar, vague drum pitter-patter—with <a href=""http://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/11-sample-replay-tips-555535"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sample-replay</a> fidelity. Vocalist Kelly Zutrau’s thin voice has none of the sighing wispiness of Romy Madley-Croft, Tracey Thorn, or even Jennifer Paige, nor the melisma or force of basically any R&amp;B artist <i>Don’t You </i>emulates; her go-to tricks are (admittedly pretty and sometimes inspired) double-tracked harmonies or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19787-banks-goddess/"">Banks</a>-y quaver that’s plaintive the first couple times you hear it. Their songs are near-identical takes on the wallow phase of a breakup, each rendered in passive, beige indifference—one misses the emotional peaks of '90s R&amp;B, which go all the way up to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rsWqZ_b44M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">If You Died I Wouldn’t Cry</a>."" Yet telling-not-showing lines like ""when you hold me, I still feel lonely"" (responsible for perhaps <a href=""http://genius.com/8387859"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the best/worst Genius annotation in recent memory</a>) are nevertheless preferable to the likes of ""today, New York feels like an island,"" a metaphor that manages the remarkable feat of being clichéd and geographically hilarious. (Perhaps they meant upstate?)</p>
<p><i>Don’t You</i> isn’t without standouts. ""Deadwater"" is well-constructed, though better as a standalone single, and skittery ""All the Ways"" is a standout purely by dint of having a higher tempo. But two-for-eleven does not an album make. ""Don’t Wanna Be Your Girl"" drowns Brian McKnight’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXPfovXw2tw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Back at One</a>"" and Cat Power’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lJiwKskTlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Good Woman</a>"" in a puddle of reverb and repetition. ""Weak"" is an approximation of what it might sound like if Meghan Trainor traded her poodle-skirt-costume versions of the '50s for roller-rink-costume versions on ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WEtxJ4-sh4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waterfalls</a>."" Either everyone involved with ""You’re the Best"" developed iron deficiencies before its re-recording, or it simply blends in with the rest of the album’s downtempo sulk.</p>
<p>Wet, to their credit and detriment, know they’ve got competition. ""Our music plays into the more general trend of artists incorporating certain elements of R&amp;B and pop into their sound and creating something really unique,"" Zutrau told <i><a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/exclusive-video-premiere-and-interview-youre-the-best-wet#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Interview</a></i>. But of those on-trend artists, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> have more exuberance and better studio players; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a> have more space and ambition; almost any contemporary R&amp;B act has more imagination, more rhythm, and more interesting blues. Wet know this too: ""[We’re] now adults in a time when the music playing on Hot 97 is some of the most exciting music being made right now,"" Zutrau said. Perhaps the future might capture a bit of that excitement; some names floated as future Wet collaborators include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> (whose ""Weak"" <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/wet/weak-clam-casino-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> is more sonically interesting alone than anything on this record) and Drake producer Nineteen85. As it stands, Wet may as well be directing readers toward better versions of them. And there have never been more to choose from.</p></div>"|21460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21460-dont-you/|4.0|Katherine St. Asaph

It’s a remarkable feat for any band, but even more impressive than the Nottingham outfit’s longevity is their consistency. Tindersticks have never released a bad album (or even a middling one), never made an opportunistic, trend-driven shift, and have never done anything that might date their music to its moment of origin. They’re the rare group that can lay claim to a signature sound, yet tweak the formula from album to album so that each of their 10 records possesses its own distinct character. The skies in their world may be forever gray, but the clouds are always moving and morphing, letting in the faintest flickers of light that change the size and shape of the shadows they cast.</p>
<p>The richly atmospheric, nicotine-stained quality of the Tindersticks’ music makes it an ideal complement to TV shows and films, whether their songs are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhsxThJBnTE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtracking pivotal scenes on ""The Sopranos""</a> or comprising entire scores for French art-house maverick Claire Denis. But on <i>The Waiting Room</i>, that dynamic is reversed: the band handed off its 11 tracks to various filmmaker friends (including Denis, Christoph Girardet, Pierre Vinour, and Gregorio Graziosi) as inspirational fodder for accompanying short films packaged with deluxe editions of the record. The album opens with a cover of Polish composer Bronislau Kaper’s ""Follow Me,"" aka the theme song from the 1962 film adaptation of <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>; in Tindersticks’ hands, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOudGh8psEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the original</a>’s tiki-torch splendor is given a gritty makeover that pushes it closer to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOudGh8psEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Midnight Cowboy territory</a>. It’s a perfect scene-setter—<i>The Waiting Room</i> may not feature any songs about oceanic expeditions, but the band sure know their way around tales of backstabbing and betrayal.</p>
<p>Yet for all the band’s filmic qualities, the action in frontman Stuart Staples' lyrics is always more psychological than physical. The weightless Wurlitzer tones of ""Second Chance Man"" and ""Were We Once Lovers?"" respectively set Staples’ inner turmoil against brassy swells and disorienting disco. And just as the latter track appears to achieve liftoff, Staples delivers a dispiriting chorus line—""how can I care if it’s the caring that’s killing me?""—that forsakes rapture for rupture.</p>
<p><i>The Waiting Room</i> might be Tindersticks’ most subdued effort to date, but it still flashes the irreverence that enlivened efforts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16307-tindersticks/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Something Rain</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13849-falling-down-a-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Falling Down a Mountain</i></a>. On ""Help Yourself,"" an uncharacteristically louche Staples shakes off his troubles by swaggering onto the floor of the Shrine in Lagos circa '72 (and the novelty of the Tindersticks going Afrobeat is savvily mirrored by Denis’ companion clip, which depicts French-Caribbean actor Alex Descas roaming the shopping-mall concourse of a French train station, nonplussed by the white European consumer culture surrounding him). An even more wondrous surprise arrives in the form of ""Hey Lucinda,"" a wobbly-kneed waltz that finds Staples communing with the spirit of the late, great Montreal chanteuse Lhasa de Sela, an occasional Tindersticks collaborator who died of cancer in 2010. It’s like a fleeting reminiscence of someone who’s passed, but one that leaves you smiling from the warm memories rather than weeping over their absence.</p>
<p>The beautifully languid ""Hey Lucinda"" contrasts sharply with <i>The Waiting Room</i>’s other big-ticket matchup, ""We Are Dreamers,"" which sees Staples joining forces with Jehnny Beth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30435-savages/"" target=""_blank"">Savages</a> and the Tindersticks tapping into that band’s brooding menace. It’s the moment where all of <i>The Waiting Room</i>’s mounting tension is finally released, into an outsider anthem that recasts material impoverishment as spiritual empowerment (""You can rob us/ You can trick us/ Peer over our shoulders and steal our ideas"") as Beth and Staples’ voices intertwine and overlap before locking into the song’s rallying cry: ""This is not us/ We are dreamers!"" But in the Tindersticks’ world, every dream is followed by a rude awakening; following that climax, the bitterly fatalistic closer ""Like Only Lovers Can"" pairs '70s soft-rock sway with a cutting chorus: ""We can only hurt each other the way that lovers can/ So where do we go?"" Appropriately, many of the visuals that accompany these songs emphasize distance and emptiness: black-and-white footage of a wedding from the '50s; a seaside fairground after the tourists have gone home; taxidermied animals. They’re moments and entities once bustling with life, but which now exist as faded memories or shells of their former selves. And for so long as we pine to make them real again, there will be exquisite Tindersticks songs to help us fill the void.</p></div>"|21310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21310-the-waiting-room/|8.0|Stuart Berman

But under This Heat's occupancy, between 1977 and 1981, the South London space became a laboratory for a strange and volatile new strain of avant-garde rock—by turns thundering and ephemeral, hopeful and wry, surgically precise and caveman-crude—that didn't quite square with anything else that was happening at the time. Their motto was simple: ""All possible processes. All channels open. Twenty-four hour alert.""</p>
<p>Two members of the band, drummer Charles Hayward and multi-instrumentalist Charles Bullen, had been playing in various progressive rock bands for more than a dozen years; Gareth Williams, the group's third member, had no musical training at all. That tension guided them as they established an exploratory practice based on extended collective improvisation that incorporated not just guitar and drums, but also viola, melodica, organ, household objects, and broken toys. They used tape machines to stretch the fabric of time and creative mic placement to warp space. They were fueled not just by formal restlessness but also by rage at consumer society—""Sleep,"" the opening song on 1981's <i>Deceit</i>, juxtaposes advertising copy with references to Pavlovian experiments in conditioning—and their certainty that humanity was on a nuclear collision course with itself. ""That's why our music wasn't psychedelic and drifty, why it was so hard-edged and angular,"" Hayward told Simon Reynolds in <i>Rip It Up and Start Again</i>. ""We had no interest in making people <i>stoned</i> with our sounds.""</p>
<p>This Heat released only two albums and one EP during their brief run, and those barely registered amid the competing din of the period. But you can hear in their slim catalog, which returns to wax thanks to these reissues from <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>, the seeds of vast fields of music that would follow: post-rock, math rock, homemade <i>musique concr</i><i>è</i><i>te</i>, and experimental electronica. This Heat did not yield a single signature sound so much as a zone of possibilities.</p>
<p>And that very range is part of what makes their music so bracing. Listening to their self-titled 1979 debut album, one moment you are lulled into a meditative state by the incidental bells and airy sax skronk of ""Not Waving""; the next you're given whiplash by churning dissonance and muscular rhythms that anticipate early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"" target=""_blank"">Shellac</a>,  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>. ""Music Like Escaping Gas,"" with its trembling organ, dissonant acoustic guitar, and chanted sing-speaking, could be mistaken for a rough Gastr del Sol demo, while ""The Fall of Saigon"" reroutes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s wispy art rock through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>'s funereal drones. The narcotic texture of that song, gloopy and atonal, stands in stark contrast to the lyrics' sly sense of humor: It begins by making a meal of a cat, and, by the end, the narrator has eaten everything that's not bolted to the floor, right down to the TV and the armchair. The fall of an empire has never been rendered in bleaker, more bitterly humorous terms.</p>
<p>The whole sweep of This Heat's project can be heard on the uncharacteristically optimistic ""Health and Efficiency,"" the A-side of a 1980 12"". ""Here's a song about the sunshine,"" they sing over a major-key melody that prefigures <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqdxiW7A2fY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nihilist Assault Group</a>""; soon, they spiral into a locked groove of violently yanked guitar strings and hypnotically looped drums. The clatter of woodblocks and milk bottles adds to the din; they even mix in the sounds of a nearby playground before the eight-minute side dissolves into a detuned and deconstructed reprise of the main theme. On the flip, the tape composition ""Graphic / Varispeed"" is 11 and a half minutes of held organ tones that rise and fall like the sound of a single-engine propeller plane circling the neighborhood. Stylistically, its musical minimalism is at odds with This Heat's twitchy muscularity, but the intensity of its focus is absolutely in keeping with the group's unflinching approach.</p>
<p>Their second and final album, 1981's <i>Deceit</i>, doesn't entirely do away with the extreme sonic abstraction. ""Radio Prague"" is an experiment in mechanical pulses and cut-up radio broadcasts, and ""Hi Baku Shyo (Suffer Bomb Disease)"" is a kind of expressionist sound painting of a post-nuclear landscape: wails, church bells, buzzing flies. For the most part, though, the album marks a significant leap forward in songwriting. (Mixed by the reggae engineer Martin Frederick, it also marks a significant improvement in fidelity.) <i>Deceit</i>'s lyrics encompass both acid critique and post-structuralist philosophy while finding poetry in the everyday, and its grooves are both catchy and strangely inscrutable. This band could also flat-out jam: ""S.P.Q.R.,"" with its chiming guitars and close-harmonized chants, goes head to head with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"" target=""_blank"">Mission of Burma</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXkZI7WZWOo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Academy Fight Song</a>"" as one of the most triumphant-sounding protest songs of the era. The album's anthemic scale helps explain how This Heat ended up opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> at London's Hammersmith Palais that year.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years later, the depth and breadth of their creativity remain both astonishing and incredibly prescient. On the tribal cut-and-paste piece ""Shrinkwrap,"" their vocal multi-tracking sounds like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beastie Boys</a> via Monty Python. And on ""A New Kind of Water,"" <i>Deceit</i>'s climactic penultimate song, their sturm and clang presents a model for the haunted cabling of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20428-bad-moon-rising/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bad Moon Rising</i></a>. The song's title is a sendup of marketing, but it ultimately concerns nothing less than the survival of the species: ""Fly away Peter, hide away Paul/ Who can watch as the Earth burns, shatters, and dies?""</p>
<p>For many years, This Heat records were hard to come by, though sporadic reissues and compilation features helped keep their legacy alive. Thanks to the new vinyl reissues and streaming, their catalog is now more widely available than ever. And yet, This Heat also feel further from the zeitgeist than ever. The sort of noisy, difficult rock that they helped pioneer has gone out of favor, and their electronic experiments have become second nature. But that resistance to faddishess helps make their music an exhilarating experience to this day, whether it's a first encounter or the continuation of a years-long relationship.

But under This Heat's occupancy, between 1977 and 1981, the South London space became a laboratory for a strange and volatile new strain of avant-garde rock—by turns thundering and ephemeral, hopeful and wry, surgically precise and caveman-crude—that didn't quite square with anything else that was happening at the time. Their motto was simple: ""All possible processes. All channels open. Twenty-four hour alert.""</p>
<p>Two members of the band, drummer Charles Hayward and multi-instrumentalist Charles Bullen, had been playing in various progressive rock bands for more than a dozen years; Gareth Williams, the group's third member, had no musical training at all. That tension guided them as they established an exploratory practice based on extended collective improvisation that incorporated not just guitar and drums, but also viola, melodica, organ, household objects, and broken toys. They used tape machines to stretch the fabric of time and creative mic placement to warp space. They were fueled not just by formal restlessness but also by rage at consumer society—""Sleep,"" the opening song on 1981's <i>Deceit</i>, juxtaposes advertising copy with references to Pavlovian experiments in conditioning—and their certainty that humanity was on a nuclear collision course with itself. ""That's why our music wasn't psychedelic and drifty, why it was so hard-edged and angular,"" Hayward told Simon Reynolds in <i>Rip It Up and Start Again</i>. ""We had no interest in making people <i>stoned</i> with our sounds.""</p>
<p>This Heat released only two albums and one EP during their brief run, and those barely registered amid the competing din of the period. But you can hear in their slim catalog, which returns to wax thanks to these reissues from <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>, the seeds of vast fields of music that would follow: post-rock, math rock, homemade <i>musique concr</i><i>è</i><i>te</i>, and experimental electronica. This Heat did not yield a single signature sound so much as a zone of possibilities.</p>
<p>And that very range is part of what makes their music so bracing. Listening to their self-titled 1979 debut album, one moment you are lulled into a meditative state by the incidental bells and airy sax skronk of ""Not Waving""; the next you're given whiplash by churning dissonance and muscular rhythms that anticipate early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"" target=""_blank"">Shellac</a>,  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>. ""Music Like Escaping Gas,"" with its trembling organ, dissonant acoustic guitar, and chanted sing-speaking, could be mistaken for a rough Gastr del Sol demo, while ""The Fall of Saigon"" reroutes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s wispy art rock through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>'s funereal drones. The narcotic texture of that song, gloopy and atonal, stands in stark contrast to the lyrics' sly sense of humor: It begins by making a meal of a cat, and, by the end, the narrator has eaten everything that's not bolted to the floor, right down to the TV and the armchair. The fall of an empire has never been rendered in bleaker, more bitterly humorous terms.</p>
<p>The whole sweep of This Heat's project can be heard on the uncharacteristically optimistic ""Health and Efficiency,"" the A-side of a 1980 12"". ""Here's a song about the sunshine,"" they sing over a major-key melody that prefigures <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqdxiW7A2fY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nihilist Assault Group</a>""; soon, they spiral into a locked groove of violently yanked guitar strings and hypnotically looped drums. The clatter of woodblocks and milk bottles adds to the din; they even mix in the sounds of a nearby playground before the eight-minute side dissolves into a detuned and deconstructed reprise of the main theme. On the flip, the tape composition ""Graphic / Varispeed"" is 11 and a half minutes of held organ tones that rise and fall like the sound of a single-engine propeller plane circling the neighborhood. Stylistically, its musical minimalism is at odds with This Heat's twitchy muscularity, but the intensity of its focus is absolutely in keeping with the group's unflinching approach.</p>
<p>Their second and final album, 1981's <i>Deceit</i>, doesn't entirely do away with the extreme sonic abstraction. ""Radio Prague"" is an experiment in mechanical pulses and cut-up radio broadcasts, and ""Hi Baku Shyo (Suffer Bomb Disease)"" is a kind of expressionist sound painting of a post-nuclear landscape: wails, church bells, buzzing flies. For the most part, though, the album marks a significant leap forward in songwriting. (Mixed by the reggae engineer Martin Frederick, it also marks a significant improvement in fidelity.) <i>Deceit</i>'s lyrics encompass both acid critique and post-structuralist philosophy while finding poetry in the everyday, and its grooves are both catchy and strangely inscrutable. This band could also flat-out jam: ""S.P.Q.R.,"" with its chiming guitars and close-harmonized chants, goes head to head with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"" target=""_blank"">Mission of Burma</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXkZI7WZWOo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Academy Fight Song</a>"" as one of the most triumphant-sounding protest songs of the era. The album's anthemic scale helps explain how This Heat ended up opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> at London's Hammersmith Palais that year.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years later, the depth and breadth of their creativity remain both astonishing and incredibly prescient. On the tribal cut-and-paste piece ""Shrinkwrap,"" their vocal multi-tracking sounds like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beastie Boys</a> via Monty Python. And on ""A New Kind of Water,"" <i>Deceit</i>'s climactic penultimate song, their sturm and clang presents a model for the haunted cabling of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20428-bad-moon-rising/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bad Moon Rising</i></a>. The song's title is a sendup of marketing, but it ultimately concerns nothing less than the survival of the species: ""Fly away Peter, hide away Paul/ Who can watch as the Earth burns, shatters, and dies?""</p>
<p>For many years, This Heat records were hard to come by, though sporadic reissues and compilation features helped keep their legacy alive. Thanks to the new vinyl reissues and streaming, their catalog is now more widely available than ever. And yet, This Heat also feel further from the zeitgeist than ever. The sort of noisy, difficult rock that they helped pioneer has gone out of favor, and their electronic experiments have become second nature.

Luckily he clicked on the link and committed to a deep dive, staying up 'til the next morning downloading hundreds of songs. Gqom (pronounced <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gqomu/it-is-gqomu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gome</a>) is a blistering variant of South African house which finds its roots in the coastal city of Durban, and like lots of the home-brewed genres of music in South Africa and beyond, a treasure trove of tracks was easily available on the Internet. The plentiful and vibrant community on the free file-hosting site Data File Host, the dozens of Facebook groups (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Gqomu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IGqomu</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Gqomu-music-672835939438133/?fref=ts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gqomu Music</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Gqom-Nation-199126743626659/?fref=ts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gqom Nation</a> to name a few), invite-only WhatsApp group chats, and most importantly <a href=""http://kasimp3.co.za/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KasiMP3</a>—South Africa's answer to Bandcamp and Soundcloud—can make a newcomer feel like he's uncovered an embarrassment of riches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But good luck cataloging any of it, let alone compiling a ""best of"" when so many tracks are titled with cellphone numbers/BBM pins, and available mostly in low bitrate formats. Kolè met Lerato Phiri through mutual friends in Rome, and she moved back to South Africa to find and meet with young producers in Durban, convincing them to contribute to a compilation. A year later they've co-founded the record label <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gqomu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gqom Oh!</a> and have released their first full-length release, <i>The Sound of Durban Vol. 1.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If there is an origin story for gqom it all begins on the Internet, probably on the Pirate Bay or a similarly clandestine digital backdoor. Emo Kid, an artist featured on <i>Sounds of Durban</i>, said that he he thinks the style ""was invented when some unknown guy from elokishini, the ghetto, got hold of production software and began experimenting and making something he could dance to, and gqom was born."" Gqom comes from a Zulu word meaning drum or hit, and in the local slang it's an onomatopoeia that mimics the abrupt sound of a rock hitting a tile floor. The sound of gqom is one literally of rupture and force, or as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"" target=""_blank"">Kode9</a> has said, ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gqomu/dominowe-africas-cry"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like being suspended over the gravitational field of a black hole, and lovin' it</a>."" The entire aesthetic of gqom is steeped in a swashbuckling DIY attitude. Nothing about these productions feels slick or highly processed. The music proudly shows its seams by remaining highly tactile, off the cuff, and very confrontational. Back-breaking tracks like ""Zulu War"" and ""Gunz &amp; Soulz"" make this quite evident.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What Kolè found so attractive about gqom in the first place was that it felt like a perfect artistic expression for the political, economic, and urban contradictions so apparent in Durban and South Africa as a whole. It is among the most Westernized and developed countries on the continent, but the living conditions for the predominately black communities in the townships of South Africa remain dismal. Gqom is still being produced in townships and suburbs, marginal communities by and large where access to Internet, gear, and everything young musicians need is still a struggle. And for the most part gqom artists and gqom music is not played on local radio, nor has it reached any significant popularity outside of Durban, which is often seen as secondary in the music scene to the larger and more visible Johannesburg. While it might seem specious that someone who has never been to Durban become the spokesperson for the genre, Kolè's intentions feel heartfelt and earnest. He's said the artists (whose ages range from 15 to 22) call him ""Malumz"" which means ""uncle"" because he's too old to be a ""bro.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Phiri and Kolè want gqom to have the same connection to Durban that juke and footwork has to Chicago, and by helping bring the genre international recognition they hope to route investment toward better access to technology and greater cultural infrastructure in Durban, which should continue fostering artistic production. They aren't the only group trying to make gqom a big deal on international dance floors. Kode9 included gqom tracks in a Resident Advisor mix last year, and the London-based label Goon Club Allstars released an EP by the group Rudeboyz last summer. That same summer, up-and-coming grime rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33395-stormzy/"" target=""_blank"">Stormzy</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtvtDXLdnZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">traveled to South Africa</a> to learn about gqom. According to Johannesburg music journalist, Lloyd Gedye, you can even hear strains of gqom's signature stylings in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"">Jamie xx</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjNssEVlB6M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gosh</a>,"" which he might have heard in the now-popular gqom nights that are popping up in South London. Even with all the hype attached, it still feels like we're learning more about gqom, and Phiri and Kolè's project is the largest and most thoughtful survey of the genre available to western audiences to date.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The 15 tracks that compose<i> Sounds of Durban Vol. 1</i> successfully capture the very essence of gqom: the rough-and-tumble vibe, the impressionistic and asymmetrical kickdrums, the hypnotic chanting, and the music's brash youthfulness. Originally referred to as ""Broken Beat"" in the community, gqom is a pushback against spiritual predecessors like Kwaito, where melody and other harmonic qualities are dissolved away and only the hard beat of a song remains.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Much of the music on the album can feel amorphous and shapeless because it's difficult to identify and differentiate artist from artist as songs bleed into the next. In that way, it's more a well-wrought mix than an album. The album pleasantly bludgeons you with what makes gqom different from other kinds of house music: it's raw, it's tougher, angrier. It presents a case for a minimal version of house which is never restrained—the music is always exuberant and riotous. This also means the album can easily move from relentless to tiring, because as a whole it lacks pacing, and it is instead a trial by fire.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Although that is not to say that artists don't stand out. Dominowe's ""Africa's Cry,"" the album's second track, sets the bar impossibly high. Cruel Boyz's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17827-cruel-boyz-umeqo-emagqomini-dub-mix/"" target=""_blank"">Umeqo Emagqomini (Dub Mix)</a>"" was the lead single for the record, and it might be the album's best song. It feels like the strongest argument for gqom being the heartbeat of club music in Durban, with its addictive combination of polyrhythmic claves and vigorous, almost painterly, use of kickdrums.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Some of these songs might feel like prototypes for who these artists might become. But it's also the first major salvo in a genre that will only get more dazzling and compelling. Ultimately, <i>Sound of Durban</i> is the story of a talented group of friends as much as it is a sampler into a new and fast-moving genre of dance music. All the things that are carefree and rebellious about being young find a way to be showcased in these songs. And if there is any resolution that can feel doable in this new year, it's to rep this group of young people in Durban as hard as possible when you decide to hijack the speakers at the party you find yourself at tonight.</p></div>"|21381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21381-the-sound-of-durban-vol-1/|8.1|Kevin Lozano

On ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-zLTN9CpbU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">They Always Fly Away</a>,"" from their 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15993-blouse-st/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a>, she stares gravely at a symbolic blackbird that returns over and over to the same telephone wire, and each time laments its next departure. ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pow9kImSNg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1000 Years</a>,"" from its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18495-blouse-imperium/"" target=""_blank"">follow-up</a>, is a dream of eternal life disguised as a pledge of undying love. But Hilton's morbid reveries recede without fail into the warmest and mushiest of mushy synth hooks, embracing human decay as if it were as alluring as a timeworn cassette. On <i>Palana</i>, her solo debut, Hilton turns her gaze to a renewable kind of death: that of our morphing identities.</p>
<p>Palana is the Sanskrit birth name Hilton left behind after high school, and she eulogizes it on the title track. ""Palana, I always thought that you would be with me every morning,"" she sings in a lullaby melody, ""Shifting with the wind, easily."" Her tone hardens on ""Something for Us All,"" in which ""children disappear, their innocence a victim of time,"" so that we understand the pain, as well as the inevitability, of shedding one’s skins. ""Is there anything that’s something all the time?"" she wonders, with a sigh that suggests there is not.</p>
<p>Despite the songs’ homespun charm, there’s something faintly confrontational in Hilton’s phrasing–to precede the above line, for example, she sarcastically sings, ""If happiness is something for us all/ Then go ahead and tell me what it's like."" On ""Funny Anyway,"" a lament for her lapsing memory, Hilton bemoans the social demands of small talk (""Why do they ask me what I’ve done?/ Do I have to say?""), in a way that could seem petty. Instead, you get the sense of a dormant intellect being perpetually roused into action—when the quietest person in the room suddenly speaks up, people tend to listen. Hilton's voice has a similar effect: It's pitched between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14952-trish-keenan/"" target=""_blank"">Trish Keenan</a> (or a slightly wooden impersonator) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29406-cats-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Cat's Eyes</a>’ Rachel Zeffira. Through the record she is elegantly detached—not disinterested so much as preoccupied, focused somewhere beyond the scope of the song.</p>
<p>Occasionally <i>Palana</i> will burst open, revealing churning undercurrents beneath Hilton’s surface calm. In the chorus of ""Let's Go to a Party,"" she pairs a silly, splashy Europop beat with a deceptively naive mantra, sung like a curse: ""I’m only happy when I’m dancing/ When I’m dancing for you."" That she dances ""for"" and not ""with"" is intriguing, but true: sometimes it is easier to perform for others than honestly engage them. It’s perhaps a lonely way to be, and that melancholy floods out through the record—yet to Hilton’s characters, it feels like home. She dances alone in the company of others, and allows her many selves, simultaneously, to live.</p></div>"|21444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21444-palana/|6.9|Jazz Monroe

Two members, two tiny dots on a massive canvas, Welsh's bottomless longing and Otto's vapor-trails electronics. Together, they explore how much mystery can be plumbed from radical transparency, and on their 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Impersonator</i></a> they hit massive dividends: It remains as transfixingly direct exploration of elemental stuff—trauma, pain, death, childhood, love—I've ever heard. Every time I listen to it, I feel like something has been dredged from my dreams.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this aesthetic might be so well-defined that there could only ever be one perfect album of it, and <i>Impersonator</i> was probably it. Last fall’s follow up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21194-are-you-alone/"" target=""_blank""><i>Are You Alone?</i></a> was gentler, less wracked by fear and dread, more reliant on ballads. It was lovely, but where <i>Impersonator</i> flirted with bathos, <i>Are You Alone?</i> nearly surrendered to it. The line between ""raw, uncompromising emotional honesty"" and ""<i>yeeesh</i>"" is razor-thin, after all, and some types of emotional outbursts only carry their full impact once.</p>
<p>The<i> Wait &amp; See </i>EP consists of songs that didn't fit onto<i> Are You Alone?, </i>but it feels perched at this same divide, and again the balance feels slightly off. Nothing much has changed, strictly speaking. Welsh’s rich, burly tenor still feels as if it is emanating from the center of your skull, and he sings his lines as if he’s maybe reading them off the page for the first time. His writing hints at life-changing late-night conversations: ""You said, ‘When I am dead, I will never feel this strange again,'"" he sings on ""Heaven."" But a few releases in, his straightforward lines are beginning to sound less like powerful honesty and more like simple guilelessness, an innate and involuntary quality rather than a conscious act.</p>
<p>These are intangible criticisms, but music this bare traffics necessarily in intangibles. Here’s a concrete problem: The mix here sounds more conventional, and beholden to other, ""normal"" synth-pop, than the bizarre, featureless expanse of <i>Impersonator</i> and <i>Are You Alone? </i>On those albums, the synths didn't have clear attacks or decays; they happened in free space, so that nothing that happened felt strictly ""real."" Welsh’s gorgeous voice didn’t even sound quite right, like maybe he’d sung the lyrics backwards and played them forwards. It made you lean forward to listen more closely to music that was already perfectly clear: You heard what he was saying, but what was he <i>saying</i>? On <i>Wait &amp; See</i>, Welsh and Otto have floated down to Earth a bit, and with the journey they shed a little bit of their unearthly magnetism. </p>
<p>The most powerful moment on the EP comes with ""My Heart Soaks Up Every Drop of Your Blood,"" a title that feels intentionally clunky and literal. The music is at its simplest here, which is always the most vital spot for Majical Cloudz’s music. As in all of his best songs, you can’t quite tell if Welsh is being tender or murderous: ""You are the seed in a pile of dust,"" he says, which is maybe not something you’d want whispered to you before dropping off to sleep. As always, it’s this liminal spot, somewhere between dread and comfort, that they occupy. Even if it's become more familiar to us, this is still a territory with no other real inhabitants, and at no point could you mistake this band for anyone other than themselves.  </p></div>"|21497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21497-wait-see-ep/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Back then, Meiburg was nursing a broken heart, and emoted in a rawer manner than in his band's grandiose ""Island Arc"" trilogy comprised of 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7105-palo-santo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Palo Santo</i></a>, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11560-rook/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rook</i></a>, and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13934-the-golden-archipelago/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Golden Archipelago</i></a>. <i>Animal Joy </i>hinted at an intimacy hidden behind the ""Game of Thrones"" magnificence of the band’s earlier work. What’s more, punching up the influences of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a> and <i>Laughing Stock</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a> helped bring a sense of old-fashioned romantic sweep to the Sub Pop label for the first time since Jeremy Enigk’s <i>Return of the Frog Queen.</i></p>
<p><i>Jet Plane and Oxbow </i>marks Shearwater’s second full-length of original material for the veteran Seattle imprint, following a collection of covers in 2013 called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18785-shearwater-fellow-travelers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fellow Travelers </i></a>that featured versions of songs by such contemporaries as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu/"" target=""_blank"">Xiu Xiu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1530-the-folk-implosion/"" target=""_blank"">Folk Implosion</a>, and intrepid labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31451-the-baptist-generals/"" target=""_blank"">the Baptist Generals</a>. Following up on the lead suggested by <i>Animal Joy</i>, Meiburg cuts closer to rock'n'roll than anything this band has ever made. The glockenspiels are back (well, it's a dulcimer this time, actually), but they are manned by former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3549-redd-kross/"" target=""_blank"">Redd Kross</a> drummer Brian Reitzell, who has spent the last two decades as a music supervisor and film composers, scoring hit films like <i>Lost in Translation, Friday Night</i> <i>Lights</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Bling Ring </i>in addition to being a de facto third member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a>. Reitzell's arsenal of keyboards, percussion, and various hammered string instruments gives Shearwater the epic 70mm feel Meiburg always seems to be aiming for; only this time, he’s got the man behind the music from NBC’s ""Hannibal"" at the controls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Meiburg—who is also one of the best culture critics in the country—continues down the more personal path he forged on <i>Joy</i>. The lyrics here brim with frustration over the political quagmire drowning the voice of American intelligence, especially in his adopted home state of Texas, over the last decade or so. Meiburg has said in the press leading up to <i>Oxbow</i>’s release that it is a protest record, and he has a very specific kind of protest record in mind: The big-sky rock of tracks like ""Pale Kings"" and ""Glass Bones"" are paired with the kind of lofty language that defined mid-'80s albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>’s <i>The Unforgettable Fire </i>and <i>A Pagan</i> Place by the Waterboys. These songs really soar, but none more so than ""Only Child,"" a beautiful and lilting ballad. Nobody aims to write big-tent rock songs quite like this anymore.</p>
<p>The album is enlivened by a pulsing rhythmic undercurrent, informed seemingly by instrumental hip-hop and new wave. This more fluid groove replaces the brutal might of longtime Shearwater drummer Thor Harris, who is inexplicably absent from this endeavor. Songs like ""Backchannels"" and ""Filaments"" sound as though Meiburg is ghostwriting for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"" target=""_blank"">Lorde</a>, while ""Quiet Americans""—with its big synths and bigger heart—seems to be channeling the Thompson Twins.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since springing from the rib of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3141-okkervil-river/"" target=""_blank"">Okkervil River</a>, Shearwater has always made music bigger than the capacity of the clubs they play. <i>Jet Plane and Oxbow</i> feels like their moon shot out of that world. Throughout the album, Meiburg seems to be personally willing the band upward and outward, risking the kind of mainstream corniness that you only encounter when ambitions grow mountain-sized. It's impressive, and a credit to the band's pure craftmanship, that so much of this Wembley Stadium-ready collection was partly cut in a friend's home studio. Somehow, from these humble origins, they have made something spacious and expansive enough to feel conjured from the costly confines of a million-dollar studio like Abbey Road or Electric Lady. With <i>Jet Plane and Oxbow</i>, Shearwater achieve not only their grandest statement to date, but their most grounded as well.</p></div>"|21441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21441-jet-plane-and-oxbow/|7.5|Ron Hart

The song, from his 1993 album <i>There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You, </i>was a meditation on faith and fallibility. With its dense imagery and antiquated language, it gave the impression of an actor treading the footboards, performing the role of an old-time singer, staging a spiritual reckoning.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Oldham recorded a very different version of ""Pulpit"" for a Peel Session, and it shows just how malleable his songs are. This performance, which opens his new odds-and-ends comp <i>Pond Scum</i>, is slow and deliberate. An acoustic and an electric guitar noodle solemnly. And Oldham’s voice is deeper and less distant; he pushes it up to the front of the song to let the listener relish the richness and texture that age has bestowed on him. Oldham isn’t an actor anymore, but a sinner experiencing a spiritual crisis in real time. </p>
<p>""(I Was Drunk at the) Pulpit"" is a potent opener to <i>Pond Scum</i>, which collects a few old Peel Sessions into a surprisingly affecting meditation on the nature of faith. As these two versions of the song prove, it’s not a redundancy, but a compilation that emphasizes new ideas and overlooked themes in Oldham’s prodigious catalog. Oldham favors retrospectives that tweak the very idea of retrospectives: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"" target=""_blank"">Greatest Palace Music</a></i>, from 2004, featured his Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy alias covering songs by his Palace persona, and he followed it up eight years later with an EP of self-covers called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16855-now-heres-my-plan-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Now Here’s My Plan</a></i>. Even as they condense and summarize his catalog, these releases are his most esoteric, rewarding, and engaging in the context of his career, when a listener can grasp the various allusions Oldham is making to himself.</p>
<p><i>Pond Scum</i> falls squarely into that category, and may therefore be a fans-only album. And yet, taken on its own terms, <i>Pond Scum</i> is also a good-faith effort to plumb the nature of God. Not just any deity, but the distinctively American one born in 1741 in Jonathan Edwards’ hellfire sermon ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</a>"" and since then praised and perpetuated in countless old-time folk and gospel songs.</p>
<p>Despite its innate humanism (""The world is within you, without is of mud""), ""(I Was Drunk at the) Pulpit"" is the only real brimstone moment on <i>Pond Scum</i>. Other songs are much more generous, some even celebratory: ""Death to Everyone"" testifies that our days are sweeter for being numbered, and Oldham’s band sound like they’re not wasting a single moment. ""When Thy Song Flows Through Me"" is lovely in its simplicity, a thank-you note to a higher power that has blessed Oldham with the ability to make music.</p>
<p>Perhaps the big draw here is Oldham’s cover of ""The Cross,"" the most spiritually explicit song by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>. As it appears toward the end of his 1988 double album <i>Sign 'O' the Times</i>, the song sounds like a slightly perverse altar call, teetering between the sacred and the secular. ""We all have our problems, some big, some are small,"" he sings. ""Soon all of our problems will be taken by the Cross."" But Oldham undersells the sentiment, hinting that what sounds like a consoling promise might actually be a threat of end times reckoning.</p>
<p>As many people do when talking about God, Oldham occasionally lets language get away from him, and the project, with its strengths and weaknesses, illustrates an interesting tendency in Oldham’s songwriting. He’s not especially well known for writing about spirituality, but that may be due to the fact that he often presents God in negative terms: Oldham sees a darkness and describes it in detail, which implies a light that he either cannot or will not see.</p>

Shortly after relocating to Brooklyn in 2013, Sprague was the victim of a hit-and-run cycling accident that left her in a neck brace and unable to use her left arm. Arriving two years later, Florist’s debut full-length, <i>The Birds Outside Sang</i> reads like a record of Sprague’s brush with mortality and slow recovery. It’s an album that invites us to appreciate the mundane, to look out at the world and be awed by the majesty and fragility of it all.</p>
<p>Most of its first half chronicles the misery and isolation of convalescence; its often claustrophobic sound evokes a bedroom full of stale air. Many songs are corporeal in their fixations—blood, bones, and body parts make frequent appearances, while the world outside remains fixed behind a pane of glass. ""Morning birds sing songs like Mrs. Robinson/ Inside my head I’m a child again/ But there’s a pill for that,"" Sprague sings on the title track, the interior and exterior blurring into a medicated haze. Sprague is skilled at drawing us into her perspective with just a few words: She tends to state things plainly, in a manner that suits her often stoic delivery. Even the recounting of her accident is detached (""The rain is falling at the perfect speed/ The cars are driving at the perfect speed/ My legs are moving at the perfect speed/ My arm is moving at the perfect speed""). When she adds emphasis, it carries real weight, like the way she draws out the phrase ""It’s painful"" before following up with ""But I don’t feel pain at all"" on the haunting ""A Hospital + Crucifix Made of Plastic.""</p>
<p>Sprague wrote mostly on the keyboard while her arm was healing, and many of these songs consist of skeletal arrangements built around a single organ or synth line. Despite their simplicity, some of the album's more minimal songs are among the most memorable: the spare opener ""Dark Light,"" the slow-burning dirge ""The Birds Outside Sang,"" and the plunky fever dream ""Thank You."" Warmth creeps into the album's second half, which leans on reverb-soaked guitars and looser arrangements. There’s melancholy here too but also a much-needed goofy playfulness. ""Please come quick, I’ve stuck my head in the banister again,"" Sprague sings on ""White Light Doorway,"" before admitting, ""I just wanted to know what it would feel like/ With one part of my body alive.""</p>
<p>As the album’s sound thaws, Sprague perspective broadens, taking in the beauty of ""tall trees,"" ""cold lakes,"" and a ""stone, skipping slow""; by observing the vitality around her, she learns to appreciate her own. ""Thunderstorms, a friendly thing that reminds me I could be dead,"" Sprague sings at the outset of the record’s denouement, ""Only a Prayer Nothing More."" By the song’s close, she’s able to sum up the entire album neatly in a couplet: ""I thought that I saw the other side/ But it was only sunlight in my eyes.""</p>
<p><i>The Birds Outside Sang</i> doesn’t break much new ground nor does it aim to. It’s an unassuming, deeply personal record that manages to shoehorn some big ideas into three-minute pop songs. In so doing, it recalls some of indie’s turn-of-the-millennium high water marks: Sprague’s reverence for the natural world recalls Phil Elverum’s work under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"" target=""_blank"">Microphones</a> moniker, while the album’s shut-in, confessional feel owes a debt to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Bright Eyes</a>. Even so, <i>The Birds Outside Sang</i> quietly announces the arrival of a young songwriter whose voice is very much her own. It should be interesting to watch it develop.</p></div>"|21445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21445-the-birds-outside-sang/|7.3|Mehan Jayasuriya

It is the dystopian landscape where these worlds intersect that makes this Brooklyn group's industrial noise-rock click and hum; it is vital in its grimness.</p>
<p>On their third album, <i>Paradise</i>, Pop. 1280 get closer than ever to the theme that unites these genres—the dehumanization at the core of the technological strides toward a Big, Bold, Bright Future, the rottenness and hollowness of a world which we’ve been told is full of promise but in which all of those promises of economic stability and cultural prosperity are consistently broken. In truth, this is less speculative fiction than the constant reality of our modern lives—less a warning than an observation. ""Chromidia,"" the album’s second single, is a meditation on the constancy of surveillance—""Are you my best friend/ Are you the camera lens?"" singer Chris Bug intones, the line growing more sinister upon each repetition.</p>
<p>They also hew closer to the conventions of mid-late '80s dancefloor industrial, more <i>Front by Front</i> than <i>Songs About Fucking.</i> Tracks like ""Phantom Freighter"" and ""In Silico"" wouldn’t feel out of place at all on the pre-TVT Wax Trax! roster. This is a deeply rhythmic record, as any exploration of the tension between man and machine must be, drum machines and samplers supplementing Andrew Chugg’s live drumming.</p>
<p>Good genre work requires a certain amount of heavy-handedness in order to be recognizable, and dancefloor industrial has always relied on obvious metaphor, big beats for stompy boots and a sizeable dose of relatively simplistic teen-style angst. <i>Paradise </i>certainly isn’t lacking in these ingredients but it makes up for dynamism what it lacks in subtlety. It is more skeletal and raw in places than their two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18322-pop-1280-imps-of-perversion/"" target=""_blank"">previous</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16243-pop-1280/"" target=""_blank"">albums</a>, and more lush and thick with synth and guitar in others. This production is ultimately what makes <i>Paradise</i> such a standout; there are plenty of young industrial and noise-rock bands running hard on all cylinders, as Pop. 1280 did on their prior efforts. The extra gears and moving parts in their sound feel like necessary moves to avoid quick and certain burnout.</p></div>"|21438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21438-paradise/|7.4|Jes Skolnik

<div><i>[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.]</i></div>
</div>
<p>Even before David Bowie stepped foot in Berlin's grandiose Meistersaal concert hall, the room had soaked up its fair share of history. Since its opening in 1912, the wood-lined space had played host to chamber music recitals, Expressionist art galleries, and Nazi banquets, becoming a symbol of the German capital's artistic—and political—alliances across the 20th century. The hall's checkered past, as well as its wide-open acoustics, certainly offered a rich backdrop for the recording of <i>""Heroes""</i> in the summer of 1977.</p>
<p>But by then, the Meistersaal was part of Hansa Studios, a facility that felt more like a relic than a destination. Thirty years after much of Berlin was bombed to rubble during World War II, the pillars that marked the studio's exterior were still ripped by bulletholes, its highest windows filled with bricks. Whereas it was once the epitome of the city's cultural vanguard, in '77, the locale was perhaps best known for its proximity to the Berlin Wall—the imposing, barbed-wire-laced structure that turned West Berlin into an island of capitalism amidst East Germany's communist regime during the Cold War. The Wall was erected to stop East Berliners from fleeing into the city's relatively prosperous other half and by the late '70s had been built up to include a no-man's land watched by armed guards in turrets who were ordered to shoot. This area was called the ""death strip,"" for good reason—at least 100 would-be border crossers were killed during the Wall's stand, including an 18-year-old man who was shot dead amid a barrage of 91 bullets just months before Bowie began his work on <i>""Heroes""</i>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say: West Berlin was a dangerous and spooky place to make an album in 1977. And that's exactly what Bowie wanted. After falling into hedonistic rock'n'roll clichés in mid-'70s Los Angeles—a place he later called ""the most vile piss-pot in the world""—he set his sights on Berlin as a spartan antidote. And though <i>""Heroes""</i> is the second part of his Berlin Trilogy, it's actually the only one of the three that he fully recorded in the city. ""Every afternoon I'd sit down at that desk and see three Russian Red Guards looking at us with binoculars, with their Sten guns over their shoulders,"" the album's producer, Tony Visconti, once recalled. ""Everything said we shouldn't be making a record here."" All of the manic paranoia and jarring juxtapositions surrounding Hansa bled into the music, which often sounds as if Bowie is conducting chaos, smashing objects together to discover scarily beautiful new shapes.</p>
<p>Those contrasts begin with the album's personnel. For <i>""Heroes""</i>, the then-30-year-old enlisted many of the same players that showed up on its predecessor, <i>Low</i>, once again balancing out the effortless groove-based rock stylings of drummer Dennis Davis, bassist George Murray, and guitarist Carlos Alomar, with Bowie's own idiosyncratic work across various instruments along with the heady synth wizardry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, who took on an expanded role. Part Little Richard boogie, part krautrock shuffle, the unlikely stylistic combination hints at man's evolution with technology while throwing off sparks of sweat. Also like <i>Low</i>, the album is broken into two contrasting sides, with the vocal tracks on the front and the back made up of mostly moody instrumentals.</p>
<p>But setting <i>""Heroes"" </i>apart was the crucial addition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"" target=""_blank"">King Crimson</a> guitar god Robert Fripp, who sprayed his signature metallic tone all over many of the album's most memorable moments. According to legend, Fripp recorded all of his parts in one six-hour burst of wiry bliss and feedback, often just soloing over tracks he was hearing for the first time. That spontaneity—most of the album's jam-based backing rhythm tracks were also recorded quickly, over just two days—is part of what makes <i>""Heroes"" </i>live and breathe to this day. It's an album that is constantly morphing, never static. As Fripp's guitar is shooting electrical shocks, Bowie is bleating saxophone blasts, and Eno is summoning sonic storm clouds that pass as soon as they arrive.</p>
<p>And then there are the vocals. <i>""Heroes"" </i>contains some of Bowie's greatest vocal performances, fearless takes in which he pushes his voice to wrenching emotional states that often teeter on the edge of sanity. There's tension here, too, because while Bowie is clearly putting all of himself into the microphone like never before, he would often have no idea what he was actually going to sing until actually stepping up to record, a technique borrowed from his frequent collaborator at the time, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a>. What came out was a Burroughsian stream of consciousness that suggests elements of Bowie's personal travails—involving alcoholism, a crumbling marriage, and business woes—while also sounding abstract and shadowy. He deals with previous alter egos on ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which could be read as a kind of apology for the ill-advised, coke-fueled fantasies of fascism he was peddling just a couple of years before. He muddles sleep and death, dreams and waking life. On the iconic title track, he undercuts the song's would-be heroism by placing its title in quotes; rather than bending over backwards to elevate his own myth, ""Heroes"" puts everyday courage on a pedestal. It's an immortal track all about fleeting wonders.</p>
<p>The album's contradictory nature went beyond Berlin and its spitballing creation, too. <i>""Heroes"" </i>was released on October 14, 1977, just two weeks before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3749-sex-pistols/"" target=""_blank"">the Sex Pistols</a>' <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i> and a few months after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"" target=""_blank"">the Clash</a>'s self-titled debut LP. So as punk was whirling into a frenzy, Bowie's TV appearances around the time of <i>""Heroes""</i> doubled as acts of stoic defiance. On the Dutch program ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1kBbNDXD4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TopPop</a>,"" for example, he looked nonchalant in a smart blazer, button-up shirt, and leg warmers, effortlessly crooning the title track like Sinatra in his prime. During the song's swirling bridge, he steps away from the microphone, lights up a cigarette, and stares into the middle distance—the face of calm in an era of turmoil.</p>
<p>He repeated this trick on Italian television, turning the doomsaying instrumental ""Sense of Doubt"" into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXNSdqelHY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ominous art film</a> in which he oversees a duel between a piano and a synthesizer. To this day, the video feels dangerous, unsettling. A marketing slogan for <i>""Heroes""</i> boasted, ""There's Old Wave, there's New Wave and there's David Bowie,"" which still rings true, especially in light of such performances. With the kids coming up from behind, Bowie used his experience to carve out a different kind of future.</p>
<p>The Berlin Trilogy, and <i>""Heroes""</i> in particular, show all the signs of an artist growing up, shaking off the trappings of capitalist ego and success, and searching for a soul instead. Of course, Bowie's ego was a magnificent thing at its height, but he also understood its insatiability—how it would kill him if he did not kill it. And even in his dressed-down <i>""Heroes""</i> garb—bomber jacket, tousled short hair, jeans—he couldn't escape his own magnetism; in fact, seeing how cool Bowie looked without all the makeup and costumes could make him seem even more untouchable. At 30, he was content with his art, happy to explore humankind's existential struggles while living in a divided, war-torn city. Berlin gave him perspective and compassion. It allowed him to be small. To let his guard down and his mind wander. To begin to come to terms with his own mortality. ""We'll do anything in our power to stay alive. There's a feeling that the average lifespan should be longer than it is. I disagree,"" Bowie told <i>Melody Maker</i> in October '77. ""I mean, we've never lived so long. Not so very long ago no one lived passed the age of 40. And we're still not happy with 70. What are we after exactly? There's just too much ego involved. And who wants to drag their old decaying frame around until they are 90, just to assert their ego? I don't, certainly.""</p></div>"|21487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21487-heroes/|10.0|Ryan Dombal

<div><i>[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.]</i></div>
</div>
<p>The thing to know about David Bowie's 1979 album <i>Lodger</i> is that there really isn't anything special to know: No creation myth, no alter ego, no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY77zDzNmYw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10-minute-long song-suites</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gy94N_mcWs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spooky instrumentals</a> or pretentious backstories about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KByxC7B9WH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George Orwell</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScVi_L817ec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock.""</a> Actually, <i>Lodger</i> might be the first David Bowie album marketed as nothing more than an album of recorded music by David Bowie. ""I would like to do something rivetingly new and, uh, earth shattering,"" he said in a radio interview a few days before the album's release. ""Every Saturday I want to do that!"" Then, self-mockery: ""<i>Let's do something earth shattering. No, let's put the telly on</i><i>.</i>"" A few minutes later, his digression on the metaphorical impacts of science fiction on personal identity is interrupted by a dog. Like, a canine, whimpering aloud while Bowie unburdens himself about inner space. ""I know it's a bore, darling,"" he says to the dog, and everyone, including David Bowie, laughs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The dog had a point: Seriousness really can be boring after awhile, <span>which might've occurred to Bowie after the cold white peaks of 1977's </span><i>Low</i><span>.</span> Sensing that high art might be losing its flavor, he went on a long, generous tour called Isolar II during which he revived the entirety of 1972's <i>Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i>, a gesture that in the context of his restlessly radical early-'70s career would've been like staging a Vegas revue. ""He's remembering that <a href=""https://youtu.be/qtbOmpTnyOc?t=92"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bone shot in 2001</a>,"" Bowie says of the dog during the radio interview. ""What a waste of a bone!"" A showman by birth and narcissist by trade, Bowie could've easily been talking about himself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Lodger</i> has 10 songs, all of which are three to four minutes long. One is a great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a> impression called ""D.J."" and another is basically a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> song with vocals by David Bowie instead of Brian Eno (""Red Sails""). The music is punky and dramatic and a little odd, with detours into reggae and near-Eastern tonalities (""Yassassin"") and nebulously exotic ""world"" sounds (""African Night Flight""), all filtered through the ears of a British guy with plenty of money and the imperial leeway to appropriate whatever he felt like. To this day, no musician has better mastered the hermetic intensity of cocaine, a drug that makes you want to have long conversations with everyone you've ever met without leaving your room.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Prior to <i>Lodger</i>, Bowie's alien status was existential, metaphorical, general—a one-size-fits-all garment for anyone convinced they'd been born in the wrong time or with the wrong body. But for as many people who saw their idealized selves in Ziggy Stardust or Aladdin Sane, <i>Lodger</i> was the first time Bowie really seemed accessible—a character with flaws and frailties, petty thoughts and grocery lists; someone who doesn't just dabble in reality but lives in it. ""Look Back in Anger"" opens with a wild panorama of guitar before devolving into a story about an angel with a cough; ""D.J."" is childish and bitchy; ""Boys Keep Swinging,"" which Bowie apparently wrote after listening to the Village People, actually does sound a little like the Village People but less secure in its sexuality. When David Bowie sings the word ""depression"" on ""Fantastic Voyage,"" it's like listening to Zeus complain about sorting lights and darks. </p>
<p>The title alone reduces his myth to something banal and transactional: No longer the Lonely Starchild gracing us with his unusual point of view, we instead meet Safari Bowie, half-drunk tourist working out his masculinity issues by haggling with street vendors, Bowie the houseguest who can't stop talking about getting ""authentic"" tacos. The first half of <i>Lodger </i>especially, with its cartoon jungles and mysterious Bedouins and Englishmen too dumb to stay out of trouble but too powerful to ever really be in it, belongs more to the colonial satire of Evelyn Waugh than late-'70s art rock. (Bowie said that ""African Night Flight"" in particular was inspired by a trip to Kenya where he met a bunch of old German pilots who seemed to spend most of their time getting drunk and the rest doing profitable crime in the bush.) Lodgers aren't heavenly beings; they're people with enough money to rent a room.</p>
<p>All this didn't just humanize Bowie, it made him whole. By the time he'd released <i>Lodger</i>, he was 32, halfway divorced and trying to keep his drug thing in check, rich and famous and still staring down the long rest of his life. ""Radical genius"" would be nice, but so would making it to 1985 and having people still remember your name. In that sense, <i>Lodger</i> is an anxious, humble album, the sound of an artist ceding the wheel to a younger generation he'd be a fool to pretend he was part of. To let the culture take him out and chauffer him for a little while. </p>
<p>Of course, he still had plenty to offer and spent the next 30 years offering it: The music videos, the generous celebrity, room-unifying songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hDbpF4Mvkw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Modern Love</a>"" and movies like <i>Labyrinth</i>, which introduced hundreds of thousands of '80s babies to Bowie the mischievous goblin king, prancing around in his tights. Stars might look pretty while they fall but all they leave when they hit earth is a big empty hole. <i>Lodger</i> is the moment when Bowie took a deep breath and started to fill it.</p></div>"|21476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21476-lodger/|8.5|Mike Powell

<div><i>[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.]</i></div>
</div>
<p>Compared to its predecessors, David Bowie's 11th studio album is noticeably reserved. ""I had no statement to make on <i>Low</i>,"" said Bowie, who could hardly write lyrics at all in the aftermath of his <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/07233-david-bowie-cocaine-low"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.A. excesses</a>, let alone fashion another extensive character study like Ziggy or the Thin White Duke. His lyrical gifts were already spread thin, and thinner still when a completed third verse was cut from ""Always Crashing in the Same Car,"" in which Bowie did his very best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> impression. Producer Tony Visconti thought it was so creepy, and potentially inappropriate given Dylan's motorcycle accident a decade earlier, that they scrapped it.</p>
<p>Bowie was hardly lucid in 1976, but you bet he knew exactly what he was doing with that verse. The mysterious injuries from Dylan's 1966 accident gave him the excuse to disappear from the rat race for years, whereas the full complement of wounds Bowie sustained in L.A. were proudly displayed for a while: the <i>Station to Station</i>-era diet of cocaine, red peppers, and milk, and the ensuing physical and psychic degradation that led him to <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/03598-david-bowie-nme-interview-about-adolf-hitler-and-new-nazi-rock-movement"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">endorse fascism</a>, fear the occult, and allegedly keep his urine in the fridge lest anyone steal it. (From a flushed toilet?) When he realized he had to leave Hollywood and kick his prodigious habit, West Berlin appealed for its anonymity, though unlike Dylan, Bowie would make his own recovery a matter of public record. Both artists were escaping paradigmatic American success by retreating into themselves. Where Dylan let rumors of death fester, Bowie opened his hermitage to the world, reinforcing his outsider myth.</p>
<p>The Bowie of this era is a tragic figure: strung out and prone to spending days awake watching the same films on a loop. He was broke from the aftermath of a bad managerial deal and drained by the related ongoing court case, and so paranoid that, after his destitute charge <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a> pushed him in the pool at the residential Château d'Hérouville studio in France, he had it exorcized to avoid being touched by the ""dark stains"" that he believed lurked at the bottom.</p>
<p>Yet Bowie's sense of purpose was at least somewhat intact. He applied exacting pressure on Iggy to make <i>The Idiot</i> as good as he knew it could be, and brought similar determination to <i>Low</i>, albeit the kind where having very few aims was its own liberating objective. Whatever they made didn't even have to be released, he told his new collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, who was brought in alongside <i>Station to Station</i>'s crack band to further develop that album's hybrid of electronic R&amp;B.</p>
<p><i>Low</i>'s first side is a beautiful futurist ruin, littered with holes left purposefully unfixed. Two decades after its release, Bowie noted that his crew ""really captured, unlike anything else in that time, a sense of yearning for a future that we all knew would never come to pass."" Visconti heightens the decay and distills the lifespan of every sound, treating Dennis Davis' drums so that he was playing along to a withered echo of his last strike, like an explosion contained in a tin can. Even Bowie's voice sounds aged and distant. Eno's sharp electronics jostle against the bolshy funk rhythms and Carlos Alomar and Ricky Gardiner's guitars, giving the record a feverish euphoria that hits like too much pseudo-ephedrine and mangles linear time. These swaggering fragments, seldom breaking the three-minute mark, promise bombastic payoffs but then fade out instead. <i>Low</i>'s first side feels like having the carpet ripped out from under you by three wizards who have plans to fly it elsewhere.</p>
<p>All this playfulness means that <i>Low</i>'s <a href=""http://www.moredarkthanshark.org/eno_int_uncut-apr01.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reputation</a> for utter desolation doesn't feel quite right. Bowie is, of course, obsessed with barriers to connection: the sudden instinct that causes him to yelp and back away from someone on ""Breaking Glass"" (""You're such a wonderful person/ But you got problems/ Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll never touch ya""), self-imposed isolation (""Sound and Vision"") and isolation from the self (""What are you gonna be/ To the real me,"" on ""What in the World""), and a semi-serious plea for lifelong companionship just as his marriage was disintegrating (""Be My Wife""). From the windows of Hansa Tonstudio (where the record was mostly finished, not tracked) the band could see into the watchtowers atop Berlin's dividing Wall. A lot of <i>Low</i>'s lyrics were extemporized, but the consistency of these ornery admissions, however fragmented, implies a self-aware desire to push past them, to hunt some trace of optimism.</p>
<p>At the end of side 1 comes the instrumental ""A New Career in a New Town,"" which plots the distance from Bowie's Anglocentric career to his new Teutonic mode, bridging the former's refractory squelched riff and the latter's dreamy gauze with a searching harmonica phrase: a regular substitute for emotion that the human voice can't reach, but a brilliantly strange idea in this context (as well as another Dylan affectation). Here, it's bittersweet, nostalgic but propelled by forward motion, and a resolution to commit to a place and escape his blue room funk. The mostly instrumental second side is a tribute to the people of the Soviet Bloc —Poland on ""Warszawa,"" and East Berlin on the remaining three songs—in which the elusive nature of side 1 subsides and Bowie's persona is subsumed into his and Eno's pulsating sequences.</p>
<p>These were carefully calibrated attempts at killing the author: Eno set out a metronome pulse, and the pair selected a random beat on which to introduce a new musical complement to the central motif. On ""Warszawa"" that’s an eerily simple piano tune that was inspired by overhearing Visconti’s infant son playing to himself; ""Art Decade,"" mostly Eno’s invention, circles around a ghostly melody worthy of ""The Twilight Zone."" Bowie shrouds the tune to ""Scarborough Fair"" inside ""Weeping Wall,"" and a lonely saxophone (played by Bowie himself) eventually joins the cathedral of male vocals and strings on ""Subterraneans."" It’s credit to their influence that these songs sound pedestrian, even a little ponderous by today’s standards, but the way they conjure lost worlds is still something to behold, like the depths of dank paintings being X-rayed before your eyes.</p>
<p>The perpetual stranger finally finds comfort in a strange land, synthesizing his dislocation (and his love of the expressionist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCcke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brücke</a> artists) and that of these broken nations with a tense, beautiful, elemental music that speaks of genuine engagement, and an empathy that seemed impossible on side 1. It makes good on the album cover's subtle joke: a still from Nicolas Roeg's <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> where Bowie’s orange hair fades into the background; the word 'Low' atop a vanishing profile. Bowie's meticulously crafted existence had always offered fans a sense of possibility. By submitting his ego to <i>Low</i>, he was able to create a new one for himself.</p></div>"|21478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/|10.0|Laura Snapes

<div><i>[Ed. Note: In light of David Bowie's passing, Pitchfork commissioned reviews of several of his classic albums.]</i></div>
</div>
<p>After a 1977 performance that still ranks among the wildest, most manic musical performances to ever hit daytime TV, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a> chats with talk show host Dinah Shore, the top-charting female singer of the ‘40s, with his collaborator pal David Bowie by his side; jazz vet Rosemary Clooney flanks Shore. Their interview is mutually respectful and endearingly sincere even as the host tries to navigate Pop’s nihilistic answers. Aiming to steer the conversation in a positive direction, she asks her guest if he’s influenced anybody, and the punk pioneer—much to everyone’s delight—nonchalantly replies, ""I think I helped wipe out the '60s.""</p>
<p>Great quote, but here’s the thing: Pop never sold enough to do that directly. Instead, it was Bowie, his most ambitious student, who revolutionized '70s music and style by uncovering the discomfort and despair of urban life that hippie idealism denied. His third consecutive UK chart-topper and U.S. Top 5 breakthrough, 1974’s <i>Diamond Dogs—</i>Bowie’s first record of original material since killing off the Ziggy Stardust character that made him an instant superstar back home—remains rooted in his still-reigning glam scene that knocked most utopian '60s rockers off the UK charts with glistening shards of pansexuality, sci-fi fantasy, and bespangled spectacle. His bleakest album until recent swansong <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blackstar</i></a>, <i>Diamond Dogs</i> is a bummer, a bad trip, ""No Fun""—a sustained work of decadence and dread that transforms corrosion into celebration. Whereas Ziggy features its titular messiah, <i>Diamond Dogs</i> has jackals that live on corpses the way Bowie fed off rotting urban culture and reckless rock'n'roll.</p>
<p>The last glam gasp of Bowie's English years, <i>Dogs</i> also sprawls toward Bowie’s forthcoming Thin White Duke persona, embracing Blaxploitation funk and soul, rock opera, European art song, and Broadway. The album cracked FM radio with ""Rebel Rebel,"" an Iggy Pop-like blast aimed at America’s teenage wasteland. Recapitulating his earlier achievements while raising their stakes, it stomped on whatever good vibes remained in British rock, and cleared the stage for punk and goth. As Bowie noted decades later, the tribal ""peoploids"" that rummage through the album’s fantastically bleak Hunger City like the orphaned pickpockets of Oliver Twist presaged a generation of Johnny Rottens and Sid Viciouses. <i>Dogs</i> envisioned a no-future future just before the next breed of pop stars lived it.</p>
<p>As befitting a post-apocalyptic work, <i>Dogs</i> was born from the frustration of failed opportunities. Bowie initially endeavored to create a TV musical adaptation of George Orwell’s totalitarian milestone <i>1984</i>—until the social critic’s widow refused permission. Around the same time, <i>Rolling Stone</i>’s London bureau arranged for Bowie and William S. Burroughs to interview each other, which introduced the singer to the author’s <i>Nova Express</i>. Immediately thereafter, Bowie began penning lyrical non sequiturs via that novel’s cut-up technique, and planned a Ziggy musical to be similarly shuffled each night. This, too, faltered, although it inspired new tunes. These two projects, sharing dystopian themes, fused together to form the mutant <i>Dogs</i>.</p>
<p>While all this was happening, Bowie shed the Spiders from Mars, who enabled his transformation from folky space oddity to eclectic, hard-rocking freak. The biggest break was with guitarist Mick Ronson, whose biting, formally schooled style and arrangements had redefined Bowie. Rather than replacing his sidekick, the singer handles most guitar parts himself, as well as contributing sax and electronic keyboards while solely producing this emphatically solo project. Tony Visconti—who oversaw 1970’s metallic <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> while providing bass guitar—returns only to assist the final mix and fulfill the singer’s request for ""Barry White strings"" on ""1984""; he’d later co-produce much of Bowie’s output. If you measure his albums by how much he calls the shots and actually plays, <i>Diamond Dogs</i> is the Bowie-est one of all.</p>
<p>He sets the scene with ""Future Legend,"" a spoken-word intro soundtracked by synths evoking dripping Dalí clocks, buzzing bee guitars quoting ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,"" and other experimental studio scuzz. This slides into the bonking backward cowbell of the title track, which filters the Stones’ slam-bam boogie through a woozy mix. ""As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent/ You asked for the latest party,"" it begins—a line Bowie later admitted as self-descriptive. Set in forthcoming years yet capturing the squalor of then-contemporary London, New York, and the Eastern Bloc nations through which Bowie recently passed, the lurid lyrics flash with gang violence: ""The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees/ Hunt you to the ground they will/ Mannequins with kill appeal."" The vibe is celebratory despite the menace, if unstable—right down to the track’s note-bending central riff. Contemporary critics mourned Ronson’s absence, but Bowie’s guitar here and throughout the album is thrillingly off-kilter with unconventional chord fragments that the Edge, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>, shoegazers, and dream-poppers alike would draw from for decades to come.</p>
<p>Because Bowie so convincingly portrayed decay, it went often unacknowledged how far he advanced his compositional and arrangement skills in just a few post-""Space Oddity"" years. Their showcase, ""Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)"" begins with Bowie growling at the bottom of his register, but even before the chorus hits, he’s wailing near the top of his tenor while Mike Garson’s tinkling jazz keys supply the sophistication Bowie’s squawking guitars deny. Topically shifting from a hustler turning tricks to a politician spewing empty promises to cocaine’s brain-freezing bliss, the suite’s interconnected segments assert that all three demand submission to all-conquering power—this concept album’s central theme. The tempo accelerates as his poetry gains density, then subsides again as the melody soars before surrendering to guitars that grind with metronomic precision until sputtering out on the root note of the opening chord on the album’s masterstroke.</p>
<p>As melodically constricted as that suite was expansive, ""Rebel Rebel"" is Bowie’s answer to all those deliciously dumb Sweet, Slade, Mud, Gary Glitter, Suzi Quatro, and T. Rex hits he indirectly enabled during glam’s peak. Androgyny is subtext to these acts, but the main man, per usual, pushes it to the forefront: ""You’ve got yer mother in a whirl/ She’s not sure if you’re a boy or a girl,"" goes the opening line, but he never definitively assigns gender: Bowie’s dissident has torn [their] dress, but wants to ""be there when they count up the dudes."" Yet there’s nothing ambiguous about that glorious guitar groove, the track’s stomping beat, the ""hot tramp"" pause between both, and their return. If Bowie often drifted above listeners’ heads, here he shoots straight at their solar plexus and scores with what ranks among the greatest, most insistent riffs of the '70s. Rockers who’d dismissed Bowie as a dandy now gave the dude a pass.</p>
<p>Aside from a stray super-Bowie line about lizards crying in the heat, side 2's opening track, ""Rock ‘N Roll With Me,"" is even more forthright—a ballad of appreciation for his fans that provides reprieve from the sleaze and offers further proof that Bowie could belt. It’s stagey to be sure, but so is it sincere. ""I’ve found the door that lets me out,"" he positively roars; performance sets him free.</p>
<p>The album is queasy soul music signifying soullessness; on the <i>Shaft</i>-like tableau ""1984,"" he rewrites Orwell’s authoritarian state as a worldwide ghetto populated by junkies overseen by surgeon thugs who manipulate thoughts and misguide identities, all set to wah-wah guitars. The album culminates perversely, joyfully, as ""Big Brother"" segues into ""Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family,"" a fuzzed-out danse macabre where irregular time signatures alternate every few measures and the percussion keeps changing accents; there’s no center, just brief, blissful release before a stuttering loop of Bowie yelping in distress fades as if to black.</p>
<p>All this hopelessness and annihilation would be suffocating if it weren’t for Bowie’s exuberance. He throws himself into Orwell’s draconian hell as if strutting around in Kansai Yamamoto’s <i>Aladdin Sane</i>-era bodysuit; it fits his skeletal contours. Determined to reaffirm his relevance in spite of his setbacks, the singer sparkled so brightly that he offset the darkness of his material. Just as Watergate was coming to a boil, singer-songwriters and prog-rockers were glutting the charts, and '60s resistance was morphing into '70s complacency, this sweet rebel (rebel) made revolution strangely sexy again. Glaring at you from <i>Dogs</i>’ cover with canine hindquarters and emaciated features like the circus sideshow <i>Freaks</i> he footnotes in the title cut, he served notice that rock’s outsiders remained more compelling than the softies who increasingly occupied its center, even as his ever-growing popularity chipped away at it. You can bet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Patti Smith</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">the Ramones</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"" target=""_blank"">Television</a> sat up and took notes.</p></div>"|21477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21477-diamond-dogs/|9.0|Barry Walters

<p>In the summer of 1974, as he was traveling across America on his mammoth <i>Diamond Dogs </i>arena-rock tour, David Bowie got deeply into soul music. By July, he was spiking his live sets with covers of the Ohio Players' ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwOMPlQvkc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here Today and Gone Tomorrow</a>"" and Eddie Floyd's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kceiks__PsE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Knock on Wood</a>,"" but he was even more interested in what was happening in dance clubs—particularly the new disco coming out of Philadelphia International Records. Bowie booked a mid-tour recording session at Sigma Sound, the studio where Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff were constructing the sound of Philadelphia. But he wasn't working with Gamble and Huff, or indeed any of the studio's house musicians: He had something else in mind.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The soul-inspired album that came out of the Sigma Sound recordings, <i>Young Americans</i>, was yet another new direction for an artist who staked his career on ceaselessly finding new directions. It was also the first time he’d made an album whose chief purpose was pleasure. There’s nothing like the apocalyptic visions of <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> and <i>Diamond Dogs</i> on <i>Young Americans</i>; it’s as smart as anything he’d recorded before it, but also relaxed and limber-hipped enough for his hardcore fans’ less alienated big sisters and little brothers to get into. And it was the first of his records to feature Carlos Alomar, the ingenious rhythm guitarist who would become his live band’s musical director for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Bowie had met Alomar at a session early in the year, when he'd produced the Scottish pop singer Lulu's covers of his own ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH6Kxkj5_qs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch That Man</a>."" He drafted Alomar in to play at the Sigma Sound sessions, and Alomar brought along a couple of singers: his wife, Robin Clark, and his best friend, the then-unknown Luther Vandross. Always quick to recognize talent, Bowie immediately got Vandross and Clark in on the recording.</p>
<p>At those sessions, Bowie recorded enough songs for an album (reportedly meant to be called either ""The Gouster"" or, more cynically, ""Shilling the Rubes"")—although it would've been very different from the <i>Young Americans</i> we know today. Its most radical gesture would have been ""John, I'm Only Dancing (Again),"" a rewritten and discofied version of a snarling, homoerotic glam-rock single from three years earlier. (Bowie didn't actually release ""John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)"" until 1979; it was a minor hit in England and ended up on his <i>Changestwobowie</i> compilation.)</p>
<p>""Young Americans"" the song was a hybrid of contemporary soul (the Vandross-led backup singers were all over it), the hyper-emotive '50s singer Johnnie Ray, and—another recent obsession of Bowie's—the up-and-coming New Jersey songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, whose song ""It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City"" Bowie covered at Sigma Sound. It was also <i>very</i> current: Bowie sang ""Do you remember President Nixon?"" in the middle of a song he'd started recording three days after Nixon's resignation.</p>
<p>After that initial burst of productivity, the <i>Diamond Dogs</i> tour resumed, now so deeply influenced by Philadelphia soul that it was nicknamed the ""Philly Dogs"" tour. Bowie ditched most of his elaborate stage design, and added an opening set by the ""Mike Garson Band""—his own group, fronted by Vandross and Clark. (Their set included a terrific Vandross original, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qEDfcgqzpM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Funky Music</a>,"" as well as a reworked version of Bowie's hippie mantra ""Memory of a Free Festival."") One of the new additions to Bowie's own set was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09U7x6YaTMw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">medley</a> of the Flares' ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmKw1ebNxH8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Foot Stompin'</a>"" and the old jazz standard ""I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate,"" powered by a funk riff Alomar had come up with.</p>
<p>When the group returned to the studio in November to try to get a little more uptempo oomph into the album, they unsuccessfully tried to record ""Foot Stomping."" They did, however, come up with two killer additions to <i>Young Americans</i>: Bowie's dreamy, spiraling slow one ""Win,"" and his lyrical rewrite of Vandross's ""Funky Music"" as the haunting ""Fascination.""</p>
<p>Bowie had also befriended <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"" target=""_blank"">John Lennon</a> around that time, and invited him along to play guitar on a cover of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">Beatles</a>-era song ""Across the Universe"" at a final session in January, 1975. (Also present then, for the first time on a Bowie record: drummer Dennis Davis, who would go on to be the hidden rhythmic genius of all of his records up through 1980's <i>Scary Monsters</i>.) ""Across the Universe"" is the album's one genuine embarrassment, Vegas-y and bathetic. But bringing Lennon in yielded an unexpected dividend: Alomar's ""Foot Stompin'"" riff, a bit of arrangement brainstorming from Lennon, and a sharp, bitter lyric from Bowie combined, very quickly, into the stunning funk track ""Fame."" (<i>Young Americans</i> ended up being curiously Lennon-heavy: there's even a slightly mangled line from ""A Day in the Life"" in the middle of ""Young Americans."")</p>
<p>""Fame"" was a knockout, the song that gave Bowie his first American #1 single, and the soul world that he so admired took it to heart. By November, 1975, it landed Bowie on ""Soul Train."" (He wasn't the first white solo performer to play the show, but he was close.) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"" target=""_blank"">George Clinton</a>, by his own admission, <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/14/how-to-stay-cool-as-fuck-forever-according-to-george-clinton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">modified its groove</a> into ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UypeE3zTwBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)</a>."" And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"" target=""_blank"">James Brown</a> paid Bowie the ultimate backhanded compliment: The instrumental track of his 1976 single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vn--qcqxXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)</a>"" was a note-for-note duplicate of ""Fame.""</p>
<p>In the context of Bowie's flabbergasting '70s, <i>Young Americans</i> is distinctly a transitional record. It doesn't have the mad theatrical scope of <i>Diamond Dogs</i> or the formal audacity of <i>Station to Station</i>; at times, it comes off as an artist trying very hard to demonstrate how unpredictable he is. You couldn't mistake it for an actual Philly soul record, although like the LPs Bowie was devouring at the time, it often comes off as hits-plus-filler. Still, a good deal of the filler is lovely, and recording funk and disco in 1974 put him <i>way</i> ahead of the curve. While there had already been a handful of disco hits on the pop charts, no other established rock musician had yet tried to do anything similar, and Bowie pulled it off in a way that not only didn't seem crass but gave Luther Vandross his big break.</p>
<p>The album was also a vehicle for Bowie to address one of his favorite topics—pop stardom—from a new angle, at a moment when it seemed likely to destroy him. (""Fame"" shares its title with a Broadway show about Marilyn Monroe's life that closed after one performance in November, 1974; thanks to Bowie's disastrous management deal at the time, its quarter-million-dollar loss effectively came out of his pocket.) When Bowie <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/18/arts.highereducation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about lower-case fame</a> with Tracey Emin in 2001, he was a bit more sanguine about it: ""There is nothing there to covet.... I understand that it doesn't even get you a Madonna ticket these days. So I won't be recommending it to my offspring. Having influence is more rewarding for feeding ego."" He had nothing to worry about on that score.</p></div>"|21488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21488-young-americans/|8.7|Douglas Wolk

But this is the rubric Future listeners now consult when he drops a mixtape: Just how lost and broken <i>does</i> Nayvadius Cash sound this time around? Is his life still a grim parade of the saddest, most transactional sex you can imagine two humans having? (Last year’s LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dirty Sprite 2</i></a> had a minor-key song called ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gROnfdw63pE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Groupies</a>"" that sounds like a funeral march.) Just how many mournful references to <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=percocet"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">perkys</a>, <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Zan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zans</a>, and <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/promethazine.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promethazine</a> does he make?</p>
<p>If you’re new to the Supervillain Stage of Future’s career, a quick primer on how we got here: Mix one part noxiously awful publicity (Future cheated on universally beloved R&amp;B singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"" target=""_blank"">Ciara</a>, breaking the public’s perception of the pair as an idealized super couple); one part savvy embrace of resulting notoriety (the phase was kicked off with 2014’s aptly titled mixtape <i>Monster</i>); and one part obsessive focus on a single aesthetic—mostly one or two producers per mixtape, short track runs, and a single uniform vibe. Out of this mushroom cloud sprung the obsessive online community known as #FutureHive, and it can be a weird place to spend time: I’ve seen fans expressing ambivalence or even disappointment upon learning that Future may not in fact be the <a href=""http://watchloud.com/future-why-he-talks-about-drugs/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">codeine-crazy</a> drug addict he plays in his songs. </p>
<p>This sort of dance-of-death vicariousness is nothing new in rap (see: ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuyEgvCVYd8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Feel Like Dying</a>""-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>, which could also be a <i>Monster</i>-era Future song title), nor is this childish magical thinking about artists by fans. But Future’s taken this poisoned chalice and run further with it than anyone in rap since Wayne at his druggy peak. To listen to Future’s output right now is to feel concerned for him, repelled by him, and slightly coated in slime from association. His best and most potent songs should make you feel a little nauseated, a little sad, and exultant all at the same time. </p>
<p>This is the place to note that <i>Purple Reign</i>, his latest mixtape, is a relatively weak dose of Dirty Sprite. Heard in the context laid out above, the den-of-sin air has cleared a bit. The lights have started to come up (or maybe your eyes are adjusting), the feeling that something unspeakable is about to happen has receded. It’s a fine tape, but considered in the run of the most vital rapper working, relatively minor.</p>
<p>The beats on Future’s best work give off an eerie, muted light, like alien eggs glowing beneath a blanket, but the music on <i>Purple Reign</i> is some of the least distinctive work his star producers (Metro Boomin’, Southside, Zaytoven, Nard &amp; B, and others) have ever given him. A few of the beats here, like ""Hater Shit"" and ""Wicked,"" are so minimal they almost resemble presets. Future's delivery also hits a few rough patches: The chorus to ""Drippin (How U Love That)"" is a dishearteningly direct <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32924-fetty-wap/"" target=""_blank"">Fetty Wap</a> imitation, and his groaning, stomach-pains cadence on the ""Never Forget"" chorus is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> rip. Meanwhile, one of the best songs (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17924-future-inside-the-mattress/"" target=""_blank"">Inside the Mattress</a>"") feels like a stealth rewrite of last year’s classic ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17407-future-march-madness/"" target=""_blank"">March Madness</a>.""</p>
<p>The project doesn’t feel uninspired, exactly, just <i>rushed</i>. The best songs on <i>Purple Reign</i> still capture that shivering, waking-nightmare energy. ""Perkys Calling"" is downcast and beautiful, a piano ballad full of Future’s heat-lightning one-line observations: ""Everything around me turn to fast food,"" he mumbles, an abstract line that manages to be feel more heartbreakingly specific the more attention you devote to it. ""I had to take a loss so I could cherish that shit,"" he declares on ""Never Forget,"" maybe the world’s best philosophy. On that same song, he defies his characterization as a destructive force, someone who uses people up and throws them away, by acknowledging the family members he has hurt by selling them drugs. He might be a monster, but he has a conscience.</p>
<p>But then there's the closing title track, where he briskly snuffs out this ember of humanity, declaring syrup his ""girlfriend,"" compares himself to a heroin trafficker and a terrorist, and tells a rival ""until you gunned down, we ain’t gon' never have closure."" Playing the heel is tiring work, and Future sounds convincingly exhausted. Sounding convincingly exhausted, in fact, is one of his biggest gifts. The way he records his vocals, and the sensitivity he uses to explore its smallest inflections, shows a producer’s mind as well as a rapper’s. Listen to the slight catch in his voice while repeating ""purple reign""; these are the moments that draw in #FutureHive, the moments that bottle and sell a helpless wail of pain.</p></div>"|21496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21496-purple-reign/|7.2|Jayson Greene

While the movie was a sendup of the tropes of all things superfly and jive, the soundtrack was an earnest homage, full of wah-wah's, the vibes and echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"" target=""_blank"">Curtis Mayfield</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2054-isaac-hayes/"" target=""_blank"">Isaac Hayes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"" target=""_blank"">James Brown</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28505-24-carat-black/"" target=""_blank"">24-Carat Black</a>. His next effort, 2011's <i>Something About April</i> (presented by his band, Venice Dawn) was also a soundtrack. Though it was full of psychedelic, trippy funk, doo-wop, and rhapsodic horns, it also called in the talents of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7157-the-funk-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Funk Brothers</a>' guitarist Dennis Coffey and Italian cinematic funkateers Calibro 35, and incorporated lessons learned from studying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Ennio Morricone</a>, resulting in a project that was more tender and nuanced. But the film—about a love affair between a young interracial couple in the '60s—did not exist, and the album brought to the fore Younge's ""extreme obsession"" (his own words) with the soundtrack format.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Something About April II</i> represents a return to this love for Younge, who masterminded two audio stories of Shaolin soul fronted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface Killah</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17872-ghostface-killah-adrian-younge-twelve-reasons-to-die/"" target=""_blank""><i>Twelve Reasons to Die</i></a> and its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20722-twelve-reasons-to-die-ii/"" target=""_blank"">sequel</a>), as well as projects with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29161-souls-of-mischief/"" target=""_blank"">Souls of Mischief</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31129-the-delfonics/"" target=""_blank"">the Delfonics</a> in recent years. Where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17811-the-delfonics-adrian-younge-presents-the-delfonics/"" target=""_blank""><i>A</i><i>drian Younge Presents the Delfonics</i></a> showcased what Younge was capable of as a producer when aided by strong songwriters, <i>April II</i> highlights his accomplishment on his own terms. For all of his leanings on history and reverence for the musical past, Younge has always been a child of hip-hop. The first <i>April</i> record was crafted by someone clearly in love with breakbeats and seemed to aspire to become new sources for crate diggers. (Tellingly, that album was used as source material twice on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Z</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18247-jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magna Carta Holy Grail</i></a>—""<a href=""https://vimeo.com/80930630"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Picasso Baby</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSdD4htGv_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heaven</a>""—and Younge's compositions provided the samples for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Premier</a>'s and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28303-royce-da-59/"" target=""_blank"">Royce da 5'9""</a>'s <i>PRhyme</i> album.) But on <i>Something About April II,</i> Younge emerges as someone more interested in creating new classics than new samples.</p>
<p>As always, the music here leans heavily on a roughly five-year slice of Black soul from '68-'73 with Younge helming a Hammond organ, Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone, and the Selene, a one-of-one hi-tech lo-fi Mellotron keyboard of his own creation. But the songs here are more fully formed than anything he's done on his own. ""Sandrine,"" featuring frequent vocal collaborator Loren Oden, is breezy, with acoustic guitar and a lyrical confidence unseen in Younge's earlier work. ""Let's treasure every moment that we share/ Cherish what we have for all time,"" Oden sings, stretching out and deepening the last two words into a small riff that sounds like it belongs in another song, but fits perfectly. A pair of duets by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28928-laetitia-sadier/"" target=""_blank"">Laetitia Sadier</a> (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"" target=""_blank"">Bilal</a>—""Step Beyond"" and ""La Ballade""—benefit from Sadier's cool phrasing, placed atop deep bass grooves that are smart enough to play the background and strong enough to disappear when they're not needed. When Younge revisits blaxploitation aesthetics—""Winter Is Here,"" with Israeli singer/songwriter Karolina; ""Magic Music"" featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14945-raphael-saadiq/"" target=""_blank"">Raphael Saadiq</a>; Karolina and Sadier's ""Hands of God""—it's with an obeisance that dares to push things outward into soaring vocals and complex arrangements, making everything sound familiar and new.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Something About April II</i>, although teasingly short—most numbers here clock in under three minutes—sounds like music for music's sake, not existing solely for samples or as reverence. Even when left largely to his own musings—on the instrumental ""Sea Motet"" and the sparsely accented ""April Sonata""—Younge presents whole thoughts that move with a fluidity that he's seldom exhibited in the past. In short: he's gotten better at everything he does.</p></div>"|21442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21442-something-about-april-ii/|8.0|kris ex

On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17705-little-simz-gratitude/"" target=""_blank"">Gratitude</a>,"" her single from her debut, she raps, ""Put my feet in the studio and call it my home while others have got no way out,"" and the listener understands the severity of the stakes. Music is her escape and it is because of music that she is later able to dive deeper into her psyche and those of the people she uses as characters in her songs. ""I ain’t never had a chance to do what I love,"" she says later in the song. ""Ain’t nobody been encouraging me. I just stay indoors dreaming.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On her latest mixtape, <i>AGE 101: DROP X</i>, she peels back even more layers, discussing the scheming of her family and friends in an uncompromising world and the mounting pressures she experiences as her career continues upward. ""Why don’t they like seeing women in charge? Shit I’ve seen left me mentally scarred"" she raps on ""Savage."" Despite this, <i>DROP X</i> feels warmer and lighter than any of Little Simz' other records, and more confident. The production is sharper than anything she’s previously done, aligning with a more progressive electronic sound that weaves in between the Afrofuturism of indie R&amp;B and post-dubstep experimentations. She also has more collaborators here than ever before, from the honey-voiced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32241-jesse-boykins-iii/"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Boykins III</a> to the slow and viscous flow of Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32461-mick-jenkins/"" target=""_blank"">Mick Jenkins</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Interlude,"" which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33317-bibi-bourelly/"" target=""_blank"">Bibi Bourelly</a>, is the strongest track, beginning with a warm guitar strum and a cold, steady coupling of drum machine and percolating synths. It sounds as fit for a singer as a rapper, and a large portion of the song is given to Bourelly. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30349-dawn-richard/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Richard</a>’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ach8Jjcg4MM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adderall/Sold (Outerlude)</a>,"" ""Interlude"" examine the pull of substances, the truth in things (pills, whiskey) that should only be temporarily enjoyable and not permanent solutions. Both songs are sad on the surface, but underneath is a level of hope: ""Staying busy working on my shit/ How else can I be great?"" Simz asks. More than most artists, Simz puts all her hope in her work; her work is her passion, the thing that helped her escape.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There is a lot of despair in Simz’s lyrics, pulling against that hope. She raps of the trials of the brutalized black body, stripped of its humanity before it has a chance to grow and thrive (""They ain't even have the one-off chance to become the greatest,"" she raps on ""Kiki's Future"") as well as her desire to keep going, regardless. She raps, ""Still I'm hella angry at the system/ Young black woman, who the fuck is gonna listen to me now?"" knowing full well the things stacked against her (her gender, her race) and still she keeps pushing. <i>AGE 101: DROP X</i> is her 10th release.

He's capitalized on his celebrity as well as any veteran rapper: He’s just recently spun <a href=""http://deadline.com/2015/11/snoop-dogg-youtube-series-ggn-revolt-tv-1201615165/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a web-series into a legitimate TV talk show</a>, he’s still nursing and <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/21/snoop-dogg-launches-merry-jane-a-pot-flavored-lifestyle-media-platform/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">launching on-brand marijuana industry investments</a>, he makes headlines <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/14/snoop-dogg-in-foul-mouthed-rant-to-bill-gates.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ranting to Bill Gates about Xbox on Instagram</a>. But his music felt like a listless afterthought (remember <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20435-bush/""><i>Bush</i></a>?). Daz Dillinger, Snoop’s cousin, has kept a lower profile: Despite producing for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a> on albums like <i>All Eyez on Me</i>, his biggest headlines of recent years are probably from him <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/09/dogg-pound-4-life-movie-daz-dillinger-suge-knight/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trying desperately to get a Dogg Pound biopic off the ground</a>. Still, the two have never stopped recording music together. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Cuzznz</i>, a full-length collaboration between Daz and Snoop, was announced with the October release of a new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"">Dâm-Funk</a>-produced song called ""Sho You Right."" Another new single, ""Best Friend,"" followed, but the album is primarily an outgrowth of years-old mixtape material repurposed as album filler. New songs pepper the tracklist instead of providing its substance, and several of the recycled tracks were throwaways to begin. Adding to the album's ""what is this thing?"" quality: A limited hard-copy version was supposedly released last fall, but it’s just recently become available digitally. <i>Cuzznz</i> was also released by a record label apparently operated by Daz Dillinger himself, and, a handful of new songs aside, it seems entirely possible that Snoop isn’t aware that his cousin has compiled this effort.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of the 14 songs on <i>Cuzznz,</i> around three are exclusive to the album. The newer songs, including previously released tracks from an EP last year, offer the only continuity here, largely attributable to Dâm-Funk. Dâm's’s production on the album, the type of low-stakes but infectious funk boogie he mined for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18801-7-days-of-funk-7-days-of-funk/""><i>7 Days of Funk</i></a>, is the sustained highlight. ""It’s Not a Secret,"" an Auto-Tune-laced glider, brings the best out of Snoop’s lazily conversational delivery. ""Have U Eva"" accomplishes the same trick, and Daz’s contrastingly shouty verse here might be his best on the project. ""N My System"" is an off-kilter spin on the same sound; the track is chunkier and a looped up cowbell lends an unexpected flair to the beat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">By contrast, the oldest song here, ""Keep’a N***a High,"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QYQ8mjWTwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dates back to 2012</a> and was a sparsely produced dud back then too. A couple of other older songs, like ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Phenomenon,"" come off like failed experiments, and neither neither rapper escapes looking awkward. The generic reggae hip-hop beat of ""Six N’Da Morning"" offers Snoop a chance to revisit the unfortunate, forced Jamaican patois of his 2013 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17920-snoop-lion-reincarnated/"">Snoop Lion</a> persona. The song also highlights the type of clunky bars Snoop has stretched thin for years: ""We headed to the hookah bar/ Man, I’m chilling like a superstar,"" he says, only half-rapping. The same delivery might work over different production, but here it snags: These days Snoop can’t reliably carry a beat so much as slip into it.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Cuzznz </i>is breezy and digestible, a funky outlet for the type of relaxed rapping that both artists can still spew out endlessly. Unfortunately, the album’s low points are the most memorable, not only because the music is sloppy and dated, but because the songs feel so awkwardly cobbled together from previous projects. Especially for a pair of accomplished veterans, the album functions primarily as unnecessary compilation. If anything, <i>Cuzznz </i>might leave a fan wanting less instead of more.</p></div>"|21440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21440-cuzznz/|6.1|Jay Balfour

Instead of morphing into the bright symmetry of a butterfly, a caterpillar becomes a dull and monochromatic flicker, flying in meaningless orbits around a light source and sometimes annihilating itself in it. There’s something familiar in this pattern, though; it resembles something as exposed and human as falling in love. ""We liked the idea of the moth as a metaphor for vulnerability,"" Caroline Polachek of Chairlift said <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61730-chairlift-talk-new-album-moth-ch-ching-working-with-beyonce/"">in an interview with Pitchfork last year</a>. ""There are risks everywhere, but it doesn’t question them.""</p>
<p>""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17911-chairlift-crying-in-public/"" target=""_blank"">Crying in Public</a>,"" one of the advance singles from the duo’s new album, <i>Moth</i>, is about being so overwhelmed with emotion, with the feeling of falling in love, that the narrator starts crying on the train. ""Each autumn leaf and passing breath,"" Polachek sings. ""Each antidote to sudden death."" The song captures the near-panicky edge to this feeling, the moment your environment becomes so charged with possibility you find yourself noticing everything: birds, breakdancers, light pouring in through trees. It's too much, and its too-muchness makes you feel small, like an exposed nerve in a vast world. On <i>Moth</i>, Polachek and her bandmate Patrick Wimberly aim to embrace this too-muchness, expanding their sound and opening themselves up, and the result is the indie pop band’s most emotionally generous and consistent effort yet.</p>
<p>""Crying in Public"" is the song on <i>Moth</i> that most resembles their earlier work, a kind of flowing and gelatinous synth pop that feels dense and enveloping, the texture of feeling itself. It seems related to the buoyancy of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8HRCacAQ-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruises</a>,"" from their debut, or to ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13065-chairlift-i-belong-in-your-arms/"" target=""_blank"">I Belong in Your Arms</a>,"" from 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16183-something/"" target=""_blank""><i>Something</i></a>, but while those records described the cellular rush of love, ""Crying"" describes love’s ability to gently create inner and outer space. There’s also a groove buried in the texture of the song, a kind of irregular flutter at its center, as if Chairlift are deliberately trying to simulate heart arrhythmia.</p>
<p>It’s in this often-fidgety percussion that <i>Moth</i> distinguishes itself from Chairlift’s other records. Sometimes it feels as if the drums were sketched out first and the songs built organically around them. Lead single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17750-chairlift-ch-ching/"" target=""_blank"">Ch-Ching</a>"" forms itself explicitly around handclaps alternating with glassy and brittle drums. It’s both animated and oddly inflexible, and the effect is disconcerting, like watching a skeleton learn how to walk. ""Show U Off"" inherits its groove from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"" target=""_blank"">Busta Rhymes</a>’ ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhigzl35sw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See</a>"" and fills its blank spaces in with nervous post-disco guitar.</p>
<p>Sometimes this instability intensifies their compositions. Closer ""No Such Thing as Illusion"" feels so empty that it sort of works like an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, its pockets of nothing enhancing the something. ""Polymorphing"" evolves through at least three different arrangements. The horn charts are possibly the most striking feature of the record; saxophones unreel in trembling ribbons or sprout from the songs in abrupt, harmonic blooms. It’s only when <i>Moth</i> loses this tailored sense of groove that it starts to feel shapeless; ""Ottawa to Osaka"" melts in and out of coherence, and ""Unfinished Business"" is only motivated by an irregular, clustering snare and Polachek’s vocal, which approaches notes as if they were mapped coordinates.</p>
<p>Sometimes the arrangements verge on fussy; there’s an airless quality to ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17850-chairlift-romeo/"" target=""_blank"">Romeo</a>,"" which is both distracting and appropriate, as the song’s about running, exhaling instead of inhaling. Polachek sings from the perspective of Atalanta, an elusive character from Greek mythology, and the drums underpinning the song give it the rhythm of one of Atalanta’s footraces, to which she would challenge her potential suitors in order to avoid marriage. ""I’m going to run/ ‘Til you give me a reason to stop/ To fall on my knees,"" Polachek sings, as if challenging someone to surprise her, as if she’s allowing herself the capacity for surprise.</p>
<p>For all of these tics and irregularities, <i>Moth</i> is overall Chairlift's best and smoothest long-player statement. As much as the singles on <i>Something</i> thrilled, it struggled for coherence from song to song. The songs on <i>Moth</i> feel related and extroverted, pulled together by a common purpose. They have a charming asymmetry, they drift in sometimes oblique and irregular patterns. This is pop that wants to show you what it’s made of.</p></div>"|21475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21475-moth/|7.6|Brad Nelson

Like many musicians before her, Friedberger has long made New York City her favorite stage. Her songs, which roll with a bouncy '70s pop nostalgia, are peppered with stories of getting sick <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4h51YBt2lA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">riding the Coney Island Cyclone</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M3oMqgLWL0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">snapping pictures in front of a sweet Lamborghini</a> on Manhattan Avenue, and the small, poignant act of<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74-iyAoMa6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> muting Taxi TV</a>. But with a bitter edge in its tone, ""False Alphabet City"" played like an earnest goodbye, to the noise, to whoever hurt her, to the false glamour of urban spaces.</p>
<p>So after over a decade of Brooklyn dwelling, Friedberger moved to upstate New York and wrote her third solo album <i>New View</i>. And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18096-eleanor-friedberger-personal-record/"" target=""_blank""><i>Personal Record</i></a> was populated with energized, electric rock songs and party-hopping anthems, <i>New View</i>’s territory is far more easygoing, more traditional in its structure. The record’s<i> </i>no-fuss, featherlight acoustic pop songs weave into one another seamlessly, Friedberger’s melodies familiar and redolent of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3092-harry-nilsson/"" target=""_blank"">Harry Nilsson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a> without playing like nostalgia. But even if <i>New View</i>’s overall aesthetic<i> </i>may pair nicely with your laziest summer Sunday morning, there’s an undercurrent of serious melancholia in Friedberger’s writing here, setting it apart tonally from her previous two records.</p>
<p>What’s palpable on <i>New View</i> is a sense of loneliness. You might even say hermitry, as Friedberger’s writing here suggests, at times, a mindset distanced from physical society. The hazy ""Open Season"" plays like Friedberger writing a letter to a long-lost friend or lover whose whereabouts she doesn’t know. ""Is it freezing over there? I’m opening a tree museum, that’s my new hobby,"" she sings, seemingly poking fun at how settled her life has become. On ""Cathy With the Curly Hair,"" a bopping, synth-laden outlier, Friedberger goes through the calendar months recounting memories of an unraveled relationship. In a year when catching up on an old friend’s whereabouts is as easy as Googling their name, <i>New View</i>’s ponderings might seem anachronistic, too reliant on in-person communication. But perhaps we all know by now that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">loneliness can be just as prevalent</a> in a hyper-connected present.</p>
<p>An interesting thread throughout <i>New View</i>’s equal parts wistful and frustrated tales of breakups is how often Friedberger explicitly refers to writing about them. She mentions that she knows she'll write about someone, to the experience of listening to her own songs when she has nothing more to say, to her own stage fright. On ""Never Is a Long Time,"" Friedberger invokes the cynical energy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10993-lindsey-buckingham/"" target=""_blank"">Lindsey Buckingham</a>’s <i>Tusk</i> cuts, particularly ""Walk a Thin Line,"" as she sings of a relationship's undoing in an uncharacteristically low and trembling voice, a single drum banging haphazardly in the background. ""We are less than nothing, nothing is a perfect rhyme,"" she sings.</p>
<p>In the past, Friedberger has loaded her music with little pedestrian anecdotes that feel specific to her songwriting, bits of wordplay and vivid descriptions of acquaintances and locations. Sometimes she gets there on <i>New View</i>, particularly on ""Does Turquoise Work?"" and ""All Known Things"" which includes kissing in a mausoleum, but the album is largely devoid of these lyrical quirks. In their place is a kind of self-aware storytelling that plays like Friedberger is letting us in to a very personal process. At times <i>New View</i> can seem like a concept record detailing Friedberger's ambivalence about her main gift: spinning fragile memories and feelings into accessible songs.</p></div>"|21380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21380-new-view/|7.8|Hazel Cills

Suede are releasing a new album mere weeks after Bowie did the same—just like in March 2013, when both parties released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17855-david-bowie-the-next-day/"">comeback</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17779-suede-bloodsports/"">records</a> following decade-long hiatuses. And while the timing may be purely coincidental, it’s an uncanny circumstance for a band that, throughout the '90s, provided the most resounding reminder of Bowie’s early-'70s supremacy, and helped rehabilitate his rep amidst a career nadir for a new generation of pretty things. Listening to <i>Night Thoughts</i> now is like hearing a eulogy from a favorite son—from its quasi-conceptual structure to its stardust-speckled guitar riffage to its abundance of misfit anthems and concert hall-crumbling ballads, the record is a testament to Bowie’s steely determination to make every song a seismic event.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That said, Suede are like the faithful scions who inherited the old family home, but didn't do much redecoration. They</span> never shared their godhead’s flair for radical reinvention and experimentation; their discography effectively imagines an alternate 1975 where Bowie never went to Philly and continued to mine the dark majesty of the<i> Aladdin Sane</i>/<i>Diamond Dogs</i> era on through the '80s. The parameters of their sound were pretty much set with their first two albums—1993’s snappy, scrappy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> and 1994’s darkly ornate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dog Man Star</i></a>—and the records that followed slid back and forth between those extremes. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17779-suede-bloodsports/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bloodsports</i></a>, their laudable 2013 return effort, hedged its bets by positioning itself smack dab in the middle of that spectrum, with the album’s invigorating first side balanced by a weightier second act. Their comeback now assured and their bravado fully restored, with <i>Night Thoughts</i>, Suede once again leap up off the dancefloor to swing from the chandeliers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Night Thoughts </i>isn’t a rock opera per se, though it gamely assumes the form of one. Several songs bleed into one another through swirling interstitials; the opening track is reprised in the penultimate position, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>-style; and it sounds like at least half the recording budget was spent on the orchestra. It’s also accompanied by a fitfully bleak feature-length film (directed by NME photographer/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/"" target=""_blank"">Libertines</a> documentarian Roger Sargent) that shows a drowning man’s reminiscences about the familial tragedy that’s driven him to commit suicide in the sea. (The band previewed the album last fall with front-to-back live performances synced up to the film.) But the songs themselves don’t actually form a linear narrative arc, reference specific characters, or directly correlate to the visuals. They’re more discrete portraits of passion, ostracization, betrayal, and depression—hardly uncharted territory for a Suede record. But the sheer, fetishistic intensity with which Brett Anderson delivers his lascivious lyrics—coupled with the balcony-baiting, pomped-up performance of the band—makes the wounds feel newly opened and the bruises freshly pressed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That </span><i>Night Thoughts</i><span>’ cinematic companion piece centers around the story of an unglamorous middle-class family—rather than, say, the freakish, fashionable deviants that populate the band’s signature songs—underscores an essential truth about Suede today: They are no longer young people, and no longer speaking for them. Once the poster children for porcelain-skinned druggy excess, they’re now the embattled survivors sharing cautionary tales of bad decisions and dreams unfulfilled. </span><i>Night Thoughts </i><span>is framed by the opening ""When You Are Young"" and its late-album echo ""When You Were Young""—shore-crashing surges of symphonic psychedelia that dissipate into Anderson’s rueful ruminations about the idealism of youth and the impossibility of recapturing it. While the album’s title may hint at seedy suggestion, </span><i>Night Thoughts</i><span> is more about those traumatic, sleep-depriving memories that have you tossing and turning and ""tumbling out of a single bed.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a record about addiction, to be sure, but to an intoxicant more elusive, potent, and damaging than any street drug: desire. And like any stimulant, the highs are ecstatic (see: ""Outsiders,"" a stained-sheet celebration of odd-couple consummation, or the nostalgically </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PdKGDMhau4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>trashy</span></a><span> ""Like Kids"") and the lows are crushing (see: pretty much everything else). The titles tell you exactly what you’re getting yourself into—""I Don’t Know How to Reach You,"" ""What I’m Trying to Tell You,"" ""Tightrope,"" ""I Can’t Give Her What She Wants""—each song more desperate and depraved than the one before, culminating in the latter’s intimations of violence (""The keys are falling from her coat/ As I weave my fingers around her perfumed throat""). Though a master of evocative detail, Anderson doesn't care much for narrative exposition—rather than set a scene, he prefers to thrust you into the thick of the moment where it’s all about to fall apart. And depending on your disposition, </span><i>Night Thoughts</i><span> concludes with either with a happy ending, or a dispiriting one. The swashbuckling, orchestro-ballad finale, ""The Fur &amp; the Feathers,"" finds Anderson valorizing ""the thrill of the chase""—an optimistic suggestion that even the most bitter, agonizing breakup can’t diminish the rush of romance, or the brazen affirmation of a damaging, heart-ravaging habit that’ll inevitably lead to more sleepless nights. For the sake of Suede’s ongoing renaissance, let’s hope it’s the latter. </span></p></div>"|21417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21417-night-thoughts/|7.5|Stuart Berman

<p dir=""ltr"">As the 1990s crawled to a close, the Japanese music industry—and the nation as a whole—was at a crossroads. The economy held strong and Japan had fostered a ""cool"" image globally, reflected in the slick Eurodance-inspired songs being exported across the continent and the jet-setting sampledelica of Shibuya-kei, highlighted by genre heavyweights <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Cornelius</a> and Pizzicato Five who landed on U.S. imprint Matador Records. Yet as 2000 came into view, the mood started to change, as what many now label the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lost Decade</a>"" came of age and music sales peaked in 1999, in decline ever since.</p>
<p>Amidst all this pre-millennial tension, a quartet reared on distortion called Number Girl landed on major label EMI Music Japan and spiked the nation’s rock scene for good. They played fast and abrasive music prone to sudden tempo changes, with guitarist and lead vocalist Shutoku Mukai’s snarled vocals adding extra force and honesty to their feedback-bludgeoned songs. This wasn’t—and still isn’t—the easiest route to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfid3PY0j8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">goofy TV interviews and massive festival scream-alongs</a> in Japan, but from 1999 until disbanding in 2002, Number Girl left a deep impression on domestic listeners and carved out a cult following abroad. Universal Music Japan is reissuing the group’s three major-label albums this month, a trio of work still looming large over the country’s rock scene and among the best music to come out of the country in recent memory.</p>
<p>Mukai formed Number Girl in 1995, but his initial lineup dissolved quickly. He reached out to other musicians in Fukuoka—a city resting far south from the glitz of Tokyo—and found guitarist Hisako Tabuchi, bassist Kentaro Nakao, and drummer Ahito Inazawa. The four, all in their early twenties, drew inspiration from 1980s American indie, taking cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> among others, and sometimes nodded to their influence via lyrics or song titles (""Iggy Pop Fan Club""). Number Girl offered glimpses of what they would become across two self-released cassette tapes and their 1997 indie debut <i>School GirlBye Bye</i>: Mukai’s larynx-ripping singing, Tabuchi’s commanding guitar solos, and a lyrical fixation on adolescence. Yet in these early years, they turned to the records their idols made like CliffsNotes, leaning too much on replication rather than finding their own sound.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After moving to Tokyo in 1998, the band snagged more attention for their live shows, leading to EMI scooping them up in 1999. That summer, they broke through with <i>School Girl Distortional Addict</i>, a frantic 36-minute affair pairing pummeling noise with the catchiest melodies Number Girl ever laid down. Despite major label backing,<i>Distortional Addict</i> sounds raw, several songs opening with tape hiss and screamed countdowns, like they were coming straight from the cramped clubs Number Girl normally played. From opener ""Touch""'s pound to ""Tenkousei""'s guitar blitz, the songs here hit hard, even before Mukai’s voice tumbled in and added extra unpredictability.</p>
<p>Although Number Girl still wore their sonic influences proudly—the second song here is called ""Pixie Dü""—they had evolved from kids imitating their favorite CDs into a group confident enough to get their own voice out into the scrum. <i>Distortional Addict</i> zooms in on the teenage experience the band’s members weren’t far removed from, echoed in the album artwork and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUAnU1A38ec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for lead single/album highlight ""Toumei Shoujo."" The songs could sound angry, but were never self-loathing or cynical. Rather, they captured the confusion of leaving childhood behind and the uncertainty that follows. The characters roaming these songs grapple with the fear of mortality (on the shrapnel-sharp ""Sakura No Dance"") to the recurring desire to chase one’s dream (a reflection of Number Girl’s own decision to leave the comforts of Fukuoka for Tokyo). Yet Mukai’s songwriting made room for other viewpoints, too. ""Nichijou Ni Ikiru Shoujo"" starts as a punk-friendly mosher, but eventually everything stops and it turns into a <a href=""https://seitekishoudo.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8%E3%81%AB%E7%94%9F%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8B%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-english-translation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">half-speed meditation </a>on what leading an ""everyday life"" entails.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Distortional Addict</i> also tapped into pre-millennial anxiety, a tension that popped up frequently in other Japanese pop culture in 1999. It was there in the novel <i>Battle Royale</i> (which, like <i>Distortional Addict</i>, focused on teenagers) and in fellow Fukuoka artist (and deep fan of Tabuchi and her attention-demanding playing) Sheena Ringo’s popular debut album released just before Number Girl's. <i>Distortional Addict</i>, though, captured the vibe better than the rest, balancing anxiety about tomorrow with a sweet nostalgia for the past.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That sweetness all but vanished on the following year’s <i>Sappukei</i>, wherein adulthood’s ugly realities pushed youth away. The band had attracted a large fanbase in Japan, but also caught the ear of longtime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Rev </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Flaming Lips</a> producer David Fridmann, who stepped on to produce Number Girl’s much-anticipated follow-up (and their final album). The overall sound didn’t change radically, as the songs still mostly power ahead with a few sudden shifts in speed (and a lot of fierce solos courtesy of Tabuchi), but everything sounds grimier. Fitting, given Mukai’s sudden shift to singing about the ugly parts of urban living. Whatever optimism snuck into their previous material was snuffed out here.</p>
<p>Number Girl could still write a battering number, but <i>Sappukei </i>(translation: ""Tastelessness"") also found Mukai simply screaming more. When done right, it hit hard, like on the push-pull guitar surge of ""Zegen Vs Undercover,"" but elsewhere it just upped the volume without adding impact. <i>Sappukei</i> found Number Girl experimenting a touch more, but ultimately comes off like a transitional piece for a band starting to get restless with their sound, but not ready to throw caution totally away.</p>
<p>They got weird on 2002’s<i> Num-Heavymetallic</i>, a gleefully confrontational set from a band who easily could have by then coasted on a solid fan base. The title track opens with the sound of Mukai screaming frantically from far away before he switches abruptly into the traditional Japanese <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enka</a> style of singing, while his bandmates show they can sound just as heavy at a narcotized pace. That’s followed up by ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDoNX0lRL1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Num-Ami-Dabutz</a>,"" a lurching number constantly buzz-sawed in half by Tabuchi’s guitar. Mukai breaks into a spoken-word that gave his bleak outlook on urban life a hypnotic quality. It’s a high point in the band’s history, and definitely a favorite when trying to figure out the most bizarre song to ever crash the Japanese singles chart.</p>
<p>Nothing else on the album approached the wildness of those two songs, but the rest of <i>Num-Heavymetallic</i> highlighted the outfit’s growing interest in more fragmentary compositions. Some experiments worked better than others—""Frustration in My Blood"" is the point where Number Girl could get too aggro—and overall it doesn’t feel coherent. That was the point though—by 2002, all the artists who had captured the uneasy feeling of the new millennium a few years prior were moving on to new territory. <i>Num-Heavymetallic</i> ended up being Number Girl’s last collection, as bassist Nakao opted to step away, and the other three decided to stop the band rather than replace him. They all went on to new, successful projects, highlighted by Mukai and Matsushita’s Zazen Boys outfit, which continued down the wonky road their final album hinted at.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these vinyl reissues exist to capitalize on Japan’s current LP trend, and the only added feature—a Fridmann remastering of all three—feels unnecessary, as the often hissy sound added to these album’s charm. But they mostly feel strange because Number Girl’s music remains so visible, both in a literal sense (these have already been released as special edition CDs multiple times) and in a more abstract way. Few Japanese bands have proven to be as influential as Number Girl, with festival-headliners such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr8magEp0Ho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asian Kung-Fu Generation </a>and rising groups like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvMyCFAVIqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tricot</a> claiming them as primary influences. But even more important are the countless bands wailing away in small live houses in Fukuoka and in Tokyo’s Koenji neighborhood and in any small countryside town, because of these four, not to mention the non-Japanese listeners seeking something different, who hunted the group’s material down through Soulseek or shady message boards before YouTube became reliable. They came to prominence at a time when many felt anxious about the future, but Number Girl carried the same torch held by their U.S. indie idols and showed a whole new generation of kids in Japan they could make any music that they wanted.</p>

The four, all in their early twenties, drew inspiration from 1980s American indie, taking cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> among others, and sometimes nodded to their influence via lyrics or song titles (""Iggy Pop Fan Club""). Number Girl offered glimpses of what they would become across two self-released cassette tapes and their 1997 indie debut <i>School GirlBye Bye</i>: Mukai’s larynx-ripping singing, Tabuchi’s commanding guitar solos, and a lyrical fixation on adolescence. Yet in these early years, they turned to the records their idols made like CliffsNotes, leaning too much on replication rather than finding their own sound.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After moving to Tokyo in 1998, the band snagged more attention for their live shows, leading to EMI scooping them up in 1999. That summer, they broke through with <i>School Girl Distortional Addict</i>, a frantic 36-minute affair pairing pummeling noise with the catchiest melodies Number Girl ever laid down. Despite major label backing,<i>Distortional Addict</i> sounds raw, several songs opening with tape hiss and screamed countdowns, like they were coming straight from the cramped clubs Number Girl normally played. From opener ""Touch""'s pound to ""Tenkousei""'s guitar blitz, the songs here hit hard, even before Mukai’s voice tumbled in and added extra unpredictability.</p>
<p>Although Number Girl still wore their sonic influences proudly—the second song here is called ""Pixie Dü""—they had evolved from kids imitating their favorite CDs into a group confident enough to get their own voice out into the scrum. <i>Distortional Addict</i> zooms in on the teenage experience the band’s members weren’t far removed from, echoed in the album artwork and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUAnU1A38ec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for lead single/album highlight ""Toumei Shoujo."" The songs could sound angry, but were never self-loathing or cynical. Rather, they captured the confusion of leaving childhood behind and the uncertainty that follows. The characters roaming these songs grapple with the fear of mortality (on the shrapnel-sharp ""Sakura No Dance"") to the recurring desire to chase one’s dream (a reflection of Number Girl’s own decision to leave the comforts of Fukuoka for Tokyo). Yet Mukai’s songwriting made room for other viewpoints, too. ""Nichijou Ni Ikiru Shoujo"" starts as a punk-friendly mosher, but eventually everything stops and it turns into a <a href=""https://seitekishoudo.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/%E6%97%A5%E5%B8%B8%E3%81%AB%E7%94%9F%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8B%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-english-translation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">half-speed meditation </a>on what leading an ""everyday life"" entails.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Distortional Addict</i> also tapped into pre-millennial anxiety, a tension that popped up frequently in other Japanese pop culture in 1999. It was there in the novel <i>Battle Royale</i> (which, like <i>Distortional Addict</i>, focused on teenagers) and in fellow Fukuoka artist (and deep fan of Tabuchi and her attention-demanding playing) Sheena Ringo’s popular debut album released just before Number Girl's. <i>Distortional Addict</i>, though, captured the vibe better than the rest, balancing anxiety about tomorrow with a sweet nostalgia for the past.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That sweetness all but vanished on the following year’s <i>Sappukei</i>, wherein adulthood’s ugly realities pushed youth away. The band had attracted a large fanbase in Japan, but also caught the ear of longtime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Rev </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Flaming Lips</a> producer David Fridmann, who stepped on to produce Number Girl’s much-anticipated follow-up (and their final album). The overall sound didn’t change radically, as the songs still mostly power ahead with a few sudden shifts in speed (and a lot of fierce solos courtesy of Tabuchi), but everything sounds grimier. Fitting, given Mukai’s sudden shift to singing about the ugly parts of urban living. Whatever optimism snuck into their previous material was snuffed out here.</p>
<p>Number Girl could still write a battering number, but <i>Sappukei </i>(translation: ""Tastelessness"") also found Mukai simply screaming more. When done right, it hit hard, like on the push-pull guitar surge of ""Zegen Vs Undercover,"" but elsewhere it just upped the volume without adding impact. <i>Sappukei</i> found Number Girl experimenting a touch more, but ultimately comes off like a transitional piece for a band starting to get restless with their sound, but not ready to throw caution totally away.</p>
<p>They got weird on 2002’s<i> Num-Heavymetallic</i>, a gleefully confrontational set from a band who easily could have by then coasted on a solid fan base. The title track opens with the sound of Mukai screaming frantically from far away before he switches abruptly into the traditional Japanese <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enka</a> style of singing, while his bandmates show they can sound just as heavy at a narcotized pace. That’s followed up by ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDoNX0lRL1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Num-Ami-Dabutz</a>,"" a lurching number constantly buzz-sawed in half by Tabuchi’s guitar. Mukai breaks into a spoken-word that gave his bleak outlook on urban life a hypnotic quality. It’s a high point in the band’s history, and definitely a favorite when trying to figure out the most bizarre song to ever crash the Japanese singles chart.</p>
<p>Nothing else on the album approached the wildness of those two songs, but the rest of <i>Num-Heavymetallic</i> highlighted the outfit’s growing interest in more fragmentary compositions. Some experiments worked better than others—""Frustration in My Blood"" is the point where Number Girl could get too aggro—and overall it doesn’t feel coherent. That was the point though—by 2002, all the artists who had captured the uneasy feeling of the new millennium a few years prior were moving on to new territory. <i>Num-Heavymetallic</i> ended up being Number Girl’s last collection, as bassist Nakao opted to step away, and the other three decided to stop the band rather than replace him. They all went on to new, successful projects, highlighted by Mukai and Matsushita’s Zazen Boys outfit, which continued down the wonky road their final album hinted at.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these vinyl reissues exist to capitalize on Japan’s current LP trend, and the only added feature—a Fridmann remastering of all three—feels unnecessary, as the often hissy sound added to these album’s charm. But they mostly feel strange because Number Girl’s music remains so visible, both in a literal sense (these have already been released as special edition CDs multiple times) and in a more abstract way. Few Japanese bands have proven to be as influential as Number Girl, with festival-headliners such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr8magEp0Ho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asian Kung-Fu Generation </a>and rising groups like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvMyCFAVIqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tricot</a> claiming them as primary influences. But even more important are the countless bands wailing away in small live houses in Fukuoka and in Tokyo’s Koenji neighborhood and in any small countryside town, because of these four, not to mention the non-Japanese listeners seeking something different, who hunted the group’s material down through Soulseek or shady message boards before YouTube became reliable. They came to prominence at a time when many felt anxious about the future, but Number Girl carried the same torch held by their U.S. indie idols and showed a whole new generation of kids in Japan they could make any music that they wanted.</p>

As the cover says, the music on this short and sweet LP was written by the group’s leader and principal songwriter Sean O’Hagan to accompany a theater production of the same name, with the brief interludes and tunes meant to be woven between monologues by the play’s six characters. Initially presented in October of 2014 at the Tristan Bates Theatre in London’s Covent Garden, the intention is to eventually take the show on a tour through Europe and the U.S. But since O’Hagan has no theatrical bona fides to speak of, the only way to make it happen is to treat it like the promotional campaign for a new record.</p>
<p>Revealing <i>Rattling Trees</i> as a soundtrack from the jump puts the Llamas at an advantage and a disadvantage. It helps to explain the structure of the album, which kicks off with an overture that touches on all the melodic themes to be heard later, followed by quick instrumental bits that precede actual songs. But without the full text of the play or a chance to see it before hearing the music, these pleasant-but-slight songs become more negligible.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, too, because the play happens to be quite affecting. <i>Rattling Trees</i> uses extended anecdotes to comment on the rapid changes happening in London, particularly in Peckham, a region in the southeastern part of the city where O’Hagan has lived for over 20 years. As the performance moves along, we hear from a plumber, a cafe worker in her sixties, a decorator, a housewife, and a health fanatic, each lamenting or appreciating the monied middle class pouring into the neighborhood and bringing with them higher rents and expensive tastes.</p>
<p>With just the music to go by, the lyrics lose much of their impact. The references to the ""slogans splashed above the mess that they made"" in ""McKain James"" don’t stick as deep without first hearing the decorator tell of his youthful days spray-painting anarchist jeremiads on the walls of apartments he was contracted to work on (before covering the graffiti with wallpaper or a coat of paint). So, too, does the sparkling ""Livorno"" need the context of the plumber marveling at the pretentious attitudes of the bourgeois couple he’s working for to really give the song some weight. Other tracks fare better: The lovely ""Jackie"" leavens the melancholy of the cafe worker’s rather drab day-to-day existence with a bouncy, harpsichord-driven swing and an impeccable chorus, and the title track recalls the early solo efforts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney</a> with bulbous bass tones and electric piano.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">During the Covent Garden run of <i>Rattling Trees</i>, the members of the High Llamas were set onstage in a semicircle,with actors standing in the middle delivering their lines. This meant that O’Hagan was forced to strip back the instrumentation considerably, and he really rose to the challenge: Even without those extra <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"" target=""_blank"">Van Dyke Parks</a>-like splashes of symphonic color, the album is still instantly recognizable as a High Llamas production. Instead, the space gets filled with quick stabs of upright piano or wah-wah-ed guitar lines or, on the plucky ""Mona’s Song,"" some tight vocal harmonies repeating a single phrase.</p>
<p>The play is set in front of an old leisure centre that has been bought up by a larger company and rebranded with a new name and look. As each character enters the show, they comment on this change, often wondering why the change needed to happen. Though O’Hagan surely didn’t mean it as such, that stands as a tidy metaphor for the pop music landscape that he and his Llamas enter into every few years or so. For 25 years now, the project has wondered aloud why the songwriters of the world needed to step out of the warm bath of the orchestral pop and exotica sounds of the '60s and '70s. We can admire him for staying the course all this while, but we also need to ask: Even when the music is wrapped up within the framework of a theater performance, will there be anyone listening?</p></div>"|21458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21458-here-come-the-rattling-trees/|6.7|Robert Ham

Over a mountain of releases, he's proven that he can shred multiple times over, and that he can match that intensity in his acoustic singer/songwriter mode. It's fair to ask what else he can do at this point. With <i>Emotional Mugger</i>, we've arrived at a turning point for Segall: After inundating us for years, what can he do to keep people listening?</p>
<p><i>Emotional Mugger </i>needed to be special to stand apart—a shock to the Segall system—and he hints at a new aesthetic direction from the outset. Where his last album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19668-ty-segall-manipulator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Manipulator </i></a>opened with stately organ, the synthesizers on <i>Mugger </i>are abrasive and off-kilter. Throughout the album, he is less focused on hitting the exact right notes and more concerned with establishing an offbeat vibe, one matching the cheerful menace of the smiling doll heads on the sleeve. The pace and structure of ""California Hills"" is briefly upended a few times for short bursts of frantic guitar work, and throughout the album, he switches between his traditional singing voice and a throaty, affected mystic dirtbag caricature.</p>
<p>There's also an underlying narrative, although it <span>would be a</span> reach to call it a full-on ""concept album."" Each song seems to be an oblique short story about cheap thrills, and throughout, his metaphor of choice is candy. The album's populated with addicts—people engineered to come back for more despite how shitty it may ultimately make them feel. Sub out the word ""candy"" for pretty much any other vapid, hollow pleasure in the world (and sometimes you wish he would—I respect his wish to keep his metaphors consistent, but occasionally his repetition of the same words leads the songs to blur together).</p>
<p>Since it's an album sending up society's constant demand for instant gratification, it feels petty and impatient to occupy its world thinking, ""This hook was cool at first, but it's losing my attention."" But that's the truth of <i>Emotional Mugger</i>—a few songs just churn over the same hook, and ultimately, there's just not enough happening to hold interest. Despite an assist from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"" target=""_blank"">Mikal Cronin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a>' Dale Crover, Segall's take on Eddy Grant's Equals song ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhKd1Vzr-YQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diversion</a>"" is repetitive, unvarying, and notably less interesting than the source material.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it's a Segall album, which means his missteps are tempered by a few phenomenal performances. ""Candy Sam"" features one of his best big-tent guitar solos on record, though the album's best song is ""Mandy Cream""—there's not much else that sounds like it in Segall's discography. The drums root the song in funk (courtesy of Segall's frequent collaborator Charles Moothart) while a droning synthesizer and his guitar solo bring both percussive supplements and weird punk hooks into the fold. Also worth noting: There are vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29648-king-tuff/"">King Tuff</a>.</p>
<p>That's another major departure for Segall on <i>Emotional Mugger</i>—his team. In addition to his usual co-conspirators Cronin and Moothart, he's surrounded himself by heavy-hitters like Kyle Thomas, producer F. Bermudez (who helmed recent records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27686-gun-outfit/"" target=""_blank"">Gun Outfit</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age/"" target=""_blank"">No Age</a>), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27851-wand/"" target=""_blank"">Wand</a>'s Cory Hanson and Evan Burrows, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4819-the-cairo-gang/"" target=""_blank"">the Cairo Gang</a>'s Emmett Kelly. And with his collaborators (dubbed ""the Muggers"") at his side, he's done an excellent job of establishing an unsettling tone across the album—one where cooing moans of pleasure on ""Baby Big Man (I Want a Mommy)"" are bulldozed by him grunting the words ""BIG MAN.""</p>
<p>When Segall rolled out the album by mailing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62025-ty-segall-mails-vhs-tape-featuring-new-album-emotional-mugger/"">VHS copies</a> to writers, he shared a clinical definition of ""emotional mugging,"" explaining, ""The over-communication relayed in cell based technology and content driven media further detaches passengers of our modern society from deep emotional understanding."" Put more simply: The Internet makes everything and anything immediately available, and that's probably fucking up how people interact and have their desires addressed. It's a relevant subject without question—one he addresses on the album with varying degrees of success. Maybe its diciest moments can be chalked up to the album's inherent feeling of uneasiness, but <i>Emotional Mugger</i> still feels transitional—either the moment before he tucks in and gets way weirder or another stepping stone before he switches gears all over again.</p></div>"|21434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21434-emotional-mugger/|7.3|Evan Minsker

Based on this new record, the experience must have been a pivotal one, as<i> The Catastrophist</i> bears a subtle yet marked style change for the band—from sprawling and loose to something more cohesive, but nonetheless experimental enough so as to not alienate their core fans. The enjoyability of <i>The Catastrophist</i> is in this leap of faith, the idea that no mold is beautiful enough to remain unbroken, even if its new shape may be foreign and strange. In this case, the risk pays off.</p>
<p>You cannot listen to this record as someone who is familiar with Tortoise's output and not be somewhat taken aback by at least one facet: vocals. <i>The Catastrophist</i> is Tortoise's first album ever to prominently feature guest vocalists, and they chose wisely. Georgia Hubley of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a> provides vocals to the distorted, laid-back soul ballad ""Yonder Blue"" which makes exquisite use of her soft, choirboy voice. A cover of British singer-songwriter David Essex's 1973 hit single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liWIbE1gQTk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock On</a>,"" which is a fairly weird classic rock oddity to begin with, enlists Todd Rittman, guitarist for fellow Chicagoans <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4431-us-maple/"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Maple</a>, and his distorted, echo-y vocals make Tortoise's version sound even more languid and surreal than the original, like a Satanic call for teenagers to experience the forbidden pleasures of rock'n'roll. When Rittman curls his tongue around ""Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen/ Prettiest girl I ever seen,"" it definitely sounds more like a concrete threat than the plea of a disenchanted lover. The original song's staccato strings are replaced here by heavy synthesizers, and the result is a track that sounds both new and steeped in '70s and '80s gearhead synth-rock. It's clever and arresting, and illustrates perfectly what could be a very new direction in Tortoise's cannon. </p>
<p>That being said, some of their more conventional tracks may pale a little in comparison to their newer aesthetics, if only because their evolution has been so slow and protracted. The album's first single, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17732-tortoise-gesceap/"" target=""_blank"">Gesceap</a>,"" beings with dueling synthesizers that are then joined by the vast array of Tortoise's instrumental arsenal, until all that's left is a tornado of texture and sound. There's a lack of the slightly more rock-oriented, guitar-driven pieces the band became popular for (the urgency of their 1998 record <i>TNT</i>, for example, is absent), but it has been replaced by almost tongue-in-cheek flourishes in some places: ""Gopher Island"" clocks in at just over a minute and might seem like mid-album fodder, but multiple listens reveals it to be a weirdo bubble of retro experimental electronica, the sort of thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> or Fad Gadget would have knocked around the studio while feeding each other magic mushrooms. <i>The Catastrophist</i>'s namesake and opener is a song that begins with a synth line unironically reminiscent of a 1970s cultural television jingle, before sliding into Tortoise's hallmark atmospheric, plucked electric guitars and splashy cymbals. There's a playfulness there that, once again, belies a watershed moment for the band. As Todd Rittman howls on ""Rock On"": ""Where do we go from here?""</p></div>"|21406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21406-the-catastrophist/|6.8|Cameron Cook

They were assembled to perform “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17354-kanye-west-all-day-ft-allan-kingdom-theophilus-london-and-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">All Day</a>,” which was then slated as a single from his still-unreleased seventh album. The song had been teased, in various unfinished states, for more than a year, but Allan Kingdom, the key player in the song’s final cut, made the trip abroad with less than two days notice, and hadn’t even unpacked when he hopped onstage. Kingdom’s affecting bridge on “All Day” helped turn the song from a sleek ode to out-of-season shopping to a carefully pointed political screed, one where all the parole hearings and Farrakhan meetings are grounded in something immediate and human.</p>
<p>On Kingdom’s new mixtape, <i>Northern Lights</i>, the obvious connections between West and the Winnipeg-born, St. Paul-bred Kingdom are stylistic. The younger MC favors a musical atmosphere that marries the brooding, synth-backed minor keys of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> </i>to the more spare and visceral sounds Kanye has explored with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a> and “All Day.” Kingdom also enjoys some of Kanye’s everyman appeal circa <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/"">The College Dropout</a> </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8768-late-registration/""><i>Late Registration</i></a>, though he mines this territory less than the elder rapper. Here, weighty existential worries and simple practical hangups are allowed to simply exist next to one another; most of West’s music has dealt with, in some form, the tension between Benzes and backpacks. Allan Kingdom acknowledges both, but moves quickly onto other concerns.</p>
<p>When he <i>does</i> deal in moral panic, Kingdom is at his slickest. On “Hypocrite,” he laments, “You got fatter thighs than the one that I lied to”; on the title track, he says he’s “Trying to stack some fucking funds, fuck a lot, and have some fun,” and encourages his guest, “Leave your questions at the door, and your dress, like, half-undone.” A few songs later, on the Auto-Tune-drenched “I Feel Ya,” sex is far less trivial. The coda that includes “Tell me when to stop/ Tell me when to stop/ Feeling for you” and a warbled “I can make you feel better” is his strongest vocal performance on the tape—confused, guilty, defiant, naked.</p>
<p><i>Northern Lights </i>clocks in just under 45 minutes, but plays even faster. “Believe” benefits from a pulsing house beat, and the production as a whole is more concerned with forward motion than with virtuosity. Kingdom’s time with the Stand4rd—the four-piece St. Paul collective that also includes the producer Psymun, the rapper, singer, and producer Bobby Raps, and Corbin, who was originally known as Spooky Black—has clearly served him well. His 2014 mixtape, <i><a href=""https://allankingdomforever.bandcamp.com/album/future-memoirs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Memoirs</a></i>, was mostly excellent, but it was on the Stand4rd’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thestand4rd/sets/thestand4rd-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> that he codified his raps into something that bent and cascaded into sharp, half-crooned records. While he surrenders hook duties a few times here (most notably to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33014-dram/"">D.R.A.M.</a>, who sings about changing his cell number on “Renovate”), he’s more than capable of starting and finishing a dynamic song without ever leaving the booth.</p>
<p>Still, the strongest song on <i>Northern Lights</i> is the most autobiographical. “Interruption,” which is produced in part by the Minneapolis mainstay Ryan Olson, looks back at when Kingdom was darting from Hennepin Avenue through the city’s freeway system, lying that he’d lost his wallet to avoid paying for meals, and meeting Plain Pat, the manager that would eventually link him with West. Allan calls himself “the son of some immigrants, ‘bout to son ‘em like Africa.” And when he puts his life into plain language, it starts to come into light—the tension between the backpacks and Benzes is what set him in motion in the first place. What matters is where he goes next.</p></div>"|21490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21490-northern-lights/|7.5|Paul A. Thompson

The Londoners don’t refute either of these points—on the contrary, their madness connects them to their audience. “There are deep-set psychological issues in this band that are a bigger problem for us than drugs,” guitarist Saul Adamczewski told <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/fat-white-family-interviewed-there-are-deep-set-psychological-issues-in-this-band-that-are-a-bigger"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NME</a>, going on to add, “there’s nothing exceptional about us as drug abusers; we’re just like everybody else.” Affliction and addiction shape their twisted worldview, and while their musical translation of this mindset—infusing the darkly-shaded psychedelia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> with the cheap electronic throb of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a>—is anything but pretty on the ears, the group’s knotted noise feels inviting. On their sophomore album, <i>Songs for Our Mothers, </i>Fat White Family lead us misfits in another corrupt communion.</p>
<p>Lias Sauodi (who writes the songs along with brother Nathan and Adamczewski) finds inspiration in drunks, degenerates, domestic abusers—scummy avatars that grant him entry to the underbelly’s topsy-turvy world. (Drugs play a considerable role, of course, although one of the band’s principle songwriters, Adamczewski, primarily worked sober). The first half of <i>Songs for Our Mothers—</i>all plodding tempos, feedback fuzz, and layered whimpers—casts Lias as a strung-out participant in some depressing half-hearted orgy that begets nothing but sloth and wasted opportunity. Devoid of all flower-power optimism and good intentions, “Satisfied,"" “Love Is the Crack,” and “Duce” take on an almost funereal component.</p>
<p>Such is the Fat White Family existential cycle: drugs and delirium fuel sex, sex begets a useless life before giving way to death, and then there’s nothing. Can you blame them for casting aside trifles like dynamics and sonic variety when they <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/09/fat-white-family-band-make-your-skin-crawl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">openly admit</a> that they want nothing more than to make your skin crawl? But while Fat White Family’s nihilistic heart endows their sluggish dirge-rock with a sense of purpose (or rather, explicit purposelessness) that distinguishes them from UK contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28209-cheetahs/"" target=""_blank"">Cheatahs</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33023-slaves/"" target=""_blank"">Slaves</a>, it’s not enough to make up for the uniformity of their songwriting. Apart from the understated lo-fi pop of “Hits Hits Hits” and churning opener “Whitest Boy on the Beach,” there’s little to differentiate one jam from the next.</p>
<p>Fat White Family’s notorious live shows prove that they’ve got the brains and the insanity to make a carnal, carnivalesque classic, but <i>Songs for Our Mothers </i> doesn’t come close to that energy. Where’s the aural equivalent of the shit-smearing, or the head careening into the audience? Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19630-fat-white-family-champagne-holocaust/"" target=""_blank""><i>Champagne Holocaust</i></a>, <i>Songs for Our Mothers </i>puts too much emphasis on setting the smoky, sinister scene—upping the reverb, working in odd yelps or electronic clatter—and too little attention on establishing dynamic, compelling arrangements. </p></div>"|21436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21436-songs-for-our-mothers/|6.3|Zoe Camp

The debut was spacious and crystalline yet suffocating, somehow; the music, epic in its melancholy, made claims of a vast emotional experience that exceeded the scope of the lyrics. It didn’t help that Elena Tonra, a hushed singer in thrall to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Buckley</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6100-ian-curtis/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Curtis</a>, was writing in an idiom of frozen hearts, heavy winters, and home-wrecking floods, metaphors as dead as her idols.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the last three years, Tonra and the band have wisely ditched the notion that seriousness plus reverb equals profound art. You can hear the transformation on ""Numbers,"" <i>Not to Disappear</i>’s lead track. Tonra opens with a deadpan jibe at a mystery antagonist–""Take the worst situations/ Make a worse situation""–then, after a pregnant pause, gets down to an unsympathetic commentary on hookup culture and its grubby allure. ""I’ll wash my mouth but still taste you,"" she sighs, letting her implications linger, before serenely chanting, ""I feel numb in this kingdom.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Recorded with Nicolas Vernhes, the esteemed Brooklyn producer, the music is expansive and spangly, like staring down a deep well to glimpse a ripple of light on the water. There’s a mix of nocturnal indie-pop, gothic post-punk, doomy shoegaze, chest-beating post-rock, and resplendent dream-pop, which all comes off as a great, stellar mush. Igor Haefeli’s guitars are devoutly atmospheric, while Remi Aguilella tends to drum like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">National</a>’s Bryan Devendorf, surging forth at the first opportunity, as if to race beyond the desolate soundscape’s frame.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The only sonic outlier is ""No Care,"" a surprising nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/122-arab-strap/"" target=""_blank"">Arab Strap</a>, speak-sung by an antsy narrator whose agency shrinks as she mollifies a manipulative partner. On a record dense with allusions to imminent motherhood, it bodes ill that every relationship is ruptured by insecurity (""To Belong""), undermined by emotional distance (""Alone / With You""), or both of the above, as on ""No Care"": ""Oh, there has only been one time where we fucked, and I felt like a bad memory,"" Tonra sings. ""How I wanted you to promise we would only ever make love/ But my mouth felt like I was choking, broken glass, so I just slept it off.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For all <i>Not to Disappear</i>’s forward strides, something remains of the debut’s pallor, and with it a niggling suspicion that, despite their commercial inferiority to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">xx</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a>, Daughter have no spicy condiments for those groups’ bread and butter. But if their five-year-plan isn’t to play catch-up with festival-bait big-leaguers, a song like ""Doing the Right Thing,"" about the plight of an Alzheimer’s sufferer, suggests they have the legs to go somewhere else entirely. The song is earthy yet spectral, like an emboldened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30274-hundred-waters/"" target=""_blank"">Hundred Waters</a>, sung from the unique viewpoint of a dementia victim fully aware of her lapsing state. She drowns in lost memories–""I'll call out in the night for my mother/ But she isn't coming back for me""–yet remains privy to the big picture: ""But you will not tell me that/ Cause you know it hurts me every time you say it."" Concluding the song from in front of a television set, she sings that while ""everyone’s in love, I just sit in silence.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If she’d been attuned to <i>Not to Disappear</i>, the narrator would know the appearance of love is often a veneer. It’s an instructive double-standard: Daughter’s music spans that gap between the very real drudgery of everyday life, and the more potent stories we tell ourselves when times are bleak.</span></p></div>"|21455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21455-not-to-disappear/|6.7|Jazz Monroe

The second part, not an unfair request, invariably led to discussions of their manifestos and politics, which weren’t always easy to parse. Which is a positive.</p>
<p>Savages' music was austere, their apparent influences easy to name (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5439-siouxsie-sioux/"" target=""_blank"">Siouxsie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"" target=""_blank"">Gang of Four</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>), but what frontwoman Jehnny Beth was singing about was more complex. She might be standing up for polyamory or breaking down the patriarchy (or both). One song, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zu-PDaFg34"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hit Me</a>,"" which some people thought was about domestic abuse, was about rough consensual sex (as discussed by the porn star Belladonna). When you added these and other themes to their well-oiled live performances and specific visual presentation—the band in black, Beth dancing like Ian Curtis—it was difficult not to get excited about the group. But, as compelling a prospect as they were, I often found myself more interested in watching them live than listening to them at home on my stereo. </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17977-savages-silence-yourself/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silence Yourself</i></a> is a strong record, but in hindsight, it also benefited from much of the above—the backstory, the buzz, the complementary material. So, in that sense, it’s especially interesting returning to the band two years later, after the initial adrenaline rush has passed. On the second collection, <i>Adore Life</i>, they’re still exciting, but the tone has shifted considerably. Not all of the songs work—a couple float by with power and grit but no real hook—but the best moments here are incredible. </p>
<p><i>Adore Life</i> is a collection of love songs, but Beth refers to it as ""a disease,"" among other things, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9662-love-and-its-opposite-in-the-studio-with-savages/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Pitchfork that when they recorded the album, they set out to ""write the loudest songs ever."" It was produced by Beth's boyfriend, Johnny Hostile, which brings another sort of real-life energy to the proceedings. And, outside of a couple ballads and torch songs, they’re still amped up—maybe even moreso than before. (Check out the sweaty <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvvhHT0B5ck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live clip</a> for the excellent anthem ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17762-savages-the-answer/"" target=""_blank"">The Answer</a>,"" which finds the audience losing their shit and their shirts.)</p>
<p>On <i>Adore Life</i>, Savages don’t always scale the heights of their signature anthem ""Husbands,"" but they find different highs. There's the slow-release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>-esque ballad, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17895-savages-adore/"" target=""_blank"">Adore</a>,"" the mid-tempo but somehow manic ""Slowing Down the World"" (which is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a>), the rumbling death rock of ""I Need Something New."" You can certainly hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> on these songs, too. Savages played some shows with Swans, and Gira has talked about how much he likes the band—the mutual camaraderie makes sense. The connection is there in the brutal repetitions: Note the combustible ending of ""I Need Something New"" or the feedback implosion at the start of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17831-savages-tiwyg/"" target=""_blank"">T.I.W.Y.G.</a>"" It’s also there in the subject matter: Michael Gira writes violent love songs, too (his classic ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jpVtYQIols"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">God Damn the Sun</a>,"" which involves addiction, threats of suicide, and general dissolution, is still one of the most romantic songs ever).</p>
<p>So, no, these are not ""love"" songs in the popular sense. Here, you’ll get a different side of flirting (""I’m not gonna hurt you/ 'Cause I'm flirting with you/ I'm not gonna hurt myself""), the messiness of love (""This is what you get when you mess with love""), lust (""Sleep with me/ And we'd still be friends/ Or I know/ I’ll go insane""), sexual fluidity (""When I take a man/ Or a woman/ They're both the same/ They're both human""), sexual discovery (""When I'm with you/ I want to do/ All the things that/ I’ve never done”), sexual power (""When I take a man/ At my command/  My love will stand/ The test of time""), jealousy/threats (""If you don't love me/ You don't love anybody""). But at its core, the album’s positive. On ""Adore,"" where she repeats ""I adore life,"" Beth sings, in part, about realizing the importance of life in the face of death, and deciding to just live—that kind of knowledge brings with it a kind of freedom and a sense of control.</p>
<p>In many ways, <i>Adore Life</i> feels more alive than <i>Silence Yourself—</i>in part because it feels more human, in part because it's telling you to be as loud as possible. People often talk about how serious the band is, which seems like an underhanded way of telling them to lighten up. But it’s their intensity, and the way they look at something like love as a dark and powerful thing, that makes them interesting. Plus, nobody's ever told Swans to smile.</p></div>"|21428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21428-adore-life/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

He played tenor saxophone with too much vibrato and too much feeling, outlining melodies that were too simple and too catchy before descending into skronky noise that was too harsh and too unsettling. Where jazz had been defined by its relationship to form, with musicians practicing their craft within established idioms or inching beyond them to create something else, Ayler’s music was too amorphous for any container, a volatile liquid churning and splashing and running over and generally making a glorious mess.</p>
<p>Ayler’s epochal studio recordings were made for the tiny ESP-Disk label in 1964 and '65. The first released was <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11649-spiritual-unity-live-on-the-riviera/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritual Unity</a>,</i> and it was immediately recognized by those who heard it as a landmark. Five years earlier, saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"" target=""_blank"">Ornette Coleman</a> had reconfigured his group so that it no longer contained a piano, the first crack in the fissure that would soon become free jazz. By de-emphasizing chord changes, which provide the harmonic foundation for improvisation that had defined jazz since its inception, Coleman opened the music to new possibilities but also created confusion: If you could play virtually anything when you soloed, what made one player or one composition better than another? </p>
<p>On his early recordings, working with the trio of bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, Ayler helped clarify the answer to that question. The general shape of <i>Prophecy, </i>a live record capturing a date in June 1964 and reissued here in expanded form, hews very closely to that of <i>Spiritual Unity</i>, which was recorded in the studio one month later. Ayler’s trio begins a given piece by playing one of the sing-song melodies that were pouring out of him during this period, melodies often based on simple folk songs from Western Europe. These fragments are <i>so</i> simple and memorable, in fact, that they are pretty much the definition of what we would now call earworms, the kind of tunes you might hear a five-year-old humming—think ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yULp0Vnzblc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patty Cake</a>"" or ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75p-N9YKqNo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The ABC Song</a>""— or else melodramatic march songs, like Ayler’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-0b5Rodwsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spirits Rejoice</a>,"" based on the French national anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K1q9Ntcr5g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Marseillaise</a>."" Much of the tension in Ayler’s early work comes in waiting for these theme statements to splinter and fall apart and be pulled into unrecognizable shapes. Once that happens, beauty clashes with ugliness, lines between joy and mourning dissolve, and the music becomes a torrent of undifferentiated emotion.</p>
<p>Despite his music’s structural freedom, technique was essential to Ayler’s art. He had a booming, bottom-heavy tone reminiscent of the honking sax players who dominated 1940s and '50s R&amp;B, but he could also reach to the shrillest higher registers, and he played with an ultra-wide, quavering vibrato that brought to mind the ecstatic trembling of gospel music. Bassist Gary Peacock alternated droning bowed lines with a spindly single-note attack, and Murray moved drumming away from its timekeeping role and, leaning heavily on his cymbals, into the realm of pure texture. All this comes together here on ""Ghosts,"" Ayler’s definitive piece—he recorded it over and over during his early years, both live and in the studio, finding new possibilities every time he deconstructed its jaunty opening theme. <i>Prophecy</i> presents both the ""First Variation"" and ""Second Variation"" (Ayler’s song titles were often confusing, with the same titles sometimes used for different pieces), which both found their way to <i>Spiritual Unity</i>. The trio crackles with life as they present the song here, seemingly aware that they were ushering in a new era.</p>
<p>The original <i>Prophecy</i> consisted of five tunes; this expanded version presents those alongside the rest of the music recorded that evening, which initially appeared on the <i>Holy Ghost</i> box set in 2004. Having it all together in one place makes sense. The other music included on this reissue is the 20-minute piece ""Bells,"" which was recorded live in 1965 and initially released as a one-sided EP. Though they have been paired together on CD for some time now, there’s no particular reason for ""Bells"" and <i>Prophecy</i> to be considered together, but early Ayler has been re-released and re-packaged steadily in the CD era.</p>
<p>If <i>Prophecy</i> found Ayler at the dawn of his game-changing new sound, ""Bells"" hinted at where he would go in his middle period, expanding his band and stringing together longer pieces built from smaller parts. (Though presented as a single piece, ""Bells"" is a number of shorter tunes that flow into each other.) Adding alto saxophonist Charles Tyler and his brother Donald Ayler on trumpet and switching Lewis Worrell for Peacock on bass, ""Bells"" explores how Ayler’s music worked in an ensemble. In another year he would add strings to his then-current touring band and they would become a bizarre and supremely moving sort of chamber orchestra (the peak recordings of this band can be found on <i>The Complete Greenwich Village Sessions</i>). ""Bells"" has hints of that development; it’s an essential snapshot of the moment if not quite one of Ayler’s essential releases.</p>
<p>One of the most telling sounds on this release exists outside the music. As ""Ghosts (Second Variation)"" ends in an impassioned stream of notes from Ayler and moaning vocals from one of his sidemen and he re-states the opening theme, we hear the applause of the audience, which sounds like it’s coming from 10 people tops. It’s true that this is Ayler at the start of his career, but it hints at the lonely road walked by an artist who sees the world differently. Ayler had a huge raft of great music ahead of him, but also a lot of heartache.</p></div>"|21345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21345-bellsprophecy/|8.4|Mark Richardson

During the great Canadian indie rock boom of the mid-'00s, singer/guitarist Jace Lasek’s Breakglass Studios hosted bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4436-the-unicorns/"" target=""_blank"">the Unicorns</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3933-stars/"" target=""_blank"">Stars</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5184-land-of-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Land of Talk</a>, capturing the imagination of music writers eager to pinpoint a connective thread behind Montreal’s music scene. Few of the acts that passed through Breakglass’s doors, however, put the studio to use quite like Besnard Lakes, who committed themselves to the ""studio as an instrument"" mentality of Lasek’s idol <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a> on each of their sweeping, meticulously crafted albums. They’re the type of records that could have only been made by a band with a producer in its ranks.</p>
<p>The studio’s influence remains as strong as ever on the Besnards’ fifth album, <i>A Coliseum Complex Museum</i>, but this time the band’s namesake lake also makes its presence felt. For the first time, Lasek and bassist/co-lead Olga Goreas began demoing songs at the remote lake in Saskatchewan, where the couple had often discussed music but as a rule had previously resisted recording it. ""It’s a great place for contemplation,"" Lasek explained <a href=""http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/besnard-lakes-new-album-jace-lasek-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in an interview last year</a>. ""There’s nobody up there, it’s really hard to get to and you could spend a whole day not seeing anybody, just standing on a beach surrounded by trees and water."" <i>Coliseum</i>’s lyrics draw from those natural surroundings, fixating on the skies, the elements, and animals, both real and imagined (the album opens with ""The Bray Road Beast"" and ""Golden Lion,"" each about a fantastical creature).</p>
<p>So <i>A Coliseum Complex Museum</i> is the band’s nature album, but mostly it’s another Besnard Lakes album, and more or less a mirror of 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17749-the-besnard-lakes-until-in-excess-imperceptible-ufo/"">Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO</a></i>, right down to its refrigerator magnet poetry title, glimmering guitars, and Floydian ambitions. ""The Bray Road Beast"" wastes no time channeling <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, with a star-gazing guitar line traced from ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZtfsfoKSB0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eclipse</a>,"" while ""Pressure of Our Plans"" and ""Towers Sent Her to Sheets of Sound"" each culminate in a thicket of swirling psychedelia. These songs run a bit shorter than those on <i>Until in Excess</i>, but they’re every bit as dense.</p>
<p>The album lightens somewhat in its second half, as Goreas takes on a greater role vocally. Her game spotlight turn on the slick, unusually groove-oriented ""The Plain Moon"" is the closest <i>Coliseum</i> comes to matching the hooky rush of <i>Until in Excess</i>’ standout ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrayxTy9To"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">People of the Sticks</a>."" The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>-esque ""Necronomicon"" is even dreamier, a respite from some of the album’s busier tracks that shows how good this band can sound when they dial things back. As if to make up for that relative restraint, though, the album closes on a note of excess with ""Tungsten 4: The Refugee,"" six minutes of heaving classic rock that signs off with a purge of blustery guitar solos.</p>
<p><i>Coliseum</i> stacks everything in the right place, and it’s all executed with the usual precision, so why doesn’t the album dazzle quite like the last few? Like the four albums before it, the Besnards self-recorded and self-produced this one at Breakglass, and more than its predecessors, it begs for an outside collaborator, somebody to shake up the band’s routine and perhaps lend some new tricks to their shrinking playbook. The joy of a great space-rock album, after all, comes not just from the sense of vastness, but also from the potential for surprise, the possibility that a thrilling reveal could be hiding behind every turn.

It’s an album of options, expectations, and the lingering hope that occurs when there’s a possibility of something better<span id=""docs-internal-guid-70584da3-5301-aec5-9ab0-72c1803f7c88""><span>. </span></span>Dalt repurposed her studio as a makeshift theater to screen films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Helke Sander, and other New German Cinema greats and <span id=""docs-internal-guid-70584da3-5301-aec5-9ab0-72c1803f7c88""><i>Ou</i>'s cinematic feel is the direct result.</span> ""When I have input from outside, I start to see more surprises in what I’m making,"" she told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> in conversation for <a href=""http://www.electronicbeats.net/julia-holter-talks-gendered-history-with-lucrecia-dalt/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electronic Beats</a>. For her, movies act as personal creative partners, and the four-track LP and its subsections are a live unraveling of all the surprises that come from the process.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The first step is removing herself from the vocal spotlight. Opener ""OVER UNITY"" sees her whisper one indecipherable line, chop it up, and feed it through vocal effects to intensify each word. That’s the album’s only lyric. Meanwhile, a soft beep ticks like a metronome. She uses that constant element to contrast alternative forms of timekeeping in the piece, like the sputtering synths in the background. Dalt bypasses realism to pursue sounds rarely experienced in reality, a point she underlines on ""OVER UNITY"" when she reshapes the piece into a traditional song structure midway, </span>drawing out asymmetrical melodies and an unconventional bassline.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As fascinated as it is with time, <i>Ou </i>is too ravenous to explore any single perception in depth. ""IOT"" breaks into three parts: ""Roto,"" an anxious pulse of downbeats that closes with bashful clarinet; ""Quebrado,"" a collection of broken telephone beeps and pitched-down gasps mimicking church bells; and ""Suelto,"" a loose percussive arrangement accented with keys. The way Dalt sees it, time is an object passing through various forms of sound. Why waste it standing still when you can see it through a dozen lenses?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">She does this by replicating <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzNzgsAE4F0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shepard tones</a> throughout the album. Like the swirling stripes of a barber’s pole, these tones—a play on pitch where a note appears to move upward or downward—is an auditory illusion that plays with perceived direction. They’re superpositioned sine waves separated by octaves, swelling like that stale hum of an airplane lifting off or the rising and falling notes of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWkJ86JqlPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>THX’s infamous sound effect</span></a>. The only piece exempt from this sound is also <i>Ou</i>’s darkest, ""FLOTO,"" where ominous saxophone and wobbling bass recall the soundtracks of low-budget alien invasion flicks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/""><span>Laurie Anderson</span></a> and those before her, Lucrecia Dalt is concerned not with upholding traditions, but reorganizing them—just like the label releasing the record, <a href=""https://www.careof.co/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Care of Editions</a>, which <a href=""http://www.chartattack.com/news/2015/11/18/you-can-get-paid-to-download-lucrecia-dalts-new-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>pays </span><span>listeners</span></a> to download its albums. On ""ELEANORE,"" she combines wind chimes, cold percussive slaps, and descending string sections to draw emotional depth from daily banalities the same way the album’s artwork—sunlight leaking through a window shade like visual sine waves —does. Consider it disembodied pop where Dalt, a civil engineer who specialized in geotechnics, patiently reworks theories until they become scalable to the average listener. As a result, <i>Ou</i> sounds like a test of specific temporal concepts that is best observed from a distance. If you listen too close, its concept thins, and you lose your grip on the very abstract ideas Dalt is exploring.</p></div>"|21420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21420-ou/|7.6|Nina Corcoran

They have coated their debut album in a fine layer of hiss and sonic grime, and if you’ve been around dance music for long, the murkiness might remind you of a time before the post-scarcity age of streaming music, when rave devotees would trade cassette dubs of rare 12''s.</p>
<p>Or it might remind you of an overdriven P.A., pushed far past its capabilities to power some kind of under-the-radar, probably illegal rave. Coming out of the Brooklyn DIY electronic music scene, that’s something DUST's members–John Barclay, Mike Sherburn, and Greem Jellyfish–know all about. Barclay in particular is a tireless advocate for pre-EDM, pre-superclub rave ethics, which he wove deeply into the events he threw at already-legendary spaces like 285 Kent (which he helped open, and where DUST was among the last acts to play before it was shuttered) and Trip House, a run-down Bushwick mansion that he turned into a 20-room party palace. More recently he’s gone legit with the Bossa Nova Civic Club, whose shadowy back room has become a mecca for hardcore house and techno freaks.</p>
<p>Barclay’s ventures as a promoter suggest not just nostalgia for a time when dance music was still dangerous, but a fairly successful attempt to yank that kind of seductively undomesticated energy out of the good old days and into the here and now. <i>Agony Planet</i> fits into that scheme nicely. The music has a raw edge that comes part from the redlined production and part from the relentless body-jacking four-on-the-floor beats and stroboscopic synth arpeggios, as well as tempos that feel pitched up a few percentages by the type of DJ who likes to test their audience’s physical endurance.</p>
<p>Singer Greem Jellyfish, a multimedia artist who designs her own surreal stage costumes, helps push the album’s manic energy over into madness. Inverting the concept of a disco diva, she yelps, shrieks, and moans her vocal parts, drawing out the dark, slightly sadistic quality woven into the beats, and really all good techno in general. Her frequently wordless vocalizing suggests someone who’s lost her mind so thoroughly to the music that she’s gone post-verbal.</p>
<p>When <i>Agony Planet</i> really comes together<span>—</span>and it doesn't, always, but it's a hard spot to locate<span>—</span> on tracks like ""Alien Prey"" and ""Tell Me,"" the effect is downright magical. It can transport you to an unrehabbed industrial loft or maybe even the abandoned loading dock where I went to one of the best parties I’ve ever been to in my life, and recreates those transcendent moments where the DJ finds the sweet spot as close to the edge of blowing out the P.A. as they can get and all the individual spirals of drug-altered moods on the floor line up and the whole dingy space seems to lift off from Earth. And then it’ll make you want to go out this weekend and find that same sensation all over again.</p></div>"|21431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21431-agony-planet/|6.8|Miles Raymer

But Kelela has always been an artist who works best when her unfettered voice is placed against unexpected backdrops: She brought effortless calm to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"">Kingdom</a>'s metallic, bass-heavy club music on <i>Cut 4 Me</i>; sultry pathos to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"">Kindness</a>' loungey, sax-heavy sophomore LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19937-kindness-otherness/"">Otherness</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19937-kindness-otherness/""></a>; and a sense of gravity to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>'s nebulous electronics on <i>Hallucinogen</i>. This past Christmas, in a seeming bid to show off this versatility, Kelela dropped <i>Hallucinogen Remixes</i>, an EP containing remixes of four <i>Hallucinogen</i> tracks that spin her style into footwork, grime, baile funk, and other genres.</p>
<p><i>Remixes</i> opens with a high-energy mix of ""A Message,"" courtesy of footwork legend <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/21402/pitchfork.com/artists/32321-dj-spinn/"">DJ Spinn</a>. Spinn leaves the song's structure relatively as-is, adding fills of high-speed drum patterns beneath Kelela's verses to give the song a shuddering spark that puts it at thrilling odds against the original's languorous production. Brazilian baile funk artist MC Bin Laden's take on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17663-kelela-rewind/"">Rewind</a>"" goes big, using a single line from the song and studding it with drops and verses from the MC to turn it into a towering baile number that wouldn’t sound out of place on the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"">Major Lazer</a> record. It's riveting, but ultimately feels like filler against a vet like Spinn, who evokes the same urge to dance with significantly less pomp.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bristol producer Kahn gives <i>Hallucinogen</i> highlight ""All the Way Down"" an ominous grime re-do and recruits rising Brixton artist Gaika for a guest verse, whose elastic rapping and low-pitched voice work as a good complement to Kelela's diaphanous vocals. Melbourne producer Air Max ’97 gives the same song an undertow of fast-paced drumming and a few floating synth lines, focusing on vivid, key lines to dramatic effect: ""I'm doing things that I don't do/ So comfortable when I'm with you... I'm staying over at yours tonight/ I'm calling late, let's exercise."" The most distinct remix here comes from club and ballroom DJs Mike Q and Divoli S’vere, who strip away the reeling bass of <i>Hallucinogen</i> closer ""The High"" and substitute just a pounding heartbeat and skittering, sped-up samples of Kelela’s voice. It's a creative flip on the original that, alongside DJ Spinn and Kahn's entries, also makes a good case for this collection's existence.</p>
<p>That being said, <i>Hallucinogen Remixes</i> doesn't eclipse its source material by any means—it's probably only essential if you're already a Kelela diehard. Paired with the original, it at least makes for a good holdover until an official debut LP, which is slated to appear sometime this year. As a brief look at Kelela playing with genres we've yet to hear, however, <i>Remixes</i> is sufficient enough.</p></div>"|21402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21402-hallucinogen-remixes/|7.0|Eric Torres

In the latter part of the '90s, his full-length contributions for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"" target=""_blank"">Missy Elliott</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"" target=""_blank"">Ginuwine</a> redirected R&amp;B from its increasing reliance on relaxed grooves and hip-hop drums to slick, broken, hi-hat happy rhythms that were playful, sophisticated, and not-infrequently referred to as ""futuristic."" His work in R&amp;B established him as visionary, and the echoes of his sound are all over today's musical landscape—from Noah ""40"" Shebib's atmospheric moodiness to the worldwide underground of <a href=""http://soulection.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soulection</a>'s beat scene. Timbaland took many cues from UK electronic soul styles, but he also gave them back: it's impossible to listen to dubstep without hearing Ginuwine's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbnoG2dsUk0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pony</a>"" in its DNA; it's hard to imagine the UK grime scene without Missy's <i>Da Real World</i>. Timbaland may not have invented any of these styles but he seemed to predict and inspire them all, down to EDM.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If these were his only contributions to music, his new mixtape—<i>King Stays King</i>, released this past Christmas—would make sense. It would be a rehashing of glory days by a once uber-influential musician. But Timbaland's prowess wasn't limited to R&amp;B—he also released major and minor hits for rappers of note and footnote,  and ushered pop artists into adulthood while blurring the lines between mature swing and youthful bounce, mainstream and urban. In terms of reach, his only peer of the past 20 years would be maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dre</a>, or Tim's hometown colleague, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell Williams</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But in the past few years, as Dre repolished his laurels and Pharrell refined himself into an inescapable pop force, Timbaland languished as a struggling legacy act, releasing respectably selling, but forgettable solo efforts and attempting to create buzz with his <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland_Thursday"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland Thursdays</a> series. None of this is what anyone saw for Timbaland—at best he would still be a major cultural power; at worst a reclusive genius releasing small, but impactful records that ousted music forward. At the least, he should have been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"" target=""_blank"">Swizz Beatz</a>—caught up with ventures beyond music but returning occasionally to the table, if only to prove that he still has it. But scoring lowbrow fare like ""<a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/03/timbaland-empire-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Empire</a>"" and releasing a middling compilation like <i>King Stays King</i>, was not in the trajectory.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's precious little that's adventurous about this new effort. Blaze Serving's ""Where You At!"" is darkly bubbling, but leans too heavily on <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>'s ""Fuck Up Some Commas,"" coming off like a local DJ's remix he plays during his set to take a bathroom break. The album's best number comes from Rico Richie, a rapper perhaps best known for<a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2015/07/16/rico-richie-arrested-drugs-guns-atlanta-young-thug/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> getting arrested when the authorities raided Young Thug's studio</a>. On ""Drug Dealer"" Timbaland seems to be aping the Neptunes, alternating between a moderately ominous swing and cavernous drums (an interesting turn, considering Tim's brain-melting work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a>'s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21337-darkest-before-dawn/"" target=""_blank""><i>Darkest Before Dawn</i></a>) but Rico, like many of the rappers here, comes through with mostly generic baller boasts tinged with just a hint of creativity: ""I flew her out to L.A. for the summer/ And she said she love me, even though a nigga used to hit her cousin/ My niggas say I'm trippin', I'm like, 'Fuck it, I don't need a rubber.'"" Even the established stars fail to register above serviceable here. Who wouldn't want to hear the erratic madness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"" target=""_blank"">Migos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>' goofy eccentricities, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a>'s swallowing and taffy-like yelping on a Timbaland beat? It may be a case of elevated expectations, but all their songs sound relatively straightforward—the raps feeling phoned in, the beats playing catch-up.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest disappointment here is that Timbaland comes off as beatmaker instead of a producer. In an era where producers like Mike WiLL Made-It and Metro Boomin cater their sounds around their artists, adding subtle fluctuations, transitions, and progressions to their music (things Timbaland once did so well), most of the tracks here plod straight ahead. The R&amp;B numbers here don't sound like Timbaland; they sound like the modern day sub-Timbaland impressions that get pushed on your Soundcloud playlist via algorithm. It's all functional, but there isn't a single standout performance here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It can be said that Timbaland hasn't been able to create stars—most of his hits have come courtesy of artists with strong songwriting ability and intrinsic inventiveness. Aside from Missy, Timbaland's most notable collaboration on this front was with Aaliyah—together the two sculptured R&amp;B in their own image. Aaliyah appears here posthumously on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17899-timbaland-shakin-ft-aaliyah-and-strado/"" target=""_blank"">Shakin</a>"" and she's in classic form. As always, her delivery dances with a light grace, but the song sounds more like a redundant album cut than a lost gem. While it's great to hear some new classic Aaliyah, hearing not-quite classic Timbaland in 2016 only makes him seem dated.</p></div>"|21403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21403-king-stays-king/|5.7|kris ex

In only eight years, they've issued five LPs, a single, and an EP of sometimes absurdly rich, long-form black metal. Krallice’s records have served as<a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/not-fit-to-print-transcendental-metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> their manifestos</a>, their music as their answer to every online ""hipster metal"" kerfuffle in which they’ve been unwillingly implicated.</p>
<p>This isolationist approach came into focus last July, when Krallice self-released the excellent and compact <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20904-ygg-huur/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ygg Huur</i></a> online with no advance notice or industry assistance. Though the move felt logical after 2012’s independently issued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17100-years-past-matter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Years Past Matter</i></a>, <i>Ygg Huur</i>’s hype-free entry still felt like a statement about the ability of signal to transcend noise. The new <i>Hyperion</i>, actually recorded two years before <i>Ygg Huur</i>, supplies the exclamation mark for that thought. Issued suddenly through Bandcamp on New Year’s Day, the three-song follow-up is a succinct, explosive encapsulation of Krallice’s evolution and progression during the last decade. The EP format prevents the band’s trademark intricacy and density from ever crossing into exhaustion; from the feedback-laced beginning to, 24 minutes later, the celestial end, <i>Hyperion</i> always thrills.</p>
<p>Taken together, these three songs speak to vastly different approaches to the band’s black metal background. ""Assuming Memory"" recalls Krallice of yore, its 10-minute expanse sweeping from a ruminative opening to pirouetting solos to a soft-focus close that drifts into a shoegaze haze. The title track, on the other hand, mirrors the concision of <i>Ygg Huur</i>. Krallice ricochets between sets of complementary riffs and rhythms, as though trapped among the overclocked paddles of a pinball machine.</p>
<p>But it’s between these two bookends, during ""The Guilt of Time,"" that Krallice hits a new compositional apex. It's so sly and subtle that it's easy to miss it. After about three minutes of rather conventional surges and stops, the band settles into a drift and lingers there before emerging above a sustained blast beat, Colin Marston and Mick Barr's guitars soaring above the rhythm section as though it were a ski jump. The guitars hold that position, locked inside a piercing little back-and-forth riff; meanwhile, Weinstein breaks his beat to pound out syncopated drum phrases that suggest warped snippets of military marches or maybe even a funk band. What <i>sounds</i> like a sustained, full-band blast beat, then, is actually a reinforced feint. This is a new level of hyperactivity for Krallice and one of the most thrilling, difficult two-minute clips of the band’s career. After you notice it, you have to hear it again and again, standing back to marvel at the sheer audacity of the moment.</p>
<p>A little less than three years passed between the release of <i>Years Past Matter</i> in 2012 and <i>Ygg Huur</i> last July. It was the longest break in Krallice’s career, as they’d issued at least an album every year (except 2010) since their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12250-krallice/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>. Now, though, they appear to be back on pace, and the consecutive successes of <i>Ygg Huur </i>and <i>Hyperion</i> reinforce what (aside from the songs themselves) has long been most admirable about Krallice. This band keeps improving incrementally, avoiding major statements of reinvention or re-emergence in favor of doggedly refining what it is they’ve done from the very start. <i>Hyperion</i>’s lyrics are loaded with references to astral objects, solar bodies, and mythological figures. But this<i> </i>is the work of a delightfully earthbound and centered band—part of a scene, sure, but apart from it, too, more focused on the work itself than the worry around it.</p></div>"|21422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21422-hyperion-ep/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

<p dir=""ltr"">It's difficult to not draw comparisons to her sister, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"" target=""_blank"">Jhené Aiko</a>, but a quick listen to <i>M.I.L.A.</i> and <i>COVERGIRL</i> clarifies the differences. Aiko, despite her limited vocal range, has a confidence to her aesthetic: She understands just what kind of music she aims to make and surrounds herself with the right creators to help make it. On <i>M.I.L.A.</i>, Chilombo’s tracks drown under the weight of its production and its collaborators, feeling less and less like an introduction to Mila J as the EP progresses.</p>
<p>In some instances, like the cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>'s ""Sweetest Taboo,"" the production wraps itself too tightly around the original. In fact, it draws your attention to the more progressive construction of the original: Sade’s ""Sweetest Taboo,"" (and really, the group’s entire catalog) survives and translates to numerous generations because it is so secretly challenging and charismatic and weird. Chilombo's cover, while technically ""correct,"" strips from the ingrained eerie heart of the original, but doesn't replace it with anything else.</p>
<p>Consider another recently released mixtape (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21319-but-you-caint-use-my-phone/"" target=""_blank""><i>But You Caint Use My Phone</i></a>), which features a number of covers and reworkings of telephone-themed tracks. That record was brilliant and biting, digging deep conceptually to critique and cherish it's inspiration as well as dive into the psyche of Badu. Audiences should want the same from Chilombo. What <i>COVERGIRL</i> tells us most about Chilombo is that she is a music fan.</p></div>"|21430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21430-covergirl/|6.5|Britt Julious

Clearly, the act of creating something distorts the perspective of the person making it, which means that artists can sometimes be the least qualified people to shed light on the things they make.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">According to the members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33426-bloodiest/"">Bloodiest</a>, the Chicago sextet's music is related to metal, but has more in common with composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"" target=""_blank"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Morricone</a>. That sounds enticing on paper, but it's not what you hear on album opener ""Mesmerize,"" a fairly straightahead number built on an insistent riff that manages to borrow from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"" target=""_blank"">Tool</a> guitarist Adam Jones while leaving out the intangibles that distinguished Jones' playing from the riffmongers of his era. The fact that a band so focused on mood and dynamics would emulate the most superficial and brutish aspects of Jones' playing makes you scratch your head—and also speaks to the pitfalls of playing musical dress-up.</p>
<p>Though they're enthusiastic fans of metal, the members of Bloodiest aren't dyed-in-the-wool metalheads. The group identifies as underground indie/post-rock at heart, which makes sense considering that at various points its membership has included alums from experimental Chicago acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3044-90-day-men/"" target=""_blank"">90 Day Men</a>, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/632081-Lustre-King"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lustre King</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4785-russian-circles/"" target=""_blank"">Russian Circles</a>. Founding guitarists Tony Lazzara and Eric Chaleff played together in Sterling and Follows, and vocalist Bruce Lamont plays sax and howls in the more jaggedly experimental quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5607-yakuza/"" target=""_blank"">Yakuza</a>. For better or worse, they have little collective experience playing heavy stuff that openly identifies as such.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To be fair, sometimes you get very ""authentic"" results from people who aren't ""natives"" to the style they play. In fact, several of metal's most iconic trailblazers never actually listened to the stuff much. But as you make your way through </span><i>Bloodiest</i><span>, the band’s follow-up to its 2011 debut </span><i>Descent</i><span>, it's hard to shake the feeling that Lazzara, Chaleff, and their cohorts handle these riffs with the same combination of fascination and distance that tourists show when they're in the gift shop of a foreign country, where the untrained eye has a hard time spotting the difference between cliché, truth, and the gray area where most cultural hallmarks are actually both.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are times on <i>Bloodiest </i>where the band does twist otherwise conventional riffs into shapes they wouldn't have assumed in their usual habitat. On ""Broken Teeth,"" for example, one of the guitarists takes the familiar theme from Holst's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mars</a>"" (the same melody you hear at the beginning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Metallica</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u-HCHCuHMg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Am I Evil</a>"" cover), puts it on a cutting board, and dices it up. Later in the same song, Chaleff and Lazzara counterpose another coiling Adam Jones-esque riff against a drum pattern that former 90 Day Men drummer Cayce Key purposely drags so far behind the beat that it makes the whole band sound like it's stuttering. Meanwhile, pianist Nandini Khaund underlays the dense, sludgy wall of sound with elegant chords that hint at what Dixieland jazz might sound like in a cough-syrup induced nightmare. At moments like these, regardless of whether this band falls as close to modern classical, post-rock, or film scores as it would have you believe, it does manage to find itself in art-metal terrain that's still mostly untouched.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When fringe musicians with indie sensibilities dabble in metal, they tend to either put a ponderous spin on it (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a>) or a campy one (Dave Pajo's one-off group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5732-dead-child/"" target=""_blank"">Dead Child</a>). Bloodiest most definitely leans towards the former, especially during its lengthy stretches of classical-tinged guitar spiked with ethereal chanting. Almost three decades since John Zorn compared <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death/"" target=""_blank"">Napalm Death</a> to free jazz, the genre still has a way of luring dilettantes who can't resist what they perceive as its lowbrow/junk-culture temptations. Never mind that, musically speaking, Zorn's comparison was totally fair; it still smacked of unintended snobbery.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Bloodiest</i> doesn't come off as the product of well-intentioned but privileged slumming. After all, this band is from Chicago, where musicians inclined to shuttle between various genres have long felt free to do so. Most of the members of Bloodiest have roots in bands that operate or operated at the outskirts of metal anyway. With this album, they stake their claim to a musical inheritance left behind by predecessors who flouted boundaries and bastardized conventional notions of heaviness. Fittingly, they make the best of that inheritance by striking out on their own.</p></div>"|21432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21432-bloodiest/|6.5|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

What we got instead was <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53319-download-busta-rhymes-and-q-tips-the-abstract-and-the-dragon-mixtape/"">The Abstract and the Dragon</a></i>, a mixtape that turned out to be a chill way to revisit the pair’s enviable chemistry and friendship but not much else.</p>
<p>Two years later, Busta Rhymes is back with a new tape of unheard material, this time without Q-Tip. <i>The Return of the Dragon (The Abstract Went on Vacation)</i> doesn’t exactly herald the return of Peak Busta or even Good Busta—in fact, it does the opposite. The raps are mostly uninspired and sometimes they don’t even make sense (""My money long, thicker than a waffle,"" on ""God’s Plan""; ""I’m Def Leppard and I ain’t tryna hear the noise,"" on ""Choose a Side""). When they do communicate, the thoughts and observations are unbearably generic, the kind of bars a rap generator might cough up. And on top of all that, Busta packs his words into the husks of worn tracks that somehow escaped the first Obama term.</p>
<p>Many of these B-sides sound years old—songs recorded for alternate purposes that were at one point or another shelved and never should’ve seen the light of day. For starters, there’s a guest appearance from long-forgotten R&amp;B singer J. Holiday on a song ironically titled ""Hits for Days."" When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5555-styles-p/"" target=""_blank"">Styles P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss/"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a> do their usual back-and-forth on ""Respect My Conglomerate 2,"" a sequel to the 2009 Busta <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sECIm3QaFSI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song of the same name</a>, there’s a reference to the bank Wachovia, which was absorbed by Wells Fargo in 2008. Some other songs feel like relics from a bygone era, especially ""Real Niggas,"" which reeks of Lex Luger ""MC Hammer""-like trap opulence with big, dramatic chamber orchestration (and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> feature to boot). ""UFC (Tap-Out)"" reunites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a>, a dated pairing given their contentious recent history and Gucci’s overlapping prison stint.</p>
<p>Whether or not these songs actually <i>are</i> old isn’t the issue—rappers put album throwaways on mixtapes all the time, and some of these releases exist to serve that exact purpose. The issue is that this particular batch <i>feels</i> old. These throwaways are stale, and to present them to rap fans as some sort of gesture of good faith on Christmas Day seems like a cheap trick.</p>
<p>If you manage to hang in for a bit, <i>The Return of the Dragon</i> isn’t without its moments: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>’s lengthy verse on ""Hello"" is a barn burner (""I know contracts are like handcuffs/ I know combat when it’s hand to hand or with handguns/ I know answers, I know man to man, can’t stand us/ I know exactly how you wanna brand us""), the cathedral organ tenor of the choir-backed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"" target=""_blank"">Mary J. Blige</a>-featuring ""Your Loss"" is heavy and evocative, and there’s a vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> showing on the gritty outro to ""Watch How You Move."" On ""Tonight,"" a horn-heavy funk gem from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a> archives, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5953-sean-paul/"" target=""_blank"">Sean Paul</a> lathers his signature patois yelps over a pounding bass, and the sensory experience is a pleasant blast from the past. But the shoehorned-in Busta verses sound labored, especially when his words are heard outside of densely packed double-time raps.</p>
<p>There are flashes where Busta Rhymes’ juking, stutter-step flow, which can burst into an elastic double-time on a whim, is sharp and reminiscent of his best performances. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32883-bj-the-chicago-kid/"" target=""_blank"">BJ the Chicago Kid</a>-featuring ""In the Streets,"" which carries a pair of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF DOOM</a> verses to its credit, is highlighted by one of the strongest Busta verses in recent memory. ""We Home,"" which reunites Leaders of the New School with fantastic results, is one of the few instances of unadulterated bliss. But these are momentary reprieves from a slog of tiresome listens. Busta Rhymes will forever be known for one of the most fluid deliveries in the genre’s history, but this rap giant is slowing and his wit seems to be dulling. ""Ain’t nothing changed, I’m still the Goliath of this rap shit,"" he spits on ""Hits for Days."" Someone should remind him how that fable ends.</p></div>"|21397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21397-the-return-of-the-dragon-the-abstract-went-on-vacation/|5.6|Sheldon Pearce

The throwaway line from <i>Live at Moe</i>, composed of recently uncovered recordings from a 1996 show at Seattle’s Club Moe, sums up the band’s appeal. A baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, 7 Year Bitch’s blunt and spiky rock music married social commentary with punk brevity and Riot Grrrl righteousness. Crowning their ferocious riffs on sex, trouble, and death were Davis-Simpson's heat-seeking remonstrations, which were as precise as they were lethal. <i>Live</i> is a powerful showcase—a welcome document that adds meaningfully to the band’s oeuvre while capturing a moment in the thriving Seattle scene of the '90s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On </span><i>Live at Moe</i><span>, we hear a band in transition but not necessarily in decline. The opener, ""24,900 Miles Per Hour,"" from 7 Year Bitch’s third and final album </span><i>Gato Negro,</i> is a furious demonstration of the band's broadening <span>palette. Selene Vigil-Wilk’s melodic narration, detailing the demise of a ""poor white trash"" girl, has a looser cadence and more languid delivery than anything from the band’s earlier catalog—the song sounds like a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10326-daydream-nation-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Daydream Nation</i></a><span> outtake, until the vocal snarls suddenly in the chorus. This version cleaves to the studio iteration but thrums with sharper urgency.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The live spark transforms other songs from </span><i>Gato Negro</i><span>, the band’s first and only album with Atlantic Records, which was simultaneously less scrappy and less compelling than 1992 debut </span><i>Sick’Em</i><span> and 1994’s </span><i>¡Viva Zapata!</i><span>. Wandering beyond their original metal-underscored feminist fury to introduce funk idiom and bluesy touches, 7 Year Bitch’s lyrics also shifted, from incendiary directness to sometimes-more-clichéd lines. ""Crying Shame,"" with its plodding chorus and piqued nursery-rhyme rhythm (""They like the kind of girl/ The kind they cannot tame"") gets a thoroughly menacing showing here; Valerie Agnew’s hi-hats pull tension lines tight, and Elizabeth Davis-Simpson’s nimble, subterranean bass anchors the sparse instrumentation. While the live mix isn’t uniform between tracks—the recording was originally streamed online—it’s generally even-handed; it breathes, often capturing the distinctive character of the musicians’ contributions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nuclear force arrives in the set with ""M.I.A.,"" from </span><i>¡Viva Zapata!</i><span>; both the album and the track memorialized Mia Zapata of the Gits, who was raped and murdered in 1993. Directed at the killer, at any abuser of women, the song unites the band’s dual strengths of raw sonic power and scarifying screed: ""Will there be hundreds mourning for you?/ Will they talk of the talent and inspiration you gave?/ No."" Vigil-Wilk’s blistering delivery speaks of monstrous anger and loss, articulating a remembrance that is both salute and spur. ""Hip Like Junk,"" also a </span><span><i>¡Viva Zapata!</i> </span><span>cut, prowls the dark grounds of drug abuse and addiction, a perennial theme for 7 Year Bitch after the drug-related death of original guitarist Stefanie Sargent in 1992.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Lorna,"" from <i>Sick ‘Em</i>, harks back to beginnings, when the band’s sound had more in common with contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2399-l7/"" target=""_blank"">L7</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32965-babes-in-toyland/"" target=""_blank"">Babes in Toyland</a>, like surf rock filtered through granite. The penultimate offering is classic brat directive ""The Scratch."" <i>Live at Moe</i>’s version swaggers, growls, and grabs; ""I want it,"" yells Vigil, ""Give it to me."" Closing out the record is ""Kiss My Ass Goodbye,"" introduced as the last song guitarist Roisin Dunne would be playing with the group before departing. Given 7 Year Bitch would break up the next year, the energetic exit feels bittersweet but apt. L<i>ive at Moe i</i>s a fierce hello-again-and-farewell to an iconic group, chronicling a set that’s tight and short, like a skirt that says ""Fuck you"" on the butt.</p></div>"|21423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21423-live-at-moe/|7.0|Estelle Tang

<div dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">There's an area in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago known as Terror Town. It’s a 2-block-by-4-block area that has seen no less than <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-6-shot-in-south-shore-we-cant-even-go-to-the-laundromat-20140602-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three large-scale shootings</a> in the last 3 years. This is where the rapper Lil Bibby lives, he of the boyish looks and the grown-ass man voice. He debuted nationally in August of 2012 alongside lifelong friend Lil Herb via ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5y9AMeU1S8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Shit</a>,"" a song that stands out as the absolute hardest song recorded by children I’ve ever heard. Bibby's work is a live play-by-play of chaos, with numerous references to paranoia that comes with simple trips to the store—""<span>This real life, real facts, this ain't rap/ Walk into that corner store, we had to stay strapped</span>/ Yeah, most of these niggas can't relate to that,"" he raps on ""EBT to BET.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The moment that gave Bibby his introduction to the world—the initial gold rush of the drill sound, with every rapper with a 773 or 312 area code getting a look and/or a deal—has passed now. His latest tape, <i>Free Crack 3</i>, feels like a game attempt to escape the box that being labeled a ""drill"" artist puts you in. The tape comes with via a mix of big-name grabs (<a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> and Metro Boomin on obvious radio ploy ""Aww Man"") and local legends (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"" target=""_blank"">Common</a>, who drops one of his better verses in awhile on ""Speak to ‘Em,"" all appear). The C-Sick produced ""If He Find Out"" features a stellar collaboration between <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32024-tink/"" target=""_blank"">Tink</a> and Bibby. As expected, Lil Herb stops by for ""Ain't Heard Nuthin Bout You,"" and the song is such a great example of the chemistry between the two that they’ve been promoting the single as ""Kill Shit pt. 2.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As he expands his range of guests, his lyrical ability leveled up significantly. By and large, Bibby’s been out of town doing shows and recording, and <a href=""https://youtu.be/Z-BvYvgqmzM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview on Chicago’s WGCI radio station</a>, he acknowledged the change has been daunting for his creative process: When I be in Atlanta too long I can’t write too many songs. I have to always come back to Chicago. There's nothing like the Chicago feeling."" The travel may have ultimately been good for him, though, broadening his worldview and leading him to delve into newer ideas and to sharpen his focus. On <i>Free Crack 3</i>, he switches perspectives ably, from a survivor determined to better the lives of himself and the people around him (the Five Stairsteps-sampling ""Things Will Get Brighter"") and a 21-year-old with a little money in his pocket and some time to kill, like <span id=""docs-internal-guid-0fdb360f-3c1b-599e-be8f-fe9ea9d050c3""><span>""Aww Man."" Through all of it, he remains self-aware of the choices he’s made and how they’ve made him into who he is. On ""Word Around Town,"" he chuckles, ""</span><span>Probably could've been a mathematician/ But a nigga made bad decisions</span><span>/ </span><span>Momma told me but I didn't listen/ Judge sent my bad ass to prison.""</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In lieu of struggling to keep up and stay relevant, Bibby has found success mostly by sticking to the program that got him here: consistent quality. While this tape marks the conclusion of the <i>Free Crack</i> series, he recently announced a debut, <i>FC3: The Epilogue</i>, coming next month. A few months back, Bibby posted to social media that he received his G.E.D and was now thinking of attending UCLA. For various reasons, it’s hard not to listen and root for him.</p>

The music is slow and heavy, the three-part vocals mournful and guttural, the cover art by Italian painter Paolo Girardi melancholic and romantic, the subject matter bleak. For instance, ""This wretched body/ The prison of the soul/ Weighted by the chains of depression/ I could never bear to let you in."" Or: ""Oh Mother/ Oh Father/ Relinquish this mistake of a life."" But, all said, it’s also uplifting.</p>
<p>This has a lot to do with the guitars and tone. On the quartet's new album <i>Chasms</i>, fire and heat are mentioned in the lyrics, and even if they show up in a negative sense (""The sun will burn the cancer we have become/ Death will be the savior""), you get the sense of the night turning into day here<i>. </i>It was produced by Jack Shirley, who also helmed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Deafheaven</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sunbather</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21022-new-bermuda/"" target=""_blank""><i>New Bermuda</i></a> (and a ton of other records), and he gives the songs a very <i>big</i> feel.</p>
<p>Lycus’ first record, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18224-lycus-tempest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tempest</i></a>, featured three tracks spreading across 42 minutes, though the last one, ""Tempest,"" drifted off at the end with low-level hiss and feedback. The more tightly packed <i>Chasms</i> features four songs in 44 minutes, and each second is fully loaded. From blistering black metal freak-out to crushing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a> climax to an unexpected psychedelic undertow, there's no incidental music here.</p>
<p>They added a second guitarist, which brings a compelling texture to the sound, and there’s also the presence of go-to Bay Area metal cellist Jackie Perez Gratz  (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29981-giant-squid/"" target=""_blank"">Giant Squid</a>, Amber Asylum). She weaves the songs together into a kind of extended suite, and her work brings to mind another of her collaborators, Asunder, who released one of the great underground Bay Area doom albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6478-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Works Will Come Undone</i></a>, in 2006. Asunder, like Lycus, found a way to make a lot happen with a little.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite records of the sort since then, which is saying a lot. Lycus maintain a specific atmosphere—deep greens, browns, dark shadows—but find a number of paths through it. Each feels right, the blending of genres and approaches and patterns seamless. More important, though, is the effect music of this sort can have on a listener. It's highly cathartic. It will move you emotionally. At the end of the haunting closer ""Obsidian Eyes,"" which finds the protagnist ""suffer[ing] through the void/ On the perilous bridge/ Between body and spirit,"" the band pushes forward with all their force into a gentle cymbal wash that closes the record. It's one of the few soft moments on <i>Chasms,</i> and it's welcome: a place to rest your head after experiencing this overwhelming, ecstatic, surprisingly meditative album.</p></div>"|21347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21347-chasms/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Aches are ambiguous and often mosaic sensations; they’re less a product of pain or pleasure than a seductive mingling of both. Ache can flow through the body as a kind of dark, indefinite wave, summoned by a photograph, or an old email.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Shame</i>, which came out in October last year, functions well enough as an indie rock record, but its atmosphere is nervous and defeated, both the frenzied search for a cigarette and the long exhale of smoke layered on top of each other. Lotz describes scenes, relationships, and emotions in fragments. ""A bulb/ A thought/ A home you’re not,” she sings in ""Feel."" Her voice is clear and direct, and illuminates her songs internally, like a skeleton made of Christmas lights. Sometimes she crafts an unstable reality, the physics of which are susceptible to anxiety. ""Being mocked by the crack in the ceiling at the top of the stairs,"" she sings in ""Sooner."" ""Wishing it’d swallow me whole."" Later in the same song she threatens to ""sow a garden of backbones I never had."" Her imagery is rich and often moves like poetry, knowing just when to slip out of sense into a region that feels blurred and indefinite, yet true to the lived experience of love and panic—all this atomic activity beneath an otherwise placid surface. Lotz’s lyrics are also funny; in ""Chandelier Thief,"" she instructs someone to ""be thankful for the floor/ it leads you to a new place.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fellow Scranton band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31791-tigers-jaw/"" target=""_blank"">Tigers Jaw</a> acts as Lotz’s band on <i>Shame</i>; their playing is precise yet also softens at its edges. Chords appear like bruises, vivid shapes with unclear borders. In ""Camera Lens II,"" there’s a delightful, lopsided quality to the changes; they almost seem to collapse on each other. ""Nature"" is the opposite; it’s completely skeletal, just vocals and drums, and yet it communicates with extreme precision something as shapeless as falling in love. ""It’s like you have an innate sense of me,"" Lotz sings. ""Like you’ve lived in my head waiting patiently/ To tell me 'you’re so afraid, just breathe.'""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lotz's finest moment is on ""Photobooth,"" which unfolds patiently as she sings, ""Kissed under the streetlight/ By your friend’s house."" Then the image recedes into a cerebral space, while the song itself amplifies and expands: ""I guess what I mean is that if I could/ Pick out all the parts of my brain/ I would leave the place where you made your home."" This is the lingering quality of <i>Shame</i>: Lotz’s ability to translate the imprecision of a kiss, the quality of a streetlight, the decay of a shadow into a memory so powerful it consumes everything. <i>Shame</i> is an album of preserved traces, of things that <i>were</i>.</p></div>"|21429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21429-shame/|7.9|Brad Nelson

It focuses on the chaos of the Boogie Down Bronx at a time when the borough was dealing with turbulence so intense that it was liable to burst into flame, but it avoids lazily conflating the chaos of the city and the beauty of the culture that emerged around the same period. Instead, it points to the Hoe Avenue peace meeting, a truce between gangs in the Bronx, as the catalyst for an artistic explosion that presaged the birth of hip-hop.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was produced by Little Shalimar, who scored the documentary and has worked as a producer with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"" target=""_blank"">Run the Jewels</a> among others. The music splits its time between rap tracks and instrumental music by Shalimar that take inspiration from various sonic flavors that were percolating through the Bronx in the '70s. Perhaps attempting to imitate the arc of the film, the album stumbles in the early going with the tough-talking track ""Savage Habits,"" which, even though it features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"" target=""_blank"">Bun B</a>, doesn’t quite pound in the way you might hope. (Also, it’s bullshit provincial homerism, but honestly: New Yorkers should open a New York album!)</p>
<p>But Little Shalimar makes several clever curatorial choices. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire</a> hasn’t never quite managed to echo the success of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15864-lost-in-translation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost in Translation</i></a>, but he sounds energized on ""Warrior Thing,"" as do indispensable voices like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30330-ka/"" target=""_blank"">Ka</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface Killah</a>, who show up on later tracks. For the most part, lyrically, the actual bars being spit here are less moving than the voices and vibe. That’s a credit to Shalimar, who has assembled worthwhile soundscapes for at least a couple of rappers who have had a below-average record in the booth in recent years. The Run the Jewels track ""Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite)"" is the high point of the rap cuts, Killer Mike spitting steel-toed syllables over a concrete staircase of a beat, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a> gleefully playing with sibilants in the second verse.</p>
<p> The best moments come when Shalimar sticks to instrumentals. His work with the musician Jeremy Wilms (together, they call themselves King Mono) on ""Bouncy 3"" is a standout. ""Partytime"" is a tribute to the breaking culture of outdoor block parties, a mix of hard funk rythms and riffs, and snazzy ballpark synths that sound imported from a Dire Straits song.</p>
<p> The narrative arc of the album isn’t quite as arresting as that of the film, but Shalimar does make an effort to say something with the song structure here. That comes into play most notably at the album’s close, with the one-two punch of ""The Piano District (Gentrification Boogie)"" and ""Phoenix."" The first is an instrumental track, part lament, part testimonial to the inexorable movement of money into the Bronx. (That a borough with such a venerable nickname <a href=""http://www.theawl.com/2015/11/whats-burning-in-the-south-bronx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">should be renamed so casually by developers</a> is the kind of Gotham micro-tragedy to which city-dwellers <a href=""http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">are consistently subjected</a>.)</p>
<p>""Phoenix"" broadcasts its message through its name. The artists featured, Tunde Adebimpe of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> and the singer/songwriter Roxiny (who sounds a little like early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a> which is to say, amazing) sing an anthem of rebirth, a hopeful song that corresponds with the message of <i>Rubble Kings.</i> But here, as on the album as a whole, any kind of explicit statement has been wrested from a canvas of evocative sonic ideas. The music comes first every time, ably conjuring up the milieu that served as hip-hop’s cradle.</p></div>"|21394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21394-rubble-kings-the-album/|7.4|Jonah Bromwich

Bassist Elizabeth Skadden was in Finally Punk, guitarist Vince McClelland in Keepsies. Singer/guitarist Sam York has modeled for Terry Richardson. <a href=""wharfcatrecords.com"">Wharf Cat</a> is releasing their self-titled debut EP, which was produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>' Austin Brown. They have given no interviews and maintain no social media profiles—just a single monochrome homepage. Maybe they're being secretive in that faintly annoying blogs-circa-2010 fashion, but maybe it's just that they're brand new. May the period that they're not beholden to the Internet and being asked crap questions about being girls (and one boy) in a band last as long as possible.</p>
<p>The context for their music, however, suggests itself immediately—a tarnished, shouty clangor that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"">Mission of Burma</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/""><i>Pink Flag</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5545-pylon/"">Pylon</a>, and an extremely misanthropic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52s</a>, all anchored by Vanessa Gomez's brisk drumming. York's lyrics often tackle the false identities necessary to survive 21st century New York, and it's hard not to hear a new band making this kind of crucible-forged post-punk as its own kind of costume: Is slavish adherence to a 30-year-old template really the best way to rail against the expectations of the modern age? That aside, WALL are innovative students.</p>
<p>For one, they're funny: ""Big black suits dressed as little white lies/ Fresh baked bread keeps the pigs well fed,"" York blares on ""Cuban Cigars,"" a jab at the whelps of Wall Street. A few verses later, she abandons her severe incantations for a mocking sing-song that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"">Kathleen Hanna</a>. Her delivery on closer ""Milk,"" a smokier song than its brittle predecessors, echoes Kim Gordon's soft disaffection as she observes how, ""The sky opened up/ Milk poured out."" That is, until the kicker, where she sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Mark E. Smith</a> after a few hours on Tumblr. ""Two-thousand feline mistresses!/ Laying all over the cobblestone!""</p>
<p>The appearance of these insubordinate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19403-parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal/"">sunbathing animals</a> in the lyrics fits the absurdist streak that gives the EP much of its appeal, though its most exciting moment comes as York succumbs to the city's pressures. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17843-wall-fit-the-part/"" target=""_blank"">Fit the Part</a>"" finds her flitting between the different roles she plays throughout the course of the day, and as the pressure mounts, so does the pace; from a stiff, spidery lumber to a rushed run-on, and a flooring white-hot tirade of panic and empty self-assurances. ""My blood's the same I know it is/ Just the exterior changes/ Shedding layers as I race to the next task/ Looking in the mirror to the face of a stranger/ Know the heart but not the face and I/ Gotta fit the part/ Gotta fit the part to get the part,"" York rattles off, as if trying to grab hold of a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>If where WALL are coming from is entirely apparent, where they're going isn't, thanks to these adrenaline surges and hectic rhythmic swerves. There's no color to their music, and little fluidity, yet in their intense fits and starts, they develop a compelling effect that has the magnetism of good melody, even in its near-total absence. ""Last Date"" is the simplest song here—another tirade of words so staccato that it's hard to discern the lyrics about being crushed by the weight of someone else. While the guitar is high and insistent, York and Skadden sing in sour, mismatched harmonies. Without really altering their resolutely monotone delivery, they seem to burrow deeper into the earth. In tricks like these, WALL wriggle out from the under the weight of history.</p></div>"|21388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21388-wall-ep/|6.9|Laura Snapes

That symmetry forms a tidy back to the label's origins, and it also serves as the crowning moment of this uncharacteristically nostalgic chapter of Richie Hawtin's career. Thus far, Hawtin has cultivated a reputation as techno's future fetishist, most literally through Minus, the heavily stylized record label that provided minimal techno with one of its key aesthetics during its mid-2000s heyday: subtractively austere, steely and clinical.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The video interview that accompanied the surprise release of </span><i>From My Mind to Yours</i><span> in December found Hawtin in a completely different place. He was positively twinkly-eyed with nostalgia, as he talked of ""going back to basics."" He credits vintage string sounds and production tricks, while speaking of stripping racks of gear back to the essentials in a Berlin studio that, by chance, replicates the dimensions (and spatial sweet spot) of a former production space from his formative years in Canada. In the weeks leading up to the final reveal of </span><i>From My Mind to Yours</i><span>, Plus 8 pressed up a series of album teasers; it was widely speculated that Hawtin, an occasional critic of the ""pain in the ass"" vinyl format, was behind the anonymous, white-label productions. In the midst of this campaign, he revived his 1990s rave night, Jak, for a one-off reunion party in Detroit, and made arrangements to pull the plug on the Ibiza superclub residency of his popular club night, ENTER.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>From My Mind to Yours</i><span> similarly hints towards some gratifying full-circle moments. ""Them,"" under the F.U.S.E moniker, unfolds with slow-reveal hypnotism, and works as a faithful tribute to the classic blueprint of Midwest techno. Album opener ""No Way Back"" draws together various strands of Hawtin's production personalities, casting a crystalline modern sheen over a thickened kick drum and twisting 303 line. Yet the album's genuinely compelling moments are scattered out over spotless plains of DJ-tool functionality, mechanically loopy acid, and towering-but-harmless walls of precise techno sound design.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most Hawtin-esque production tropes since the inception of Plus 8 (and Minus) reappear here, but with neither the vigour needed to push his futurist agenda, nor the dynamic context of his rich back catalog.""Stretching"" requires a vivid imagination to find an appeal beyond its minimalist bare bones, and Circuit Breaker's only appearance—the curiously unmoving ""Systematic""—doesn't begin to approach the gruffness of that alias' industrial past. The clutch of tracks that fall under the 80XX alias play directly to the critical cliches that Hawtin is often accused of creating. </span>Plastikman, the most beloved of Hawtin's identities, fares the best across the two-volume album. His signature hyper drums appear on the bold ""Purrkusiv,"" and its visceral power is undeniable; follow-up track  ""Gymnastiks"" deploys its sleazy bassline and wispy drum echoes to a satisfying yin-yang effect.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hawtin's '90s techno hero status was cemented with landmark classics like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsct-e-HVE0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spastik</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6QaS0IMTAk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elektrostatik</a>,"" which in turn assured a spot for Plus 8 in the annals of techno history. The label's only other recent release arrived unannounced last year: an anonymous record that was eventually revealed to be produced by electro house megastar and Twitter hothead Deadmau5. This was an unpopular revelation in certain quarters, but it worked both as a gossip-worthy moment and an effective jolt of renewal for the label's run-up to its 2015 anniversary; the tracks's production standards signalled a revived richness of sound that the label lacked in its latter years. At moments, <i>From My Mind to Yours</i> captures some of that same texture and immediacy, but the spontaneity and looseness that Hawtin speaks of so passionately have been diluted through the process of translation. Rather than feeling like the beginnings of a new phase, <i>From My Mind To Yours</i> presents a version of a fertile past that isn't working toward the benefit of the present.</p></div>"|21421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21421-from-my-mind-to-yours/|6.5|Christine Kakaire

Compared to the rudimentary sounds of peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27949-graveyard/"" target=""_blank"">Graveyard</a>, Kadavar, and Truckfighters, Witchcraft's music—however indebted to the past—skews progressive, a cumulative approach to riff-building beget by several decades' worth of influences.</p>
<p>On their fifth album <i>Nucleus</i>, Witchcraft continue to carry the torch of '70s hard rock/proto-metal bands while striving torward a broader sound. Pelander has put down his axe to focus entirely on singing, as well as production; unsurprisingly, the mix that he and producers Philip Gabriel Saxin and Anton Sundell decided upon gives him all the space he needs to croon to heart’s content. Apart from that, the album sounds downright gargantuan. From the airtight, string-inflected boogie of ""The Outcast"" to the grizzled march of the title track, each cut optimizes volume over vulnerability, a torrent of liquid lead rushing into the ears. Folk, and maybe even a little bit of jazz, sveltely sneak their way into the mix in the form of of flutes and strings—but by and large, <i>Nucleus</i> is an album that refuses to stay quiet, roaring and clawing forth for over an hour before coming to a shuddering halt.</p>
<p>Like so many of the groups before them, Witchcraft draw inspiration from high fantasy, an aesthetic that manifests itself with the ren-faire woodwind and string arrangements and in the epic tales of wanderlust, misplaced faith, and heroic striving in the lyrics. Thankfully, the fanciful mood never gets mired in Blind Guardian-style goofiness, gesturing more generally to the haggard adventurer in us all: ""The Outcast"" focuses not on some wayward brigadier, but rather on the growing alienation of a global population becoming more resigned and hopeless by the second. The universality makes the record more approachable, but the lyrics can’t rise to accommodate it, as evidenced by the aformentioned track’s head-scratching, grammatically-tenuous refrain: ""Save a nation from a bad economy/ Is like sailing away on an endless sea."" Pelander’s stilted cadence compounds the problem; if he’s not squeezing an extra syllable out of a word like ""indecision,"" he’s attempting to rhyme ""loving parents"" with ""discontent""—and botching the emphasis on both.</p>
<p>It’s up to Rage Widerberg on drums and Tobias Anger on bass to convey what Pelander’s words can’t, and they deserve a considerable amount of credit for channeling all the rage and confusion coursing through tracks like ""Malstroem"" and ""The Obsessed""'s percolating, crowd-pleasing doom riffs. Unfortunately, the glacial pacing of <i>Nucleus</i>’ slow burn frequently snuffs its own flame. Following ""Maelstrom""’s opening inertia, the album sinks into a figurative tar pit: a seemingly endless progression of the smoky, wail-ridden jams <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/538-blue-cheer/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Cheer</a> could write in their sleep. Even by doom’s slow standards, the record’s second half is plodding and woefully self-indulgent, relying more on Pelander’s killer pipes than on developed songcraft. Of course, it goes without saying that <i>Nucleus</i> rocks: its nine tracks (two of which extend past the 14-minute mark) pack in enough solemn solos, furied backbeats, and majestic stoner breakdowns to hold fans over until next time. But how good is pure volume when it's lacking a furious heart to match?</p></div>"|21395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21395-nucleus/|5.5|Zoe Camp

Where most rappers have their growing pains scattered around Soundcloud or on shoddy tape dubs, the South Central rapper emerged fully-formed, all grit, learned distrust, and half-full/half-empty 40s. Two years ago, his pair of debut singles, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Dg6qj8L3M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreams</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ljqfW1VLTY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Need That</a>,"" shook the Los Angeles street-rap community to its core; by the fall of 2014, the ink was dry on his deal with Interscope and Dreamville Records, the imprint run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"" target=""_blank"">J. Cole</a>. News of the signing was followed in quick order by <i><span class=""il"">Cozz</span> &amp; Effect</i>, an excellent mixtape that paired his forceful, sandpapered voice with spare beats.</p>
<p><span class=""il"">Cozz</span>’s breakout comes in the midst of a renaissance for L.A.: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"" target=""_blank"">YG</a> with their variations on the familiar Compton myths; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"" target=""_blank"">Open Mike Eagle</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"" target=""_blank"">Busdriver</a> with their looking-glass art rap; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> with his white-knuckled self-improvement; and excellent, often daring music from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32473-cam-china/"" target=""_blank"">Cam &amp; China</a>, Skeme, Speak, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30994-nocando/"" target=""_blank"">Nocando</a>, and more.

But what makes him stand out in the crowded field is his restlessness. <span class=""il"">Cozz</span>’s writing keeps a sense of forward motion, where each high school liquor store excursion or bus ride from Manhattan Beach back to 65th and Western is as sleek and economical as a film script. </p>
<p>His new offering, <i>Nothin Personal</i>, is a low-concept stroll through the Crip-controlled blocks of <span class=""il"">Cozz</span>’s youth. On the somber, reflective ""Grow,"" he remembers accounting for the $10 his father used to leave him for lunch money: ""I used to spend five dollars on the weed/ A 40 ounce with the other half—every day/ Starving myself for the hunger of a buzz."" In other hands, ""Choice Today"" might come off as dull moralizing; here, it’s the eerie, slinking voice in your head that tries, often successfully, to drag you off track. That song is also vocally experimental in a way he hasn't tried yet:<i> </i>he mostly abandons his staccato cadences for a slow warble, something he also trots out for ""Grey Goose"" and on the latter half of ""Tell Me."" Unfortunately, the latter is also the clumsiest moment on the record, a song about sex that’s really a song about control in the least interesting way possible. </p>
<p>The tape’s high-water mark is ""City of God,"" which pairs him with Boogie for a slow creep that darts from battered Ford Explorers to boardrooms and back again. One one level, it’s two of Southern California’s finest trading cracks about piety and iPhone read receipts; on another, it finds them in awe of the fact that things are finally, mercifully panning out. But each rapper is inherently skeptical of what’s laid out before them—so it’s back to speeding through Florence, eyes on the road. </p></div>"|21446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21446-nothin-personal/|6.9|Paul A.

How ridiculous are the style experiments? What funny celebrities does he have ""more bitches than,"" and have ""hoes on his dick like""? Is anything on this as good as ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHPumshGgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like a Martian</a>""? Is anything on this as good as ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pyops3UGr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I’m God</a>""?</i> At this point, B's set his own parameters such that there’s no way to identify what ""going astray"" might look like for him. In everything from his capricious tweets to his mixtapes, he’s made a perspective in every direction a perspective in itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So how do we rate new DatPiff-based landfills full of Lil B music, which arrive about three years since he has done anything genuinely surprising, or figured out that he didn’t have to? Sometimes it feels like you have to commit to either categorically disdaining the BasedGod brand, or endorsing all of it. When you have a 50-plus track Lil B release, like the recent </span><i>Thugged Out Pissed Off</i><span>, there’s a song or 10 to satisfy any of your favorite B song types or subjects. The majority of his tapes since 2012’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16414-lil-b-gods-father/"" target=""_blank""><i>God’s Father</i></a><span> have been this large-scale: Perhaps there’s no going back when you’ve gotten into the habit of running long and holding yourself to a standard that no one except you remotely understands. How does he decide when a tape is done? With Lil B, you can’t qualify what you’ll never feel like you really processed.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The tape kicks off with the musical equivalent of a slow-motion strut into the boxing ring with the robe hood up: a trap-ified flip of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Moroder</a>’s funereal <i>Scarface</i> theme. The track sets the mood for the tape pretty well, insofar as we can generalize that of a 63-track-long collection of freestyles: <i>Thugged Out Pissed Off</i><i> i</i>s a little more self-serious, a little more dead-eyed, and a little more disinterested. It lacks the exuberance that made 2014's <i>H</i><i>oop Life</i> and last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20955-free-based-freestyles-mixtape/"" target=""_blank"">collaboration</a> charming. You, the listener, will spend a little more of the portion of the collection asking ""Why this?""</p>
<p>As with a lot of the music which defines the notorious genre of cloud rap—from Raider Klan affiliates to disciples like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32505-yung-lean/"" target=""_blank"">Yung Lean</a>—part of the appeal of Lil B (or, at least, the source of his novelty) for his fans is the contradictory perspectives he squirms in and out of. He’s usually playing at some comic book version of a hard-ass, a bathetic mystic, or a confessional ""real hip-hop""per. On this tape—as if celebrating of the impending release of <i>Deadpool—</i>he’s in full-on noxious mode. He plays the anti-heroic Stanley Kowalski of hustlers with a ""dirty dick like Charlie Sheen,"" and dallies on the subject of ""knocking out bitches."" It seems as if he's intending to indict roided-up possible form of masculinity through first-person character study, and as always with B, it’s hard to put together any fixed explanation. ""I’m a jealous guy so I beat up my bitches/ I’m so insecure, I don’t even trust me,"" he drawls on ""Play the Hood,"" showing his cards a bit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lamentably, there is little in the way of songs fit for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P6-V7J5S-0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crying in pet stores</a> or fun, <i>non sequitu</i>r-filled bangers to balance all this out, or make the body of this thing—the middle two hours, perhaps—less boring. If you love the playful WTF moments, they don’t get too much more compelling than flips of ""Coco"" and ""Jumpman"" (the choruses, respectively: ""I’m in looove with the Based God"" and ""Based God, Based God, Based God, Based God""). These are exercises which it’s hard to imagine even the most diehard, TYBG-tatted devotee getting excited about.</p>
<p>The best songs on this tape pair oddball versions of party-rap production<span>—</span>a fair amount of Mannie Fresh’s laser-tag bounce and calls of ""whodie"" here<span>—</span>or slurred, <i>I’m Gay (I’m Happy)</i>-style boom-bap, with lyrics revolving around racial identity. ""I Was Born Poor"" couples a Hot Boys-ready, cymbal-driven beat with a velour sitar sample, and finds B dreamily murmuring about his ancestry (""Booker T. Washington, still got that honor/ Born into bondage, still became a scholar""). On the purely musical end, there are a handful of unusual gambits that stick with you: the triumphant singing on ""With Me"" is placed like a R&amp;B break in the middle of an early '00s rap track and comes out sounding like something close to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcSlcNfThUA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tiny Tim</a>.</p>
<p>But even the pleasant details are forgotten too quickly. Even more than, say, 2013’s 101-track <i>05 Fuck Em—</i>a similarly unwieldy but much more engaging release thanks to a good haul of truly bizarre style experiments—it feels like B is just hitting a deadline and releasing what he has lying around. Sure, that’s probably what he’s always done, but this feels more like a perfunctory archive purge.<i> Thugged Out Pissed Off</i> creates the image of a Lil B who is unsure if he wants to keep up things exactly as he’s been doing them, but doesn’t know exactly what he should do instead.</p></div>"|21392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21392-thugged-out-pissed-off/|6.3|Winston Cook-Wilson

""I guess I was pretty naive."" By the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Knuckles</a> moved over to the Powerplant in 1985, Heard finally checked him out. And while still not the biggest fan of house music, he shared Knuckles’ tastes, a zealotry for both '70s R&amp;B and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Moroder</a>-style Eurodisco. Heard, the drummer for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4711-yes/"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a> cover band and multi-instrumentalist, began making his own productions as Mr. Fingers soon after, which brought things full circle; ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJv6qBOZbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mystery of Love</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9d8DHMZi0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Washing Machine</a>"" became both the urtext for house music and staples of Frankie’s sets. </p>
<p>Heard’s productions remain the gold standard for dance music. While he’s not as prolific in the 21st century, Heard’s still the person acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a> tap for cred-boosting remixes. But finding and hearing Heard’s albums has never been easy, even in 1988, when he released two of house music’s finest full-lengths: <i>Ammnesia</i> (credited to Mr. Fingers) and <i>Another Side</i>, his sterling collaboration with vocalists Robert Owens and Ron Wilson as Fingers Inc. Both are beacons of American dance music, and ironically neither album was ever released stateside.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years later, <i>Another Side</i> finally gets reissued on Heard’s <a href=""http://alleviatedrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alleviated</a> label, remastered and spread across three pieces of vinyl (it's also available digitally). <i>Another Side</i> might sound unfamiliar to modern EDM listeners, who might wonder where the incessant wallop and insipid vocals signifying ""deep house"" in 2016 went. The album opens with the shimmering keys and by-turns gritty and gentle soul vocals of Owens on ""Decision,"" Heard’s programmed drums swinging around but never quite settling into a four-four. The downtempo rhythmic figures, silken pads, and whispers of ""Bye Bye"" only reinforce the anecdote that in 1992 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> Adu personally approached Heard about producing her band's album, a collaboration that sadly never came to pass.</p>
<p>But while we may never hear the man in conjunction with Ms. Adu, Heard found a singular vocalist in Robert Owens. Forceful enough to growl over an 808 and smooth enough to slot into adult contemporary, Owens’ formidable talents are still not appreciated today. While his fellow Chicagoans were overt in their influences, be it Jamie Principle’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> obsession or Darryl Pandy’s Teddy Pendergrass impression, Owens balances between those two giants of R&amp;B without ever being beholden to either. It’s a voice that conveys emotions rarely found in dance music these days: grace, gratitude, giddiness, forlornness, estrangement, defiance.</p>
<p>All those emotions can be not just heard, but <i>felt</i> on songs like the title track, ""I’m Strong,"" and ""Bring Down the Walls."" ""Be strong,"" Owens and backing vocalist Ron Wilson advise on ""Another Side,"" hopeful for a better tomorrow, repeating as mantra: ""Someway/ Someday/ Somehow/ (Carry on)."" Whether you hear ""I’m Strong"" and ""Bring Down the Walls"" as a resilient call to arms for gay men, for the impoverished, for inner-city African-Americans, for South Africans under apartheid, or just for all the oppressed people seeking solace on a darkened dancefloor, they still resonate as that rare breed, elegant yet body-jacking songs of protest. Not bad for a song like ""Walls,"" which Owens <a href=""http://www.electronicbeats.net/larry-heard-and-fingers-inc-on-the-story-of-a-house-classic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted</a> to writing on toilet paper during his break at the hospital.</p>
<p>For all the sophistication, smooth jazz chords, and political undertones of the album, it's important to note that it still knocks. The programming of tracks like ""Distant Planet,"" ""Music Take Me Up,"" and ""I’m Strong"" still define dance music and elevate the room at peak hour. You could just as easily retitle the latter half of the album <i>House Music’s Greatest Hits</i>, as it’s filled with seismic tracks like ""Mystery of Love,"" ""Feelin’ Sleazy,"" ""Bring Down the Walls,"" and ""Can You Feel It.""</p>
<p>While ""deep house"" now means certain club-friendly clichés to a generation of YouTube commenters and Boiler Room attendees, an album like <i>Another Side</i> has only had its title grow in meanings over the intervening decades. It suggests that at its inception, ""house"" was not a simple square but instead polygonal. Or as one of Heard’s devotees, Todd Terry, would put it a few years on, ""house is a feeling."" <i>Another Side</i> showcased Larry Heard’s myriad other sides, be it tropical ambient, grown-ass R&amp;B, deft jazz chops, island rhythms, and even prog-rock’s embrace of early synthesizer technology. But ultimately, the music that Heard and Owens rendered back then was a way to make cheap synths and cast-off drum machines emote and express the tumult of human emotions that could arise after a long night at the Warehouse, or anywhere else. In hindisght, it sounds now like the path not traveled by the masses. </p></div>"|21391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21391-fingers-inc-another-side/|8.8|Andy Beta

Villagers prove to be the exception to this rule with <i>Where Have You Been All My Life?</i>, a collection of re-recordings of material from their three previous albums that reframes the songs in an impressively cohesive manner.</p>
<p>Many artists re-record their best work because they’re in a dry spell and/or they’re sick of watching their old label make money off of the songs they made when they were young and signed a bad contract. What usually hinders re-recorded versions is a sense of ""we got it right the first time"" frustration that undermines the spirit of the original, but the new versions on <i>Where Have You Been… </i>swell with a different determination, one of ""We’ve <i>got</i> to get it right this time."" Recorded in one day last July, these mostly acoustic versions were reportedly all first or second takes with no overdubs.  The band had already been touring in support of last April’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20393-darling-arithmetic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Darling Arithmetic</i></a> for three months by the time they went into RAK Studios in London. <i>Arithmetic </i>tracks account for half of the songs on here, but Villagers have restructured the older songs to fit the sound of the newer material, unifying them in their delicate harmonies, brushed drums, and double bass arrangements.</p>
<p>A definite highlight on this collection is ""Memoir,"" which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4921-charlotte-gainsbourg/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a> recorded a version of in 2011 and which appeared as a Villagers B-side a year later. The distracting crowd noise and flat-tire-on-the-highway rhythm of that version were wisely left off this most recent recording, and the song touches a nerve even more discomfiting than before. Its desperate romantic lyrics hit more directly. ""In the orgy I can vaguely hear the outline of your call,"" <span>singer and songwriter Conor O’Brien </span>sings at one point before telling the subject of the song, ""you were the lighthouse to my broken boat."" The latter image connects the song on this compilation with ""My Lighthouse,"" which first appeared on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17509-awayland/"" target=""_blank""><i>{Awayland}</i></a>.</p>
<p>""The Waves,"" also originally from <i>{Awayland}</i>, is another highlight. On that album, it had an electronic undercurrent, which was later taken several fathoms deeper when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N-uqa_dEIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixed</a> by house duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16690-psychemagik-black-noir-schwarz-ft-renegade/"" target=""_blank"">Psychemagik</a>. The drastic acoustic reinterpretation on this album feels like the song’s natural state, the long-building crescendo threatens to swallow the singer before he has finished saying his piece.  The <i>Where Have You Been All My Life?</i> title comes from a line in “The Soul Serene,” but naming it as such feels like Villagers begging for new audiences to ask that same question of the album. The music within warrants it.</p>

Brothers Niko and Xander Sitaras, Jordan Graham, and Nathan Blake were previously-known as ""the band who opened for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"" target=""_blank"">Mac DeMarco</a> at the show where he was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57476-mac-demarco-detained-by-police-during-santa-barbara-concert/"" target=""_blank"">arrested at in Santa Barbara</a>,"" and now they’ve released a debut EP: <i>Fun for Family &amp; Friends</i>, an ode to the exact kind of synergy with an audience for which that show is remembered.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Paper Days are reckless, or that their music is unhinged. Their EP was recorded without overdubs in an homage to the live-show experience; this is a group that wants to sound like they’re in the room with you, playing at a house party the likes of which Paper Days have channelled into something of a mini-cult following in SoCal (thus the name of their EP: <i>Fun for Family &amp; Friends</i>). The overarching sound here is wave-washed rock from a bass-, drums-, and two-guitar configuration. ""Kind Guidance"" and ""Sweet Destiny,"" the band’s two lead singles, are beach-friendly and melodic, but percussive and turbulent in their messiest moments thanks to Graham’s forceful timekeeping and the synergy between Blake and the Sitaras bros’ kaleidoscopic guitar tones (Xander Sitaras plays bass).</p>
<p>There’s an atmospheric feel in Paper Days’ music, and singer Niko Sitaras uses this context as a means of both poetic conveyance and care-free musing. ""I had to be a believer to know when I was wrong,"" he croons on ""Kind Guidance,"" before rejoining, more explicitly: ""You had your back/ Against the wall for me, baby."" There’s a slickness to lyrics like this that feels more social than angsty; ""Boy""—which is inspired by Caitlyn Jenner—is a reflection on gender stereotypes that still manages to sound fun-loving despite the embedded provocations in the lyrics (""For a boy to be a man/ He’s gotta learn it with his hands""). Here, Sitaras' vocals, which were written collectively by the band, seem to mirror the binaries of the music itself; at points his voice is vigorous and gruff, yet during the bridge (""It’s alright to be okay/ (Are you?)"")—it soars up in the register to a high falsetto that is the sonic equivalent of a gentle caress.</p>
<p>The entire EP is loose and layered, with several elements that occasionally feel too cluttered to cohere (cc: ""Lightning Cola"")—but then again, some of the cuts here, like the title track, are single, raw takes meant to emulate that ""living room"" feel that often defines small-town bands. Lyrically speaking, Paper Days’ EP could benefit from a stronger narrative arc—something to make each song, with each of their frenetic sonic elements, feel like pieces of a larger puzzle (rather than mini-narratives unto themselves). Paper Days have a personality that asks to be teased out with a more resonant point of view. Instead of being part of Mac DeMarco’s story, he could be part of theirs. </p></div>"|21425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21425-fun-for-family-friends-ep/|6.9|Molly Beauchemin

In 2014, after a decade spent leading the occasionally entrancing psych-and-blues syndicate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28085-the-entrance-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Entrance Band</a>, Blakeslee stepped from beneath a long-hanging haze to issue <a href=""https://guyblakeslee.bandcamp.com/album/ophelia-slowly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ophelia Slowly</i></a>, his proper solo entrée.<a href=""https://guyblakeslee.bandcamp.com/album/ophelia-slowly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>The nine-song set suggested the musical equivalent of a clean haircut acquired for a job interview, as though Blakeslee wanted to prove he had moved beyond the chemically addled numbers of his youth and matured into proper rock songcraft. As such, moments on <i>Ophelia Slowly</i> aligned with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">the War on Drugs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"" target=""_blank"">the Walkmen</a> and, lo and behold, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2353-kings-of-leon/"" target=""_blank"">Kings of Leon</a>. Sure, some wild-eyed, static-heavy clips remained, but now past the age of 30, Blakeslee seemed to have cleaned up his act and cleared up his songs.</p>
<p>But <i>The Middle Sister</i>,<i> </i>his second LP under his own name, is a reentrance to a psychedelic state of mind, at least on the surface. Issued by <a href=""http://leavingrecords.com/releases/lr073-the-middle-sister/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving Records</a>, a Los Angeles imprint that specializes in the astral and the abstruse, <i>The Middle Sister</i> is an all-instrumental, guitar-and-accessories reverie of two very different, very high minds. If <i>Ophelia Slowly</i> was Blakeslee’s attempt to sharpen the edges of his rock and aim for a bigger audience, <i>The Middle Sister</i> turns left and aims for the solitude of the stars. These six pieces are complementary, connected tributes to several strains of musical mysticism—American primitive guitar playing, New Age trance-induction, krautrock ascendance, and ambient drift. It fails, however, to get very far beyond pleasant.</p>
<p>The record’s first half, a two-song collection called ""Halcyon Movement,"" offers precisely what the title implies—peaceful, feather-light acoustic guitar meditations that spiral upward toward some New Age ideals, for eight-to-10 minutes each. Not content with the sound of six strings alone, the second selection adds the sustained washes of singing bowls and the twinkling ripples of distant piano. Blakeslee plays a bit harder above them, feverishly strumming the chords toward the diptych’s end as though pushing back against the very veil of prettiness he’s created. These extended compositions reach for the majesty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10287-the-cloud-of-unknowing/"" target=""_blank"">James Blackshaw’s finest recorded hours</a>, which turned six or 12 strings into graceful little symphonies. But Blakeslee’s approximations are rudimentary and shambolic, too uneven and pedestrian to provide the lift of his predecessors.</p>
<p>The four-movement back half, collectively dubbed ""Maja (Queen of the Storm),"" comes as an uninterrupted four-song suite. Blakeslee starts alone, routing rudimentary triads through a series of guitar effects, tape delays, and static shrouds. It’s a wan recreation of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"" target=""_blank"">Stars of the Lid</a>’s galaxy-sized swells. A drum machine subsequently anchors this wafting chromaticism, with rays of noise dissolving into and out of a beat that is itself more identifiable than Klaus Dinger’s name. Blakeslee lets that steady thrum disappear gradually, first into a drums-and-guitar space jam and, finally, a glacial six-minute exit that splits the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Eno</a>’s ambient systems and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a>’s high-volume thrall. This is a listener’s digest version of those enormous touchstones; Blakeslee has slimmed the giants he summons of necessary weight and context, repurposing their accomplishments into his own facile end.</p>
<p>The best of Blakeslee’s work with Entrance found him digging deep into archaic source material, challenging and churning it into tunes that, no matter how clear the inspirations, felt like personal journals. He’d wrestled with the references. But <i>The Middle Sister </i>feels passive and passing, like a fleeting homage from a musician just starting to explore new sources. It’s hard not to picture Blakeslee in the back of a van or at the desk of a bedroom, going down YouTube, Spotify, or MP3-blog wormholes with transfixing masters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"" target=""_blank"">John Fahey</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5407-lubomyr-melnyk/"" target=""_blank"">Lubomyr Melnyk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"" target=""_blank"">Ash Ra Tempel</a>, only to re-emerge with the hope of making a record like <i>that </i>of his own.

Just a minute into opening track ""The Birds,"" the West Coast-based rapper and singer/songwriter offers: ""My mama caught the gambling bug... My papa was behind them bars/ We never had to want for nuthin’/ Said all we ever need is love."" His voice is warm, strained, and conversational, like a Baptist minister or your favorite uncle schooling you, and the wide-open groove has an unhurried feel. It's immediately clear: This is a sincere, soulful project, brimming with honesty and humble perseverance.</p>
<p>Brandon Anderson Paak has seen a lot in his 29 years. His mother was a farmer from South Korea, and his father served in the Air Force and later worked as a mechanic until he was sent to prison. ""I didn’t see him again until he was being buried,"" .Paak <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/12/from-compton-to-malibu-the-new-life-of-anderson-paak/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Consequence of Sound in a 2015 interview. All of this life experience is reflected in <i>Malibu</i>, which is both his most assured and most personal project yet.</p>
<p>.Paak's name is more prominent these days given his recent work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/""><i> </i><i>Compton</i></a>, where he appeared on six of 16 tracks, but even his sophomore album, 2014's <i>Venice</i>, showed flashes of brilliance. <i>Venice</i> was an easy listen; on <i>Malibu</i>, .Paak celebrates his progression by acknowledging where he’s come from, the trials he’s endured and things he’s seen. ""I spent years being called out my name, living under my greatness,"" .Paak asserts on ""The Season / Carry Me,"" a shape-shifting album highlight. He grew up performing in church, and on the song’s second half, you can hear a rich gospel flair in his voice: ""Ya moms in prison, ya father need a new kidney/ Ya family’s splittin’, rivalries between siblings/ If cash ain’t king, it’s damn sure the incentive."" Much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, .Paak skillfully depicts his surroundings while remaining in the foreground.</p>
<p>Kendrick's spirit feels present at many points on <i>Malibu</i>. .Paak's quicksilver flow on ""Your Prime"" feels teleported in directly from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/"" target=""_blank""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i></a>as the music flows expansively from creamy soul harmonies to trap cadences. But .Paak is a confident and unique presence, with a strong command of style and genre as a producer and songwriter. He leapfrogs three eras in a festive suite of songs mid-album that examine heartbreak: '60s soul on ""Put Me Thru,"" club grooves on ""Am I Wrong,"" and '90s hip-hop on ""Without You."" His musical and emotional generosity ties everything together, making <i>Malibu</i> an expansive opus that flows in multiple directions like a classic '70s double album. </p>
<p><i>Malibu</i> is a community-oriented project, much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/"" target=""_blank""><i>Surf</i></a>, informed by voices from the past and full of guests who are given ample space to do their best work. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"">The Game</a> drops one of his most disarming, winning verses in a minute on ""Room in Here""; Rapsody flows affectingly about heartache over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>-style boom-bap. Many songs ride out on extended breakdowns, like ""Parking Lot,"" which feels like a studio band given room to stretch. </p>
<p>On ""The Dreamer,"" the album’s celebratory final track, .Paak shares his success with his community, people who look like him and work to avoid similar pitfalls. ""Who cares ya daddy couldn’t be here/ Mama always kept the cable on/ I’m a product of the tube and the free lunch/ Living room, watching old reruns."" This is powerful art, not only for people of color, but for everyone who exists beyond societal constraints. It’s for those who’ve been told they don’t quite fit, those viewed through a different lens because of their circumstances. It’s a beautiful reminder that, no matter what you’ve endured, you can go anywhere and reach glorious heights.</p></div>"|21387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21387-malibu/|8.6|Marcus J. Moore

While the Maryland-based indie pop outfit intended to record an album in 2014, the band stalled and effectively dissolved, leading frontman Sam Ray to take the reins, recording an album by himself and bringing in past members and anyone who was willing to help finish the job. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ironically, for an album that was shaped largely by one person, <i>An Abundance of Strawberries</i> exceends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18017-julia-brown-to-be-close-to-you/"">the band’s sole demo</a> and single in ambition. Ray pushes past the conventional limitations of ""lo-fi indie pop"" at every turn: The opening title track begins with Ray's soft singing and a strummed acoustic guitar, before giving way to cymbal crashes and a cavalcade of voices as the song expands and blossoms. Likewise, ""The Body Descends"" is a near-epic at five minutes, growing from quiet piano chords to Infinity Crush's Caroline White singing along with Ray, her voice melding with his as as viola swells with the drums to create a pristine piece of ballroom pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the surface, </span><i>An Abundance of Strawberries</i><span> feels like a continuation of Julia Brown’s old, home-taped sound. ""Procession (full)"" is full of choppy guitar strums and has a ramshackle quality meant to hide how well put together it is. ""All Alone in Bed,"" with lines like ""Does your mother know/ That you’re skin and bones/ Does your mother know/ Those things you do when you’re all alone in bed"" over plinked xylophone captures the intimacy, playfulness, and quiet melancholy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18017-julia-brown-to-be-close-to-you/""><i>To Be Close to You</i></a>.<b></b></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But then something like ""Snow Day,"" which is built around an off-kilter drum machine and near-random keyboard notes, draws just as much from the production work Ray does under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32107-ricky-eat-acid/"">Ricky Eat Acid</a> moniker. This quiet experimental runs throughout the album and binds everything together, even at its extremes. ""You Can Always Hear the Birds"" opens with an out-of-nowhere jungle freak-out before giving way to looping drum crashes and Ray’s Vocoder-masked vocals, yet the album ends on ""Bloom,"" the album’s simplest track: Just Ray and his guitar, reminding everyone the true essence of his work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i> An Abundance of Strawberries</i> is a dense collection, but it coheres thanks to Ray's ability to twist a connective melody out of the most unlikely of places. It feels indebted to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6330-elephant-6/"">Elephant 6</a> creative model, where albums express the vision of one artist through a whole host of close collaborators. It has a similar communal feel, like being surrounded by a group of creative friends. If this is indeed the last work of Julia Brown, it’s heartening to know that the band was able to end on such a grand statement.  </p></div>"|21399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21399-an-abundance-of-strawberries/|7.9|David Glickman

That's not necessarily true, though. If the retro fixations of the current century have told us anything—from electroclash's fascination with the early '80s to the recent revival of grime's bleepy fundamentals—it's that dance music's period-specific patinas are a big part of its enduring charm.</p>
<p>A new anthology of the duo Mood II Swing is, if anything, overdue. Their productions in the '90s helped establish a style of house music—moody, colorful, and rhythmically inventive—that has had a profound impact on several successive generations of club producers. Their unique sense of swing helped feed the slinky syncopations of UK garage around the turn of the millennium; more recently, the hypnotic and soulful aspects of their sound have influenced revivalist house music from the underground all the way to the top of the charts, from tunes like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32958-jack-j/"">Jack J</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17498-jack-j-thirstin/"" target=""_blank"">Thirstin'</a>"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30666-duke-dumont/"">Duke Dumont</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14677-duke-dumont-need-u-100-ft-ame/"" target=""_blank"">Need U (100%)</a>."" The bulk of the songs collected here date from between 1992 and 1997, but the uninitiated listener hearing them for the first time might well mistake many of them for brand-new productions. Many sound uncannily<i> </i>current; the best sound timeless.</p>
<p>That Mood II Swing (consisting of Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone) established such an immediately recognizable style is all the more impressive for the fact that most of the time they were remixing other artists. Only 14 of the 33 songs here are originals; the rest are remixes for a diverse lot of pop and R&amp;B acts whose names have mostly faded from view, like Kim English, Loni Clark, and Ultra Naté, whose career peak, 1997's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgRBkjgXHro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Free</a>,"" was co-written with and produced by Mood II Swing. No matter who the credited performer is, though, a number of hallmarks remain constant throughout. The most obvious is the group's infectious and inimitable sense of the groove. Around steady kicks and hi-hats, regular as fence posts, snake vine-like figures dipping and bobbing in the breeze—shakers and congas, hiccupping accidentals and sidewinding basslines that turn even the most linear rhythms into controlled explosions of kinetic energy.</p>
<p>On a song like Doubleplusgood's ""Conga Té (Mood II Swing 12"" Mix),"" you can hear the influence of hip-hop, particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10512-the-bomb-squad/"">the Bomb Squad</a>: Every inch of the track is stuffed with elements until it all ignites like a sky full of fireworks. A typical Mood II Swing track is charged with so much friction, you expect sparks to fly, and that's particularly true when they indulge their fondness for busted and broken sounds. You can hear that in the distortion of BT's ""Remember (Mood II Swing Remix),"" in which the kick drum rattles like a shredded speaker cone, and the nervy squelch of the heavily filtered ""Slippery Track,"" which rivals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"">Matthew Herbert</a>'s most aggressively funky work of the period.</p>
<p>The compilation is split more or less evenly between vocal tracks and instrumentals or dub versions, and in the case of Eric Gadd's ""The Right Way,"" which is presented in both versions, you can hear how differently the duo approached those two contexts. The vocal mix leaves the singer's whispery falsetto unadulterated, and the results sound a lot like early '90s R&amp;B with a piano-house underpinning. (The vocalists they worked with tend to be soulful belters; your appreciation for the vocal side of their catalog will depend largely upon your fondness for that emphatic, melismatic style.) On the dub, though, Mood II Swing mute everything the singer does save for a plaintive looped cry. It's on these dub mixes and instrumental cuts where Mood II Swing's talents really shine: Just check ""Do It Your Way,"" which takes a ""Billie Jean""-like bassline and kits it out in flashing ride cymbals, slapback delay, and a liquid tone that sounds like a melancholy snippet of whale song. In these moments they're sultans of swirl, masters of the hypnotic groove, and as nuanced as anyone in dance music, then or now.</p></div>"|21405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21405-strictly-mood-ii-swing/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

It was the original name of a certain morose Mancunian post-punk band <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">before they got all inside-baseball with their World War II references</a>, and it was the inspiration for ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gy94N_mcWs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warszawa</a>,"" the haunting ambient symphony that heralds the foreboding second act of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s <i>Low</i>. As the first Warsaw-based musician in years to plug into the North American indie industrial complex, Tobiasz Biliński doesn't do much to dispel those grim allusions. He may possess the gentle voice of a sensitive folksinger and the byzantine mind of a composer, but at the core of his music beats the blackened heart of a goth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Provider</i> is Biliński's third album as Coldair, but the first to land in the U.S. (through a publishing and digital distribution deal with <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a>). And from an aesthetic standpoint, it may as well be his proper debut, because it's less a full realization of what he's been working toward than a wholesale reformulation of it. Coldair's previous efforts were more like warm gusts: gentle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>an serenades guided by winsome, wandering melodies and buttressed by brass fanfares. But 2013's <i>Whose Blood</i> suggested a creeping unease, with digital jolts and foreboding, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>-like percussion that poked black holes in the scenery. On <i>The Provider</i>, Biliński reaches into those fissures and tears them wide open, allowing that darkness to become all-consuming. Listen close and you can still hear the acoustic strums and trombone trills that underpinned his earlier work, but here they're subservient to frosty synth drones, icy 808s, and synthetic handclaps that sting like smacks to the face on a winter's night. As the arresting opener ""Endear"" emerges from a misty haze into an urgent, industrial-grade throb, Biliński is transformed from humble troubadour to the high priest at black mass, complete with an ominous church-organ hum that powers the song's intense finale.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But there's a bit of a </span><span>Wizard of Oz</span><span> effect at play on </span><i>The Provider</i><span>—the songs may project a majestic ultraviolet glow, but the dry ice eventually clears to reveal the lonely, wounded soul pulling the levers behind the curtain. Biliński's language has become brutally direct: ""My whole life is falling apart so fast,"" he sings at one point, and </span><i>The Provider</i><span> can be heard as his attempt to put the pieces back together, resulting in songs that seem both fragile and imposing in their construction, all jagged edges and exposed wires. The overwhelming mood of distress is reflected in the unsettled arrangements—electro-shocked beats clash with militaristic drum fills, pianos and shoegaze guitar drizzle rub up against anxious tick-tock rhythms, meditative melodies hover above dirty dancefloor grinds. But that internal tension dissipates when the songs start to sprawl out, as on the synth-smeared title track or the sputtering bombast of ""Suit Yourself.""</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a0ed3b68-1e27-b276-8f40-da010e290967""><i>The Provider</i><span> is most compelling when its textural expanse induces claustrophobia. Beneath the clatter, </span><i>The Provider</i><span> elicits the discomfiting sensation of eavesdropping on Biliński's private conversations—with family members, with ex-lovers, with himself—about his feelings of inadequacy in the face of parental and societal pressures. But his voice remains as light as the subject matter is heavy, and is often double-tracked into angelic harmonies that help smooth over the songs' corrosive surfaces. And even when working with electro-sonics and brittle beats, Biliński's classically-trained approach to songcraft prevails—on strobe-lit standouts like ""Perfect Son"" and ""Denounce,"" he builds big hooks out of scraps and shards, skilfully layering and arranging his minimal elements to maximize their dramatic impact. Ironically, the more oppressive environs of </span><i>The Provider</i><span> prove to be a more effective showcase for Biliński's emotionally charged songcraft than his heart-on-sleeve folkie phase. Because that's the funny thing about cold air—when the weather turns so frigid that your exhalation produces visible vapors, it feels like you're breathing fire.   </span></span></p></div>"|21447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21447-the-provider/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Enter Dylan LeBlanc, a 25-year-old Louisiana native. According to his bio, LeBlanc found himself, at 23, ""exhausted and damaged,"" thanks to alcohol and hard living. True to this particular troubadour form, he more or less got his life together and wrote some songs about it. He’s even got a tie to the Muscle Shoals golden goose, having lived in the Alabama town as a child before returning to write his third LP, <i>Cautionary Tale</i>.</p>
<p>The result lands comfortably in the contemporary singer-songwriter canon, but it’s hard to say exactly <i>where</i>. Lilting pedal steel, brushy acoustic guitar strums and tender piano licks suggest Americana, but string sections pull LeBlanc in a different direction. <i>Cautionary Tale</i> often feels like what most folks probably expected from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30716-night-beds/"">Night Beds</a> as a follow-up to 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17656-country-sleep/""><i>Country Sleep</i></a>. LeBlanc’s somewhat high mumbled singing directly recalls Night Beds’ Winston Yellen, most notably on ""Man Like Me.""</p>
<p>It’s these richer textures and unexpected twists that do <i>Cautionary Tale</i> the most favors. The result is a record that, on the surface, sounds beautiful from start to finish. At times, though, these arrangements create a smoke-and-mirrors effect that obscures the weak spots in LeBlanc’s songwriting. ""Beyond the Veil"" is a slow, bluesy track with blunt lyrics about lying politicians and media manipulation that don’t read much different from a teenager’s Tumblr post encouraging readers to ""stay woke."" Later, ""Balance or Fall"" feels like a tired take on a lonesome cowboy metaphor: guns, the desert, harlots, and the hangman’s noose all come up at some point. An Americana-leaning song romanticizing the Wild West: imagine that!</p>
<p>These arrangements don’t prevent <i>Cautionary Tale</i> from dragging in its back half, either. Centerpiece ""Beyond the Veil"" <i>sounds</i> pretty, especially with its extended instrumental coda, but by the song’s end, you’ve pretty much gotten the gist of the extent of LeBlanc’s capabilities. The remaining four songs end up feeling like dead weight, adding little else of note. ""I’m Moving On,"" a pleasant shuffle that sounds teleported from the early '60s, might be an exception—even if most of its lyrics are just the title repeated about a dozen times. </p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, LeBlanc still fares better than many of his like-minded contemporaries. <i>Cautionary Tale</i> never feels cloying or over-the-top—LeBlanc’s voice and arrangements always fit together naturally. His songwriting seems promising enough to expand, offering him an opportunity to examine himself and the world around him with a more critically thoughtful eye. LeBlanc might be part of a club that never seems to stop expanding, but he at least offers some extra intrigue with his membership.</p></div>"|21389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21389-cautionary-tale/|5.7|Allison Hussey

He's a notoriously streaming-unfriendly artist, after all, and even as his reputation looms larger than ever, his art has become more difficult to obtain. What would someone vaguely familiar with the legend but completely new to the music discover? Well, a millions things obviously—a particular melodic sensibility, the urge to continually reinvent, the indelible stories, his undeniable chops, a restless creativity. But in concrete terms, Prince's best work took new, unfamiliar paths to familiar feelings. Established song forms rebuilt the ""wrong"" way, Prince's discography has a stiff, funky, uncanny-valley relationship with the pop that came before.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And this is why <i>HITNRUN Phase Two</i> is an underwhelming entry in the artist formerly known as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince's canon. Relative to the idiosycratic and all-over-the place <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21026-hitnrun-phase-one/"">first iteration</a> of the <i>HITNRUN </i>series, <i>Phase Two</i> is an organic-textured, polished, and predictable release. From beginning to end, Prince seems more interested in establishing his proficiency with pop forms, demonstrating his facility with the materials  to craft, as it were, a sturdy wooden table. Rather than an artist's interpretation, we get a craftman's tracing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is in part due to the absence of Joshua Welton, formerly of forgotten R&amp;B group Fatty Koo. Welton  co-produced the bulk of the first <i>HITNRUN</i> album, accenting it with EDM flourishes in a way that felt mildly adventurous. Without them, the record feels bland. But ultimately it's a lack of ideas that sinks this record, a point which hits home every time these songs overtly or subliminally recall one song or another in pop music history. Whether the references are knowing (a nod to Prince's own ""Kiss"" partway through dancefloor record ""Stare"") or simply dial up favorites from R&amp;B's celestial jukebox (the extended highlight ""Groovy Potential"" surely recalls Oliver Cheatham's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2UZ7BGRkE4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get Down <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_535443080""><span class=""aQJ"">Saturday</span></span> Night</a>""), the songs rarely cohere into unique shapes. Or when they do, there's something quaint and mediated about the whole ordeal: the swaggering protagonists of ""Stare,"" (""Now we got the sound that's popping in the street"") may have the ""party going ham"" but the strutting feels calculated and theatrical.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We also get the waltz of ""When She Comes,"" like an action-figure version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding/"">Otis Redding</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2RGu1v5388"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I've Got Dreams to Remember</a>,"" or the ludicrous chorus of garage-rock vehicle ""Screwdriver,"" which was first premiered in 2013 and could have been written for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1957-the-hives/"">the Hives</a>. Lyrics tend to be forgettably symbolic; ""I'm in the big city when I'm in your arms."" I mean, sure? This is perhaps most jarring on topical opener ""Baltimore,"" which not only strikes a bum note tonally—the reassuriningly jaunty vibe is miles away from ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17553-kendrick-lamar-alright/"" target=""_blank"">Alright</a>""—but just seems lazy: ""We're tired of crying, and people dying/ Let's take all the guns away."" OK, so no one needs Prince to offer policy positions, but in contrast with even the hippy idealism of his incredible '90s anti-gun anthem ""<span><a href=""http://www.wat.tv/video/prince-nona-gaye-love-sign-4x6bf_2jvpb_.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Love Sign</a>,""</span> ""Baltimore"" suggests complete creative fatigue.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The redeeming moments are ones which make some unpredictable moves—any shocks are welcome on a record as polite and poised as this. Near the end comes ""Revelation,"" a spare version of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12335-the-isley-brothers/"">Isley Brothers</a>-style ballad which holds attention by withholding. Prince's vocal performance has a touching grace, but what makes the song work is its subversive refusal to entirely exist: it feels like a shadow. But perhaps the album's true star is ""Xtraloveable,"" a silly record with an amusing chorus conceit: ""Whenever you need someone to take a shower with, call me up, please."" It strikes a rare relatable-goofy balance, and like 2014's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHbyNrGXpAA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Breakfast Can Wait</a>"" or 2015's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VC7oi4U--g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1000 X's and O's</a>,"" this gives the record some weight and substance. It's a bit odd to imagine that shower sex is the most exciting part of Prince's day—after all, he's still a superstar living in a $10 million Paisley Park estate—but no reason not to take what you can get.</p></div>"|21353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21353-hitnrun-phase-two/|4.7|David Drake

""I'm depressed and faded,"" he confesses early on his debut project, a short EP called </span><i>5 O'Clock Shadow</i><span>. That self-medicated crossroads isn't so unique for his age, after all, but the debut's sustained gloom stands out. The release is Tents' lone calling card, and at times he's rightfully fussed with how to frame the project. A couple months after releasing the original 7-track EP the Brooklyn rapper expanded the effort into a full LP of the same name. It seemed like he was testing the waters, and while the album fleshes out a more formal introduction, the streamlined original still carries the best work.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tents has a breathless baritone that allows him to stretch out long phrases and carry a hook. The production on <i>5 O'Clock Shadow</i>, overseen by the Vamp, is warm with embedded instrumentation, a brand of soulful easy-listening that begs for the punctuation of a singer. As a rapper Tents sculpts his verses out carefully, sometimes to the unfortunate point of leaning on familiar tropes. Still, he has an obvious sense for structure, and while the EP has several guests they're usually added voices instead of featured characters. On the opener, ""The Way,"" Tents is overly cautious about the prospect of his music career and it's immediately apparent how much pressure he's placed on this outing. It's the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32435-tunji-ige/"">Tunji Ige</a>-assisted hook that pulls you in though, a ghostly chant about taking over that hits its mark.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tents seems quietly apart from New York City's hip-hop scene: geographically he's from way out in East New York, Brooklyn, and figuratively he's adjoined to a crew called SLEEPERcamp, a burgeoning collective taking calculated steps to establish a brand in small doses. (Tents and crewmember Jay Bel were briefly managed by behind-the-scenes TDE coordinator Anthony ""Moosa"" Tiffith Jr.) The track ""All of It"" brings in KeithCharles Spacebar of Atlanta's in-the-moment <a href=""http://awfulrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Awful Records</a>, who joins Tents for an uncharacteristic-to-the-project trap sound. It seems like Tents is saying, ""I can fit in this lane too,"" before burrowing back into his own character-building.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-466c668c-08af-78d0-d23c-ffeeef461ab7"">""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17872-jimi-tents-landslide/"">Landslide</a>"" is the lone upbeat number here, a cheerful standout that both the EP and Tents use to stay afloat. ""Elmer Fudd,"" Tents' original debut single released almost a year ago, bears out his somberly-executed charms: a knack for melody and precise delivery. ""If a body drop in the hood, and no one around, does it make noise?"" he asks. The whole debut carries that straight-forward polish; repeated listens won't necessarily bear out lyrical revelations, but the foundation is sound. In that way <i>5 O'Clock Shadow</i> pulls off a professional introduction like a firm handshake and practiced party chatter, an accomplished first impression more than a winding conversation.</span></p></div>"|21378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21378-5-oclock-shadow/|7.9|Jay Balfour

His breakthrough project, 2013’s <i>Signed to the Streets</i>, produced a catchy street hit (""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgA-wVkuZGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dis Ain’t What U Want</a>"") and spotlighted his particular brand of Auto-Tuned warbling, equal parts soothing and seething.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After a rough 2014 marked by spotty appearances on the </span><i>Coke Boys 4</i><span> mixtape, a lukewarm </span><span><i>Signed to the Streets</i></span><span> sequel, and the murder of his cousin, OTF Nunu, things continued to nosedive for Durk in the months leading up to and immediately following his Def Jam debut, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20564-remember-my-name/""><i>Remember My Name</i></a><span><i>.</i> His manager, OTF Chino, was killed last March and his debut, which arrived shortly thereafter, grappled with the same gun violence that took his friend and colleague, only with minimal affect and an uneven, often shoddy, delivery.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lil Durk, however, soldiered on and earned back some musical capital with the rap ballad ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17812-lil-durk-dej-loaf-my-beyonce/"">My Beyoncé</a>"" featuring Detroit rapper and long-rumored girlfriend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32502-dej-loaf/"">Dej Loaf</a>, which perfectly married their similarly cleansing uses of Auto-Tune—for Durk, it purges impurities; for Dej, it makes her vocals smooth and measured like pressing wrinkles from a garment. The duet was the first taste of Durk’s latest mixtape, <i>300 Days 300 Nights</i>, a 19-track offering that manages to sustain interest for its duration, presenting a reinvigorated Durk, who’s the sharpest he has been in years. ""Ever since I built my buzz, I don’t get the same love,"" he raps on ""Mud."" He raps like he’s trying to earn that favor back.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The main knock on Durk is that his use of Auto-Tune renders him a prisoner to melody, which, in turn, renders him one-dimensional, but he proves himself capable on bustling rap-first songs like ""On Em"" and ""Make It Back,"" where he packs some of his most ferocious bars together (""Can't stand the smell of that work, that's why my brothers cook it for me/ 30k a show don't call my phone, just book it for me."") He sounds good in </span>both traditional drill productions (courtesy of staples Chopsquad DJ and DJ L) and spacious songs with distorted vocal samples (like Christian Rock band BarlowGirl’s ""Never Alone"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The unsung hero behind many of the best cuts on <i>300 Days 300 Nights</i> is producer C-Sick. The Chicago beatmaker has done most of his notable work for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a>, but he and Durk have a palpable chemistry. On ""Gunz N’ Money,"" Durk bops through a punching track as the bottom drops out, exposing chillingly direct warnings: ""Word to <a href=""http://www.bet.com/news/music/2014/06/02/lil-durk-s-cousin-otf-nunu-shot-dead-in-chicago.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nuski</a> killer/ Word to <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/03/lil-durk-manager-shot-and-killed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chino</a> killer/ Word to <a href=""https://twitter.com/lildurk_/status/357287782890217474"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moski</a> killer/ We know we gon’ kill ya."" Durk raps about leaving the safety of his own home and venturing out into the streets on ""Jump Off,"" which winds layers of chords into a cocoon. The tone-setting intro, led by a monologue from his father, who has been locked up since Durk was an infant, is built around a pitched-up sample of Lori Perri’s ""Up Against the Wind,"" which seems like a fitting representation for the tumultuous environment that Durk comes from. <i>300 Days 300 Nights</i><i> c</i>ould’ve benefitted from some sort of executive producer cutting it down to its 13 strongest songs, but songs like ""Believe It or Not"" and ""Street Nigga"" are solid as far as filler goes. Few moments lack Durk’s captivating and crushing bellows or his blunt writing. This is the rapper Def Jam thought they were getting.</p></div>"|21386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21386-300-days-300-nights/|7.0|Sheldon Pearce

Sure, there's a perverse thrill in digging on something that few other people know about, but it can actually be painful to harbor a lifelong love for band that's been all but erased from history.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That might sound a tad dramatic to you, but it's a safe bet that it doesn't sound that way to Hank Shteamer, the producer and driving force behind this three-album box set. (Full disclosure: Shteamer is an occasional contributor to Pitchfork). As a 16-year-old, Shteamer's mind was so thoroughly blown by the Cleveland quintet craw that no other music has affected him in quite the same way since. He currently plays drums in STATS and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32022-aa/"">Aa</a>, serves as senior music editor at rollingstone.com, and continues to chart connections between metal and jazz via his interview blog, <a href=""http://www.heavymetalbebop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavy Metal Be-Bop</a>. With this box, listeners get an opportunity to re-trace Shteamer's steps through the band's first three albums. (craw's fourth and final LP, 2002's <i>Bodies for Strontium 90</i>, is still available via Hydra Head.) </p>
<p class=""p1"">If you've never heard craw's work, you'd have every reason to be skeptical about how it might hold up in a climate where even groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"">the Dillinger Escape Plan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31518-gorguts/"">Gorguts</a> have a hard time keeping up with the accelerated mutation they inspired in other bands with their classic output. Indeed, <i>Lost Nation Road</i>, craw's 1994 sophomore LP, includes a song, ""Bypass,"" that drifts uncomfortably close to the silt-coated riverbed that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"">Tool</a> illustrated so memorably on 1993's landmark <i>Undertow</i>. ""Bypass"" is immediately followed by ""Botulism, Cholera + Tarik,"" a chaotic saxophone orgy (courtesy of guest horn players Matt Dufresne and Marcus Rosinski) that recalls the expulsive spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2848-mr-bungle/"">Mr. Bungle</a> splattered with a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a> for good measure. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Other than those two moments, however, this set demonstrates over and over how craw found their way to their own musical island, and listening to these three albums for the first time today is like traveling to a remote, untouched location and discovering strange wildlife and fauna that have evolved in genetic isolation. If you were forced to categorize this music—or, more aptly, to describe it in terms that people will understand—craw carved out a space where post-hardcore, technical metal, math rock, and experimental noise all flow together under a hazy smog of something that <i>resembles</i> jazz, but isn't always clearly definable as such. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Craw specialized in shifting, nonlinear song structures where rhythms, riffs, harmonies, and atmospheres seep into one another—a stark contrast from the enduring metal/post-hardcore standard where bands flash their chops by stringing together part after part after part. Craw actually had more in common with <i>Pony Express Record</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3776-shudder-to-think/"">Shudder to Think</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4359-these-arms-are-snakes/"">These Arms Are Snakes</a> than they ever did with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/435-botch/"">Botch</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>, and an unhinged semblance of jazz permeates their material like a spectral presence. Of course, their music sounds more fitting of a psychiatric ward than the urbane lounges—or even the piss-stained lower-Manhattan sidewalks—that jazz was heavily associated with in the '90s. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As much as bands like Candiria and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4115-shining/"">Shining</a> deserve credit for transplanting horns into their respective takes on street-level hardcore and black metal, craw were clearly aiming for a creative dimension you can't arrive at by stylistic gene-splicing alone. Neil Chastain, who played drums on the first two albums, helped shape craw's warped sense of structure by applying concepts he'd discovered in the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Neubauten</a> and Edgard Varèse. Likewise, guitarist and self-described ""math and science geek"" Rockie Brockway used a numbers-based system to write riffs. But those things don't necessarily do justice to the sound that craw came up with. ""We were trying,"" Chastain recalls, ""to dig through your comfort layers and make you feel something."" The realization that this band was searching for something intangible lurks at every turn, but as you grow more familiar with craw's vocabulary, that ""something"" remains as vague and hard to pinpoint as it must have sounded to people's ears in the mid-'90s. And it is that mystery that ultimately pulls you in.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Shteamer recalls that at the six or seven craw shows he attended, there were fewer—""sometimes far fewer""—than 20 people in the room. Unsurprisingly, he brings a missionary's fervor to documenting the band's history via an accompanying 200-page book that comes stuffed with interviews (conducted by Shteamer himself), a complete catalog's worth of lyrics, and an abundance of photos, show flier and album artwork (much of it courtesy of famed cover artist Derek Hess), handwritten notes, a complete gigging history as best as everyone can remember it, and miscellaneous ephemera including a merch order invoice. According to Shteamer, even the most diehard experi-metal aficionados have never heard of craw, but this box presents as thorough an opportunity to play catch-up as one could ever hope to get for any artist, let alone a band that makes Barkmarket and Thought Industry look like household names by comparison.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span>The lyric sheets and voluminous interviews included in the book </span>give listeners plenty of perspective on frontman Joe McTighe's way with words, but suffice it to say that his images walk the fine line between demented and acutely aware—much in the same way schizophrenics can appear at once utterly detached from ""reality"" while speaking with intuitive precision about their surroundings. McTighe's reference to the car-bombing of real-life environmental activist Judi Bari is as captivating as it is uncomfortable to stomach—and just one of many examples that set his lyrics in a class by themselves. Likewise, even through his barking/gurgling/whispering style, McTighe's words are almost always intelligible. Some heavy bands—the majority of them, arguably—play heavy music to aggress, to go fists-up and balls-out into life. For others such as craw, heaviness represents a barrier behind which one retreats and stews in observation of the outside world.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Early on in their career, craw moved away from a riff-based approach and began writing as an ensemble. It shows, more or less, from note one of this set. Musicians in particular should find craw's approach to structure especially illuminating, even though, when taken as one entire chunk, it's sometimes difficult to tell one album apart from another. It doesn't help that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a>'s thoroughly unremarkable recording style fails to capture the raw immediacy of a band in the room while also forcing the band to shy away from using the studio as a means to create the atmosphere and ""album feel"" that its material rightfully called for. Luckily, though, there are times when the audio mix recalls the charming timbre of the cassette demos that were common during craw's years of activity. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In any case, long before you arrive at 1997's <i>Map, Monitor, Surge</i> it becomes obvious that craw didn't fit any of the commonly accepted storylines that media outlets like this one depend on and, essentially, manufacture. And unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1922-helmet/"">Helmet</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a>, craw didn't benefit from a media climate that embraced their exotic other-ness and allow them to exist in multiple camps simultaneously. Who knows what other factors played into craw's career trajectory, but looking back it's easy to imagine that this band was more or less destined for obscurity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the best sense of the term, craw's music is an <i>acquired</i> taste. Immediately on hitting play, one understands that this was not a band that got to the point quickly or shied away from making long, drawn-out albums. Sometimes, though, more does end up being more. And this box provides an appropriately exhaustive vehicle for taking the time it requires to sit with and digest a body of work that's still revealing itself to a lifelong fan like Hank Shteamer so long after the fact. Listening back, you have to wonder how many other trailblazing groups have existed that you'll never know about. But as you work your way through <i>1993-1997</i>, you do get the distinct impression that none of them sounded quite like this. </p></div>"|21330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21330-craw-1993-1997-box-set/|8.3|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Sure, there's a perverse thrill in digging on something that few other people know about, but it can actually be painful to harbor a lifelong love for band that's been all but erased from history.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That might sound a tad dramatic to you, but it's a safe bet that it doesn't sound that way to Hank Shteamer, the producer and driving force behind this three-album box set. (Full disclosure: Shteamer is an occasional contributor to Pitchfork). As a 16-year-old, Shteamer's mind was so thoroughly blown by the Cleveland quintet craw that no other music has affected him in quite the same way since. He currently plays drums in STATS and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32022-aa/"">Aa</a>, serves as senior music editor at rollingstone.com, and continues to chart connections between metal and jazz via his interview blog, <a href=""http://www.heavymetalbebop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavy Metal Be-Bop</a>. With this box, listeners get an opportunity to re-trace Shteamer's steps through the band's first three albums. (craw's fourth and final LP, 2002's <i>Bodies for Strontium 90</i>, is still available via Hydra Head.) </p>
<p class=""p1"">If you've never heard craw's work, you'd have every reason to be skeptical about how it might hold up in a climate where even groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/"">the Dillinger Escape Plan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31518-gorguts/"">Gorguts</a> have a hard time keeping up with the accelerated mutation they inspired in other bands with their classic output. Indeed, <i>Lost Nation Road</i>, craw's 1994 sophomore LP, includes a song, ""Bypass,"" that drifts uncomfortably close to the silt-coated riverbed that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"">Tool</a> illustrated so memorably on 1993's landmark <i>Undertow</i>. ""Bypass"" is immediately followed by ""Botulism, Cholera + Tarik,"" a chaotic saxophone orgy (courtesy of guest horn players Matt Dufresne and Marcus Rosinski) that recalls the expulsive spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2848-mr-bungle/"">Mr. Bungle</a> splattered with a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a> for good measure. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Other than those two moments, however, this set demonstrates over and over how craw found their way to their own musical island, and listening to these three albums for the first time today is like traveling to a remote, untouched location and discovering strange wildlife and fauna that have evolved in genetic isolation. If you were forced to categorize this music—or, more aptly, to describe it in terms that people will understand—craw carved out a space where post-hardcore, technical metal, math rock, and experimental noise all flow together under a hazy smog of something that <i>resembles</i> jazz, but isn't always clearly definable as such. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Craw specialized in shifting, nonlinear song structures where rhythms, riffs, harmonies, and atmospheres seep into one another—a stark contrast from the enduring metal/post-hardcore standard where bands flash their chops by stringing together part after part after part. Craw actually had more in common with <i>Pony Express Record</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3776-shudder-to-think/"">Shudder to Think</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4359-these-arms-are-snakes/"">These Arms Are Snakes</a> than they ever did with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/435-botch/"">Botch</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>, and an unhinged semblance of jazz permeates their material like a spectral presence. Of course, their music sounds more fitting of a psychiatric ward than the urbane lounges—or even the piss-stained lower-Manhattan sidewalks—that jazz was heavily associated with in the '90s. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As much as bands like Candiria and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4115-shining/"">Shining</a> deserve credit for transplanting horns into their respective takes on street-level hardcore and black metal, craw were clearly aiming for a creative dimension you can't arrive at by stylistic gene-splicing alone. Neil Chastain, who played drums on the first two albums, helped shape craw's warped sense of structure by applying concepts he'd discovered in the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Neubauten</a> and Edgard Varèse. Likewise, guitarist and self-described ""math and science geek"" Rockie Brockway used a numbers-based system to write riffs. But those things don't necessarily do justice to the sound that craw came up with. ""We were trying,"" Chastain recalls, ""to dig through your comfort layers and make you feel something."" The realization that this band was searching for something intangible lurks at every turn, but as you grow more familiar with craw's vocabulary, that ""something"" remains as vague and hard to pinpoint as it must have sounded to people's ears in the mid-'90s. And it is that mystery that ultimately pulls you in.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Shteamer recalls that at the six or seven craw shows he attended, there were fewer—""sometimes far fewer""—than 20 people in the room. Unsurprisingly, he brings a missionary's fervor to documenting the band's history via an accompanying 200-page book that comes stuffed with interviews (conducted by Shteamer himself), a complete catalog's worth of lyrics, and an abundance of photos, show flier and album artwork (much of it courtesy of famed cover artist Derek Hess), handwritten notes, a complete gigging history as best as everyone can remember it, and miscellaneous ephemera including a merch order invoice. According to Shteamer, even the most diehard experi-metal aficionados have never heard of craw, but this box presents as thorough an opportunity to play catch-up as one could ever hope to get for any artist, let alone a band that makes Barkmarket and Thought Industry look like household names by comparison.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span>The lyric sheets and voluminous interviews included in the book </span>give listeners plenty of perspective on frontman Joe McTighe's way with words, but suffice it to say that his images walk the fine line between demented and acutely aware—much in the same way schizophrenics can appear at once utterly detached from ""reality"" while speaking with intuitive precision about their surroundings. McTighe's reference to the car-bombing of real-life environmental activist Judi Bari is as captivating as it is uncomfortable to stomach—and just one of many examples that set his lyrics in a class by themselves. Likewise, even through his barking/gurgling/whispering style, McTighe's words are almost always intelligible. Some heavy bands—the majority of them, arguably—play heavy music to aggress, to go fists-up and balls-out into life. For others such as craw, heaviness represents a barrier behind which one retreats and stews in observation of the outside world.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Early on in their career, craw moved away from a riff-based approach and began writing as an ensemble. It shows, more or less, from note one of this set. Musicians in particular should find craw's approach to structure especially illuminating, even though, when taken as one entire chunk, it's sometimes difficult to tell one album apart from another. It doesn't help that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a>'s thoroughly unremarkable recording style fails to capture the raw immediacy of a band in the room while also forcing the band to shy away from using the studio as a means to create the atmosphere and ""album feel"" that its material rightfully called for. Luckily, though, there are times when the audio mix recalls the charming timbre of the cassette demos that were common during craw's years of activity. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In any case, long before you arrive at 1997's <i>Map, Monitor, Surge</i> it becomes obvious that craw didn't fit any of the commonly accepted storylines that media outlets like this one depend on and, essentially, manufacture. And unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1922-helmet/"">Helmet</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a>, craw didn't benefit from a media climate that embraced their exotic other-ness and allow them to exist in multiple camps simultaneously. Who knows what other factors played into craw's career trajectory, but looking back it's easy to imagine that this band was more or less destined for obscurity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the best sense of the term, craw's music is an <i>acquired</i> taste. Immediately on hitting play, one understands that this was not a band that got to the point quickly or shied away from making long, drawn-out albums. Sometimes, though, more does end up being more.

Perhaps it stems from his handling of the label’s archival overviews—of such unheralded electronic music producers ranging from Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir to the Burrell Brothers to Daniel Wang—but Young Marco has absorbed their sense of craft. It’s understated yet undeniable, and in a few short years he’s racked up a good deal of remix work.</p>
<p>Ten of these remixes are compiled as <i>Sorry for the Late Reply</i>, its title no doubt a nod to the hectic touring schedules of most in-demand DJs/ producers (when I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/electric-fling/9715-constant-vacation-inside-amsterdams-dance-scene/"">spoke to him last year</a>, Sterk had recorded in Bali, toured the West Coast with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"">Jamie xx</a>, and was about to do more club dates in Europe). No doubt some of these remixes were done on the fly, but each submission sounds as if Marco missed its deadline to finesse a small detail and make each track land just right.</p>
<p>The remix that kicks off the set is the one that’s traveled the furthest, Michael Ozone’s ""Hetrotopia,"" thanks to its inclusion on a Boomkat comp, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30976-ben-ufo/"">Ben UFO</a> mix, and on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"">John Talabot</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18749-john-talabot-dj-kicks/"">DJ-Kicks</a></i>. Marco takes the queasy, anxious arpeggio of the original and shoots it through with sunlight and a sense of ease. The beat sways between bubbling acid and a touch of hand drum, shot through with echoing jungle cries and a voice sneering: ""Freaks come out at night."" The cheap Casio underpinning Heatsick gets paired with a swinging drum and hi-hat figure on ""Dream Tennis,"" giving the stiffness of the original a bit more bend.</p>
<p>For most of the set, Young Marco prefers subtle builds, simmering drum programming, and playful recasts of his source material, with only a stomping track like Causa’s ""Alji"" serving as a peak-hour track. Otherwise, <i>Late Reply</i> will get the most work for building up sets or else easing things down at the end of the night (the shimmering downtempo take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31789-tony-g/"">Tony G</a>’s ""Simple Dreams"" is an album stand-out). If ""tropical house"" weren’t already a cringeworthy subgenre, I might try to use it to describe Marco’s ability to add lilting island rhythmic patterns to house’s grid.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s when he’s working with decidedly non-electronic material that Marco’s eclectic handiwork shines. Take two curious remixes, of mop-topped Dutchman troubadour <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30915-jacco-gardner/"">Jacco Gardner</a> and of Cameroonian musician/author Francis Bebey. Gardner’s wistful ""The End of August"" shades into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"">Kindness</a> territory in Marco’s hands. It gets a rhythmic nudge in the form of a wispy conga pattern and hissing drum machine, Gardner’s gentle voice garlanded by blips that swoop down like swallows. Marco doesn’t bear down too hard on the track, but keeps it light on its feet. For Bebey’s quaint and charming ""The Coffee Cola Song,"" Marco takes a brief pip of Francis Bebey’s nose flute and makes it into something as effervescent as the title suggests, the drums and pads underneath hiccupping about the track. The tracks throughout are sterling but don’t sound fussy, and for the range of artists represented, Marco’s sensibilities shine throughout, making for that rare remix album that actually hangs together as an end-to-end listen.</p></div>"|21404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21404-sorry-for-the-late-reply-various-remixes-for-various-reasons/|7.4|Andy Beta

He is popular music’s ultimate Lazarus: Just as that Biblical figure was beckoned by Jesus to emerge from his tomb after four days of nothingness, Bowie has put many of his selves to rest over the last half-century, only to rise again with a different guise. This is astounding to watch, but it's more treacherous to live through; following Lazarus’ return, priests plotted to kill him, fearing the power of his story. And imagine actually <i>being</i> such a miracle man—resurrection is a hard act to follow. </p>
<p>Bowie knows all this. He will always have to answer to his epochal work of the 1970s, the decade in which he dictated several strands of popular and experimental culture, when he made reinvention seem as easy as waking up in the morning. Rather than trying to outrun those years, as he did in the '80s and '90s, he is now mining them in a resolutely bizarre way that scoffs at greatest-hits tours, nostalgia, and brainless regurgitation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>His new off-Broadway musical is called </span><i>Lazarus</i><span>, and it turns Bowie’s penchant for avatars into an intriguing shell game: The disjointed production features actor Michael C. Hall doing his best impression of Bowie’s corrupted, drunk, and immortal alien from the 1976 art film </span><i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i><span>. Trapped in a set that mimics a Manhattan penthouse, Hall presses himself up to his high skyscraper windows as he sings a new Bowie song also called ""Lazarus."" ""This way or no way, you know, I’ll be free,"" he sings, smudging his hands against the glass. ""Just like that bluebird."" Bowie sings the same song on </span><i>Blackstar</i><span>, an album that has him clutching onto remnants from the past as exploratory jazz and the echos of various mad men soundtrack his freefall.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Following years of troubling silence, Bowie returned to the pop world with 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17855-david-bowie-the-next-day/""><i>The Next Day</i></a><i>.</i> The goodwill surrounding his return could not overcome the album’s overall sense of stasis, though. Conversely, on <i>Blackstar</i>, he embraces his status as a no-fucks icon, a 68-year-old with ""nothing left to lose,"" as he sings on ""Lazarus."" The album features a quartet of brand-new collaborators, led by the celebrated modern jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin, whose repertoire includes hard bop as well as skittering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> covers. Bowie’s longtime studio wingman Tony Visconti is back as co-producer, bringing along with him some continuity and a sense of history.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Because as much as <i>Blackstar</i> shakes up our idea of what a David Bowie record can sound like, its blend of jazz, codes, brutality, drama, and alienation is not without precedent in his work. Bowie’s first proper instrument was a saxophone, after all, and as a preteen he looked up to his older half-brother Terry Burns, who exposed him to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13109-eric-dolphy/"">Eric Dolphy</a>, and Beat Generation ideals. The links connecting Bowie, his brother, and jazz feel significant. Burns suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life; he once tried to kill himself by jumping out of a mental hospital window and eventually committed suicide by putting himself in front of a train in 1985.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps this helps explain why Bowie has often used jazz and his saxophone not for finger-snapping pep but rather to hint at mystery and unease. It’s there in his close collaborations with avant-jazz pianist Mike Garson, from 1973’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_x9fzY4WH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)</a>"" all the way to 2003’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yeZmGVsi_g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bring Me the Disco King</a>."" It’s in his wild squawks on 1993’s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avJt0SQec0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jump They Say</a>,"" an ode to Burns. But there is no greater example of the pathos that makes Bowie’s saxophone breathe than on ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevwLPV86os"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Subterraneans</a>"" from 1977’s <i>Low</i>, one of his most dour (and influential) outré moments. That song uncovered a mood of future nostalgia so lasting that it’s difficult to imagine the existence of an act like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> without it. Completing the circle, Boards of Canada were reportedly one of Bowie’s inspirations for <i>Blackstar</i>. At this point, it is all but impossible for Bowie to escape himself, but that doesn’t mean he won’t try.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thematically, <i>Blackstar</i> pushes on with the world-weary nihilism that has marked much of his work this century. ""It’s a head-spinning dichotomy of the lust for life against the finality of everything,"" he mused around the release of 2003’s <i>Reality</i>. ""It’s those two things raging against each other… that produces these moments that feel like real truth."" Those collisions come hard and strong throughout the album, unpredictable jazz solos and spirited vocals meeting timeless stories of blunt force and destruction. The rollicking ""'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore"" gets its name from a controversial 17th-century play in which a man has sex with his sister only to stab her in the heart in the middle of a kiss. Bowie’s twist involves some canny gender-bending (""she punched me like a dude""), a robbery, and World War I, but the gist is the same—humans will always resort to a language of savagery when necessary, no matter where or when. See also: ""Girl Loves Me,"" which has Bowie yelping in the slang originated by <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>’s ultraviolent droogs.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e2f10665-1878-21c1-fd2d-0aa4c3b01fca"">Though this mix of jazz, malice, and historical role-play is intoxicating, <i>Blackstar</i> becomes whole with its two-song denouement, which balances out the bruises and blood with a couple of salty tears. These are essentially classic David Bowie ballads, laments in which he lets his mask hang just enough for us to see the creases of skin behind it. ""Dollar Days"" is the confession of a restless soul who could not spend his golden years in a blissful British countryside even if he wanted to. ""I’m dying to push their backs against the grain and fool them all again and again,"" he sings, the words doubling as a mantra for <i>Blackstar</i> and much of Bowie’s career. Then, on ""I Can’t Give Everything Away,"" he once again sounds like a frustrated Lazarus, stymied by a returning pulse. This tortured immortality is no gimmick: Bowie will live on long after the man has died. For now, though, he’s making the most of his latest reawakening, adding to the myth while the myth is his to hold. </span></p></div>"|21332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/|8.5|Ryan Dombal

In 2012—Chief Keef’s breakout year—the particulars of the then-teenage, Chicago-reared rapper’s music was as much under scrutiny as his sudden, controversial rise. These days, only stories of career self-sabotage, and legal or financial missteps (most recently, his suspension from his record deal with hologram and online television entrepreneur Alki David’s multipurpose entertainment corporation FilmOn) make for major headlines. The unlikely regional and viral success of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgw7Yv8je-k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Faneto</a>""—a fiery, rhythmically deranged 2014 mixtape track—was comparatively little commented upon, despite around 60 million cumulative YouTube views, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhGM_sHSqv8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a lengthy paper trail </a>of virality, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3kQ24J6PWQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 10-minute remix </a>featuring the biggest names in his hometown’s hip-hop scene, and even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zforFEE4dU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">a Drake cover</span></a>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Admittedly, there's a top-heavy static-to-signal ratio on Keef’s mixtapes of the past two years. His default ritual—long days and nights in the studio with his in-house production team—results in plenty of appealing, distinctively styled rap songs, but filling his increasingly frequent projects out to between 15 and 20 tracks necessarily makes for redundancy. The Keef devotee must be prepared to rifle through his tapes, scouting for the buried handful of standalone hits. It’s to be expected, really: The over-saturation business model is the profitable and logical choice for a modern street rapper with a diehard fan base.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Releases like December’s <i>Nobody 2</i> evidence the downside of this approach. The tape is both on the more unruly end of the musical spectrum for Keef, and his most poorly curated project since 2013’s <i>Bang 2</i>. That’s not to say it's uninteresting. It is, at least, full of inimitable and decidedly bonkers beats from <a href=""http://kollegekidd.com/news/lil-durk-12-hunna-diss/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notoriously prickly</a> executive producer 12 Million (formerly 12Hunna), who also masterminded its predecessor—last December’s meditative, AutoTune-drenched <i>Nobody</i>—and is <a href=""https://twitter.com/12millionglo/status/678784090393468929"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">threatening</span></a> a third installment this month. On songs like ""Phone"" and ""Sex With Me,"" most elements of the drum loops lag queasily behind the tempo. ""Andale,"" even more extremely, plays out like some untested gear-operated machine lurching into motion and chugging unsteadily along, obscuring twinkling synth constellations in the background. One of 12 Million's hallmarks is his invasive snare patterns, in which wildly backfiring trails of delay become more important that the actual on-the-beat hits themselves. Keef’s terse phrasing holds everything together, demarcating time stylishly, if sometimes to little additional effect. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Keef songs like ""Mirror"" function like levels of early Nintendo games—not because of the actual bleep-bloop sonic likeness, but because of the mileage they get from the deceptively complex overlap of a handful of miniature, mechanistic moving parts. Keef’s vocal take sounds as assembled from tiny scraps as the beat itself, but packs in just enough in the way of conversational one-liners to lend the track cohesion (""I think you need a chair/ Waiting on me to fail/ You say you seen some money/ N*gga, tell me where/ Is it over there/ Or is it in here?"") ""Mirror"" is enough to make one go cross-eyed after focusing in too hard on any of its particular irregular elements, but falls together perfectly after pulling back and zoning out a bit.</p>
<p class=""p2"">But though 12 Million’s work on this tape is his most compelling to date, Keef, unfortunately, is less present than ever. On tracks like ""Sex With Me,"" he murmurs nearly inaudibly in the background for the better part of the song—more a sound effect than anything else. On the appropriately titled, delay-riddled ""In the Stu,"" it sounds like he’s set foot in the booth without even an embryonic idea or plan of attack. Sometimes, as on the distorted jeremiad of a pre-chorus on ""Tony Hawk,"" he's nearly incomprehensible.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Nobody 2</i> is a far cry from the more lyrically clever and emotionally charged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20281-sorry-4-the-weight/""><i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i></a>, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20925-bang-3/"">Bang 3</a>’</i>s diplomatic songwriting and sonic clarity. This is chilly, uninviting music, implicitly and explicitly about isolation. ""I feel like I need to separate myself from hip-hop, don’t let nobody come around me, don’t let nobody learn from me,"" Keef intones menacingly on the album’s central skit. A few years into his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhl0-hD9k3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still-influential</a> career, nobody quite sounds like Chief Keef in rap music. But if he doesn’t let anyone push him to complicate his now-time-tested vision, his songs may never expand back into being something more than fringe experiments, and even the interest those hold may, after a healthy amount of reiteration, wane for good.</span></p></div>"|21355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21355-nobody-2/|6.7|Winston Cook-Wilson

It was light. It was fun. It was a good song. At nine years old, she was the youngest-ever signee to Roc Nation: perhaps not an astonishing fact given who her parents are, but hitting the limelight before middle school can be tough on the psyche no matter how silver your spoon is. Therefore, it was a pleasantly surprising decision when, a few years later, Willow decided to bail on starring in a remake of <i>Annie</i>, canned all follow-ups to her burgeoning music career, and focused on growing up with whatever artistic integrity the world would allow her. Although still in the public eye, giving increasingly mature and existential interviews, and sporadically releasing music online, Willow has now released what amounts to her first official album, <i>Ardipithecus</i> (which is ""a genus of an extinct hominine that lived during Late Miocene and Early Pliocene in Afar Depression, Ethiopia,"" according to Wikipedia, FYI), and the fact that it is such a pointed departure from her earlier musical forays is a surprise to no one.</p>
<p>Nepotism and talent aren't mutually exclusive, but behind all the psychic awakenings and blossoming chakras, something about <i>Ardipithecus</i> remains unbaked. The potential is there, definitely—Willow's complete subversion of R&amp;B/pop tropes (shaved head, age-appropriate sexuality, asymmetrical fashion) is a breath of fresh air, and comes off as totally natural, not the posturing of someone pretending to be cooler than they are. Her vocals are untrained, but not gratingly so, coming off as throaty and confident even when she misses notes. The current alternative R&amp;B landscape is filled with artists who may not be the most powerful vocalists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>) but more than compensate with lyrical style and production skills. It's clear that this is what Willow aspires to; however, by focusing so heavily on her mystical lyrics and desire to express her worldview, the overall production value takes a backseat. Can the spiritual musings of a high school student, albeit one with above-average life experience, sustain themselves for an entire record? And furthermore, is Willow's persona enough to detract from her somewhat forgivable artistic shortcomings? Even after multiple listens to <i>Ardipithecus</i>, frankly, those questions persist.</p>
<p><i>Ardipithecus</i>' problems are even down to its track sequencing—by the time the album picks up at ""Stars,"" an uptempo, synth-lead collaboration with frequent musical partner JABS, you're already <i>twelve</i> songs in, many of which aren't complex or structured enough to hold much of your attention. ""Why Don't You Cry,"" the record's lead single, is also its closer, a puzzling decision which, again, seems much too little too late after a full listen. It's a shame, because many of the ideas within <i>Ardipithecus</i> are solid, just shoddily executed. Willow is able to flow from tribal chanting (the fast-paced and shuddering ""Natives of the Windy Forest,"" an early highlight) to more traditional R&amp;B leanings (""IDK,"" a song that proves that when her lyrics about mortality and spirituality are slightly subdued, the effect can actually be arresting), which is no small feat. But at the same time, Willow has written and produced the whole album pretty much by herself, and it shows. When she sings, on opener ""Organization &amp; Classification,"" ""I'm just a teenager/ But I feel angrier than a swarm of hornets,"" it's a painfully unnecessary statement, because literally no other type of person would follow it up with a song that's unironically called ""dRuGz,"" which includes the line ""I'm the heroin inside the syringe/ And I'm not going in/ I'm just the girl.""</p>
<p>But if you were Willow Smith, would you care? Her crown as Most Woke Millennial is secure, and her mission of completely abandoning her pop past has definitely been accomplished. In the same way that the leap between ages 10 and 15 is gigantic, so is the leap between 15 and 20, and in another five years, if not sooner, it's absolutely plausible that Willow could deliver the polished, brilliant record she is clearly capable of. It's just that, in between bursts of inspiration, <i>Ardipithecus</i> is largely a record of growing pains.</p></div>"|21370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21370-ardipithecus/|5.8|Cameron Cook

Rap fans, particularly those throughout the American south, know him as one of the genre's most distinct voices—literally, for his cartoon-villain-on-helium drawl, and more broadly for a writing perspective that marries grim reportage to an unshakeable, immutable sense of joy.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">In March of 2014, Boosie was released from that (barely) <a href=""http://mic.com/articles/88461/a-modern-day-slave-plantation-exists-and-it-s-thriving-in-the-heart-of-america#.rvB5HqAzq"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">repurposed plantation</a> in Louisiana after beating a drug smuggling case and first-degree murder charge. He seemed, finally, free—a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF6hs7TSYjA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">pair</span></a> of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o4Jv_OIPUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">freestyles</span></a> recorded on the ride home had him singing about seeing his kids and figuring out when he could squeeze in a haircut. He quickly went scorched-Earth with a series of guest features and loose singles that saw him very near, or perhaps at his creative peak. (A <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEygeG9XW_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">remake</span></a> of ""Lifestyle"" was so good it justified its existence.) </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">His return to retail shelves, last spring's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20670-touch-down-2-cause-hell/""><i>Touch Down 2 Cause Hell</i></a>, played like a blues record. There was the snarling intro, the grizzled wisdom on ""Mr. Miyagi,"" the unadulterated happiness of ""All I Know."" Save for a four-song stretch on the back half, the preceding mixtape <i>Life After Deathrow </i>was even better, and ranks alongside Boosie's best work. For an artist who had spent the ages that account for many rappers' creative primes behind bars, there were remarkably few cobwebs to shake out. It seemed, for 18 months, that Boosie had beaten every odd and would go down as one of the greatest feel-good stories of his era.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Until this Thanksgiving. That's when Boosie posted to his Instagram—then hastily deleted—a notice that he had been diagnosed with kidney cancer. A few weeks later, in mid-December, he reportedly underwent surgery to have half of one of his kidneys removed, and announced that it went well, and that he's now cancer-free. It was a relief to his legions of fans, but the very public process had been disorienting: how is one person so chronically, powerfully unfortunate?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That question is the catalyst for <i>In My Feelings (Goin' Thru It)</i>, Boosie's brief new album. As always, he has the ability to explore in-depth and with great precision the extent of his unhappiness, without ever sounding self-indulgent or as if he's wallowing. ""Cancer,"" the record's centerpiece, is plaintive even by his standards: ""Told my bitch, she cried/ Told my niggas, they cried/ Mama tried to downplay it to the family—she lied/ I'm thinking, 'Damn, how'd I get cancer?'"" There and at <i>Feelings</i>' other high points (""The Rain,"" the beautiful closer ""I Know They Gone Miss Me""), Boosie is who you wish you'd be in his situation, resolute and concerned with others before himself. It's like watching your most positive friend try to speak it into existence one last time.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And yet, while you'd be forgiven for being morbidly curious about 10 tracks of Boosie at his lowest, the album's construction is its Achilles heel. Not only are there no emotional highs like a ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkQy7o-u8KI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Top to the Bottom</a>"" or a ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWeLYvn8oPw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Finger Fucking</a>,"" but the prevailing mood here is weariness. That's probably an honest reflection of where Boosie's at in life, but it can make for a grim listen. Consider ""Call of Duty,"" where he raps about sending a duffel bag full of money to someone's house, then cross-reference his vocal take with how you imagine Boosie would rap about that situation at any other point in his life. It's easy to imagine him crushed under the weight of obligation, but there are a handful of would-be set pieces that end up feeling frustratingly anonymous.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Boosie is still Boosie, and through the din of doctors and ungrateful hangers-on, you can still hear the pen that will keep him in rotation at LSU for generations to come. The hook on ""Bad Guy"" alone is more carefully crafted than many songs that will hit Top 40 this year. But <i>In My Feelings </i>often feels as if its about to collapse under its own weight, which is doubly frustrating when you consider it clocks in at a slight 34 minutes. Still, it's hard to be too somber when you remember that Torrence Hatch is free, cancer-free, and isn't going anywhere. </span></p></div>"|21424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21424-in-my-feelings-going-thru-it/|6.9|Paul A.

Without <i>any</i> context, actually, beyond the basic information provided on the sticker that adorns the front of the set. Born in 1931, Mikael Tariverdiev became hugely popular in his home country of Russia. In addition to ballets, suites, concertos, and even operas, he scored more than 130 Russian films from the 1950s until his death in 1996, most of them directed by Mikhail Kalik. <i>Goodbye, Boys!</i>, from 1964, is arguably their most famous collaboration, but none of the films represented on <i>Film Music</i> are available in the United States at this time.</p>
<p>Gathering mostly instrumental excerpts and miniature suites on 3 LPs, <i>Film Music</i> is his first comprehensive release in the West, essentially introducing him to half the world, which makes it a major collection, albeit a puzzling one. Soundtracks are a curious musical format, by nature secondary to the visuals they’re meant to accompany; in execution the music ought to work subliminally, becoming part of the fabric of the film itself, not unlike set design, wardrobe, or blocking.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Listening to </span><i>Film Music</i><span> without having seen the films, in other words, can be an odd, unsettled experience. You have no idea what Tariverdiev might be reacting to, what he might be trying to achieve, how he might be using musical cues to complement visuals. Nor do you have any of his previous works to provide a clearer portrait of the composer. So we are left with music that is presented in a setting for which it perhaps was never intended. And yet, it is to Tariverdiev’s immense credit that the music sounds so evocative, so immediate, so </span><span>transporting</span><span> even without its visual anchor. Rather than forbidding, </span><i>Film Music</i><span> is immersive: a box set to get lost in.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>These excerpts sound simultaneously simple and complex, austere and lush, straightforward and elusive, adventurous and modest. Typically Tariverdiev spotlights only one or two instruments at a time, usually with minimal backing: A piano daydreams at a sidewalk café on ""Prelude for Ket,"" the spare percussion suggesting the clink of silverware and the chatter of passersby. A robust and red-faced saxophone bursts into ""The Last Romantic"" to deliver a pining solo that sounds like a eulogy. The tracklist has an easy, unforced range that covers humble piano suites, knockabout American jazz, pliant folk, rambunctious klezmer, erotic chanson. This is specific, even programmatic music, allowing you to infer character, setting, and even story.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tariverdiev’s eclecticism allows these songs to exist apart from the films that inspired them and to speak to Western audiences. In fact, <i>Film Music</i> gives you a strong, yet fleeting impression of Russian cinema during the latter half of the 20th century. You would imagine any film accompanying this music would balance whimsy and melancholy, humor and tragedy, naturalism and fantasy, hope regarding the future and nostalgia for the past. For Tariverdiev, the thing itself—whether a musical instrument, an artistic tradition, or a political idea—is much less important than how it interacts with other things. That may be the guiding theme of <i>Film Music</i>, which is all the more evocative for arriving with so much of its compelling mystery intact. </p></div>"|21385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21385-film-music/|8.0|Stephen M.

This is the first thing I asked myself listening to <i>Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven,</i> and it's not as snide a question as it sounds; it's genuinely hard to tell. While his diehard fans await his long-delayed <i>Man on the Moon III</i><i>,</i> Cudi opted instead to release <i>this—</i>a 90-minute, double-disc rock album, unfiltered and unpolished even compared to his 2012 side-project WZRD. Cudi is not a very good singer or guitarist, and his artlessly blunt lyrics are even more exposed in this context. So what are we to make of this? It's tough to guess the motives of someone who commissions Mike Judge to wedge painful ""Beavis and Butthead"" skits in between songs about self-harm with nihilistic lines like ""I’m feeling I’m a goner.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is something morbidly compelling about the tenacity of this project: ""Wedding Tux"" plods along for two-and-a-half minutes on two chords and has a hook that goes, ""everything, everyone sucks"" until it almost grows mesmerizing. ""Judgmental Cunt"" sounds an awful lot like self-laceration (""look at you, dumb stoner little boy"") with Cudi breaking his voice while screaming. On ""Trauma,"" he offers this: ""<span id=""docs-internal-guid-3b9bec37-1377-2f26-71a9-db16b346b8cf""><span>When I was eleven I saw my dad’s corpse."" </span></span>The discomfort level might be high enough to inspire rubbernecking from people who wouldn’t otherwise care about a new Cudi record.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven</i> is interesting the same way a friend getting a dramatic bad haircut is interesting: Once the shock wears off, you still have to look them in the eye and level with them. The album is a failure, and not even a noble one. Cudi insists on calling the album ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/KidCudi/status/672894911113334784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alternative</a>,"" and with the ""Beavis and Butthead"" narration, the shout-out to Cobain on ""Man in the Night,"" and a flat drawl that curls into awkward Layne Staley or Scott Weiland impersonations, it’s clear his approach to making a ""rock album"" is even more dated than <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>’s, grounded in ideas and sounds that are now two decades old.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are fleeting moments, here and there. On single ""Confused!,"" he manages one of the album’s more memorable lines, repeating ""hate the drugs but I love the numb."" When he hits on a nice guitar tone or melody or lyric, the songs are so simple that they assume a semi-meditative quality. The title track is the best song here, with a nostalgic breakbeat and Cudi softly singing about manic depression: ""If I crash, or when I land, no matter the case, I’m all smiles."" It’s a simple but effective tone poem. </span></p>

Since the young DJ and producer debuted in 2007 on fellow Detroiter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27648-omar-s/"">Omar S</a>'s <a href=""http://www.omarsdetroit.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FXHE</a> imprint, Hall has been viewed as the great hope for the next generation of Detroit dance music. Hall kept up his end of the bargain, fostering the potent <a href=""http://wildkyleoats.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wild Oats</a> label, throwing parties in the city and, crucially, not absconding to New York or London or Berlin. Kyle Hall is doing it all, and his 2013 debut album, <i>The </i><i>Boat Party</i>, sounded like it, anxiously flitting between a host of styles: electro, ghetto tech, filter disco, beat tracks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's against this backdrop of fervent activity that Hall's second album, <i>From Joy</i>, stands out so fully. A richly melodic exploration that expertly balances astral reverie with rhythmic heft, it's the kind of fully realized statement no one was really expecting Hall to make. Not because he didn't have the talent, but because, well, he seemed busy. A three-LP set featuring eight expansive tracks, <i>From Joy</i> is ambitious but warm and approachable. In its openness, imagination, and sense of history, <i>From Joy</i> feels like the child of Detroit's legendary <a href=""http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/11/detroit-radio-feature"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exploratory radio shows</a>. The concept is simple: jazzy pianos, walking basslines, and probing synth explorations welded to house music's 4/4 drum templates.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Jazz has always been valuable in house music—as source material and as a thematic link to another form of (largely black) outsider expression—but <i>From Joy</i> uses jazz a little differently than usual. Hall doesn't sample much here, instead borrowing from jazz its ensemble nature, the sense of unity achieved when the elements of a track lock together just so. Where most dance music feels sequenced, <i>From Joy</i> feels played. Where most machine music employs randomizations and swung notes to remind you of its human nature, <i>From Joy</i> just kind of flows.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hall is able to achieve this in part because <i>From Joy</i> sounds fantastic. You will pass entire tracks—five- and six-minutes long—zeroing in on the richness of one tone or another. For all of a synthesizer's endless possibilities, it's easy to remember that many of them were conceived with the more conservative purpose of emulating traditional instruments. And <i>From Joy</i> is conservative in this sense, dialing up exquisite, harmonically rich synth basslines—see opener ""Damn! I'm Feeln Real Close""—and sonorous leads. One of the album's least dance-y tracks, the contemplative ""Wake Up and Dip,"" is a showcase for a squelchy solo as expressive and felt as any old vanguard. Hall does all this without betraying his dance music bonafides, as side-long tracks such as ""Dervenen"" and ""Strut Garden"" offer DJs and dancers ample acreage. The latter track improbably lives up to its name, a whole lawn of little jukes and swaggers. Its bassline makes all the familiar moves, freeing you to make the unfamiliar ones.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>From Joy</i> effortlessly functions as both dance music and a home listening experience. Kyle Hall, an artist who has built his young career around doing it all, has made an album that does it all. <i>From Joy</i>, imbued with the past but not overly reverent of it, is Hall cashing in on the prodigious talent glimpsed in his prior work. It's tempting to hold it up as a capital-letter statement, a totem of his hometown. It's equally tempting, and probably healthier, to spin it back and delight in its abundance.</p></div>"|21377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21377-from-joy/|8.2|Andrew Gaerig

Cole</a> has made it abundantly clear that he wants to be judged alongside rap's all-time greats. So let's do that: <i>Revenge of the Dreamers II</i>, the new nine-song compilation from his Interscope imprint, Dreamville Records, is not <i>The</i> <i>Dynasty—</i>it doesn't have the color, the heart-wrenching personal asides, the 1-900 numbers that teach you how to sell crack. Nor does it have the slick condescension of any Bad Boy collaboration, the virtuosity of <i>Soundbombing</i>, the knowing sneer of anything the Diplomats made on their worst day. </p>
<p>The problem with <i>Revenge of the Dreamers II</i>, beyond the absence of a ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GwbWjIIzbA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Can't Be Life</a>"" or a ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCvxC8rofjs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dipset Anthem</a>,"" is the same as the problem with much of Cole's solo catalog: In his desperation to be canonized beside his idols, he shies away from the risks they took to earn those spots. His performance on a song-by-song basis from his debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15879-j-cole-cole-world-the-sideline-story/"">Cole World: The Sideline Story</a>, </i>to last December's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20054-2014-forest-hills-drive/"">2014 Forest Hills Drive</a> </i>oscillates wildly, but never shakes the feeling that it's checking boxes, doing X because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> did and Y because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">Pac</a> did.</p>
<p>Take the opener, ""Folgers Crystals,"" where Cole compares himself to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12401-bob-marley/"">Bob Marley</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nat Turner</a> in the first handful of bars. In many ways, his background is remarkable; the Fayetteville, N.C. native has detailed his experiences in schools with various socioeconomic makeups, including his time at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXVFNs0piP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. John's University</a> in New York. (As always, his rapping on <i>Revenge </i>owes more to the latter locale.) His plan to turn his childhood home—on Forest Hills Drive—into a shelter where single mothers can live rent-free is not just admirable, but is a sincere, inspired way to alleviate the conditions he grew up in and around. But in Cole's more serious writing, most of that personal touch is filtered out, replaced by blunt aphorisms: ""'Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him/ Raised in hell but heaven sent him/ Let 'em diss him.""</p>
<p>That kind of toothless penmanship might slide if it weren't delivered so deliberately. Cole's always been at his best when the stakes are low, or at least self-contained; when he's rapping for its own sake, or reveling in the fact that he signed his friends (""Night Job""), he can be a well above-average technician. (To be fair, that song is nearly derailed when he says he's ""Horny like that Coltrane album,"" one of a handful of sex-centric bars that he and his Queens-bred signee Bas inexplicably cling to.) But when he's moralizing or getting somber, it's robotic, as with ""Caged Bird""'s refrain, ""Freedom's just an illusion/ That's my conclusion."" On ""Crystals,"" he punctuates a particularly intense, clumsy passage with, ""So you can take my cock and chew on it,"" a line that needs a wink or some levity to redeem itself, but is given neither. </p>
<p>Fumbled legacy-building though it is, <i>Dreamers </i>is not without its bright spots. The tape introduces the label's two newest signees: the Washington, D.C.-bred singer Ari Lennox and lute, a rapper from Charlotte who joins Cole in representing North Carolina. Each artist contributes one song here, both of which are among the best on the tape; lute's <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>-cribbing ""Still Slummin"" in particular is superb, throwing you immediately into his world (""Took off my work badge, realized I'm back in the hood"") and dispensing plaintive, delightfully un-cinematic notes: ""Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet.""</p>
<p>Lennox's introduction comes in the form of ""Backseat,"" a song that racked up tens of thousands of plays between its October 2014 release and when it was scrubbed from the Internet last month. It's a knowing, slinking cut that succeeds on almost every front: fun, warm, a little sleazy. Cozz, the Los Angeles rapper who inked his Dreamville deal last year, updates the single with an uncharacteristically flat verse; fortunately, his later contributions to the tape, ""Tabs"" and especially the introspective closer ""Grow,"" are excellent. (His pre-Interscope singles ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Dg6qj8L3M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreams</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ljqfW1VLTY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Need That</a>"" remain two of the most delightfully menacing street rap songs of the past several years.)</p>
<p>Bas—whose braying ""Housewives"" is the weakest cut by a country mile—is joined in Dreamville's relative old guard by Omen, a Chicago native. He and Cole mostly sleepwalk through ""Caged Bird,"" but his headlining song, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32978-donnie-trumpet/"">Donnie Trumpet</a>-assisted ""48 Laws,"" is a welcome contrast; Omen finds the kind of pocket that always seems to elude his more famous partner, and it makes for a sleek, collected track that feels immediately more vibrant than any of the tape's weightier material. And that, in many respects, is <i>Revenge of the Dreamers II</i>: compelling when its focus is at its most narrow, leaden and impersonal when it reaches for the Very Serious and Very Important. It's like Bleek said: ""The strong move quiet, the weak start riots/ We know you got a brick but sell 'em 20s 'til they tired.""</p></div>"|21416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21416-dreamville-ii-revenge-of-the-dreamers/|6.2|Paul A.

Beyond the abstract idea of remembrance lie some hard truths about our own limitations: our memories are imperfect and constructed and they degrade over time much as we do ourselves. Odd Nosdam’s <i>T r i s h</i> EP is an act of remembrance that wrestles with these limitations. Its six largely instrumental songs bear the tenor of memories: at once warmly familiar and hazily indistinct.</p>
<p>Nosdam recorded the <i>T r i s h</i> EP in memory of the late Trish Keenan of English noise-pop act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>. Originally released as a limited-run cassette on the Baro label in 2013, the out-of-print EP is now seeing wider release on vinyl. While Nosdam is known best as a producer of cerebral hip-hop beats, the songs on <i>T r i s h</i> are comparatively formless, often eschewing low-end and percussion altogether. This is Nosdam at his most abstract and untethered, dispensing with any notion of genre to explore the evocative qualities of sound. Working with tape loops, samples, and layers of distortion, he constructs churning songs whose melodies lie buried under blankets of static. While Nosdam is certainly no stranger to noise in his work, these tracks often push into Broadcast territory, sounding like transmissions from a radio station that’s just out of range.</p>
<p>Nosdam’s primary focus here is texture; he spends much of <i>T r i s h</i> smearing recognizable shapes into more impressionistic forms. Take the chiming opening melody of ""O l y n n,"" which feels like it was ripped straight out of a Broadcast song. Around the two-minute mark, the track cuts to silence before that same melody returns, pitched up, massively delayed and barely recognizable. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>’s Liz Harris contributes a vocal to the song—a haunting, wordless wail—but even that ultimately gets swallowed up by a cloud of echo as well. Nosdam approaches samples with a similarly warped sensibility on <i>T r i s h</i>; ""L o n j a e"" sounds like a yé-yé 45 left skipping on a turntable until it transforms from a song to a drone.</p>
<p>Broadcast’s greatest trick might have been sculpting pop songs out of noise and Nosdam manages to perform a similar alchemy on the closing track, ""T r i s h."" Here, the producer gives himself over fully to Broadcast’s school of songcraft, employing the sort of fuzzy organ and heavily distorted bass that became hallmarks of that band’s sound. Even more striking, though, is the vocal that floats through the middle of the track. It's a sample from a late-'60s Norwegian folk record but the singer, Annlaug Lofthus, is a dead ringer for Keenan. For a brief moment, amid swells of noise, we catch a glimpse of Trish Keenan through the haze. And then, just like that, she’s gone.</p>
<p><b>Correction (1/6, 3:50 p.m. EST):</b> An earlier version of this review incorrectly identified the singer on ""T r i s h"" as Trish Keenan. It is Annlaug Lofthus, as now stated.</p></div>"|21368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21368-t-r-i-s-h-ep/|6.8|Mehan Jayasuriya

In recent years, he’s been consistently active on the contemporary jazz circuit—lending his talents to a series of celebrated albums by artists such as guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12609-mary-halvorson/"">Mary Halvorson</a> and saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/337-tim-berne/"">Tim Berne</a>. The music of both those composers occasionally strays close to avant-rock, which helps explain Smith’s in-demand status around jazz’s cutting-edge galleries. But he also led those bands through quieter, softer passages, proving his depth and range.</p>
<p>For his first album as a composer and bandleader on Germany’s iconic ECM label, Smith has chosen a subtlety that seems influenced by his most recent bandmates and peers. It’s a stylistic course that will be broadly familiar to fans of Manfred Eicher’s jazz-and-classical imprint, and less so to fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11091-women-as-lovers/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Women as Lovers</i></a>. But <i>The Bell</i> isn't placid, either: In the company of pianist Craig Taborn and violist Mat Maneri—an experienced pair of collaborators—Smith forges a quiet intensity. There’s heat here, even if it takes some time to feel it.</p>
<p>Things begin calmly. The album’s title-track opener announces itself with a lone, delicate smack of pitched percussion, before the other players enter. Though the nine-minute piece never strays very far from a static and spacious feel, there’s often something new happening: Smith moves from the bell-like elements in his kit to some vibraphone shimmers, or thrumming timpani playing. Maneri moves from a low drone on his viola to high-pitch wisps of brief, almost-scratchy timbre. Collectively, the group’s sound is constantly tempting you into a false sense of ease that individual players delight in subverting with little tics—adding extra notes to minimalist phrases before they become too predictable.</p>
<p>While all <i>The Bell</i>’s tracks were composed by Smith, the group’s <a href=""http://www.chessmith.com/projects.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">status</a> as ""an improvising trio"" is clear during ""Barely Intervallic,"" a cut where Smith indulges skittering, freer playing. ""I’ll See You on the Dark Side of the Earth"" and ""I Think"" follow the big-canvas, pensive-but-driven feeling of ""Isn’t It Over?""<span> In the album's final third, ""</span>Wacken Open Air"" gives up its theme right away, the better to let us hear the group work the spare material into a potent acoustic riff. Maneri deals in some lyrical soloing toward the end of ""It’s Always Winter Somewhere."" And the finale, ""For Days,"" re-establishes the set’s quiet equilibrium.</p>
<p>The largely hypnotic, not-quite-repetitive quality of the music will, for some listeners, call to mind Taborn’s own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8257-junk-magic/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Junk Magic</i></a>, an early-21st century triumph of electrified chamber jazz (and an album that also featured Maneri). But <i>The Bell</i> isn’t just some<span> less kinetic, acoustic redo of</span> that project, with Smith holding down the percussion chair. Despite the album’s restricted range, it suggests a malleable aesthetic, likely the result of the year and a half these improvisers put in together before recording their debut outing. You can imagine this band doing a wide variety of impressive work, in the very near future: perhaps adding in some electronics, or including compositions from all members. But for now, it’s persuasive enough as a demonstration of Smith’s continued career shift into contemporary jazz.</p></div>"|21350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21350-the-bell/|7.6|Seth Colter Walls

And he's one of the few film composers whose work has had a significant impact on rock music (perhaps only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a> can claim more). In fact, the work that first brought him fame—his iconic soundtracks for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Leone</a>'s mid-1960s Spaghetti Westerns—might have had more influence on rock musicians than film composers. Whenever I hear dramatic rock using echoey twang and dusty atmospheres—examples include <a href=""https://youtu.be/p8Z0Ayy1RdU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Labradford</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4211-thinking-fellers-union-local-282/"">Thinking Fellers Union Local 282</a> (who <a href=""https://youtu.be/y8OzwcI9_Y8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered </a>Morricone's music for Leone), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>—I immediately think of scenes from <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.</a></i></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of which makes Morricone's decision to score </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60342-ennio-morricone-to-score-quentin-tarantinos-the-hateful-eight/""><span>Quentin Tarantino</span></a><span>'s </span><span><i>The Hateful Eight</i> </span><span>immediately interesting, since it's the first Western-themed film he has worked on in over 30 years. Doubling the intrigue is the fact that some of the music is a cross-pollination of Morricone and Carpenter's visions. Due to time constraints, Morricone </span><a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/12/ennio-morricones-unused-score-for-the-thing-ended-up-in-the-hateful-eight/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>re-used pieces</span></a><span> he wrote for the latter's 1982 thriller </span><i>The Thing</i><span> which Carpenter ultimately didn't include. Then there are the facts that Tarantino has never made a fully-scored film before—he's only used previously-recorded music—and that Morricone once </span><a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/italian-composer-morricone-slams-tarantino-428954"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>said</span></a><span> he ""wouldn't like to work with [Tarantino] again, on anything"" (a statement he later partially </span><span><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ennio-morricone-clarifies-remarks-about-quentin-tarantino-20130319"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rescinded</a>.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So there's a lot of promise in </span><span><i>The Hateful Eight</i> </span><span>soundtrack, and the final result delivers—though not necessarily due to the factors above. Morricone's return to the Western genre ends up somewhat coincidental; this music is more in line with his later, traditionally-filmic orchestral work, and there's nary a guitar twang to be heard. The score's relation to Carpenter (whose own music has undergone a</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20091-john-carpenter-lost-themes/""><span> recent </span></a><span>underground revival) is more evident. Morricone's themes have the kind of primal tension that Carpenter used so well in his other movies, but in this case transposed from synth to orchestra.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ultimately, Morricone's music for <i>The Hateful Eight</i> is rich and evocative regardless of the circumstances of its creation. You might guess that after this long, he'd have to make increasingly complex pieces to find new things to say. Yet the opposite is true: his melodies are still simple, relying on a few notes to form a backbone from which he never strays far. His arrangements and flourishes build momentum, but the core is always powerfully uncluttered. Morricone trusts that a few strong musical ideas can supply lots of atmosphere and emotion throughout an epic-length film.</p>
<p><i>The Hateful Eight</i> isn't all Morricone, though. Tarantino can't resist DJ-ing a little bit, sprinkling in a short <a href=""https://youtu.be/vWYoTebs1wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gem</a> from the second <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">White Stripes </a>album, an excellent mid-'60s Roy Orbison <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Roy-Orbison-There-Wont-Be-Many-Coming-Home/release/1746139"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">single</a>, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hess"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Hess</a> track from the 1972 Wes Craven movie <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068833/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Last House on the Left</a></i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068833/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>, and a fascinatingly-unpolished version of the Australian folk song ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones_at_Botany_Bay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Jones at Botany Bay</a>"" as sung by Jennifer Jason Leigh in the film itself. There are also snippets of movie dialogue interspersed throughout, which are entertaining but too short to be very meaningful (they also include what has to be the most uses of the n-word on any Morricone album).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All those Tarantino additions add texture to </span><i>The Hateful Eight </i><span>soundtrack, but Morricone's music by itself is more than enough. There's a wealth of both visceral adventure and reflective emotion in hs pieces. At best, these songs are thrill rides, mood swingers, and thought provokers, all at once. That makes them a perfect fit for a Tarantino movie—but then, as he's proven for over half a century, Morricone is the right choice for any filmmaker.</span></p></div>"|21369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21369-the-hateful-eight-ost/|8.0|Marc Masters

They began as a duo called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32616-deers/"">Deers</a> after Carlotta Cosials and Ana Perrote met back in 2011. Inspired by bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">the Black Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a>, the pair wrote woozy pop tracks about love, partying, and the complicated problems that occur when mixing the two. After releasing their first single, 2014's <a href=""https://hinds.bandcamp.com/album/demo-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>DEMO</i></a>, Hinds completed their lineup with Ade Martin on bass and Amber Grimbergen on drums, and soon after were forced to change their name due to legal issues (Hinds means a female deer). Hinds may be aware that their casual origin story and goofy demeanor (catch them <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHVboNNkAo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>cracking beers</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=488tfIa66v4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>dancing on tables</span></a> in their videos) may cause some to think they are not a serious project, so the foursome chose to challenge themselves on their debut LP <i>Leave Me Alone</i>, and the decision pays off.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Hinds have described the 12 tracks on </span><i>Leave Me Alone</i><span> as the various ""faces of love"" they experienced while writing their debut, and therefore is more emotionally varied than their previously lighthearted singles. While the title indicates detachment, a majority of the songs suggest the opposite, pleading quite literally on ""Fat Calmed Kiddos"" ""please don't leave me.""</span><i> Leave Me Alone</i><span> is a record of human contradictions, of the admissions of vulnerability, and the realization that these things are beautiful. It's no coincidence that the phrase ""You're on my mind"" appears on several songs; for better or worse, Hinds realize that there are some feelings that cannot be escaped.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Leave Me Alone</i><span>'s singles focus on their purely poppy side, from the smooth opener ""Garden"" to the glorious jangle of ""San Diego"" to the </span><span>wailing </span><span>harmonies of ""Bamboo."" The previously released ""Castigadas En El Granero,"" which translates to ""punished in the barn,"" is perhaps the most frenzied track on the album, which is only amplified by rapid-fire, somewhat absurd observations like ""All I see is a big cow/ And now I'm eating all your corn."" Another particular standout is ""Fat Calmed Kiddos,"" a sunny whirlpool of a song with a particularly poignant chorus: ""And I needed to risk 'cause I needed to try/ And I needed a breath 'cause you were out tonight.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>These tracks show off what truly sets Hinds apart: Cosials and Perrote's shared vocal responsibilities, which fit together perfectly. Cosials' voice switches between a silky drawl and a Joplin-like howl while Perrote's is grounding and steady. When one is singing, the other often emphasizes or counters, the Ego and Id so to speak. The best moments on</span><i> Leave Me Alone</i><span> occur when Cosials and Perrote are going all-out, belting together without restraint.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-c09cdef9-0dc0-c6a6-65e3-b01588830ddd""><span> But even on the ""slower"" songs (there isn't really a lull on </span><i>Leave Me Alone</i><span>, except for the midway instrumental interlude ""Solar Gap"") the possibility exists for the energy to be cranked up all the way. After a few final mellow jams like the spacey ""And I Will Send Your Flowers Back"" and ""I'll Be Your Man"", Hinds conclude with ""Walking Home"", a fuzzy and almost-tropical declaration of love. The song embraces silly metaphors like ""You're the map to my toe"" and ""You're the rice of my bowl"" before softly fading out with the words, ""You're the love of my life."" </span><span>""Walking Home"" is a lovely reminder of two important facts: that love does not need to be complicated and that Hinds are not afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves.</span></span></p>

In essence, he's a rapper in an R&amp;B singer's body, more likely to sing about his harrowed past and the things he's done to keep food on the table for his family than some romantic tryst. Even ""Would You Know?,"" the lone love song on the New Orleans native's latest album, <i>This Thing Called Life</i>, is a conflicted ballad on which Alsina is a ball of nerves, afraid that opening up to the possibility of love would leave him vulnerable. But Alsina applies the tender, ruminative aspects of R&amp;B—and its sense of longing, especially—to his street tales, and his second studio album solidifies his place amongst the upper echelon of modern-day R&amp;B.</p>
<p>Like many of his contemporaries, Alsina shares the same interest as <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih</a> and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"" target=""_blank"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a>—even <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a>—in exploring the percussive elements of rapping and the myriad of ways they can be married to melody. On sepia-toned lead single ""Hip-Hop,"" he effortlessly slips back and forth between sweet rhythmic singing and melody-oriented rapping as he describes the environment he grew up in and how he ""came up in criminal ways."" The chorus of ""Dreamer"" finds Alsina employing a triplet cadence à la <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"" target=""_blank"">Migos</a>, a clever flip of the rap-song-with-a-sung-chorus template. Alsina's line-blurring between rapping and singing is never quite as experimental as someone like Jeremih or Young Thug, but it feels completely natural.</p>
<p>Alsina's music also gestures towards his gospel roots. A singer in his church's choir as a child, he hangs hard onto the idea that salvation can be found through perseverance and a strong sense of belief, whether in a higher power or simply your own ability to get through the day. Persistence is Alsina's default mode of engaging with the world—when he's boasts about ""buying the same thing three times"" on ""Why I Do It,"" a horn-laden banger featuring an engaged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>, Alsina sounds prouder of the work he put in to get to where he is than the spoils of that work.</p>
<p><i>This Thing Called Life</i> also corrects one the most egregious flaws of <i>Testimony</i>, Alsina's 2014 debut: its guests actually make thematic sense. There are only four: in addition to Weezy, Anthony Hamilton, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss/"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a>, and Chris Brown all make appearances. With the exception of Brown, who doesn't subtract anything from the slick radio-ready earworm ""Been Around the World"" but adds nothing, the guests feel like kindred spirits rather than label-mandated concessions, artists for whom the experiences of a hard-luck upbringing are never far from the center of the frame.</p>
<p>The album loses a bit of steam toward the end, when another love song or two would actually be a welcome change of pace, but it perks back up in time for closer ""The Encore."" A joyously triumphant paean to perseverance, the track captures Alsina's wide-eyed and generous approach to songwriting: ""Always thought that it would be good, but I never had it <i>this</i> good."" It's hard not to root for someone whose music is suffused, at the DNA level, with such appreciation. He's grateful for his good fortunes even as he can't help but be surprised by them. </p></div>"|21341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21341-this-thing-called-life/|7.4|Renato Pagnani

For most people with Internet access, recalling one's initiation into the era of video streaming is like remembering the first picture they ever saw, or the first song they heard—it's damn near impossible. Daniel, on the other hand, remembers the moment he clicked the play button, saw an Iraqi sandstorm, and set off down the path into one of the biggest repositories of human experience ever constructed. At the end of 2015, he put that self-awareness to the test by dropping <i>Why Pay More?</i>, a musical case study of YouTube and the ways it amuses, alarms, alienates, and unites the modern mind. Half abstract collage, half dance album, and altogether weird, it's a fitting tribute to the website a decade after its rise to popularity.</p>
<p>Rather than look to globally recognized memes to illustrate YouTube's power and ubiquity, Daniel calls on the mostly forgotten fragments floating out there in the algorithmic abyss, waiting to be stumbled upon by accident or odd search (in other words, no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k85mRPqvMbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crazy Frog</a> here). His samples come from the clips on the nth page for the search result ""party,"" the 10 videos viewed a collective 10 times, the zeroes and ones that never mattered—until now. Sonic traits most listeners would consider detrimental—poor sound quality, background noise—form the basis of the record's texture. Within the tightly wound confines of ""Acappella,"" for example, an amateur soul performance that sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom finds new life as an echoey sample in a house track. Various explosions, screeching tires, and sarcastic anti-drug monologues find their way into the ragtag mix as well, colliding and collapsing until the junk gets vulcanized into a speedy machine. </p>
<p>Queerness is intrinsic to the Soft Pink Truth: 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19454-the-soft-pink-truth-why-do-the-heathen-rage/"" target=""_blank""><i>Why Do the Heathen Rage</i>?</a> sought to expose and deconstruct the homophobic attitudes lurking beneath the surface of black metal fandom, and Daniel's introduction to the project, 2003's <i>Do You Party</i>, drew upon the sounds and experiences of his time as a go-go dancer at Bay Area gay bars earlier in his life. As a musical case study of YouTube—one of the century's near-universal mediums—<i>Why Pay More? </i>requires a broader lens to illustrate the amorphous, anonymous nature of the website. But there are many tracks on the record—""I Love Your Ass,"" "" Fire Island of the Mind,"" the title track—that bring the queer-as-fuck energy of Daniel's earlier material. ""Are You Looking?"" assembles results for the terms ""Looking"" and ""Step"" into a brittle-sounding dancefloor turn, solidified by a sample from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"" target=""_blank"">Madonna</a>'s ""Vogue,"" a song inspired by (and arguably pilfered from) gay culture; aside from that, the former keyword links a classic term for soliciting gay sex to the act of trolling YouTube, suggesting that <i>something</i> each of us does is queer—that by extension, we all are. It's a sneaky statement that functions simultaneously as a compelling thesis as well as a clap-back to homophobic trolls.</p>
<p>Then there's the title track, which was conceived as a contest/concert at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5258-dan-deacon/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Deacon</a>'s Whartscape festival where guests had to guess the track's BPM. Daniel doesn't make that task easy, burying the beat beneath harsh, tinny game show music, warped house synths, and, most unsettlingly of all, a voice-altered clip of what appears to be a demonic android ordering off the Taco Bell value menu. Isolated from its traditional performative context, ""Why Pay More?"" scans more overwhelming than engaging, putting it in step with the blaring, boorish ""Awesome"" (hope you like bagpipes) and the cartoonish ""Party Pills."" Nevertheless, such compositions realize the album's mission of sensory overload—that inevitable, mind-numbing state that we all acquiesced to (however subconsciously) when we clicked on that play button for the first time.</p></div>"|21348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21348-why-pay-more/|7.0|Zoe Camp

They are deeply entrenched in the underground: The album is out on <a href=""http://ironlungrecords.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron Lung</a>, the quietly reigning West Coast punk and hardcore label operated by a band of the same name; Iron Lung's drummer, Jensen Ward, accompanies members of Gag in White Wards. And Gag's clutch of tapes and EPs, which date back to 2012, demonstrate a rigorously fundamental understanding of hardcore: forbidding thickets of guitar feedback; dour, mid-tempo riffs evocative of dogged trudging and furrowed brows; and rhythmic motifs limited to lumbering backbeat and pugilistic punctuation.</p>
<p>That makes Gag at once highly traditional—wavering little from formal touchstones like, say, Poison Idea's original ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_UWOj1-ys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pure Hate</a>""—and at odds with hardcore's prevailing inclinations today. There's none of the studied staccato blitzkrieg of Punch, no d-beat homage à la Ajax or Gas Rag. Rather, <i>America's Greatest Hits</i> is a sturdy and relatively unhurried exercise in stylized hostility: ""Steel Forced Twin"" is a strident salvo of floor-tom thud, while ""Pretty Boy"" is all showy strut and bratty leads. Trenchant and thuggish without relief, <i>America's Greatest Hits </i>is predictable but never rote; if contemporary hardcore is less in conversation with originators and more indentured to them, Gag threatens to depose its masters.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ghoulish jester adorning the cover of last year's <i>Locker Room </i>EP looks something like Gag's spiritual advisor. And <i>America's Greatest Hits, </i>like Gag's catalog at large, is distinguished by its humor. Historically, hardcore has prized clarity—rejecting irony and sarcasm in favor of a more imperative and sincere tone—whereas punk is more likely to traffic in farce and black humor. Gag, however, forces an impressive amount of sardonic punch lines, guttersnipe mockery, and macabre wit into its otherwise purist hardcore. In the squelched, scabrous vocals, quizzical references to shrimp, sunglasses, and Wal-Mart abound. ""It's Just Me"" begins, ""There's no justice/ There's no justice—just me<i>,</i>""<i> </i>which<i> </i>illustrates how skillfully Gag uses the few syllables allotted each line: there's a simplistic pun, a cynical assertion, and even something of a political statement.</p>
<p>All throughout <i>America's Greatest Hits</i>, Gag fulfills the music's nearly monosyllabic requirement with a rare capacity for invention and play. But they aren't simply clever. They mix mastery and transgression. Perhaps Gag explains its perspective best: Consider one of its finest little maxims, from the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUAmVhvx7KM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>40 Oz. Rule '90</i></a> EP: ""Ha ha ha/ Blah blah blah/ Either way you die.""<i> </i>Like the very most resonant sentiments in hardcore, it's inarguable and essential. And <i>America's Greatest Hits </i>affirms that Gag guffaws in the face of death. </p></div>"|21338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21338-americas-greatest-hits/|7.7|Sam Lefebvre

He's a twenty-year veteran with access to the swankiest production but very little of the nagging pressure to surf mainstream trends that runs his peers ragged. He wrestled the major label rap machine and won, and his scathing sneer has menaced a decade of hip-hop top dogs, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>. He's the rare instance of a rap talent sharpening over time; few who made their first recordings in the late '90s, as he did as one half of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"">Clipse</a>, can be argued to possess a firmer grasp on their voice today than in their youth. Since jumping to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>'s G.O.O.D. Music after the Clipse began a now-permanent hiatus, Pusha T has zeroed in on a mercenary style both weathered and totally disrespectful; he's seen whole labels, crews, and organizations dissolve, and he's happy to tell you how yours will come apart on you if you're not careful.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A popular rapper with a disdain for the machinery of hip-hop fame is a dangerous assassin, and Pusha spends a good piece of his sophomore studio album <i>Ki</i><i>ng Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude</i> pulling back the curtain on rap stardom to reveal it for smoke and mirrors. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17870-pusha-t-mftr-ft-the-dream/"">""M.F.T.R.""</a> razzes rappers who'd ""rather be more famous than rich,"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17877-pusha-t-crutches-crosses-caskets/"">""Crutches, Crosses, Caskets""</a> shames a platinum rapper whose ""momma lives in squalor,"" before smirking that Push's own mother is ""in the Bahamas for the month/ She probably sittin' in her pajamas, having lunch."" In a year where a multi-platform media mogul like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"">50 Cent</a> declared bankruptcy, and Drake and Lil Wayne grumble publicly about Cash Money not paying up, Push's dart in the Biggie-sampling lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17820-pusha-t-untouchable/"">""Untouchable""</a> about which companies' checks don't bounce is sound business advice as savage quip (or vice versa).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Darkest Before Dawn</i> </span><span>isn't all trash talk; Pusha still takes inspiration from his dealer days, both good and bad. Some of the more revealing corners of the record delve into how he coped when things went sour. ""The crash don't kill, it's how you survives it,"" he raps on ""Keep Dealing."" Early on in ""F.I.F.A."" he snaps ""I'm my city's Willy Falcon/ How you niggas celebrating Alpo?"" in reference to the Floridian coke trafficker who once beat charges of pushing nearly 80 tons of white by bribing the jury and the Harlem shooter Alpo Martinez, subject of the movie </span><i>Paid in Full</i><span>. Pusha's second act, both after his group folded and after the Clipse's former manager pled guilty to charges alleging he was a drug kingpin, is a rebirth few inside rap or out have enjoyed. Irv Gotti was never the same after the Feds ran into the Inc offices, and try as he might, </span><span>Family Hustle </span><span>Tip will never be </span><i>King</i><span> again.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Imagine Tony Montana slipping out of the country scot-free ahead of his career-ending </span><span>Scarface </span><span>raid, and you arrive at the cocktail of spite and incredulity fueling </span><i>Darkest Before Dawn</i><span>. The swing from moneyed gall to grizzled paranoia is a well-trodden path in hip-hop and elsewhere, but the eye for detail in the writing and the claustrophobic, foreboding sonics set it apart from other rote goon rap fare. That these 10 songs hang together is testament to the writer's bleak vision, since they're technically flotsam from the forthcoming </span><i>King Push </i><span>(hence the protracted </span><i>The Prelude </i><span>subtitle). Perhaps the prevailing feeling he's not trying to impress us comes from the records he really intends to impact radio being saved for a different project. Whatever the case, Pusha dragged a crack team of rap maestros well outside their respective comfort zones for the occasion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The production on <i>Darkest Before Dawn </i>is uncompromising headphone boom bap from people who don't really make it anymore. The curt ""Intro"" is a Metro Boomin beat uncharacteristically light on hellacious synths and heavy on cavernous, tribal stomp. For ""Untouchable,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> leaves his trademark bells and whistles behind for a skeletal array of dizzyingly tricky bass and snare hits. ""M.P.A."" is the most unfussed Kanye West production since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12266-otis/"">""Otis.""</a> ""F.I.F.A."" gets a sputtering Rick Rubin style breakbeat from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a>. Rap producers are dying to make and sell weird shit like this, but thirst for easily recognizable signature sounds pigeonholes rapper and beatsmith alike. Pusha T getting his collaborators to set aside their pet sounds is the mark of fearless showmen and inimitable chemistry.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-62b2ff81-083f-ef45-881d-493598183879""><span>To that end, </span><i>Darkest Before Dawn </i><span>is best explained as an exercise in pure craft for everyone involved, the kind of record being scared out of existence because chickenshit execs won't fund what they can't see topping the charts. The beats sound like money, and the raps are whip smart and cleanly tailored. Like Pusha's career post-Clipse, it's godly providence everything has gone as swimmingly as it has here. The resourceful hustler always finds his way.</span></span></p></div>"|21337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21337-darkest-before-dawn/|8.2|Craig Jenkins

Its sample soup might have put you in mind of tracks by DJs like Coldcut, but more laid back, and with the magpie wit replaced by studied cool.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The vibe of ""Loaded"" was unusual enough. The identity of its makers was what really startled. Primal Scream had already jumped from sweet-toothed jangle-pop, which Bobby Gillespie’s reedy voice suited well, to scuzzy proto-grunge, which it really didn’t. Reviewers found the band’s second self-titled LP an awkward experience, which explains why a further lurch in direction on ""Loaded"" attracted as much mockery as delight. Great single, everyone agreed – but was it actually Primal Scream in anything but name?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Loaded"" had precedent – the warm, loping shuffle of the Stone Roses’ ""Fools’ Gold"" for one – but its status was set as much by what came after. Gillespie wasn’t the only indie bandleader to find himself a new groove, and the summer of 1990 was speckled with similar hits from the obscurest of sources: the Soup Dragons, the Beloved, the Farm. Like earlier psychedelic explosions, you might argue how much of this was down to the liberating effects of drugs and music on shy boys in bands, and how much was down to the more worldly urge to make some fast money and get on TV. The indie-dance bubble inflated, and a saucer-eyed version of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" by unknown chancers Candy Flip probably marked the exact moment it burst. Months after that, the Primal Scream LP finally came out.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If welding ""dance"" and ""rock"" was all it achieved, its 18-month gestation would have hurt <i>Screamadelica</i>. The album might have been a mere appendix to a briefly promising scene. Fortunately, <i>Screamadelica</i>'s power isn’t in an abstract clash of two different genres, but in the marriage of two very similar sensibilities.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One is Bobby Gillespie’s. Primal Scream’s output has sometimes been dismissed as ""record collection rock"", their versatility no more than a procession of learned poses – the Byrds, rave, krautrock, post-punk. But Gillespie’s approach is less bandwagon-jumping and more a kind of aesthetic cosplay, where his fannish intensity of identification works to overcome the limitations of technique. The comedown blues of ""Damaged"" is <i>Screamadelica</i>’s weakest song, but Gillespie’s conviction makes it essential to the record.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The other is producer Andy Weatherall’s. Weatherall, along with Terry Farley who remixed the ""Come Together"" single, was part of the Boy’s Own DJ and fanzine collective in the earliest days of London Acid House. Boy’s Own loved big, uplifting records, played any genre they fancied, and everything they did, in print or on record, was touched with a cheeky swagger. The euphoric splash of Italo house piano at the climax of ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"", <i>Screamadelica</i>’s most floor-ready track, is a great Weatherall moment. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The meeting of these approaches – unashamed, celebratory club music and rock star fandom – is what gives <i>Screamadelica</i> its particular mood, half strutting with confidence, half yearning for transcendence. One result is that the record is often better when Bobby Gillespie is a presiding spirit rather than an actual singer. Compare album centrepiece ""Come Together"" with its single version, where Gillespie enacts a loved-up Ecstasy high in winsome style. The LP drops his vocals, reshapes the track around the gospel backing singers, and it becomes something titanic. It’s a full-length manifesto not just for the brotherhood of clubbing but for the syncretic approach to rock Primal Scream were exploring. ""All those are just labels"", thunders a sampled Reverend Jesse Jackson, ""We know that music is music."" If you want to know how joyful – and how corny – pop’s discovery of rave could feel in 1991, this is where to start.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Other high points use the frontman better. ""Higher Than The Sun"" casts Gillespie as an astral voyager in a post-rave take on Tim Buckley’s ""Starsailor"". He sounds as awed by its soundscape of hoots, harpsichords, ambient drift and trumpet blasts as the listener. 13</span><span>th</span><span> Floor Elevators cover ""Slip Inside This House"" is just as questing, but more earthy and urgent, with a ragged-voiced Gillespie pushed beyond his limits by the groove.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Screamadelica</i> is a limit-breaking exercise in general, exploring a central question: what is ‘a band’ in the remix age? One reason the LP remains a classic is that its answer to this is so bold and open-ended – ‘Primal Scream’ here is anything from a rock group having the time of their lives on ""Movin’ On Up"", to a vaporous but definite presence on ""Higher Than The Sun (A Dub Symphony In Two Parts)"". The scoffers’ question about ""Loaded"" – is this really Primal Scream? – is firmly answered: it is if it feels that way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The fact that Primal Scream, and others, quickly retreated from this answer doesn’t make it less true. But even by 1992’s Dixie-Narco EP – included on this reissue - the band were downplaying the clubbing influence in favour of something more rootsy, recording new tracks in Memphis. Ultimately, the group’s own preference for being a rock’n’roll touring unit – with associated debauchery – stopped them pushing harder on the doors <i>Screamadelica</i> unlocked.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The two bonus discs fall either side of the tightrope they were walking – a collection of mixes, and a document of the group’s 1992 touring set. The former, like most mix collections, isn’t meant for linear listening, but assorted nearly-there versions of ""Loaded"" show a great idea coming together and the 12"" of ""Higher Than The Sun"" is a glorious re-immersion in the song’s sensory otherworld.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The live disc finds a ramshackle group admirably committed to showing their audience a great time, twisting <i>Screamadelica</i>’s grooves into more band-friendly shapes in the process. Some of them suffer – the segue from ""Higher Than The Sun"" into a clodhopping fragment of Sly Stone’s ""Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" is an excruciating flip from Gillespie’s finest impulses into his worst. But at best, like on the vocal version of ""Come Together"", the tracks wear their extra muscle well. And even if it closes down half of what made <i>Screamadelica</i> special – its reinvention of band as aesthetic – it pulls focus onto the other half. The record is in places ambitious, cosmic, showily wasted – but the thing it is most is a great party album. ""Loaded"", ""Movin’ On Up"", ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"" are still immense dance-rock singles, and Screamadelica is one of alternative music’s great periodic rediscoveries of rhythm. Dance music threw open new wardrobes for British indie – and an inveterate dresser-up like Bobby Gillespie could, and did, take full advantage.</span></p></div>"|21328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21328-screamadelica/|9.0|Tom Ewing

Led by singer/guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2557-lydia-lunch/"" target=""_blank"">Lydia Lunch</a>, the short-lived, NYC-based Jerks cultivated a visceral severity that redeemed its dearth of material. Lunch's caterwaul sounded dangerous and vulnerable, and she sang as though choking words free <span>— </span>wounded, defiant, and quaking with a restrained sense of vengeance made all the more impressive by Lunch’s youth during this period. The band, meanwhile, was the rock’n’roll equivalent of an active blender full of gravel.</p>
<p>Compiling recordings from six shows <span>—</span> five in NYC and one in Toronto <span>—</span> <i>Live 1977-1979</i> presents a convincing argument that stage Jerks might have been superior to studio Jerks. For these sets, Lunch and drummer Bradly Field were the linchpins in a lineup that at times included James Chance of the Contortions on saxophone and future Sonic Youth drummer Jim Sclavunos on bass. On <i>Live</i>, they traded in the intimate miserablism of their singles for something even uglier: a volley of abrupt, interrogative blurts. In the face of audience indifference—crowd chatterers at the January 17, 1979 Max’s Kansas City and November 4, 1978 CBGB’s gigs deserve footnote credit alongside <i>Live</i> mastering engineer Weasel Walter —the Jerks went for broke, urgent, persistent, and stridently staccato. “Orphans” surfaces here twice in virulent form, with Lunch’s serrated guitars kiting and spiralling around Field’s brute thwomp. The band doubled down on the already confrontational fury of “The Closet” by lurching forth in a glowering lockstep, every spat syllable hitting like a fist on a locked door.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Within and beyond the context of “The Closet,” “the size of this room feels like jail” stands as a revelatory lyric. With songs often clocking in at around 75 seconds and its non-chronological tracklist, </span><i>Live </i><span>can feel like a veritable blizzard of Jerks, as insular as the scene surrounding the band. Concurrently, Lunch was playing with Beirut Slump as the Jerks approached a late 1979 implosion; solo, collaborative, theater, and literary projects exploded in myriad directions shortly thereafter. The beast that incubated Lunch’s burgeoning voice could never hope to contain it.</span></p></div>"|21331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21331-live-1977-1979/|7.8|Raymond Cummings

Iñárritu's new film <i><a href=""http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/the-revenant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Revenant</a></i>, Leonardo DiCaprio plays<b> </b>frontiersman Hugh Glass as he, his son, and his hunting team raid Native American land in 1832. After DiCaprio is unexpectedly mauled by a bear, the crew buries him, murders his son, and abandons their bodies, continuing the journey unaware that DiCaprio escaped the grave to seek revenge. Calling <i>The Revenant</i> ""intense"" doesn't begin to do it justice; among other things, it's a meditation on the unholy perseverance of the human soul. Yet its soundtrack—co-created by Japanese composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, German electronic musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/68-alva-noto/"">Alva Noto</a>, and multi-instrumentalist Bryce Dessner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">The National</a>—wisely opts to complement that savagery rather than illustrate it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Iñárritu’s </span><i>Birdman</i><span>, the 2015 Academy Awards' Best Picture winner, stuttered its way through an unconventional drum score by Antonio Sánchez. Here, things get even more minimalist. </span><span><i>The Revenant</i></span><span> trades in sixteenth notes on hi-hats for minute-long fermatas, or held notes, on cellos. Throughout all 23 tracks, the score straddles the line between weariness and wonder, like someone constantly recalling the danger this stunning planet is capable of unleashing. Under conductor </span><a href=""http://www.andrederidder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>André de Ridder</span></a><span>, Berlin-based orchestra </span><a href=""http://www.we-are-stargaze.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>s t a r g a z e</span></a><span> plays expansively and with great care, its 25 players sporting a serious side compared to their work with artists like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/""><span>Deerhoof</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/""><span>Arcade Fire</span></a><span>'s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32312-richard-reed-parry/""><span>Richard Reed Parry</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That organic swelling matches the dramatics beneath the film. Iñárritu fought to keep <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-leonardo-dicaprios-revenant-shoot-810290"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CGI out of The Revenant</a>. He fought to use <a href=""http://deadline.com/2015/02/birdman-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-the-revenant-1201365129/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">natural light on set</a>. He fought to film so deep within nature that <a href=""http://collider.com/the-revenant-filming-details-inarritu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">40% of the day was spent traveling there</a>.  Each of the three contributors uphold this commitment to naturalism, even with Alva Noto's electronica. Sakamoto favors simplicity and clarity; as DiCaprio crosses frozen rivers and sleeps in animal carcasses, the brevity of Sakamoto's ""Killing Hawk"" illustrates the strength of Sakamoto's tight focus. On the minute-long ""Arriving At Fort Kiowa"", a single cello is joined by trotting string support, the group leaning forward in rhythm as a unified organism. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Noto brings three different dream sequences to the table—""First Dream"", ""Church Dream"", and ""Second Dream""—where electronic bass thuds in the background like a mattress falling to the floor of an empty room. It's eerie without offering obvious indicators as to why. In that, Noto's a pro. His use of electronics mimics the eldritch stares of a stalker, especially on ""Goodbye to Hawk"",  creating the kind of anxiety heard in films like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"">Drive</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/"">Under the Skin</a></i>. Familiarity with the film's graphic scenes or the brutal landscapes of southern Argentina isn't required. Noto's written work acts as the terrified heartbeat fueling Iñárritu's violent winter all on its own.</p>
<p>Bryce Dessner is the least involved of the three songwriters, but when he contributes, he creates a world overwhelmingly rich with life – the very thing DiCaprio's character clings to. The most emotional number on the album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62350-the-nationals-bryce-dessner-shares-imagining-buffalo-from-the-revenant-soundtrack/"">""Imagining Buffalo""</a>, introduces one violinist to another and another, stitching them together so they form a single note stretching into the infinite and spilling joy over into illusory insanity. ""Looking For Glass"" rides a similar crescendo. When all three men join forces again, songs like ""Cat and Mouse"" use handclaps and violin tremors to communicate the indefatigability of cheating death. Sometimes, the soundtrack traces the film’s woes without coloring them in, but it’s still successful in creating the sound of mental exhaustion choosing life over death, no matter how torturous and unforgiving it — and we — may be. </p></div>"|21352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21352-the-revenant-ost/|7.3|Nina Corcoran

He's released hip-hop mixtapes, ambient instrumentals, and remixes of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-FwVcdqCx4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other acts' songs</a>; only some of his output has been under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/"">King Krule</a>, the moniker he settled on for his 2013 debut full-length, meaning it's flown beneath the radar of casual music fans who were stunned by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18414-6-feet-beneath-the-moon/""><i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i></a>. The work of tracking what he does now has fallen to hardcore faithful, which seems like a smart long-term survival strategy and a sensible reaction to early career hype: halve your visibility, double your productivity, and wait for the universe to catch up.</p>
<p><i>A New Place 2 Drown </i>is a name given to three new projects—there is also a handsome 208-page art book of sketches, photographs, and poetry from Marshall alongside his older brother Jack, and a short film. And then there is this album. All of it surfaced together this week, and the shared title seems to make an offer to fans and clarify a wish to the larger world. Marshall wants to be swallowed by his work, and he's offering you a chance to join him.</p>
<p>Marshall has often seemed eager for disappearance—journalists have dubbed him ""press-shy,"" a euphemism for ""loathes journalists""—but on <i>A New Place 2 Drown</i>, he achieves it completely. His voice was the star of<i> 6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i>, a blood-red streak against black, but here he dissolves it into the grey mist of his beats. Mostly he croons or mutters over crackles, drips, and clanks. He is an element in his landscape now, not a spotlit singer-songwriter or an ersatz modern-day blues singer. There isn't a single guitar audible on the album's drifting, dreamlike 37 minutes, and not a single song you could imagine <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiesQcy6jzI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Willow Smith attempting to cover</a>.</p>
<p>What it shares with his older work is the septic world it depicts, full of flickering halogen bulbs, sticky synth keys, and corroded outputs. He's made tremendous strides as a producer, to the point where his touch exceeds Rodaidh McDonald's work on his debut. His sound is more three-dimensional, a series of shrouded corners and murmured conversations. This is wandering, grey-skies music, finding pleasure and even sensuality in solitude.</p>
<p>Like most others in the sentient universe, Marshall is a professed fan of hardcore '90s NYC hip-hop, stuff like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"">Wu-Tang</a> and D.I.T.C. Unlike everyone else, he gorgeously reproduces its gloom and loneliness, and finds a way to integrate it into his own style. He does this mostly with a succession of sounds so obsessively perfect and tactile they seem like whole songs themselves: The hollow, rounded <i>thunk</i> of the drum track on ""The Sea Liner MK 1"" precisely mimics the sound of colliding pool balls, and hearing it for only a measly four minutes seems like a cheat, somehow: It is a drum knock so perfect you would cross the street to listen to it.</p>
<p>The formal grain of his music bends increasingly towards hip-hop: The sluggish tempo and tar-thick synths of ""Dull Boys"" and ""Thames Water"" suggest across-the-pond admiration of Houston's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24062-dj-screw/"">DJ Screw</a>, as does the halting sing-song of ""Buffed Sky"". His mumbly, string-of-conscious delivery on ""Sex With Nobody"" conjures early-'00s indie rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti/"">Serengeti</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/160-atmosphere/"">Atmosphere</a>. He is steadily narrowing the gap between the rap he admires and the music he makes, and <i>A New Place 2 Drown</i><span> seems like evidence that he should start producing for rappers regularly.</span></p>
<p>Marshall's own words are haunting but elusive, ripples moving across the surface of his music that dissipate before your ear focuses on their meaning. But you get a peek into a mind state and a mood with every legible phrase: ""I'm pretty sure I'm dying as I speak,"" he offers on ""Arise Dear Brother"". ""She plays me Barry White, all night/ She drift into the light,"" he sings wistfully on ""Ammi Ammi"". The most ringing line, clearest in both its setting and its intention, comes from ""Buffed Sky"": ""I'll fly solo,"" he sings, drawing out the second syllable of the last word for relish and emphasis. It seems like it's working for him.</p></div>"|21326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21326-a-new-place-2-drown/|8.6|Jayson Greene

Lots of the writing, critical and otherwise, about the group's music has really been about revivalism. Is Ratking bringing the '90s back? Should they bring the '90s back? (How much Avirex do they own?)  In reality, both <i>So It Goes<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19201-ratking-so-it-goes/""></a> </i>and the follow-up EP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20355-700-fill-ep/"">700 Fill</a>, </i>are forward-thinking. The group's ties to Clinton-era New York are ethereal—Wiki's affinity for <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"">Cam'ron</a>-esque marriages of crass humor and life advice, Sporting Life's winter-resistant drum programming, Hak's careening narratives. And every piece of Ratking's New York has been picked for a purpose, even if it's dragged through mud and sleet and trampled on by commuters afterward.</p>
<p>The young rapper's solo debut, <i>Lil Me</i>, is an act of decluttering. Where he was once verbose and technical at the expense of his message, here he pares down his writing: ""Light Ls, make it glow/ It takes a toll on my health,"" from the closer ""Sun Showers"". In some ways, this<i> </i>is Wiki's touring record, but it's not about groupies or friction in a relationship back home. It's pointedly unglamorous, all stale gas station food and cramped van seats. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17857-wiki-livin-with-my-moms-ft-nasty-nigel/"">""Living With My Moms""</a> he raps, ""I don't even know/ It's wherever the label tell me to go""; on ""Seedy Motherfucker"", he tells us about getting booed during his set. Even the victories (clean sound checks, crowds who half-understand the lyrics) seem smaller-than-life. Wiki alludes to graver problems—coke habits, robberies, loaded guns—but lets them linger in the margins. </p>
<p>The out-of-town dates serve primarily as an excuse for Wiki to re-examine his hometown. On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>-produced half of the opener ""WikiFlag"", Wiki's pining: ""It's been a minute since I've been given a New York dap."" ""3 Stories"", one of two songs produced by the Montreal-based DJ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a>, is a detail-obsessed narrative in the classicist vein. ""Hit the L"", which reassembles the Ratking lineup, could unfurl in a dozen different directions, but it stays fixed in a smoky room, walls closing in. Sporting Life hooks up a turn-of-the-century chipmunk soul loop, yet chops it into two one-second samples, and uses those sparingly. </p>
<p>The song that follows,""Old Blocks New Kids"", is <i>Lil Me</i>'s thematic center. Reigns at the top are short like leprechauns, and the song (another furnished by Sporting Life) celebrates the turnover. <i>""</i>Oh pops, I know you thought that you could do this/ You ain't stupid, but you old, pops—new kids."" That's Wiki's New York: cold, cutthroat, decaying, being reborn. Over and over, stripping away anything that's unnecessary. </p></div>"|21329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21329-wiki-lil-me/|7.6|Paul A. Thompson

Of the many German bands from the period that would later be called ""krautrock"", Harmonia, though ostensibly a ""supergroup,"" were among the most obscure. Comprised of Dieter Möbius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of astral synth explorers Cluster and guitarist Michael Rother of Neu!, Harmonia was less a band than a two-year-long Iron John retreat, with electronics swapped out for the customary hand drums. Living, practicing, and recording in the hamlet of Forst, Germany, Harmonia managed two full-length records in their short lifetime, and neither made a dent in the consciousness of your average German music fan. But copies of their records found their way into some famously open-eared and influential fans in the UK—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, among others—and Harmonia’s music has been part of the experimental rock canon ever since.</p>
<p>As with many krautrock O.G.s, Harmonia’s initial standing was enhanced by the fact that their records were never easy to find, even after they were discovered by cognoscenti. That was especially true in the U.S., where their records were reissued sporadically, sometimes on dodgy labels. This heavy box set from Gronland fixes that. Gathering everything the group recorded together in one place—and it turns out to be quite a lot, with more music than they managed to release in their lifetime, including newly unearthed fragments released here as <b><i>Documents 1975</i></b>—and augmenting the audio with a book of photos and an essay by krautrock expert Geeta Dayal and other goodies, it offers the definitive portrait of the band. With a group as odd as Harmonia, you take all the context you can get.</p>
<p>Harmonia were a key krautrock band because they brought together the most familiar strands of the sound and effectively perfected the whole. Krautrock in its platonic ideal should be basically instrumental; it should should seamlessly meld electronics and rock instruments;  it should favor long, drawn-over structures over short dynamic shifts, and steady-state rhythms over syncopation. Can were too funky and had too much of an ear for pop; Neu!’s albums had jarring shifts in noise; early Kraftwerk leaned too heavily on flute and mid-period Kraftwerk was too heavy on synths; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"">Ash Ra Tempel</a> had a weakness for bluesy soloing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a> changed their sound too often, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/82-amon-duul-ii/"">Amon Düül II</a> were really a prog-rock band. Harmonia, in the midst of too much, was just right. And if that means their music could sometimes be pleasant and ambient instead of bold and challenging, that’s not a slight. They made virtues of control, understatement, shading, and texture.</p>
<p><b><i>Musik von Harmonia</i></b>, the group’s 1974 debut, was a precise meeting of their constituent parts—Roedelius’ eerie beauty, Möbius’ sense of tension, Rother’s cool exploration—with each member contributing to the sound equally. It’s a shade darker and a half-turn more tense than what would follow, and was also more crudely recorded. Tracks like ""Sonnenschein"" and ""Watussi"" are already underway when we first hear them, making them feel like they’ve always existed and go on forever.<b> ""</b>Dino""’s trebly rhythm brings to mind <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>’s hypnotic major-chord strum in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, and on top of the rhythm bed Michael Rother’s leads seem guided more than played, like he’s directing the flow of water through a maze. The meditative ""Ahoi"" is both futuristic and folky with its piano chords and gently plucked guitar, channeling the type of new age that taps into something ancient while warmly embracing current technology. From the beginning, Harmonia could take what sounded like an interlude and make it hold your attention for minutes on end.</p>
<p>If <i>Musik von Harmonia</i> mapped the range of everything Harmonia would ever do, 1975’s <b><i>Deluxe</i></b> used a more limited palette to paint a more beautiful picture. Working with master engineer Conny Plank and adding the deeper bottom end of drummer Mani Neumeier from Guru Guru, Harmonia refined their approach into a kind of shimmering pastoral dub. ""Walky-Talky"" is right there with Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gChOifUJZMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Autobahn""</a> and Neu!’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAXYMOgHQI4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hallogallo""</a> for the definitive smooth-humming motorway anthem; ""Notre Dame"" is an electro-pop update on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a> in joyfully trippy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3W-3HPMWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rainbow in Curved Air""</a> mode, and ""Gollum"" is a startlingly minimal and precise look ahead at the sound the Too Pure catalog would be known for two decades hence. Even when adding new wrinkles, as with the chanted vocals on the opening ""Deluxe (Immer wieder)"", Harmonia sound tremendously self-assured and comfortable in their sound. And their integration of something approaching proper songcraft intersected quite closely with experiments being done some distance away by the former keyboardist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a>, a young man who became enamored of Harmonia named Brian Eno.</p>
<p>Harmonia was pretty much always on the verge of breaking up, but not because of personal animosity; since the group was not well known, rarely played live, and was made up of three musicians who had other projects close at hand, their status was always tenuous. After <i>Deluxe</i>, they had no plans to continue, but Brian Eno asked to record with them and they re-grouped once more in Forst in 1976. The sessions with Eno were not released at the time, but have been re-packaged in various configurations since, and they are included here as <b><i>Tracks &amp; Traces</i></b>. Eno’s presence is clear and the music is more atmospheric, feeling more like soundscapes than the low-key minimalist rock songs they band made their name with. Not surprisingly, the set also sounds a lot like the electro-acoustic work of the Rother-less <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27520-cluster-eno/"">Cluster &amp; Eno</a>, a collaboration that would extend into the late '70s over several more records. <i>Tracks &amp; Traces</i> is enjoyable, but serves more as a look ahead to those records rather than something that builds on what came before.</p>
<p>The real heart of the box, a disc that sums up the band as well as any, is the 1974 live set. It’s both surprisingly high quality in its recording and also speaks to what made this band special. Rather than recreating tracks they had recorded for this album, they apply their music-making principles to a set of jams that are as beautiful as anything on their proper records. Thick with drones, highly repetitious, and often flat-out gorgeous, <b><i>Live 1974</i></b> throbs, tumbles, pulsates, and twinkles, a gentle explosion in super slo-mo that unfolds over an hour.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <i>The Complete Works</i> doesn’t reveal Harmonia to be an especially varied group, but it does demonstrate that they did a small handful of things brilliantly well, and those happened to be things that no one else was doing. They also happened to sound like what various kinds of experimental music would sound like 20 years later and, I’m guessing, what some strains of it will sound like 20 years from now.</p></div>"|20947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20947-complete-works/|8.5|Mark Richardson

""Walky-Talky"" is right there with Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gChOifUJZMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Autobahn""</a> and Neu!’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAXYMOgHQI4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hallogallo""</a> for the definitive smooth-humming motorway anthem; ""Notre Dame"" is an electro-pop update on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a> in joyfully trippy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3W-3HPMWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rainbow in Curved Air""</a> mode, and ""Gollum"" is a startlingly minimal and precise look ahead at the sound the Too Pure catalog would be known for two decades hence. Even when adding new wrinkles, as with the chanted vocals on the opening ""Deluxe (Immer wieder)"", Harmonia sound tremendously self-assured and comfortable in their sound. And their integration of something approaching proper songcraft intersected quite closely with experiments being done some distance away by the former keyboardist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a>, a young man who became enamored of Harmonia named Brian Eno.</p>
<p>Harmonia was pretty much always on the verge of breaking up, but not because of personal animosity; since the group was not well known, rarely played live, and was made up of three musicians who had other projects close at hand, their status was always tenuous. After <i>Deluxe</i>, they had no plans to continue, but Brian Eno asked to record with them and they re-grouped once more in Forst in 1976. The sessions with Eno were not released at the time, but have been re-packaged in various configurations since, and they are included here as <b><i>Tracks &amp; Traces</i></b>. Eno’s presence is clear and the music is more atmospheric, feeling more like soundscapes than the low-key minimalist rock songs they band made their name with. Not surprisingly, the set also sounds a lot like the electro-acoustic work of the Rother-less <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27520-cluster-eno/"">Cluster &amp; Eno</a>, a collaboration that would extend into the late '70s over several more records. <i>Tracks &amp; Traces</i> is enjoyable, but serves more as a look ahead to those records rather than something that builds on what came before.</p>
<p>The real heart of the box, a disc that sums up the band as well as any, is the 1974 live set. It’s both surprisingly high quality in its recording and also speaks to what made this band special. Rather than recreating tracks they had recorded for this album, they apply their music-making principles to a set of jams that are as beautiful as anything on their proper records. Thick with drones, highly repetitious, and often flat-out gorgeous, <b><i>Live 1974</i></b> throbs, tumbles, pulsates, and twinkles, a gentle explosion in super slo-mo that unfolds over an hour.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <i>The Complete Works</i> doesn’t reveal Harmonia to be an especially varied group, but it does demonstrate that they did a small handful of things brilliantly well, and those happened to be things that no one else was doing. They also happened to sound like what various kinds of experimental music would sound like 20 years later and, I’m guessing, what some strains of it will sound like 20 years from now.</p></div>"|20947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20947-complete-works/|7.6|Mark Richardson

Of the many German bands from the period that would later be called ""krautrock"", Harmonia, though ostensibly a ""supergroup,"" were among the most obscure. Comprised of Dieter Möbius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of astral synth explorers Cluster and guitarist Michael Rother of Neu!, Harmonia was less a band than a two-year-long Iron John retreat, with electronics swapped out for the customary hand drums. Living, practicing, and recording in the hamlet of Forst, Germany, Harmonia managed two full-length records in their short lifetime, and neither made a dent in the consciousness of your average German music fan. But copies of their records found their way into some famously open-eared and influential fans in the UK—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, among others—and Harmonia’s music has been part of the experimental rock canon ever since.</p>
<p>As with many krautrock O.G.s, Harmonia’s initial standing was enhanced by the fact that their records were never easy to find, even after they were discovered by cognoscenti. That was especially true in the U.S., where their records were reissued sporadically, sometimes on dodgy labels. This heavy box set from Gronland fixes that. Gathering everything the group recorded together in one place—and it turns out to be quite a lot, with more music than they managed to release in their lifetime, including newly unearthed fragments released here as <b><i>Documents 1975</i></b>—and augmenting the audio with a book of photos and an essay by krautrock expert Geeta Dayal and other goodies, it offers the definitive portrait of the band. With a group as odd as Harmonia, you take all the context you can get.</p>
<p>Harmonia were a key krautrock band because they brought together the most familiar strands of the sound and effectively perfected the whole. Krautrock in its platonic ideal should be basically instrumental; it should should seamlessly meld electronics and rock instruments;  it should favor long, drawn-over structures over short dynamic shifts, and steady-state rhythms over syncopation. Can were too funky and had too much of an ear for pop; Neu!’s albums had jarring shifts in noise; early Kraftwerk leaned too heavily on flute and mid-period Kraftwerk was too heavy on synths; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"">Ash Ra Tempel</a> had a weakness for bluesy soloing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a> changed their sound too often, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/82-amon-duul-ii/"">Amon Düül II</a> were really a prog-rock band. Harmonia, in the midst of too much, was just right. And if that means their music could sometimes be pleasant and ambient instead of bold and challenging, that’s not a slight. They made virtues of control, understatement, shading, and texture.</p>
<p><b><i>Musik von Harmonia</i></b>, the group’s 1974 debut, was a precise meeting of their constituent parts—Roedelius’ eerie beauty, Möbius’ sense of tension, Rother’s cool exploration—with each member contributing to the sound equally. It’s a shade darker and a half-turn more tense than what would follow, and was also more crudely recorded. Tracks like ""Sonnenschein"" and ""Watussi"" are already underway when we first hear them, making them feel like they’ve always existed and go on forever.<b> ""</b>Dino""’s trebly rhythm brings to mind <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>’s hypnotic major-chord strum in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, and on top of the rhythm bed Michael Rother’s leads seem guided more than played, like he’s directing the flow of water through a maze. The meditative ""Ahoi"" is both futuristic and folky with its piano chords and gently plucked guitar, channeling the type of new age that taps into something ancient while warmly embracing current technology. From the beginning, Harmonia could take what sounded like an interlude and make it hold your attention for minutes on end.</p>

Later, their style helped inspire Art Nouveau, and thus the underdogs became the influencers. It is an appropriate title for a theatrical indie pop band that embraces life's misinterpretations and messiness, and their message has never been more apparent than on their sophomore record <i>Try to Be Hopeful</i><i>.</i> Although it was still a defining theme on their 2013 debut, <i>D</i><i>ress Up</i><i>, Try to Be Hopeful </i>finds the group writing much more explicitly about queerness and identity. As singer and guitarist Nye Todd explained in an <a href=""http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/music/13764514.Spook_School_s_pop_punk_finds_a_new_identity/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>interview</span></a>, ""A lot of the lyrics I wrote on our first record were about coming to terms with being trans, whereas on this one the songs are more about a feeling of 'Yeah, this is an identity! This is GOOD!""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""This is GOOD"" is the overwhelming attitude of the record, given the sense that all of the depicted experiences<span>—</span>whether body dysmorphia, gigantic crushes, or the realization that identity is bigger than a hexadecimal<span>—</span>contain the possibility to be validating or enriching. This is not to say that the tracks on </span><i>Try to Be Hopeful</i><span> are naively optimistic; instead, as the title insinuates, they attempt positivity with a grain of salt. However, there is still plenty of room for fear to sneak in, as expressed in the album's eponymous track: ""I've been waiting outside for what seems like years/ When I finally get inside I'll give in to the fear/ Of finally having what I want, I'll finally know/ If this really really will fix me/ If my problems will all sail away.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Burn Masculinity"" defends the title's proclamation with the rationale that those of a certain gender should recognize their inherent, systematic privilege because ""what good has it ever done?"" Meanwhile, the penultimate track ""Binary"" claims that humans are not computers and thusly should not be ""limited to binary desires."" The journey from ""Burn Masculinity"" to ""Binary"" offers a literal marker of growth. While recording, Nye began taking testosterone treatment, and the change in his voice is evident over the course of 11 tracks.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of </span><i>Try to Be Hopeful</i><span> is spent digging into the complexities of self and society with a lens that is simultaneously critical, sensitive, and goofy. Perhaps this final descriptor is most crucial: the Spook School's eagerness to grow is comforting and inclusive. Lyrically, the band appears more serious on </span><i>Try to Be Hopeful</i><span>, but their noise-pop jams remain as joyful as ever. Take ""I Want to Kiss You"", a track celebrating, clearly, desire with an unrestrained joy. ""I want to run my fingers through your hair/ And you would say you've never done this before/ With someone like me,"" the four sing in unison. It's great fun, but the ""with someone like me"" phrase is a constant reminder that there is great risk in vulnerability. To layer these sentiments with shredding doesn't minimize the meaning: it just shows that humans contain the capacity for multitudes.</span></p></div>"|21342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21342-try-to-be-hopeful/|7.2|Quinn Moreland

He regularly shared cognac at his house with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>; he recorded a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8317-ray-charles/"">Ray Charles</a>; he singlehandedly put Miami on the map with his early '70s label TK Records; and made a star of a worker in his warehouse named Harry Wayne Casey, whose KC &amp; the Sunshine band scored disco hits like ""That's The Way (I Like It)"" and ""(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty"" for TK. Just as impressive as his business smarts was his restlessness: though TK was Stone's primary concern, he also oversaw a fleet of smaller independent labels, each of which had a different stylistic focus, but were all loosely linked to R&amp;B.</p>
<p>One of those labels was Gospel Roots, which Stone founded in 1976 with Timmy Thomas, who had himself scored a hit four years prior with ""Why Can't We Live Together"", a song that has had <a href=""http://www.whosampled.com/sample/365941/Drake-Hotline-Bling-Timmy-Thomas-Why-Can't-We-Live-Together/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a particularly big 2015</a>. Like all of Stone's ventures, Gospel Roots quickly amassed a sprawling discography, releasing 50 LPs in just three years. Part of this was owed to the label's canny structure—rather than shelling out for recording and production, Stone snapped up pre-existing gospel masters from regional artists and simply pressed and distributed them through Gospel Roots. According to the extensive notes included with <i>Christians Catch Hell</i>, Thomas rarely met—or even spoke to—the artists whose work he was commissioned to promote. The label expired just three years after it was founded, without scoring a single notable hit.</p>
<p>That backstory makes <i>Christians Catch Hell</i>—a collection of 18 tracks from the Gospel Roots label—seem like yet another in a long line of barrel-scraping reissues of ""lost classics,"" but the music it contains transcends record collector arcana, providing instead a snapshot of the underexplored intersection between disco, funk, and gospel. Despite its fiery title, the prevailing themes on <i>Christians</i> are joy, empathy and compassion; in nearly all of them, salvation and Divine love are contrasted with societal ills. On the loose, New Orleans-style R&amp;B of the Fantastic Family Aires' ""Tell Me"", vocalist Rachion Conigan asks repeatedly, ""What is this world coming to?"" describing fractured families and global catastrophes as the band vamps balefully behind him. Later, in ""The Color of God"", they attack racism, describing God as being ""a natural color,"" existing above toxic, man-made prejudice. Like ""Tell Me"", the music that accompanies it is a slow walk, full of teardrop guitar licks and heartbeat bass lines.</p>
<p>By contrast, Pastor T.L. Barrett's swooping ""After the Rain"" comes on like <i>Talking Book</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, with big, clanging piano ringing out behind Barrett's fervent reassurances of God's enduring love. And ""On Jesus' Program"", by the Original Sunset Travelers, is a kind of twilight doo-wop number that edges its way forward slowly, with an unidentified lead vocalist spilling his honeyed tenor over deep-set, creeping music. There are fragments of hundreds of styles on <i>Christians</i>: the wacka-wacka disco guitar on ""For the Children"", the twinkling cocktail lounge funk on the sweeping ""Said It Long Time Ago"", and late-night Quiet Storm vocals on the praise number ""Spirit Free"", which gracefully blurs the line between spiritual and romantic love. <i>Christians</i> subtly connects all of these genres, indicating passages from one to the other while also gesturing toward their common source in gospel music. More than being a simple celebration of obscure artists, <i>Christians</i> is instead a kind of roadmap, tracing the byways that lead from one style to another.</p>
<p>At times, it could do with a bit more heat. With few of the tracks operating above mid-tempo, it begins to sag slightly as it goes on. Fortunately, it snaps back into focus with the late arrival of the title track, a smoky, agonized blues number powered by the impassioned vocals of Rev. Edna Isaac and the Greene Sisters. In the liners, Isaac describes crying while writing the lyrics, and every ounce of that pain turns up in her delivery. Unlike the rest of the record, which presents religion as a rescue, ""Christians Catch Hell"" focuses on the difficulty of having faith, and the oppression from friends and spiritual forces that accompanies belief. ""People who are non-Christians/ Throw stumbling blocks in your way,"" she cautions, ""Satan chooses his disciples/ Puts his seal on them to do his ways/…But I'd rather be a Christian/ And stay with the Lord every day."" Like all of the songs on <i>Christians</i>, it didn't turn its singer into a star on par with, say KC &amp; the Sunshine Band. But the conviction of the performance and the clarity of the lyrics suggests that perhaps earthly acclaim was beside the point.</p></div>"|21296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21296-christians-catch-hell-gospel-roots-1976-79/|7.3|J.

That 18-song, 75-minute double album found the onetime sludge group making calmer, more melodic rock music, and seemed to presage a crossover. There was energy around the band, a palpable sense of momentum. But a month or so after the release of the record, Baroness got into a bus crash while on tour in England. It was a serious accident, a slide off the road, that stalled the <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> roll-out and almost ended the band. It was jarring enough that drummer Allen Blickle and bassist Matt Maggioni, who both suffered fractured vertebrae, ended up leaving the group.</p>
<p>There was emotional and psychological healing, as well as bones that had to be reset: A photo of the banged-up band surfaced and frontman and visual artist (and the group's poet and beating heart) John Baizley said he was close to having his arm amputated. But he healed, as did longtime guitarist Peter Adams. After the accident, Baizley wrote an<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48060-baroness-john-baizley-writes-beautiful-thank-you-letter-to-fans-about-august-bus-accident/""> amazing letter </a>reaffirming his commitment to Baroness and music and art in general before he and Adams went on tour with new members, bassist/keyboardist Nick Jost and drummer Sebastian Thomson. Their shows after the accident were powerful—even the calmer <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> songs had a magnetic, life-affirming force.</p>
<p>Shortly before <i>Y&amp;G</i>'s release, before the accident, I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8886-longform/"">interviewed</a> Baizley. He told me he wanted <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i>’s cover art, like the songs themselves, to reflect the feeling of the moment before or after a disaster. It’s eerie rereading his words now: ""A lot of what I tackled lyrically or conceptually with [<i>Y&amp;G</i>] is present on first glance but has... this implication of horror, or 'this is the moment before a car crash,' or the moment after a car crash. It seemed a little bit more engaging and interesting to me to consider those moments before, those moments after, rather than the ease and bluntness that comes with graphic violence or obvious, terrifying things."" In a very real-life way, <i>Purple</i>, their first studio album since the accident, has ended up doing this, too.</p>
<p><i>Purple</i> is the color of fresh bruises. It's also the combination of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10646-red-album/""><i>Red</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13603-blue-record/""><i>Blue</i></a>, which makes sense musically for those familiar with the group's albums of those names. These are some of the biggest, strongest songs Baroness have written; it's rock music that folds in their more metal leanings, along with something more delicate and spare. The hooks and melodies are their best. It also marks a number of firsts for the band. They're releasing it themselves on their new Abraxan Hymns imprint, and instead of recording with John Congleton, who produced the last couple of albums, they worked with Dave Fridmann, best known for his longtime collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a> (and you'll notice a larger presence of psychedelic keyboards throughout). It's also the first album to feature the new lineup, the same group as that first tour after the accident, and at this point they play together like longtime vets.</p>
<p>It’s shorter and more precise than <i>Yellow &amp; Green, </i>with 10 songs in 43 minutes. The opener ""Morningstar"" rips into the thoughtful synths of ""Shock Me"", before that song, too, starts to burn. ""Shock Me""'s an elegant song about being shocked into a new reality, about bad dreams coming true, about going into battle without proper preparation. On one level it feels like a song about the struggle and battle of day-to-day living, but this isn't dour or sad music: In fact, Baizley sounds thankful for the clearer, sharper vision personal tragedy's afforded him.</p>
<p>Songs like ""Kerosene"" and ""Desperation Burns"" nod to heat or flames, as do many of the lyrics. There are also lyrics about breathing and disappearing, doctors and spines and pills and death. The excellent, epic first single ""Chlorine &amp; Wine"", features a harmonizing breakdown after a gentler piano bridge that seems to signal survival. In it, the entire band sings (or, shouts really): ""Please don't lay me down/ Under the rocks where I found/ My place in the ground/ A home for the fathers and sons."" These feel like war stories, or more aptly, stories from some people who feel ecstatic to be alive.</p>
<p>Baizley likes to tell stories through his cover art as well. On the sleeve of <i>Purple</i>, four women huddle together in what looks like the cold, with calm dogs and falcons by their sides. There are some mice (food for the birds) and nails (tools for building). There's a full moon, too, as well as blooming flowers and bees and berries and honey (the promise of Spring). The picture, which seems to be referenced in the lyrics to ""Morningstar"", communicates the hardiness of spirit it takes to live through tougher times and emerge hopeful. It's easy enough to see the four band members reflected in these four women. Here they are, alive and astonished, and here is this record.</p></div>"|21179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21179-purple/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

But since reaching his pinnacle with 2012’s </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"">Rich Forever</a></i><span>, oversaturation has exhausted much of what made him successful in previous years.

<p>If MMG is rap’s luxury car dealership, then Ross is its cigar-smoking general manager; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"">Meek Mill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"">Wale</a> his top salesmen. At this stage of his career, Ross should be sitting and tallying sales. But after Meek Mill fumbled a winning hand against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, Wale and Meek began squabbling, and Ross himself went to jail for assaulting his groundskeeper. Ross was forced to roll up his sleeves and right the course of his imprint. September’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21025-black-dollar/"">Black Dollar</a></i> was a step in the right direction, with a refocused Ross proving that he’s more interesting with his back against the wall than when he’s dropping hits <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xOi6P2pf6I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like Steph Curry three-pointers</a>. With <i>Black Market</i>, he continues this narrative.</p>
<p>""Bottom of the black market, time to rise again,"" he announces on the album’s opener, ""Free Enterprise"". As the first song written for the album (albeit, during Ross’s jail stint earlier this year), it’s a strong tone-setter. Aided once more by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5848-john-legend/"">John Legend</a>’s soaring vocals, Ross ponders future possibilities. Think of it as the next step after <i>Black Dollar</i> carryover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17664-rick-ross-foreclosures/"">""Foreclosures""</a>, where he waxes eloquent about how financial problems can still complicate the lifestyles of the rich and famous: ""You reap what you sow, and they speakin’ repossessions/ To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons."" Ross excels when given a focal point, and adversity (specifically, the fear of going back to rags from riches) gives him something to dig his teeth into.</p>
<p>Absent from <i>Black Market</i> is the boisterous production heard on previous Rick Ross projects. With the Lex Luger trademark heard on ""B.M.F."", ""MC Hammer"", and ""9 Piece"" pirated into extinction over the years, Ross has wisely moved on. He's at his most effective when he dials back the Rick Ross character, so the album’s standouts feature him laying bawse insight over slow-burners. The radiance of Jake One’s production and CeeLo Green’s chorus add another layer of warmth to ""Smile Mama, Smile"", lifting it out of routine homage territory. ""Crocodile Python"" is as smooth as the title indicates, and ""Silk Road"" is beautifully minimal. On the latter, he explains that he fixates on ostentatious imagery to create something vivid for the less fortunate: ""I entertain niggas under poverty lines/ So I paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes."" ""Black Opium"" falls into the same neighborhood, adding scratches from DJ Premier for furnishing and decoration.</p>
<p>But amidst the good, errors loom. ""Peace Sign"" treads into lazy, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb6HZa151s8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Diced Pineapples"" territory</a>. Meanwhile, ""Can’t Say No"" revives and refurbishes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU1knfz15xI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an old Mariah Carey gem</a>. Carey sounds great, but the song’s inclusion is as unnecessary as the resurrection of its source material. It’s the inverse of what Carey previously did to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cam’ron</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9rk1e1T_po"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh Boy""</a>. ""Dope Dick"" features more stellar production from Jake One, but the laughable title and hook (has ""dick"" been uttered more over a five-minute period?) makes you wish Ross saved the beat and verses for something more serious.</p>
<p>""Success is a precious jewel,"" Ross warns on ""Foreclosures"". It should be cherished, because, like popularity, it can vanish at a moment’s notice. Rick Ross’ has waned in recent years, but the trials have added new shadings to his four-color persona. The motivated, slightly weary Ross heard on <i>Black Market—</i>which has no MMG features—is a better fit for the moment than the bulletproof supervillain of old. Ross has proven his resilience in the past; maybe carefully controlled doses of reality are just what he needs to move forward. </p></div>"|21344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21344-black-market/|7.0|Julian Kimble

She's a true triple threat, equally searing as a rapper, soul singer, and personality and an unstoppable force on record, as amply proven with single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQaRQe86suA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Batches and Cookies""</a> (and its buttered-up hunkfest of a video) and with previous groups <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4Wnfai7YI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GRRRL PARTY</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XdbE74V7gA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Chalice</a>. <i>Big GRRRL Small World</i> comes off as the work of an already minted star—her introduction to the small world, which she's already stepped over, laughing.</p>
<p><i>Big GRRRL Small World</i>—named for a line on <i>LIZZOBANGERS, </i>and Lizzo's label BGSW, on which she released the album—finds her reckoning with her sudden fame, and also the things that plague it: white culture vultures, terrible dudes (consigned on ""Ride"" to the ""Support Group for Men Without Lizzo,"" a demolishingly hilarious couple of bars), people who need her references RapGenius'd clear for them, needy people, misogynists. It's all delivered with sheer glee, and some of it is among the most wicked <i>fun </i>committed to record in 2015.</p>
<p>It also sounds gorgeous; largely produced by BJ Burton (<a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31596-sylvan-esso/"">Sylvan Esso</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30306-polica/"">Poliça</a>), the album is full of unexpected turns and immaculate codas. Lizzo bends each track to her will, twisting them until they're anything but obvious. ""Ain't I"", the closest thing here to a LIZZOBANGER, begins with references to reparations and Russian czars but ends with a distant, slightly untuned piano interlude and distorted guitar squeals. The ballads speak the language of vulnerability but twist R&amp;B tropes to different ends. Standout single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17747-lizzo-humanize/"">""Humanize""</a> begins as a shimmering post-coital reverie sung in feather-soft voice and ends smothering and alone, with a voice like the feather's sharp end.</p>
<p>Lizzo's lyrics <b></b>on ""Humanize"" complicate everything, full of reversals (""your skin is warm—it keeps me up though I am tired"") and pinprick-perfect lines: ""No, you can't lay on my shoulder, there are spikes and scales and your cheek would just press them in."" It's an exhausted, near-existential sigh: one of yearning for connection but unable to find it, particularly when the ones you're supposed to connect with are the aforementioned terrible dudes. ""En Love"" begins as another sumptuous soul piece, Lizzo's besotten cooing resting upon beds of '90s synth pads, until Lizzo drops the punchline—""with myself!""—and turns the track into a trap jam. Lizzo's force of personality prevents the switch up from being mere gimmick, as does her generosity; she dedicates a verse to her best friend, and to her listeners.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most straightforward tracks on <i>Big GRRRL Small World</i>, such as empowerment ballad ""My Skin"", are explicitly about and for everyone who looks like and looks up to her. This—not only her indie friends, or her crystalline production, and especially not her place in any made-up taxonomy of female rappers she's been placed into—is largely responsible for her whirlwind success, and Lizzo knows it. ""I love that because I am a woman and because I rap and I look the way I look, I can connect with the demographic of people who feel like they have a voice in me,"" <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487576/lizzo-rapper-interview-sleater-kinney-tour"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lizzo told <i>Billboard</i></a>. ""I get to speak to these people who did not get spoken for in this genre."" <i>Big GRRRL Small World </i>succeeds because it's just that: a showcase for the small world, a keepsake for the big grrrls.<br/><br/><b>Correction:</b> An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Bon Iver's Justin Vernon produced <i>LIZZOBANGERS</i>.</p></div>"|21312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21312-big-grrrl-small-world/|7.5|Katherine St. Asaph

Almost a decade after he passed, we're on posthumous record #3, and you start to wonder if we're officially scraping the barrel. </p>
<p>Compared to <i>The Naked Soul of Sweet Jones</i>, which at least featured producers Pimp C worked with in life and was rooted in the country-rap sound, 2011's lesser <i>Still Pimping</i>, <i>Long Live the Pimp </i>is the worst of his posthumous output. This is partly due to the uncharacteristically sleepy and subdued verses from Chad Butler himself, but it's not helped out by the production either. Instead of the country-inspired bounce of Pimp's own productions, a lot of <i>Long Live the Pimp</i> works a dank, marching-band percussion rhythm associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a>'s late-career resurgence, more ""Bandz a Make Her Dance"" than ""Sippin on Some Syrup"". </p>
<p>In fact, Juicy J oversaw production on several of these songs, and his fingerprints are all over the album. ""Payday"" sounds like something from this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21076-100-juice/""><i>100% Juice</i></a>. The two collaborated often and were representatives for their own regional scenes, but the songs here are discomfiting because they sound too obviously inspired by current trends, an ill fit for a voice so closely aligned with a singular aesthetic. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> is a great artist, but you can't pair one of his hooks with a Pimp C verse any more than you can digitally insert John Candy into <i>Krampus</i>.</p>
<p>And the overt tributes to Pimp's  sound—church organs and wah-wah guitars—sound flimsy as well, the Diet Coke version of country rap tunes. ""Trill"" is nice enough, with three professional verses from three signature Houston voices—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4128-slim-thug/"">Slim Thug</a>, ESG, and Lil Keke. But everyone sounds careful and reverent, on their best behavior. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"">A$AP Rocky</a>, Juicy J, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"">Nas</a> features fall predictably flat (though ""Friends"" works a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29154-tlc/"">TLC</a>-inspired hook as well as it can), but something like ""Bitch Get Down"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"">Bun B</a> and 8 Ball &amp; MJG or ""Twerk Something"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> should have been home runs. They all feel too tasteful to really be essential, not at all a proper tribute to Pimp's spirit.</p>
<p>Pre-release hype pegs <i>Long Live the Pimp</i> as the culmination of what Pimp C was working on toward the end of his life. But it makes you wonder—why did it take eight years for this stuff to see the light of day? Maybe the best verses he left behind have already been used on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a>'s final album, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13073-ugk-4-life/"">UGK 4 Life</a>,</i> and two other posthumous solo records. Pimp C's work is in good hands (I don't see any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5923-duets-the-final-chapter/""><i>Duets: The Final Chapter</i></a>-type fiascos in the future) but maybe it's time to leave well enough alone.</p></div>"|21308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21308-long-live-the-pimp/|5.0|Matthew Ramirez

""It's the best day of the year, girl,"" you mumble for the thousandth time, fumbling for a Cialis. No one gets older, and nothing changes. That's been the unfortunate majority of Jeremih's career—somewhat bafflingly, considering the singer and multi-instrumentalist has racked up three platinum singles and features on hits from half the rap game. Since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMxOzxKYYo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Birthday Sex""</a>—his 2009 debut single, recorded in college classmate Mick Schultz' makeshift studio—took hold of Chicago radio and then the world, he's tried in vain to politely distance himself from the song. And meanwhile, he obsessively adjusted and readjusted <i>Late Nights</i>, his third studio album: the one that officially renders his early career a distant memory and establishes himself as one of R&amp;B's most singular voices.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The <i>Late Nights</i> universe pays no mind to the swagless Gregorian calendar, abiding instead by the hours of Patron shots and wanton DM slides. Each day begins at dusk and ends at sunrise, eyelids gently twitching from leftover molly. It is a purgatory in the best sense, a retreat from reality for discerning hedonists. Jeremih seems to zone out a lot: two separate instances on <i>Late Nights</i> find him coming to the realization that he is the only clothed person in the room, as if he'd absentmindedly stumbled into a drunken orgy. Above all else, he needs room to breathe. <i>Late Night</i>'s guiding principle is space—for his weightless upper register to float, and for the album's barely-there production to echo off itself. ""Man, my whip's so big when you in it,"" he crows to his beguiling passenger on ""Planez"", this year's best radio R&amp;B single in spite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>'s paraphiliac trainwreck of a guest verse. It's a small sentiment that gestures at something grander: When you're with me, my world opens up. And that's exactly how <i>Late Nights</i> feels.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There is almost no continuity between this album and Jeremih's last, 2010's paint-by-numbers <i>All About You</i>. With its dim-lit crackle and delicate suggestions of beats, <i>Late Nights</i>' only real predecessor is his 2012 mixtape of the same title—one he released for free against the guidance of Def Jam, who seemed unwilling to give Jeremih the benefit of the doubt. To be fair, no one could have seen it coming: impeccably produced, subtle, and hot as fuck, it showed Jeremih like no one had seen before. Parts of <i>Late Nights</i>, the album, feel like direct continuations of that tape's sound: third single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17787-jeremih-oui/"">""Oui""</a> builds on the delicate doo-wop of ""Rosa Acosta"" like a gently-traced impression of a Terius Nash creation. But then the bottom drops out, and Jeremih slips into a momentary interpolation of Shai's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNRc1ER8p4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""If I Ever Fall in Love""</a>. It's easy to see what draws him to the 1992 hit: a wisp of a backdrop, over which the quartet's harmonies defy gravity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Late Nights</i>' most stunning moments take the mixtape's best ideas and strip them down further than seemed possible. ""Pass Dat"" is little more than suggestive synth echo and bass tremor; ""Woosah"" rations percussion like there was a drought, sustaining itself off muted finger-snaps and the flick of a lighter. More than ever, Jeremih—who taught himself the drums at three years old—has learned to use his own voice as a rhythmic element, redefining the idea of ""flow"" for the R&amp;B set. It's the logical reverse of the direction rap's been moving in for most of the 2010s, blurring rapped and sung delivery to indistinguishability; on ""Drank"", he skips nimbly from rap-inspired staccato to half-chanted dancehall melodies, the R&amp;B equivalent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1cR-AW3Zf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stoner""</a>. <i>Late Nights</i>' most overt hip-hop crossovers (""Giv No Fucks"", ""Royalty"") feel less essential, but to watch Jeremih approach rap and R&amp;B's midpoint from the opposite direction as rhythmic innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"">Twista</a> is a fascinating study in contrasts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It feels like poetic justice that the high point of </span><i>Late Nights</i><span>—an album about patience, space, the agonizing tease of perfectionism—is saved for its final track. Over nothing more than an acoustic guitar, Jeremih yawns blearily at his beachside paradise, kind of faded, the only one still awake. He pops some Tylenol, revisits the preceding night's debauchery, smiles. ""Sooooo fuckin' wasted,"" he harmonizes like a delinquent angel choir. It's a derelict canticle, a lullaby for the perpetually hungover, a deep breath. It took him long enough to get here, and he's going to savor the moment for as long as he possibly can, in the little universe he's carved out because the industry didn't have space for him. </span><i>Late Nights</i><span>, in its subtle seduction, feels all the more special in an era that increasingly rewards artists who shout the loudest. Jeremih makes you shut everything else out so that you can hear him whisper in your ear. It was worth the wait.</span></p></div>"|21340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21340-late-nights-the-album/|8.3|Meaghan Garvey

Anderson’s music—not the lurid B-movie scares of lurking bogeymen or masked slashers, but a trauma more rooted in the quotidian and everyday, of neuroses roaming in a fog of prescription medication and of self-inflicted scars hidden beneath long sleeves. First as part of Los Angeles group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5505-gowns/"">Gowns</a>, and now in her solo incarnation as EMA, Anderson has pursued a raw, husky lo-fi music that feels intensely personal, the sort that you either feel and empathize with on a deep and profound level, or listen to uncomfortably, like an intruder. On <i>#HORROR</i>, though, we find Anderson not airing personal demons, but writing to commission, as she scores the debut feature film by the actress, fashion designer, and socialite Tara Subkoff.</p>
<p>As the hashtag implies, this is a calculatedly millennial take on the genre, a tale of pre-teen girls, inherited privilege, and cyberbullying that takes an inevitable dark twist. On paper, Anderson is a good fit for the subject matter—not just for the fraught emotions that crackle in her music, but for her digital nativity. While EMA’s early output was firmly rooted in a DIY punk idiom, Anderson’s work has increasingly expanded into virtual and connected spaces, from the song-portraits of technological malaise found on her 2014 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19208-ema-the-futures-void/""><i>T</i><i>he Future’s Void</i></a> to her recent exhibition <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wzkMpy_iMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Destroy (Sacred Objects From Suburban Homes)""</a> at New York's MoMA PS1 and London’s Barbican, which employed Oculus Rift virtual reality technology to memorialize or consecrate banal or defunct artefacts of consumer culture. Now on<i> #HORROR—</i>recorded with long-time collaborator Leif Shackelford—we find Anderson again working at the boundary line between the real and the virtual, taking up vocals, strings, and electronics to soundtrack a sinister online realm unrolling its tendrils into our own.</p>
<p>Certainly, Anderson and Shackelford have done their homework. These 18 tracks add up to an hour of music, gesturing out to horror score landmarks past and present. ""Running Danger"" and ""Dr White in the House"" channel the analogue synth work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>, unfurling throbbing electronic tones around which Shackelford twines long, melancholy violin strokes. ""Locust Strings"" recalls the sinister orchestral clamor of György Ligeti—or, if you want a more contemporary antecedent, the wasp’s nest hum of strings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23356-mica-levi/"">Mica Levi</a> wove throughout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/""><i>Under the Skin</i></a>. And while many of the album’s tracks feel fleeting, working with shadowy atmospherics, one fully-fledged song emerges in the shape of ""Amnesia Haze"". Taking its cues from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"">soundtrack</a> to Nicolas Winding Refn’s <i>Drive</i>, it’s a diaphanous synthpop confection of twinkling arpeggios and soft-strummed guitar that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a> in its minor-key yearning and opiated pacing. ""You were just a child,"" repeats Anderson, and the results are striking, if a touch more pristine than the raw angst with which EMA made her name.</p>
<p><i>#HORROR</i> often feels like a slick thing, with few of the rough edges that have defined Anderson’s work. But the above zig-zag of reference points here perhaps gestures at the real reason <i>#HORROR</i> doesn’t entirely come off. It feels a little too surface and referential, lost amidst legacies. You might argue a horror film soundtrack can never be anything other than a genre exercise: the process, after all, comes with certain demands and strictures—the tension of suspense, the release of the scare. But such is the genre-skipping on show that it’s hard to grasp what dark truth about Subkoff’s film <i>#HORROR</i> is trying to express.</p>
<p>Perhaps we get closest on a handful of tracks that feel like they play off the aesthetics of the web itself: ""Horror #2"", with its coldly impassive choral voices and buzzing tones that evoke jagged waveforms; or ""Harshmallow World"", a twinkly fantasia of pizzicato strings and tolling bells recalling the sumptuous, exotic darkness of Italian maestros like Bruno Nicolai, but presented with a bright, hyperreal glaze. With John Carpenter off on tour and labels like <a href=""http://deathwaltzrecordingcompany.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Death Waltz</a> and <a href=""http://waxworkrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waxwork Records</a> resurrecting dusty old scores as luxury consumer products, the vintage horror soundtrack has never been more sung. But at times like this we need someone to advance the form, and <i>#HORROR</i> doesn’t quite have the strength of conviction. Next time, perhaps, more guts.</p></div>"|21336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21336-horror-ost/|6.4|Louis Pattison

But Watson's pursuits outside that band have veered in all sorts of directions. His other group, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30264-pond/"">Pond</a>, is the unbridled id to Tame Impala's steely superego, a band that feels no shame in giving songs titles like ""Heroic Shart"" or compunction in flipping between blown-out narco-rock and new wave in the space of two releases. Likewise, in just a year, Watson's solo alter ego GUM has hot-wired the grotty psych-pop of 2014's <i>Delorean Highway i</i>nto the block-party prog of sophomore effort, <i>Glamorous Damage</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What ultimately unites Watson's constellation of bands is a desire to divorce '60s psychedelia from period details and infuse it with other temporally dislocated sounds, be it '70s art rock, '80s electro, or '90s lo-fi. Compared to Tame Impala's IMAX-scaled productions, </span><i>Glamorous Damage</i><span> is like the 8-bit, Nintendo videogame adaptation of a blockbuster film—an offshoot that can't possibly match the grandeur of its esteemed affiliate, but possesses a quirky charm all its own. And where Tame Impala's super-sized sound swaddles Parker's intimate lyricism, GUM's downsized dimensions can barely contain Watson's eccentric, multi-voiced personality.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Watson may double down on cheeky '80s signifiers here—arcade-game laser blasts, boombox beats, falsetto hooks, high-pitched cathode-ray frequencies—but they're the foundations that support his freakery, like the skull-piercing synth drone that overwhelms the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>ly funk of ""Anesthetized Lesson"". Where <i>Delorean Highway</i> featured a wobbly but ultimately faithful cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23101-genesis/"">Genesis</a>' 1980 pop crossover hit ""Misunderstanding"", <i>Glamorous Damage</i> deviously twists synth-pop until it turns into prog-rock: The brief opening snippet ""G.U.M."" introduces a budget <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> bass groove that reappears in extended form as ""R.Y.K."", where it ultimately serves as the canvas for a splatter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>ian synths and smeared guitar solos.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Glamorous Damage</i> succeeds so long as that impulsive energy is given enough space; when Watson stays locked in a single gear—like on the pastoral goth of ""Greens and Blues"", or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> Floyd reverie ""She Never Made It to Tell"" or the spoken-word title-track throwaway—the album stalls. Of course, even GUM's most fanciful gestures will feel modest next to Tame Impala's interstellar overdrive. But there's enough synthetic psychedelic splendor on <i>Glamorous Damage</i> to soundtrack a DIY planetarium laser show under the covers with tinted flashlights.</p></div>"|21324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21324-glamorous-damage/|6.7|Stuart Berman

Only 250 copies of the chamber-ambient ensemble's album were pressed when it was first released on vinyl in 2010. It reappears now, on New York's <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG Intl.</a>, as a sort of coda to last year's RVNG-released Bing &amp; Ruth album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19887-bing-ruth-tomorrow-was-the-golden-age/""><i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i></a>. That record, a luminous affair for piano, cello, clarinet, bass, and tape delay, was many listeners' first encounter with David Moore's group, so it makes sense the label would want to dust off a recording that most people never got the chance to hear.</p>
<p><i>City Lake </i>is very much of a piece with its successor, although there are subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences between the two. While <i>Tomorrow </i>utilized just seven players, <i>City Lake </i>features an 11-person ensemble—two clarinets, two cellos, two voices, bass, lap steel, tape delay, percussion, and piano—and the effect of the expanded lineup is notable. It's a fuller, richer sound with more definition. The piano leads the way, knocking out rapidly repeating chords that emphasize the instrument's percussive side, and the reeds, cello, and lap steel frequently twist into sturdy, vine-like shapes. <i>Tomorrow</i>, with its shimmering delay, has a wispier, more featherweight feel; <i>City</i> <i>Lake</i>, while still beautiful and tinged with melancholy,<i> </i>leaves more room for dissonance, and even flat-out chaos. If, already familiar with <i>Tomorrow</i>'s calm, cozy atmospheres, you turn to <i>City Lake </i>to soundtrack your next dinner party, maybe don't use the fine china: Your meal may take an unexpected turn some 40 minutes in, when the music explodes into a buzzing, squealing maelstrom of insistent crash cymbals and earsplitting glissandi.</p>
<p>Just like <i>Tomorrow</i>, <i>City Lake </i>is built upon exceedingly simple musical figures, but the results are anything but. Moore is often compared to American minimalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, and not without reason; he is fond of repeating patterns and stalwart pedal tones, and his chord progressions are usually content to stay in one place, shifting from foot to foot. And, just like Reich and Riley, Moore's own music doesn't easily square with a concept like minimalism. Immersed in the billowing harmonics of <i>City Lake</i>, you don't think of empty space, but of fullness. You don't think of absence, but of presence. The dominant motif of ""Broad Channel"" may be the piano's hollow open fifth, but the way he uses the rest of the instruments to color in that interval, you're left with the impression of a sound that can't be contained. </p>
<p>You feel it most in ""City Lake / Tu Sei Uwe"". Gentle piano chords, wreathed in glowing drones, create a sense of space that exists outside of time. The rhythm plays out only in the broadest of strokes, like the movement of waves. It builds imperceptibly, until, some 10 minutes in, cymbals and voices and a stream of gravelly feedback rise in a squall that, in the score, is notated as ""HEADACHE INDUCING LOUDNESS."" It might feel out of character for Bing &amp; Ruth; in fact, if you dropped in unawares, you might mistake the passage for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>. But it's over just as quickly as it's begun—a sudden cutoff, then silence. If <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> corresponds to what Erik Satie termed ""furniture music,"" <i>City Lake </i>is a glimpse at the raw materials before all the splinters have been sanded down—and it is all the more exciting for them.</p></div>"|21256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21256-city-lake/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

The movie attempts to speak on Chicago's heartbreaking gun violence and gang culture, but it's not so much a narrative as a succession of overwrought messages and ham-fisted editorializing bolstered with history and current-events lessons, heavy statistics, and too many ideas bogged down by rhyme in an ode to the source material, Aristophanes' Athenian comedy, ""Lysistrata"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The soundtrack doesn't fare much better. <span>Like the movie—whose trailers were met with head-scratching and </span><a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/chi-raq-controversy-spike-lee"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rebuttals from Chi-Town rappers across the board</a>—the music was met with controversy before even being released, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32657-dj-slugo/"">DJ Slugo</a>, a Chicago native working as the film's music supervisor, was discovered running <a href=""http://thirtyroses.com/2015/05/31/chicagos-dj-slugo-fired-from-spike-lee-film-for-pay-to-play-scheme-draws-attention-to-industry-wide-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an unnecessarily complex payola racket</a> for soundtrack placement. Upon getting caught, Slugo apologized, writing ""This is not the way Spike Lee nor his team operates and I take full responsibility for my bad decision,"" but the mini-scandal casts a harsh light over this collection.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>'s<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/""></a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/""><i>Compton: A Soundtrack</i></a>, which featured not many artists from its titular city, <i>Chi-Raq</i>'s original motion picture soundtrack is largely devoid of Chi-Town talent. The city's hip-hop elite—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"">Lupe Fiasco</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>—are nowhere to be found. Like wise, OG's like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"">Twista</a>, Crucial Conflict, and Shawnna are absent, and the new crop of progressive Chi-Town MC's—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32461-mick-jenkins/"">Mick Jenkins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30982-rockie-fresh/"">Rockie Fresh</a>—aren't here. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32308-vic-mensa/"">Vic Mensa</a> appears briefly in the movie as a hype man, but has no role in the soundtrack.) Most egregiously, save for a beat from Young Chop, there are no notables from the drill scene present—not <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a>, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33262-lil-herb/"">G Herbo</a>, or any of the other young talents who could have furthered dialogue about Chicago's horrendous and shameful bloodshed. The movie argues against intra-community crime through a lens of respectability politics—it all but ignores the systemic causes that have made the Windy City a war zone. The Chicago PD—currently under pressure for the cover up of Laquan McDonald's murder, not to mention Homan Square, its Guantanamo-like black site—is treated like an afterthought. Without an abundance of homegrown voices, nothing about <i>Chi-Raq</i> feels authentically Chicago.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some of the numbers seem picked from Lee's wishful thinking. Kevon Carter's ""WGDB"" (for ""we gotta do better,"" the de facto slogan of the respectability movement) is an incredibly sanctimonious string-and-keys lamentation replete with clunky (and false) observations like ""We're the only race that shoots and kills themselves"" and the laborious opening lines: ""Everybody's talkin' about brother Bill Cosby/ Looks like our favorite dad was drugging girls."" It's a song that would make sense within the context of a </span><i>Hamilton</i><span>-esque musical, but it's not presented in the film as a performance number—it just seems to be Lee believing his audience should be condescended to with simple answers to complex issues. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The disconnect is an extension of Lee's heavy-handed and off-center vision. Nick Cannon, who plays a gang member named Chi-Raq, comes through with two songs in character—the uplifting ""Pray 4 My City"" (whose lyrics are flashed across the film's opening credits with ebonicized spellings—dey, dat, dis, cuz, Lawd) and the Young Chop-produced thuggery-by-numbers of ""My City"". Both songs feel like they're trying to bring<i> Afterschool Specials</i> back. There's no true gravitas in any of it, and the only place where these songs fit is in Lee's movie, with its reliance on outdated tropes, such as a ridiculous preponderance of gang colors and a reference to Brooklyn as ""Bucktown"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not all bad. Treasure Davis' ""Simple"" is a sunny and bouncing number about on-and-off love; Sam Dew's ""Desperately"" is yearning, body-grinding boudoir music; Mali Music and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a>'s Caribbean-tinged ""Contradiction"" is perfectly tailored for break-up and reconciliation. When Mali sings ""If you say that it's over/ I won't die,"" you're not sure if he's coming or going, but it doesn't matter, because the song just works.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And here's a troubling thing: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a>—still one of the most <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/music/read-the-stomach-churning-sexual-assault-accusations-against-r-kelly-in-full-6637412"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reviled</a> and gifted artists in R&amp;B—comes through with the album's best song. It makes so much sense—Kelly is as much a Chi-Town icon as Michael Jordan, Barack Obama, or Oprah Winfrey. And ""Put the Guns Down"" is topically in line with movie's message, especially with a guest verse from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32024-tink/"">Tink</a>, who notes that kids are ""Fifteen, buying a tool/ Just to feel more safe when they gotta make it home from school."" It's targeted, but not pedantic and—most importantly—it's girded by a four-on-the-floor track that actually entertains. When R. Kelly sings, ""Just do your dance, get in your zone/ No, they can't take you out that,"" meaning and music come together as they do nowhere else on this album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And that's the state of </span><i>Chi-Raq</i><span>, a movie that uses a term for a city that no one in the city actually uses: a soundtrack about said city that uses very few voices from the despair it seeks to shed light upon. Its best number comes from guy who is all but a pariah in the urban community, which all but ensures that none of these messages are going reach the people who need to hear them most. And that may be the real tragedy here. </span></p></div>"|21305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21305-chi-raq-ost/|5.0|kris ex

Assessing the four studio albums they released between 1967 and 1970 on the Pitchfork scale is like measuring a yardstick. They were also a perpetually struggling touring rock group like any other, playing extended engagements at large and small clubs all over the East and West Coasts, often two shows a night, to an audience of people who mostly just wanted to dance. <i>The Complete Matrix Tapes</i> is a document of that side of the band: Supposedly, it's a collection of the 42 songs the band played in two nights at a 100-capacity San Francisco club, The Matrix, some of which formed the bulk of <i>1969: The Velvet Underground Live with Lou Reed</i> 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that the Velvet Underground were at their best on stage, and the high points of <i>The Complete Matrix Tapes</i> bear that out. The peculiarly thin sonics of Matrix owner Peter Abram's recordings don't do Maureen Tucker's caveman drumming any favors, but they make a serious case for Sterling Morrison as God-Emperor of Rhythm Guitarists. The first disc's magnificent ""What Goes On"", with Morrison and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>'s guitars chattering together at breathless speed while Doug Yule hammers at an organ, is the wellspring for, among other things, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4564-the-wedding-present/"">the Wedding Present</a>'s entire catalogue; ""Ocean"" is the seed and the soil for both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>. The version of the throwaway two-line rocker ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"" on disc two is utterly thrilling, and the hushed, droning ""Heroin"" later in that set is a solid 20 years ahead of its time. Both ""White Light/White Heat"" and ""I'm Set Free"" are much more dramatic and vivid here than in their studio incarnations.</p>
<p>That said, some of the <i>Matrix</i> box's extended vamps get draggy, and there's a lot of song duplication here: four versions <i>apiece</i> of ""Some Kinda Love"", ""Heroin"", and ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"", three apiece of ""There She Goes Again"" and ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", two apiece of seven others. But <i>The Complete Matrix Tapes</i> is useful as a way to hear how the Velvets constantly reworked their repertoire. Yule later said of Reed that ""there were times when he would invent or put together songs on the fly in a performance, and he'd just turn around and say, 'Follow me'"". The bizarre take on ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" that opens the box is slowed down to a crawling blues, extended to 13 minutes with some seemingly extemporaneous new verses; ""Lisa Says"", which the group had recorded in a studio just a month earlier, has almost totally rewritten lyrics and an entirely new bridge. Their most protean song, ""Sister Ray"", turns up in a relatively relaxed, noodly 37-minute performance that's far from its face-melting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18770-the-velvet-underground-white-lightwhite-heat/""><i>White Light/White Heat</i></a> incarnation.</p>
<p>This box isn't exactly a grand opening of the vaults: as nice as it is to have all this stuff in one place, less than a quarter of it hasn't been officially issued before, and it's not like there's a shortage of Velvet Underground live recordings that could stand to be released for real. On the other hand, you can think of <i>The Complete Matrix Tapes</i> as a greatly expanded, better-mixed version of <i>1969</i> with less perfect sequencing and four songs missing, and considered that way, it's a jewel with a chip knocked off its top. Elliott Murphy's liner notes for <i>1969—</i>written in 1972, when the Velvet Underground were still a commercial nonentity with an enthusiastic but tiny cult—imagined a kid a hundred years later, in a ""classical rock'n'roll class,"" listening to the Velvets and wondering what to make of them. We're close to halfway there now, and their place in the canon is secure, but we still haven't entirely figured them out.</p></div>"|21317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21317-the-complete-matrix-tapes/|8.5|Douglas Wolk

More focused than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18892-warpaint-warpaint/"">the last Warpaint record</a>, <i>right on</i><i>!</i> is subtle, with the softness and density of cashmere. It owes quite a bit to '80s and '90s goth-leaning college rock but thankfully never feels like a direct tracing thereof. It’s a good record for the winter, reflecting long nights, and the search for comfort and safety, the desire to wrap ourselves in layers.</p>
<p>Where <i>right on!</i> sticks its landings—which it does more often than it falters—it’s in the moments where Lindberg’s bass work drives her songwriting. ""boom boom"" is a constant, tense pulse, a stutter in the chest; ""never"" has a classic goth club-floor feel. ""bully"", with its central, just-vague-enough threat of ""I’m not playing around"", moves like a shadow behind a theater scrim. ""riot"" has noise and discord at its core, with Lindberg’s howl buried in the mix and played to perfectly disturbing effect. It’s easy to overplay your hand with horror, the line between terror and corniness divided by camp, but that watery scream is genuinely scary.</p>
<p>The couple of tracks that meander, though, are frustrating. ""blind"" is a bleak highway drive to nowhere. ""long lonely winter"" begins with promise, articulating the flatness of isolating depression with remarkable accuracy, but trails off in layers of synth and desert haze. ""he fresh"" feels more like sketch than song. But <i>right on! </i>is an immaculately produced record—again, not a surprise from a member of a relatively technical band known for their attention to detail. It’s rare to hear a solo album by a bass player that highlights that instrument’s primacy but doesn’t feel overly filigreed. The bass is the butt of jokes; the bass is the instrument people pick in movies when the other rock instruments are taken, and so bassists often feel like they have to overcompensate. Lindberg, thankfully, never falls into that trap. Her voice as an artist, as brought to highlight via production decisions, feels uncluttered and distinct.</p></div>"|21309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21309-right-on/|7.3|Jes Skolnik

The steady drone whipped up by the ship's vibrations quietly erupts into all manner of rustle and whirr—the bleeping of the navigation system, the hissing of steam vents, and countless quavering whines of uncertain provenance—until the entire world of the film feels cocooned inside an omnipresent hum.</p>
<p>That buzzing matrix is the subject of <i>Before Nostromo</i>, a new album by the German musician Stephan Mathieu. Mathieu has been working the seam between ambient, musique concrète, and microsound since the late '90s, running vintage acoustic instruments and obsolete media like wax cylinders through electroacoustic processing and digital treatments. Mathieu describes <i>Before Nostromo</i> as an homage to <i>Alien</i>'s sound design, and he has given the work a novel premise. Just prior to being awakened from hypersleep by the ship's computer, the film's seven characters—Ripley, Dallas, Parker, Lambert, Kane, Brett, and even Ash, the android—each have a dream. So does Jonesey the cat. Eight tracks, ranging from four minutes to nearly 20 minutes in length, represent those respective dreams. (A ninth, ""Anamorphosis"", rounds out the set; Mathieu suggests that it may be attributed to the <i>Nostromo</i>'s other passenger, the alien.)</p>
<p>To record the music, Mathieu used two large gongs, piano, and shortwave radio, but none of those elements are obvious from the sound of the music, which changes colors as imperceptibly as late-afternoon light. ""Entropic processes,"" like those Alvin Lucier used to create <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Am Sitting in a Room</a></i>, in which a spoken text gradually decays as it bounces back and forth between two reel-to-reel players, are key to the music's soft, rounded forms.</p>
<p>Using relatively modest means, Mathieu evokes a vast expanse. Rarely, though, do you hear a note being produced; sounds slink into being like shadows creeping across the wall, and they abscond just as imperceptibly. There's a brief tinkling, as of wind chimes, in ""Stasis 7 (Ash the Android's Dream)""; in ""Stasis 1 (Dallas' Dream)"" there's a sourceless tapping that reappears in ""Stasis 4 (Brett's Dream)"", as if Harry Dean Stanton's character were down in the engine room, banging away on pipes. Otherwise, though, everything is as soft and sanded down as a coastline worn smooth by the millennia. His abstracted shapes genuinely resemble dreams, albeit the memories of one from which you've just emerged tugging at the edges of your consciousness.</p>
<p><i>Before Nostromo </i>is best suited for deep listening. With so few obvious features to grasp on to, even after multiple plays you may not immediately be able to tell the difference between one ""dream"" and another. But that's hardly the point. These bottom-of-the-well fantasies are the headiest kind of echo-chamber music, fusing the unstable oscillations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1157-kevin-drumm/"">Kevin Drumm</a>'s <i>Imperial Horizon</i> and Folke Rabe's <i>What?!</i> with the soft spectral explosion of Ligeti's <i>Lux Aeterna </i>and the melancholy decay of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/""><i>Disintegration Loops</i></a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <i>Before Nostromo </i>is a digital-only release—a format that Mathieu has dedicated himself to with religious zeal, for reasons both economic and audiophile. The album takes the form of a 24-bit FLAC (the download also includes a beautifully designed PDF booklet designed by his wife, Caro Mikalef) and it sounds unusually sumptuous, with a richness—dynamic, timbral, spatial—that is all too rare in digital music. Spend some time with Mathieu's gorgeous, absorbing tribute, and then return to <i>Alien</i>, and you may find yourself hearing the film as you never have before.</p></div>"|21313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21313-before-nostromo/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

Bruce Springsteen’s fifth album gushes forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. Coming after the deliberate twin masterpieces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Born to Run</i></a> and <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i>, records epic in scope but precise in execution, <i>The River</i> not only appears to be a mess but embodies the classic definition of a double album: it seems to be a clearinghouse for every song Bruce Springsteen had at the ready in 1980. <i>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</i> shows just how wrong that assumption is. Expanding the original 20-song double album to a 4xCD set supplemented with video, it laughs at the notion that the original album was much too much by underscoring exactly how Springsteen intended the album to overwhelm.</p>
<p>Initially, Springsteen planned to follow 1978’s <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> with an album called <i>The Ties That Bind</i> but he withdrew the record in the fall of 1979, believing that it wasn’t ""big enough."" This claim came from the stage during a 2009 performance of <i>The River</i> at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce going on to say, ""I wanted to capture the themes that I’d been writing about on <i>Darkness</i>. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added the music that made our live shows so much fun and enjoyable for our audience."" On this box, the scrapped <i>The Ties That Bind</i> gets an official airing as the third disc on the set—here it’s dubbed <i>The River [Single Album]</i>—and it does indeed play like a truncated, miniature version of <i>The River,</i> containing in its 10 tracks seven of the double-album’s songs, along with two alternate versions of tunes that wound up on the released record. What’s striking is what’s absent: shorn of its party songs, the record feels gloomy and haunted—even ""You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)"" in a lonesome Sun rockabilly incarnation feels like a transmission from the lonely black of night. It reiterates many of the themes of <i>Darkness</i>, only without aggression, fury, or precision, the very things that give that record a lift that fights against its undercurrents of hopelessness.</p>
<p>Surely recognizing this deficit, Springsteen spent roughly another year in the studio, reviving old songs and writing new ones, arriving at full-blown, completed recordings of most of these tunes, then picking and choosing from his surplus to create the final album. The result was enough material for <i>another</i> double album, presented here as <i>The Ties That Bind</i>, a collection that runs two songs longer the 1980 double-LP but winds up six minutes shorter. This is an absurd amount of shelved material—and, even with this abundance, there are a handful of bootlegged cuts that didn’t make the grade. There’s a lot of unheard music here, even if some tracks are colored with new Bruce vocals, a slightly sour grace-note that is only notable upon close inspection.</p>
<p>Listening through the box, it’s hard not to be struck by Springsteen’s labor-intensive creative method. He knew the broad outline of what he wanted to achieve, so he kept tweaking his material in the studio, rearranging and recording until he found just the right emotion. If <i>The Cutting Edge 1965–1966</i> proves how Bob Dylan sought to capture the lightning of a live performance, Springsteen always is seduced by the illusion of a <i>record</i>: sure, he’s invigorated by live performance—and the Tempe concert included here is tremendous, the E-Street Band at the peak of their power—but he sculpts his albums out of tracks that are powerful as recordings, not simply songs.</p>
<p>This is especially true of <i>The River</i>, which Bruce loaded up with the purest, hardest, and happiest rock’n’roll the E-Street Band ever cut in the studio. ""She’s the One"" pulsated to a beat borrowed from Bo Diddley and <i>Darkness</i> surged with desperate passion, but Bruce’s first four records rarely touched on the ecstatic joy that can be had from just making noise. <i>The River</i> is full of these moments (""Sherry Darling"", ""Crush on You"", ""I’m a Rocker"", ""Cadillac Ranch""), and some of the weightier items trade in this same sense of exuberance—a sense of desperation cuts against the grain of the sunny hook on ""Hungry Heart"", and ""Two Hearts"" spins headfirst into unfettered romanticism. But this music is so simple, so visceral, that it’s often been tagged as throwaway, the detritus surrounding the haunting ""The River"", ""The Price You Pay"", and ""Stolen Car"".</p>
<p>Thing is, these throwaways give <i>The River</i> its cinematic scope. Some of the newer additions were cut from a familiar forlorn cloth (""Independence Day"", the closing pair of ""Drive All Night"" and ""Wreck on the Highway"") while ""Point Blank"" and ""Jackson Cage"" split the difference between the celebration and sorrow. But the biggest distinction between <i>The River</i> and the original <i>Ties That Bind</i> is this full-on bash, funny and furious and entirely sincere in its worship of the sounds rocking frat houses and AM radio in a '60s that didn’t belong to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>. It’s the Springsteen album that can easily slip onto any show on Little Steven’s Underground Garage, and this party winds up providing an ideal counterpoint to the sweeter, sadder moments on <i>The River</i>.</p>
<p>Take the second side, which opens with ""Hungry Heart""—Bruce’s first genuine hit single, reaching number five on a combination of its hook and Springsteen’s general momentum—then dwells upon the cinematic escape ""Out in the Street"" and serves up two breakneck rockers before settling into the dreaminess of ""I Wanna Marry You"" and the stark ""The River"", the latter two hitting harder due to the companions. Each side is structured similarly, with the last song tipping slightly toward melancholy, the cumulative effect suggesting there’s no separating pleasure from the pain. It all comes at once and, depending on mood, <i>The River</i> either seems like the happiest or saddest of Bruce’s records: in its mess lies a mirror that reflects the listener’s state of mind.</p>
<p><i>The Ties That Bind</i> illustrates this sprawl was no accident. Within these 22 rejects—some of them sneaking out as B-sides or on previous reissues, including the 1998 box <i>Tracks</i> and the bonus disc on 2003’s <i>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</i>—Springsteen explores the same terrain as he does on <i>The River</i>: urban romance, accidental violence, working-man’s blues, and restless nights. Like its parent, <i>The Ties That Bind</i> achieves a delicate balance between adult despair and adolescent freedom: he may dwell upon ""Little White Lies"" and ""The Time That Never Was"", but he also borrows a song title from Claudine Clark (""Party Lights"") and tips a hat to Connie Francis’ beach classic <i>Where the Boys Are</i> (""Where the Bands Are""). Enough great songs didn’t make a cut that it’s possible to cobble together a killer single album from the outtakes—one that would open with the breathless ""Meet Me in the City"" and contain the cloistered paranoia of ""The Man Who Got Away"", the blank desperation of ""Roulette"", the open-hearted ""Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own"" and ""From Small (Big Things One Day Come)"", a heightened Chuck Berry story song Bruce turned over to Dave Edmunds. But like the completed album, what resonates is the magnitude of the sprawl itself.</p>
<p>As they spill out, the songs play off each other, accentuating the sorrow or celebration heard in their predecessors. Combing through these outtakes, it quickly becomes clear how Springsteen, Van Zandt, and Jon Landau constructed each track to deliver its own specific visceral thrill and then culled through their finished product to find the cuts that fit their intended design. Some of these rejects rely on that headstrong old time rock’n’roll—""Living on the Edge of the World"" bops along to its syncopated swing, ""Paradise by the C"" is a roadhouse jam highlighting Clarence Clemons—but others play like ripostes to the E-Street Band’s peers: the live ""Held Up Without a Gun"" (which would later morph into the finished ""You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)"") careens like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25170-elvis-costello-the-attractions/"">Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions</a>, the chiming guitars of ""Take ’Em As They Come"" seem like an answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9634-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/"">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</a>, while ""I Wanna Be With You"" pulses to the Iron City rush of Joe Grushecky &amp; the Houserockers.</p>
<p>Thirty-five years after the release of <i>The River</i>, it’s easy to think of Bruce Springsteen as existing on a separate plane from such contemporary kindred spirits or perhaps as somebody who only belongs to part of a self-styled lineage that runs through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody Guthrie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>. By adding <i>The Times That Bind</i>, both the scrapped '79 LP and this new double-disc collection of outtakes, to <i>The River</i>, this box highlights the plain, prosaic ways he belonged to his time. On these 52 songs, Springsteen sings about gas shortages, cold beer, unemployment agencies, busted dreams, and Burt Reynolds, fleeting images of a blue collar America that unknowingly was entering its decay but these words are married to the sound of a working band that knows it has to work, aware that it has to have songs to fuel those marathon three hour shows.</p>
<p>Springsteen never really let these straight-up rockers be part of his records again—maybe on <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, but both ""Darlington County"" and ""Working on the Highway"" end in tears—but he also never quite worked the same way again, producing such a ridiculous surplus of finished material as he set out on his quest for bigger, greater things. <i>The River</i> brought Bruce to those heights, giving him his first number one album and Top 10 single, but it’s hard not to think of it as not a beginning but an end, the last record where he and the E-Street Band were not the biggest band in the land but merely the best. In that light, piling on a ton of unreleased music, all in the same spirit and feel as the final album and nearly as good as what made the cut, feels like a gift. And for those who may think four CDs and three DVDs are too much, consider this: for an album that is all about contradictions, excess and mess, more of everything is most certainly a good thing.</p></div>"|21306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21306-the-ties-that-bind-the-river-collection/|8.7|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

One night, my friend was at a party in the Bay Area when McCombs showed up with a guest. It was a real punk-rock party. (My friend remembers overhearing someone insist that what people didn't understand about the American Revolution was that the American Revolution was still going on.) My friend was sitting on the porch when McCombs and his guest came out to leave. He said McCombs looked like he was about to cry. Not in a remarkable way, but like about-to-cry was his resting face. ""Well,"" McCombs said to his guest, ""we were just two sweaters at a sweatshirt party."" They left without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>This was about 15 years ago, before McCombs had released his first album (the enigmatically titled <i>A</i>), but the sweater bit was prophetic. McCombs is one of those artists who looks out of place no matter where you put him. His biography says he was born in Concord, Calif., but it seems hard to say where he's from (in the metaphorical sense) or even where he lives (in the utility-bill one). He has no attachment to any particular scene, and though he has collaborated with a hundred unrelated artists over the last decade—including a producer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"">Adele</a> (Ariel Rechtshaid), the bass player from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24159-phish/"">Phish</a> (Mike Gordon), and an Academy Award–nominated actress (the late Karen Black)—he often appears to be totally alone, a tumbleweed drifting through the interior of nowhere. Characters in Cass McCombs songs are executioners, truck drivers, lifelong bachelors who treat liquor as their personal ticket to the moon and other people for whom being alone is not the product of bad luck but of religious election. At one point he only answered interview questions through the mail.</p>
<p>The style of McCombs' music differs from album to album but all shares a low-key American spirit that joins the personal freedom of '60s counterculture with the reticence of late-'90s indie rock—cowboy music for people with a lot of library fines. As a writer, he has a trickster's gift for resignation: He makes misery seem funny and his ability to control it seem smart. (This is why I tell the ""sweater"" story: Half because it presents McCombs as a loner, half because it presents him as someone with the ability to understand his solitude so well that he can turn it into a joke that connects with other people. )</p>
<p>His most recent album is a B-sides and outtakes collection called <i>A Folk Set Apart</i>. It covers 2003 to 2014, from <i>A</i> through the Wild West epic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18612-cass-mccombs-big-wheel-and-others/""><i>Big Wheel and Others</i></a>. On it you will hear songs that resemble garage-punk (""A.Y.D.""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> ballads (""Bradley Manning""), nursery rhymes (""Three Men Sitting on a Hollow Log""), and stretches of recorded sound that people in the commuter pool would probably identify as non-music (""Texas"").</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about listening to McCombs is that he seems unafraid to make some really bad decisions. This is a man who once orchestrated a three-minute outro that sounds like a dog sleeping in a clarinet (""Memory's Stain"") and interrupted an otherwise beautiful song to ask what it was like to shit in space (""Morning Star""). <i>A Folk Set Apart</i> is scattered by nature but it has some of these moments, too—moments in which some line or turn that at first sounds unnatural becomes a signal both of McCombs' quiet confidence and of his casual rebellion against the idea of how songs are supposed to go. It's easy to understand why he was fascinated with someone like Bradley—now <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea</a>—Manning, the trans woman dishonorably discharged from the Army and convicted of espionage for her relationship with WikiLeaks: Not only is Manning a modern variation on the American outlaw, but the turns in her life defy every extant script. </p>
<p>So start with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13180-catacombs/""><i>Catacombs</i></a>, or with the funereal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15343-wits-end/""><i>WIT'S END</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10768-dropping-the-writ/""><i>Dropping the Writ</i></a>. <i>Big Wheel</i> is good, too. They all are in their idiosyncratic, prickly little ways. If pop's goal is to forge a path of identification between artist and listener, McCombs is defiantly un-pop, a singer continually trying to figure out how to outpace his audience's comfort levels without driving them out of the room. In modern parlance, Cass McCombs didn't come here to make friends. Which is good. There are plenty of sweatshirts in the hamper if you want them. </p></div>"|21289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21289-a-folk-set-apart-rarities-b-sides-space-junk-etc/|7.0|Mike Powell

Cassie Ramone's collection of covers, however, forgoes the usual Christmassy spectacle; the songs on here are dark and harrowing in their interpretation. As gusts of wind introduce both the record and Ramone's drawling take on ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"", she immediately projects loneliness and isolation. As she sings ""The snow's comin' down/ I'm watchin' it fall,"" Ramone counteracts Darlene Love's powerful hopefulness in the original song with sheer hopelessness.</p>
<p>While she had some assistance from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> on bass and Jay Heiselmann in mastering on her first solo effort,<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19768-cassie-ramone-the-time-has-come/""><i>The Time Has Come</i></a></i>, this time Ramone, formerly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"">Vivian Girls</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28076-the-babies/"">the Babies</a>, is truly on her own<i>. <i>Christmas in Reno</i> </i>was recorded and mixed mostly by Ramone herself, rendering these covers with a vulnerable and intimate touch. Nothing is tight and structured per se, but everything is meticulously executed in order to reach its intended effect: portraying a despondence and loss of interest in life. Reverb guides Ramone's disturbed voice on her version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a>'s ""Wonderful Christmastime"", letting her pain linger. The track fades out with a wobbly wah-wah, leading into a haunting and fuzzy rendition of ""Blue Christmas"". ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" is tragically slurred and toward the end Ramone's recital of Bing Crosby's popular lyrics becomes indecipherable. </p>
<p>""Run Run Rudolph"" is probably the most upbeat thing here—it sounds like a rough DIY track, which Ramone accentuates with guileless yelping. But even ""Sleigh Ride"", possibly the chirpiest and most festive Christmas ditty of all time, feels haunted. Ramone zooms in on the ""you"" in the line ""It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,"" letting it linger with ache; she wants whoever ""you"" is to know how much they hurt her. Her memories of Christmases together with a former lover are too painful, but she tortures herself over and over, ending the song with a repeating ""you.""</p>
<p><i>Christmas in Reno</i> is uncomfortable to listen to—the tracks that you so often associate with being jolly are torn up into pieces and burned at the core. However, that's exactly Ramone's intention—to find the melancholy in a ""joyful time of year."" Bad things can happen to you no matter the time of year. She affirms this using Nat King Cole's ""The Christmas Song"", halfheartedly ending the record with a bleak ""Merry Christmas to you.""</p></div>"|21307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21307-christmas-in-reno/|7.1|Sarah Sahim

They had some precedent in far-out outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"" target=""_blank"">Faust</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"" target=""_blank"">This Heat</a>, who used studio technology, isolation, and willful primitivism to push their music to into extreme places. And, because they blended '70s experimentalism with elements of American underground punk music, they had distant cousins in post-rock groups, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"" target=""_blank"">Trans Am</a> (with whom they toured). Their vibe was very different, though. Tortoise was serene and vibey. Trans Am had a sense of humor. Laddio plowed down a different path altogether -- following common influences toward dark psychedelia and the occult.</p>
<p><i>Live and Unreleased </i>collects odds and ends pulled from Laddio Bolocko's archives, including rehearsal tapes, concert recordings, and a DVD's worth of grainy concert footage. These are hardly throwaways or fans-only ephemera, though. The set—which spans two CDs or three LPs—adds depth and dimension to the group's unfairly thin catalog, allowing a peek into the communal jamming and weeded-out home studio experimentation that drove the band's creative process.</p>
<p>Liner notes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a> drummer Kid Millions give insight into the quartet's brief, grubby existence. After relocating to Brooklyn from southern Illinois during the mid '90s, drummer Blake Fleming, guitarist Drew St. Ivany, and bassist Ben Armstrong found a low-rent practice/living space in then-blighted Dumbo that offered no shower, but allowed no-complaints all-hours music-making.</p>
<p>The 20-minute ""43 Minutes of (Excerpt)"" is drawn from this time and captures the trio finding its stylistic footing. They trance out big-time here, with Armstrong and St. Ivany plugging away at car alarm-style riffs on bass and keyboard while Fleming goes wild on the kit. The tape marked the emergence of an idea that would drive the band's later work—mainly, the skewing of the senses through high-volume repetition—and also possibly helped to win over saxophonist Marcus DeGrazia, who engineered the session and who would join the band full-time shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Looking for a change in scene, Laddio later decamped to an abandoned ski lodge in upstate New York. This period accounts for the collection's darker, more abstract material— where the band moved off the grid and completely into its own territory. Tracks like ""Catskills # 3"" and ""Catskills #5"" are full of alien melodies, haunting found sounds, and phantom piano tones. The music has an eerie energy to it, as if it wasn't so much being consciously written as channeled into existence. It's as if the quartet slipped down some strange Lovecraftian wormhole -- not so much in these sense that the music evokes horror, but that the band's druggy transcendence brings only disquiet and distance. After plotting out the material for their second record, <i>In Real Time</i>, Laddio ended its stay in the countryside and returned to Dumbo, where they landed in an even filthier crash pad. Not long after, the group called it quits. Armstrong and St. Ivany would go on to form the excellent trio, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10709-the-psychic-paramount/"" target=""_blank"">the Psychic Paramount</a> while Fleming would do a few off-and-on stints in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"" target=""_blank"">the Mars Volta</a> and perform in the band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1322-electric-turn-to-me/"" target=""_blank"">Electric Turn to Me</a>, along with DeGrazia.</p>
<p>Awesome as they were, it's hard to say that Laddio Bolocko has spawned many imitators. They were just too obscure. Millions' band, Oneida, embraced similar ideas and sounds, but the drummer admits that during Laddio's lifetime, even he had never heard of the band. But it would be hard to replicate the quartet's magic, anyway.</p>
<p>Laddio toured extensively throughout its existence and the live recordings included here—six songs taped during a performance in Slovenia—provide the some of the set's most compelling material. On stage, the band's strange and diverse ideas gel together perfectly. The songs are otherworldly, but visceral. The quartet performs with intensity and shared purpose that seems somehow paranormal, nudging out of their regular songs into unknown territory, searching out an ecstatic state. </p></div>"|21283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21283-live-and-unreleased-1997-2000/|7.8|Aaron Leitko

The economic, cultural, and political situation in the newly independent African country had been sliding downward since the mid-'70s, but at one point the label had been a beacon for the country. Sékou Touré, perceiving that creating a strong national identity for the one-time French colony hinged on developing its culture, established a record label and a national radio station, distributing instruments to citizens and funding bands. The imperative was for the young nation of Guineans to create the voice of a new Africa.</p>
<p>The sound that Syliphone promoted was an astonishing, elegant blend, embracing old Guinean folk music as well as newly heard Cuban music (by way of the Congo) and American jazz bands, all under the banner of ""authenticité"". In an ideal world, proponents of small government and shuttered arts programs might hear the twinkling, beguiling music rendered by Guinea bands like Bembeya Jazz National, Jardin De Guinée, Balla et Ses Balladins and be charmed into state sponsorship of the arts so as to ""Make (<i>insert country</i>) Great Again."" By 1976, Guinea was in turmoil, with a failed assassination plot on Sékou Touré, and detention of political dissenters. Some of the strongest music from Syliphone predates this struggle, but that's part of what makes <i>Musique Sans Paroles</i> (translation: Music Without Words), released that same year, such a jewel: Amid increasing unrest, <i>Sans Paroles</i> serves as an oasis.</p>
<p>This compilation documents some of the label’s lesser known acts: Only one of them, alto saxophonist Momo Wandel, has more than one release to his name. Given the turmoil of Guinea, it’s likely that many of these groups never got the chance to record again. Opening band Sombory Jazz most closely resembles the flagship acts of the imprint, the rhythm shuffling between African polyrhythms and Cuban rhumba without quite settling. The horn work evokes comparison to Bembeya Jazz National, the guitar solo imbued with that rippling, eddying guitar tone so prevalent in the era, liquid and psychedelic at once. But from there,<i> Sans Paroles</i> explores little-heard wrinkles. Wandel’s ""Tam-Tam Sax"" emulates Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango but with squawks that bring to mind spiritual jazz players like Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp.</p>
<p>Each song shows a stylistic shift. The seldom-recorded Quintette Guinéenne does a rhythm &amp; blues number on ""Douga"", while ""Flute Parlante"" is as close as the album gets to words. Highlighting solo flute, it brings to mind the recordings that the old Folkways Records used to document. The highlight is Quintette Guinéenne’s second contribution, ""Massane Cissé"". A Griot thought to date back to the 12th-13th century, it exemplifies Sékou Touré’s mission to update his country’s traditions in the new century. Between the extended guitar solo and battery of percussion, it brings to mind the exploratory psychedelic rock happening across the Atlantic Ocean. Trio Papa Kouyaté, named and propelled by Miriam Makeeba’s longtime conga player, offers up two nimble acoustic numbers with Kouyaté shadowed by stand-up bass and acoustic guitar. Kouyaté’s conga playing hints at Arsenio Rodriguez’s groups of the 1950s. Close your eyes and the capital of Conakry starts to turn into downtown Havana. Or, in the case of ""Massane Cissé"", the epicenter of San Francisco a decade prior.  </p></div>"|21280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21280-musique-sans-paroles/|7.7|Andy Beta
