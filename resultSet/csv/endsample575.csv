After the dissolution of the Smiths, Moz was, quite oddly, tipped by many to struggle without his longtime songwriting partner and bandmate Johnny Marr; he wasted no time proving them wrong, releasing his debut solo single, ""Suedehead"", just over two months after the final Smiths single. It became his biggest hit to that point, the first of four consecutive UK top-10 singles, and, with ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", one of the tentpoles of his outstanding solo debut, <i>Viva Hate</i>.</p>
<p>And then the wheels fell off. Morrissey began what was to be his follow-up album, <i>Bona Drag</i>, surrounded by acrimony and litigation. He had fallen out with producer Stephen Street, plus former Smiths bandmates Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke-- all of whom had played key roles in that successful string of hits. The breakup of his partnership with Street was the most devastating: He had co-written all of <i>Viva Hate</i> and served as an unofficial mentor for Morrissey's early solo years, performing on records and playing several instruments.</p>
<p>Amidst the rubble of these personal relationships, Morrissey issued his fifth single, ""Ouija Board, Ouija Board"", a relative commercial failure that was so critically savaged that <i>Bona Drag</i>'s progress was abruptly halted. When Morrissey did finally return to recording, he contrasted the trifling, almost-novel morbidity of ""Ouija Board"" with two dark, excellent, descriptive, and quite underrated singles about outsiders-- ""November Spawned a Monster"" (about a disabled girl) and ""Piccadilly Palare"" (a young male prostitute). It was a brief recovery: Morrissey's second proper album, 1991's <i>Kill Uncle</i>, still turned out to be a dud. (A move to L.A. and into more muscular rock thankfully soon kickstarted the second phase of his solo career.)</p>
<p>As a title, if not a studio creation, <i>Bona Drag</i> was rescued in 1990 and issued as a compilation record piecing together that first run of seven singles-- six of the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
m rich and eclectic and rightly beloved, one of them the song that derailed his progress. And without the weight of being an A-side, buried in the middle of the record, even ""Ouija Board"" comes off as charming. The seven B-sides chosen from the era were well-selected, too. Five are as good as their A-sides: the elegant (albeit edited version of) ""Will Never Marry"", ""Yes, I Am Blind"" (ironically introspective considering its title), ""Such a Little Thing Makes Such a Big Difference"" (not surprisingly well-detailed considering its title), and the archly humorous ""Disappointed"" and ""Hairdresser on Fire"".</p>
<p>The compilation was a reminder of how fruitful this period of Morrissey's career had been when he needed it most. Despite a brilliant three-year solo run, coming right off the back of his seminal work with the Smiths, <i>Bona Drag</i> was issued into a rapidly shifting UK music scene. Mancunian music in particular was drastically changing, going from the miserablism, soul-searching, and spikiness of post-punk and the Smiths to the rolling rhythms and textures of the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. The years covered by <i>Bona Drag</i> coincided directly with the crossover of acid house and subsequent emergence of Madchester, a hopeful injection of youth, optimism, and hedonism, traits met with suspicion if not outright hostility in Morrissey's worldview. Moz was instead often writing songs about England's past-- whether the dissolution of key facets of its national identity in ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", decades-old gangsters in ""The Last of the Famous International Playboys"", or out-of-fashion slang in ""Piccadilly Palare""-- while the generation behind him was re-writing UK indie's future.</p>
<p>The hook on this reissue of <i>Bona Drag</i> is the addition of six previously unreleased tracks (though three-- an early version of ""At Amber"" called ""The Bed Took Fire""; ""Let the Right One Slip In""; and ""Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness"", given to Sandie Shaw-- have been issued in other forms.) In sum, the songs are a nice addition to the Morrissey catalog, all worth hearing though none perhaps necessary. In a career of odd reissues and collections, however, they at least make a welcome addition to this 20th anniversary release-- all genuine curiosities for completists that will please non-fans.</p>
<p>Even without those additions, this would be one of the most complete and necessary compilations in rock history, working both as a functional and utilitarian way to catch up with Morrissey outside of the UK and as a way to re-assess him within it. That the latter needed doing in the face of these songs is frankly mind-blowing.</p></div>"|14737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14737-bona-drag-20th-anniversary-edition/|9.8|Scott Plagenhoef

After throwing her hat in the nu-goth ring with last year's debut full-length, <i>The Spoils</i>, <i>Valusia</i> comes as the third release Nika Roza Danilova has given us this year-- two EPs plus a noisy collaboration with LA Vampires. Thankfully, Zola Jesus here<span> return to the best of those records, the</span> <i>Stridulum </i><span>EP,</span><i> </i>which found the band pushing for something both forceful and accessible;<i> Valusia</i> follows the same formula, upping the emotional ante with stirring pop ballads and mascara-smeared anthems. All this, and it only accounts for four of the 10 new songs we've heard from her in 2010. For someone who is already having one hell of a year (she also just completed her undergraduate degree and turned 21), you wouldn't suspect that the addition of those four songs-- three of which have already appeared on an expanded, import-only edition of <i>Stridulum</i>-- would make much of a difference. But here we are.</p>
<p><i>Valusia</i> kicks in the door with a pair of tracks that rank among her most dynamic. Opener ""Poor Animal"" ratchets up the intensity, taking a simple 4/4 drumbeat and riding it over it aching synths and a shimmering final act where a single violin (courtesy of Cult of Youth's Christiana Key) leads the driving build. It's a triumphant first impression, illuminated by Danilova's tide-shifting wail. ""Tower"" can't quite outmuscle ""Poor Animal"" (and not for lack of trying), but it more clearly demonstrates where Danilova sees herself right now. Played out like part of a tortured Rapunzel fantasy, its industrial lurch and rising, orchestral synths are sapped of their charge only when backdropped against her towering vocal. Dropping everything but a spare drum, she sings, ""And it feels like I'm the only one."" This isn't the first time Danilova has explored feelings of isolation, but here it's a striking, confusing moment: How could someone who sounds like she has a fucking army behind her feel so alone?</p>
<p>The two ballads that make up the rest of <i>Valusia</i> further explore that tumult, with Danilova left with more questions than answers. On the Zippo-friendly ""Sea Talk"", she's tired and unable to provide someone with what they need; on the aching, candelabra-lit piano piece ""Lightsick"", she's left wondering what happens ""when the lights go out on us."" It's unclear if the question is philosophical, or in the romantic sense, far more literal. What is clear is how fragile and intimate it all sounds, and what rich, elegant pop songs these songs all prove to be.</p>

Using his deep, hushed voice, acoustic guitar, and smattering of electronic textures, his mix of dusky, introverted soft-focus indie-pop and ambient textures bring to mind flickering, aged film footage. This trend continues on <i>Lasted</i>, Meluch's third full-length under the name. The songs here share sonic concerns, but have no specific or overriding theme connecting them. <i>Lasted</i> sounds like a well-curated collection of miniatures that Meluch had stored away for later use, dusting them off and presenting them together when they felt ready. But it also feels like it's best experienced whole.</p>
<p>Indeed, what makes <i>Lasted</i> feel more complete than Meluch's previous records is how he weaves his interstitial tone pieces within the fabric of the more straightforward, poppier material. On 2006's <i>Précis</i> and 2008's <i>Temper</i>, those interludes seemed to exist solely to provide sonic variety; here, it's hard to imagine some of these songs without their lead-ins or fade-outs, like the way the crackling vinyl stop of opener ""Purse Discusses"" introduces ""Sault""'s metric guitar lines. And some of the connecting threads are particularly subtle, like the rattling field recording that segues the title track into the stately interlude ""Weird Door"", for example. The album invites you to listen closely.</p>
<p>Production details aside, Meluch's songwriting has never been stronger. He's always had a way with glowing melodies-- 2007's underlooked single ""Fir"" certainly proved as much-- and they're equally present here. The easy-moving gait of ""A Coin on the Tongue"" suits Meluch's clear, shy vocals perfectly, while he's buried under beds of tickled piano and subtle drone on ""Fluoresce"". You can't make out a lot of what he's saying throughout the record, but the words still seem personal, somehow; <i>Lasted</i> is one of those albums whose meaning will shift depending on what you bring to the listening experience.</p>
<p>For those drawn to dark, hermetic, electro-acoustic folk, this is comfort food, and its familiarity is exactly what makes this music so compelling. In an interview with <i>The Village Voice</i> a few years back, Panda Bear said that he'd written ""Ponytail"", the beautifully simple closing track from 2007's <i>Person Pitch</i>, multiple times over the years leading up to the album's release. He also said that he'd probably never stop writing that song over and over again, and he sounded happy about that prospect. I suspect that Thomas Meluch might feel something similar in his music, and the results haven't lost their charm yet.</p></div>"|14735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14735-lasted/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Is Nellie McKay losing her edge, or is she just feeling blue? Just a few short years after her debut, which she recorded as a precociously talented and knowing young woman, she sounds a bit weary on her fifth full-length, the scattered and distracted <i>Home Sweet Mobile Home</i>. It may be her most intensely, intently melancholy album yet, which actually sounds promising: Under her perky persona McKay has always hidden a prickly disposition, and the witty dissonance between her wry lyrics and her spry, eclectic music implied a gleefully subversive mission. In that regard, she's always been as much an acolyte of Randy Newman as of Doris Day, despite fêting the latter on last year's solid covers album, <i>Normal as Blueberry Pie</i>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On <i>Home Sweet Mobile Home</i>, however, she hits that balance like it's an obligatory stance, such that these songs sound best when she's at her most miserable and lags whenever she breaks her funk for another genre foray. The opening track introduces the album's rainy-day tone: ""Bruise on the Sky"" is a melancholy rumination on depression, as she mistakes dark clouds for rainbows. On the bridge McKay sounds like she might even be addressing her younger self: ""I used to think about it, and by 'think' I mean 'satirize.'"" The ""it"" she's talking about-- lost loves? unspoken regrets? bad politics?-- is left intentionally vague, but the overcast dejection in her voice conveys the specificity of her emotional state if not her predicament, and even rhyming ""follow"" with ""Charo"" can't cheer her up.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As a songwriter, McKay's mischievous sensibility has always been her greatest asset, and the smarty-pants songs on <i>Home Sweet Mobile Home</i> allude not only to the cuchi-cuchi of the Spanish-American actress but also to Mussolini and the French Revolution. McKay wields a sharp wit and deep knowledge of 20th-century pop culture, which certainly enlivens the album, yet her vocals often fail these songs, sounding somewhat distant and detached-- either too cool or too blue. The hiccups at the end of ""Dispossessed"" sound rehearsed, and ""¡Bodega!"" sounds like a nervous dress rehearsal. It's as if
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
the melancholy of ""Bruise on the Sky"" and the lovely lament ""Coosada Blues"" has pervaded every song, with little regard for whether it demands that tone.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">McKay is just as eclectic musically as she is lyrically, with forays into reggae (""Caribbean Time"") and New Orleans jazz (""Dispossessed"") along with asides to dinner theater and merengue. In the past, such genre excursions have commented cleverly on her lyrics, but too often these trappings sound like errand running-- obligatory and largely uninteresting, with few specifics to color the settings as uniquely McKay. While the lite-disco funk of ""No Equality"" suits her just fine, the arrangements on ""Caribbean Time"" and ""Unknown Reggae"" might sound right at home on Willie Nelson's failed reggae album from 2005-- or anyone's failed reggae album for that matter. The end result is an album that sounds believably, prevasively downhearted, nodding to our expectations of Nellie McKay even if the woman herself no longer sounds like she believes them.</p>

But since then, it has, by and large, grown into a respectable musical genre. Plenty of unreformed misanthropes call black metal home, but groups like Darkthrone and Emperor have entered the underground metal canon, and bands jump on corporate-sponsored bills without shocking anyone. So the existence, and the popularity, of Sweden's Watain feels like something of a wild-North throwback. If Watain aren't genuinely terrifying people, they've worked hard to keep that hidden. The band is notorious for throwing buckets of actual pig blood at their audiences, and for keeping the rotting heads of animals on pikes as part of their stage set. Frontman Erik Danielsson has worn the same t-shirt at nearly every one of the band's live shows, and that shirt must be the single nastiest, most disease-ridden shirt on the planet at this point. When asked how he felt about his Nazi black metal peers, Danielsson once basically answered that they're not evil <i>enough</i>, that they can't tap into the ""insanity and perversion"" that the genre is supposed to represent.</p>
<p>It's one thing to claim allegiance to Satan and slather yourself in corpse paint; it's quite another to share tour-van real estate with actual animal remains to get that point across. So credit Watain with going that extra mile. There's something at once unsettling and anachronistically charming to their over-the-top devotion to squalor and Satanism. And even if all these disgustingly theatrical tricks don't reflect directly on their music, it's impossible to forget all these little factoids when you're listening to the band. It certainly helps that they're very good at what they do. Black metal, at its finest, conjures images of a roiling, freezing, Lovecraftian chaos that can't easily be put into words. And Watain attack the fundamentals of their genre with absolute conviction. But they also undermine its rigor in subtle ways, finding room for actual catchiness in the all-out assault.</p>
<p>Watain were at their best on their last album, 2007's <i>Sworn to the Dark</i>, a windy blast of bile that sounded absolutely beautiful when I was in a very particular sort of mood. That album relied on the fundamentals of its genre (bloodcurdling screams, mosquito-buzz guitars, relentless double-bass drum assault), but it did it with style and atmosphere, and it carved out room for some memorable chanted choruses. I probably won't ever forget how perfect it sounded during a particularly hellish New York City Christmas shopping expedition. <i>Lawless Darkness</i> attempts to push that approach into something even bigger and possibly more accessible, but it stumbles a bit where its predecessor thrived. The cleaner production feels more compressed and less immersive, like they're attempting to bludgeon you with sheer loudness rather than suck you into their universe. Some of the touches, like the howling-wolf sound effects on the intro to ""Wolves Curse"", are just sillier than they need to be. The long songs blur into each other more than they used to. The whole thing feels like a step back for a band that was in a rare zone last time around.</p>
<p>Still, judged on its own merits, this is pretty powerful stuff. Occasionally, the band hits levels of all-out ferocity so absurd that they actually sound pretty. Danielsson has a truly great black-metal voice, a ravaged and demonic back-of-the-throat gargle that only occasionally says anything I can decipher (""Rivers of blood! Rivers of blood!""). When they chant, ""Hail! Beelzebub!"" on ""Four Thrones"", they sound like they mean it, which somehow makes the whole thing more fun. These freaks still know what they're doing, even if they're just treading bloody water this time around.</p></div>"|14741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14741-lawless-darkness/|6.2|Tom Breihan

Written during Dylan's punchline-prone Christian era, ""Pressing On"" is notable for its cutting, lucid assessment of the human condition in the second verse: ""Temptation's not an easy thing/ Adam given the devil reign/ Because he sinned I got no choice/ It run in my vein."" Antony handles those words with weepy verve, as though the realization of his doom is as strangely liberating as it is terrifying. During ""Imagine"", he trades Lennon's imperative edicts for a personal past tense: ""Imagine there's no Heaven/ It was easy when I tried,"" he sings, recasting that famed gambit. By the time the song, which closes the EP, sublimates into a noisy infinity, you've realized the extent of Antony's despair: He's imagined our way out of hate and self-destruction, but our own myths and hang-ups might finally hang us all. Our beliefs won't save us; rather, they might end us. On <i>Swanlights</i>, his most diverse and possibly most demanding album to date, we listen as Antony searches for some sort of reset button, in spite of our proclivities.</p>
<p><i>Swanlights</i> is neither Antony's most immediate nor best album. It lacks its singular masterpiece, its ""Cripple and the Starfish"", ""Hope There's Someone"", or ""Aeon"". What's more, the album's half-dozen stylistic shifts show that, maybe for the first time, one of music's most assured stylists might be a bit unsettled. From romping single ""Thank You for Your Love"" to the tortured ""The Spirit Was Gone"", from the whirlwind ""Salt Silver Oxygen"" to the fastidiously restrained ""The Great White Ocean"", <i>Swanlights</i> is willfully uneven. ""Flétta"", Antony's much-buzzed duet with Björk, is indeed a mesmerizing composition, with fits and starts that coil suddenly into crescendo. It's a late-album distraction, too, a concession to an idol that would've fit better as a B-side. As quickly as <i>Swanlights</i> can attract its audience, it can also repel. Across three records and a few dozen collaborations, Antony's seemed an uncanny puppet master of grace; <i>Swanlights</i>, however, wobbles.</p>
<p>Despite those shortcomings, <i>Swanlights</i> might be Antony's richest album yet, with musical and thematic charms that take their time to take their hold. It's a brilliantly composed and played record, with the Johnsons responding exquisitely to Antony's production and the arrangements of young talents like Nico Muhly and Maxim Moston. During ""I'm in Love"", Antony whirls above calliope organ and Greg Cohen's aggressive upright bass, the drums adding a broken trot that suggests extreme heart flutter. On ""Swanlights"", he warps his voice through backmasking and distortion, highlighting the torture of the subject-- <i>Swanlights</i> is the name of a polar bear once killed for dog food, as pictured on the album's cover-- by singing against and around himself. Antony continues to link himself with what he sees as a dying natural world, the martyr tying himself to the stake he claims the most. The love and sadness of which he sings, then, are more meaningful than they might first appear; as on last year's <i>The Crying Light</i>, Antony's talking about the end of everything, not just himself.</p>
<p>A limited edition of <i>Swanlights</i> comes bound by 144 pages of Antony's paintings, sketches, scribbles, and collages. In the artist's statement that closes the book, Antony writes, ""I don't want your future. I hope when I die, that I never return to your world. I will go where the trees go.... Gut me with sticks and stuff my body full of lavender crystals."" Nearly all of <i>Swanlights</i>' tracks play heavily on some sort of end-- death in two of the first five songs, spiritual or physical molting in two of the first seven, sleep to dream in the title track, the way that mid-album instrumental lingers, unresolved. But none of these ends are ultimate. Antony's death in ""The Great White Ocean"" grants him eternity with his family and the earth, while the exit in ""Ghost"" frees snakes and specters from their hosts. Ends are means to beginnings. The visual art reflects a quest for similar renewal. A blot of wonderful, vibrant pink, for instance, explodes from a dull, morose block of black, and a penciled supercontinent politely imposes itself atop a photo of seemingly endless ocean. A time-damaged newsprint photo of Kurt Cobain gets new color, courtesy of Antony's pen.</p>
<p>That last picture is telling: Four albums into a fascinating if not flawless career, Antony Hegarty remains one of music's great absorbers of darkness, be that the AIDS crisis he discovered upon moving to New York in the early 90s or the worldwide environmental crisis on which his albums have increasingly focused. But he's not interested in offering tales of woe without redemption, and that's never been more apparent than on <i>Swanlights</i>. During ""Salt Silver Oxygen"", he casts God as the woman and hero above a brilliant musical whirlwind. If that's the save, closer ""Christina's Farm"" is the dawn: ""I awoke to find/ A whiteness inside/ Everything did shine/ Slyly from each body... My face and your face/ Tenderly renewed,"" he offers faintly, bravely, and assuredly. Even here, on the stumbling block of <i>Swanlights</i>, Antony's message remains one of faithful renewal, despite its requiring changing everything we know-- or, hell, dying-- in the process.</p></div>"|14748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14748-swanlights/|7.7|Grayson Currin

Never mind the family connections, the fame garnered from helming albums by Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse-- artists charismatic enough to give any producer a cushy job-- or the dubious entity called the Business Int'l. The real cause for all those cocked eyebrows and dubious looks has been the diminishing-returns appropriation of old soul tropes in service of neo-soul radio hits, which actually sounded great on <i>Back to Black</i> but much less compelling-- almost comically crass-- on Ronson's own cashgrab 2007 album, <i>Version</i>. Full of payback cameos by Winehouse, Allen, ODB, and Robbie Williams, <i>Version</i> was a covers album that tried to position Ronson as a trendsetter, but proved dead-end rather than innovative and fresh.</p>
<p>Ronson's moment may have passed, but he actually seems relieved. <i>Record Collection</i>, his follow-up, succeeds at leaving his signature sound in the past and rolling out some new, often impressive tricks. Mercifully, there are no Daptone horns on here (no slam on that group, but they sound better when paired with Daptone artists), and Ronson expands his range beyond Stax, Philly, and Motown to reach into the 1970s and especially the 80s for inspiration. ""You Gave Me Nothing"" rollerskates on glittery disco beats, ""Lose It All (In the End)"" mimics the orchestral pomp of 60s crooner pop, and both ""The Colour of Crumar"" and ""Circuit Breaker"" soundtrack lost Atari games ca. 1986. The result is a grab-bag of an album: scattered, frantic, distracted, overeager, yet occasionally engaging nevertheless.</p>
<p>While that title may suggest a navel-gazing bedroom-auteur beatshop, <i>Record Collection</i> proves a surprisingly gregarious album, varying up the sounds and styles and making better use of cameos by his famous friends. Unlike Handsome Boy Modeling School and N.A.S.A., Ronson doesn't pair up his guests in stunt combinations. Rather, he's more interested in how they complement each other and the songs; he's after chemistry. ""Somebody to Love Me"" pairs Boy George with long-time Ronson associate Andrew Wyatt, and the former's gritty delivery makes him a nice foil for the latter's youthful falsetto. It's one of the most dramatic moments on the album, especially when Boy George pleads for someone to ""see the boy I once was in my life.""</p>
<p>Ghostface is the consummate professional, Spank Rock goes twee, and the album's runaway star is former Pipette Rose Elinor Dougall. She gets three songs that show new range, playing ABBA's Agnetha on ""You Gave Me Nothing"", Dusty Springfield on closer ""The Night Last Night"", and Debbie Harry in ""Hey Boy"". Her easy presence on these songs only hints at what a full-length collaboration between Dougall and Ronson might sound like. Alongside such naturally charismatic personalities, however, guests like Kyle Falconer from the View (the band, not the TV show) and Planet's Andy Greenwald fade into the mix, so overshadowed as to be absent.</p>
<p>Through almost every song, Ronson rides a shuffling drumkit beat, stitching the album and the guests together sonically. It's a bit too clipped and choppy to be especially funky, but it does keep things fleet and agile as Ronson introduces and develops new ideas, revealing a musical curiosity that <i>Version</i> seemed to preclude. His mission here is modest: As Simon LeBon sings on the title track, ""I just want to be in your record collection."" That's easy for him to say, since Duran Duran is in just about everybody's record collection. But <i>Record Collection</i> is a small step in that direction for Ronson.

Their last album, 2007's <i>Octopus</i>, got downright funky in places, and their reggae flourishes have always seemed to stem from an actual appreciation for the genre rather than some association with stoner culture. Their 2002 cover of Os Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina"" is about as ragged as they've ever been.</p>
<p>But even by their standards, <i>Every Step's a Yes</i> is unusually mellow and spaced-out. The Tropicália of that Os Mutantes cover has since become a more prominent element of their sound. Band leader Paul Butler, having spent time away in the Amazon and working with Devendra Banhart, seems to have internalized the <i>feel</i> of bossa nova and samba more than the actual rhythms and sounds, though-- these songs showcase a gentle melodicism as akin to Gilberto Gil as it is to Pink Floyd's ""Arnold Layne"". I guess the simplest term for it would be psych-folk.</p>
<p>The band is still a six-piece, but unlike on the last album, they don't sound that big-- everybody pulls back here behind the gauzy vocal harmonies, quiet organ blending with acoustic strumming, and a lot of laid-back drumming. Even the web-only single, ""Silver Line"", is a whisper of a song that doesn't seem likely to grab a lot of non-fans (it's just not that hook-y), but it nicely distills their pastoral vibe. The standout of the album is ""Winter Rose"", which opens with a haunting guitar part reminiscent of Bembeya Jazz's slow-burning six-string fireworks, before it slips easily into a reggae-ish rhythm. Horns answer Butler's lead vocal with dubbed-out bursts of melody. It's psychedelic, but not in an obvious or over-the-head way.</p>
<p>The little flourishes of sitar on ""I Really Need Love"" are more over-the-head, but for the most part their pretty psych-folk works. The album closes with its most ebullient track, ""Gaia"", a sort of mariachi samba whose lead guitar part recalls Crosby Stills &amp; Nash's ""Dark Star"". It's ultimately more memorable for the way it combines its sounds than for its songwriting, which is a criticism that applies to a fair amount of the record.</p></div>"|14739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14739-every-steps-a-yes/|6.9|Joe Tangari

In most cases, this would be a negative thing. But as the latest in a long line of releases from the absurdly prolific Aidan Baker-- who along with Leah Buckareff records as Nadja as well as solo under his own name with like-minded collaborators-- it's another incredibly small step forward for a guy that makes music that has never really been about forward movement.</p>
<p>The first half of this two-disc set (they are timed so that they could also be listened to simultaneously) finds Baker in standard Nadja territory. Guitar tones stretch out for minutes on end, blanketing songs in endless elastic loops of feedback before drums thundercrack their way in with appealingly human sloppiness. There's no good entry point except the beginning and no real escape until it ends. But Baker has made a home in this sound, carving pleasurable moments out of the sometimes arduous drone music listening experience.</p>
<p>In less talented hands, this could come off as a slapdash reach for doom-and-gloom experimentalism, but Baker manages to pull enough reference points that he's able to sit comfortably in the crossroads of weirdo jams-- somewhere between post-rock's languid build and release and doom metal's intensely loud textured hum. It may sound contradictory, but Baker is making overwhelming background music. It's so intrusive that it's nearly impossible to focus entirely on, but it manages to make everything in your natural surroundings ultra-serious and heavy.</p>
<p>The second disc, when heard on its own, is where Baker's lofty emotional goals betray him. The expansive landscapes of heavy guitar are mostly toned down in favor of structured feedback and quivering strings. Good elements when they're played against the emotional swell of the tracks on the first disc, but taken separately-- especially after listening to an entire disc's worth of this stuff-- it's too much. This second half feels like Baker is treading water. With so many releases per year, he seems more preoccupied with documenting the process of making glacially slow music than actually pushing his work into new territory. Here, he would benefit from leaving some of this on the cutting room floor in favor of a more definitive document.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Under the Jaguar Sun</i> is a Nadja record for those who are already into Nadja. It aims for all the emotions you want from a Nadja record-- crushing heartbreak giving way to bleak reality and occasional slivers of hope and brightness. But this many albums in, it just comes off as another competent release from a dude who is slowly clawing his way to something more transcendent.</p></div>"|14743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14743-under-the-jaguar-sun/|6.8|Sam Hockley-Smith

According to an interview the quintet did this summer with the blog Rhubarb Bomb, one of the band members lived in a building called Sussex Heights, so their unusual moniker is really an acronym for ""Sussex Heights Roving Artist Group."" Not exactly the kind of thing you imagine they settled on expecting to have to market it all these years later to a wider audience. Was this Joy Division? Not at all. The Desperate Bicycles? Shampoo? Bis? Getting warmer...</p>
<p>Shrag's self-titled debut album was the result of a similarly haphazard process, and it turned out to be one of last year's most enjoyable indie pop releases. Scruffy, heartbroken, and genuinely communicative at a time when bands are increasingly getting by on mood or genre signifiers alone, <i>Shrag</i> collected some of the well-crafted, cleverly affecting singles and mp3s the band had quietly offered up in the past few years, including ""Hopelessly Wasted"", ""Forty Five 45s"", and (for those of us still too freaked out by adulthood to become parents) ""Pregnancy Scene"". With <i>Life! Death! Prizes!</i>, Shrag attempt a sophomore LP that works more like an album than a collection of singles, and they mostly succeed.</p>
<p>When they're doing tightly coiled pop songs that could stand beautifully on their own, the group-- now two women and three men, following former drummer Leigh-Ann's illness-related departure-- can be quite charming. Keyboard-streaked and punk-spiked, boy-girl duets ""Tights in August"" and ""Rabbit Kids"" are as catchy and upbeat as the feelings they express are confused and conflicted: ""Your love is like your August tights/ It looks all right, but they're impractical tonight."" Slowing it down but not turning off the distortion for ""Their Stats"", <i>Life! Death! Prizes!</i> scores another potential alternate-universe hit, a jagged, jerking anxiety attack that feels like the apt product of a time when ""friendship"" has become nothing but a number on a Facebook scorecard.</p>
<p>Like so many indie bands' second albums, though, <i>Life! Death! Prizes!</i> suffers just a little from having to be conceived during a year or so rather than a lifetime. The shouty ""Faux-Coda"" (""miraculous, still not over"") and plaintive, poignant ""Coda"" (""It was a terrible year, though"") are endearing and, production-wise, miles ahead of the band's past work, but they don't have the direct-hit impact of <i>Shrag</i>'s ""Talk to the Left"" or ""Mark E. Smith"". They feel like, well, album tracks. That's fine-- they support the record's overall flow-- but it's still difficult for them to stand out in the crowded field of bands reminiscent of the UK's first big do-it-yourself wave. And the distinctive, much-needed female perspective on the indie scene shown in past singles like ""Different Glue"" is no longer much in evidence, either. Whether they were planning on it or not, Shrag deserve their own chance to reach a bigger audience, only for now, they're a slightly better singles group than albums group. Given indie pop's 7"" culture and their own humble origins, it sort of suits them.</p></div>"|14721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14721-life-death-prizes/|6.8|Marc Hogan

That's on the face of it an obvious statement, but much of what reaches indie fans these days isn't or doesn't rock: It's bedroom electronics, it's folk, it's born out of underground disco, or indie pop, or synth-pop, or it's what once would have been called new wave or classic rock. No disrespect to other labels, but I couldn't imagine Matador releasing records by, say, Iron &amp; Wine. Instead, they're the large indie who signed Jay Reatard, Fucked Up, and Times New Viking; the label who welcomed old-school rockers Ted Leo and Sonic Youth back into its fold; the label whose rising folkie star is an emotionally raw and brave performer like Perfume Genius, who is never going to get a song in a Previa ad. Sure, they acquired an imprint, True Panther, that gathers some of the best of the bloggier end of indie-- Balearic synthpoppers Delorean, or California indie pop band Girls. But Matador proper still keeps one foot planted in noisy rock.</p>
<p>Considering the way indie has grown up in the past few decades, it made a weird kind of sense that Matador celebrated its 21st birthday with a series of once-in-a-lifetimes shows in Vegas. They're also giving back to fans, as well as a handful of charities, with this affordable, limited-edition 6xCD box set: five discs of the best of Matador and a sixth disc of live performances, mostly of Pavement (they also throw in some poker chips.) The set is arranged chronologically, and its compilers make no qualms about where the label was at each stage of the box, naming each disc after the relative fortunes of Matador at the time. In short, the first disc is how the label started; the second is the codification of indie rock itself; the third finds it branching out to a wider range of sounds; the fourth is a retreat back to its wheelhouse, in time for the Internet to help push indie rock toward its peak commercial potential; and the fifth is where Matador is today.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it's the middle period that stands out immediately: It was a relatively dark time for Matador, if only because they were for once pointing toward the future rather than setting the agenda for the present. The disc starts with Boards of Canada, a group so above its like-minded peers it made them almost irrelevant. It goes on to forays into hip-hop (Arsonists, Large Professor), as well as other spheres of eventually quite trendy electronic music: the proto-microhouse of Burger/Ink, Pole's dubby minimalism, Matmos' conceptual experimentalism. In the end this stuff never became Matador's defining sound-- and it wasn't anywhere as close to a part of the indie conversation then as it is now-- but you can't fault the label's instincts. Even the guitar artists here, for the most part, were ahead of or helped set prevailing trends: Belle and Sebastian, certainly-- their songsmithery, collectivism, and classicism were oddly out of step at the time but have become a defining strain of 21st century independent music. Spoon as well, with their tight rhythms and love of post-punk already lockstep in place. Even Yo La Tengo and Pavement sound here more like 2000s indie than stuff from the 90s.</p>
<p>On either side of those supposedly lost years, Matador built from the ground up the defining sounds of first the 1990s and then the 2000s in credible guitar rock. The first go around, the label came to the fore as an alternative to the self-parody of mid-90s alt-rock. Much of Disc One here is a continuation of the more distorted, punk-rooted sounds of SST or Homestead or Touch &amp; Go-- landmark noise-pop songs like Teenage Fanclub's ""Everything Flows"" and Superchunk's ""Slack Motherfucker"" alongside more abrasive, tangled work from Unrest, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, or Dustdevils. Appropriately it ends with the group whose ramshackle songs would do more to codify the loose smirk of 90s indie rock than any other, Pavement.</p>
<p>By Disc Two, though they'd likely be loathe to admit it, Matador were sort of drafting off alternative rock, with most of their biggest artists-- Pavement, Liz Phair, Yo La Tengo, Guided by Voices, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Pizzicato Five, Helium-- working the margins of the major-label crossover. These bands played Lollapaloozas, though mostly on side stages, and made appearances on MTV, though primarily on ""120 Minutes"". When curious kids became tired of alt rock and what it quickly devolved into, it didn't take a lot of digging for them to find Matador bands next-- particularly since through some of these years, Capitol Records briefly owned a 49% share of the label.</p>
<p>It helped naturally that this group of artists would encompass a deceptively wide range of styles and viewpoints under the banner of independent rock. None of them were part of a trend or subgenre per se, unless ""lo-fi"" actually counts. None were espousing a particular ethos, or particular idea. They were quite simply talented, singular artists given the creative freedom to express themselves by a label that associated ambition with artistry rather than commercialism. In that way, Matador defined the big-tent ethos of 2000s indie by not having an ethos at all: Unlike most big indie labels of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Matador was never tied to a specific movement or sound of geographical location.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the label underwent a second revolution. Part of it coincided with a shift in indie sensibilities: After a few years in which less-rock-rooted influences became popular and chic (krautrock, Tropicália, dub, exotica, and jazz among them), independent music returned to the guitar, this time embracing a more populist set of bands now easily located via the Internet, for good or bad. Matador responded with Interpol, the New Pornographers, and eventually Shearwater and Brightblack Morning Light. Nineties holdovers B&amp;S, Mogwai, and Cat Power became bigger stars, a new crop of frontline Matador artists following the various fates of Pavement, Liz Phair, and Guided by Voices. Disc Five outlines the now of the label-- the aforementioned place where TNV settles next to Delorean and Perfume Genius.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the <i>Matador at 21</i> set has no designs on being a collection of the label's best songs; instead, it's more like an oral history-- messy and haphazard, with imperfectly remembered details. Matador would likely tell the story a little bit differently each time it attempted, and in that way it feels as good a document of the past 20 years of indie rock as you could create. There is no central thrust or cozy center. These songs didn't chart. They weren't often agreed upon. They didn't define their times for large numbers of people. They were shared experiences, but in small ways-- between friends, between a listener and his or her record collection, between groups of strangers at small club shows. Sometimes the listener and artist even enjoyed the experience together. These songs represent dozens of potential inroads and tributaries into and through an ill-defined, often-changing musical world that over the past 21 years you might not have known existed unless you stumbled on them via a well-curated record store, or an older brother's friend, or college radio, or a mixtape from a friend or lover, or <i>Spin</i> or <i>Puncture</i> or <i>Melody Maker</i>, or a website or a blog. And in that sense there is no single way, or best way, to tell the story. The important thing, as always, is in the telling itself.</p></div>"|14740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14740-matador-at-21/|9.5|Scott Plagenhoef

It's a go-to emotion for every era, but, thanks to the eternal  memory bank known as the Internet, this is a  particularly fruitful time for looking back. But not all remembrances  are created equal. The majority of today's cultural nostalgia is  dominated by a cheap, remember-that-show quality that ultimately infantilizes  its audience into submission. Shameless nods to yesterday's  TV/music/movies are fine for a quick escape, but they can also make  tomorrow that much more daunting. Still, when approached with more care,  peering into the past can be invigorating. Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig summed up the two sides with characteristic eloquence on this year's <i>Contra</i>, singing about how we're ""nostalgic for garbage, desperate for time."" Koenig is one of the good guys in the current Nostalgia Wars, and so is Gold Panda.</p>
<p>The London-based producer's main instrument is an Akai MPC2000XL sampler, which allows him to rearrange, repurpose,  and recycle previously recorded sounds at the touch of a button. By  nature, it's a nostalgic machine. And he uses it to push things forward;  he's not just sampling what we know already on <i>Lucky Shiner</i>,  he's using sounds that mean something to him-- a tapping keyboard, a  sped-up or slowed-down recording of someone saying the word ""you,""  exotic-sounding instruments unfamiliar to a Westerner's experience-- and  attempting to universalize them. This process is something of an  internal challenge, as the beat maker told me in an interview last year.  ""I usually find stuff that I hope no one really knows or cares about,""  he said, talking about his sample selection. ""If I'm ripping off  something that's already brilliant, what's the point?"" Because of this,  the dusty melancholia of <i>Lucky Shiner</i> feels earned and lived-in. It's a  far cry from just naming your new bedroom-pop band Double Dare.</p>
<p>While this is the first Gold Panda long-player after a slew of EPs  and remixes over the last couple years, he just turned 30. Not to get  all ""respect your elders"" with it, but the Londoner's relatively  advanced age probably adds depth to his stoic reminisces. As a hushed  acoustic guitar/found sounds track, ""Parents"" is a telling anomaly on  the album. The song is introduced by some heavily-accented words from the producer's grandmother, after whom  Lucky Shiner is also named. It's an interlude that offers little  on its own but offers an irrefutable bit of personalization early on and  is invaluable to the album's homespun wistfulness as a whole. Even if  you can't understand what she's saying, the voice has the unmistakably  kind lilt of a grandmother; it draws you into the instrumental elegance  elsewhere.</p>
<p>In sonic terms, Gold Panda breathes the same kind of  life into his work as Four Tet. His beats are mechanical but also  intensely human. But Gold Panda's trigger finger is a bit itchier. His  signature tic involves short, unique samples that burst in rhythmic  repetition. So on opener ""You"", the words ""you and me"" are sliced into  individual pieces and then tapped in brain-screwing succession as a  bulbous beat makes the song all too ready for the club inside your head.  And ""Before We Talked"" rides on a quicksilver pulse made up of tiny  squelches and glitches that are Aphex-like in precision and scope. Oftentimes, plinking  notes from various unique, piano-like sounds add a spotlit solemnity  underneath or alongside the drums. A sense of well-thought-out  album-style completeness is evident throughout, too, with the two  aforementioned tracks coming with their own sequels later on in the form  of ""After We Talked"" and a closer also named ""You"". But the last track  isn't a reprise as much as a hard-won ending point; whereas the opener  is fast and friendly, it's ""you""s popping quick, <i>Lucky Shiner</i>'s finale  is noticeably more contemplative with the sampled ""you"" now  stretched-out and slowed. It's always about ""you,"" but perhaps not the  same ""you"" as before.</p>
<p>In some ways, the idea of nostalgia is  averse to growth. Mourning the loss of time (even good time) can be  intoxicating and stagnant. That's not what Gold Panda is doing. He's  recognizing that loss, articulating it with a multitude of finely-placed  sounds, and then coming to grips with his place in the here and now.  He's making nostalgia work for him without consuming him. ""I'm just  really happy to be happy for the first time since I was about 20,"" he  said last year. ""It's nice to just do my hobby and be able to live.""  It's easy to hear his joy through those rejiggered memories.</p></div>"|14732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/|8.3|Ryan Dombal

It's an album that fits on an unusual continuum somewhere between classic backpacker breaks and hazy garage rock, creating a unified sound out of supposedly disparate scenes through sheer force of personality. And the singer who made that unification work did so with a multi-faceted voice-- everything from foggy, deadpan muttering to vivid falsetto soul, all wrapped up in an air of relatable mystery-- that made it all come together. So what happens when you divorce Gonjasufi's vocal tracks from the Gaslamp Killer, Flying Lotus and Mainframe beats that they fit so well in? Gonjasufi can be easily slotted into just about any genre without losing what makes his style distinct. But on remix album <i>The Caliph's Tea Party</i>,<i> </i>it only clicks when that style <i>stays </i>distinct, instead of being left to the devices of a remixer who seems more interested in distorting it or crushing it beneath the weight of an overbearing squall.</p>
<p>Mark Pritchard's billowing rework of ""Ancestors"" is the opening cut, and of the collection's dozen tracks, it's the most true to the original material's spirit: it builds off a subtle update of circa-<i>Ummagumma </i>Pink Floyd, all portentious widescreen desert-scape gloom heavy on funereal organs. Add a judicious amount of reverb, and Gonjasufi's rasp sounds hauntingly isolated and adrift, underscoring how fragile he can sound while still holding strength in his voice. That approach fits well elsewhere, too-- he sounds just as vivid over the scrapyard drums of MRR's ""Holidays"" remix and Hezus's Clinic-esque garage-freakout take on ""My Only Friend"". And in some of the more transformative style tweaks, where the decayed, organic-sounding original backing tracks are replaced with a thick digital pulse of live-drum house (Bear in Heaven's mix of ""Love of Reign"") or shuddering, malfunctioning industrial electro (Agdm's mix of ""DedNd""), there's proof that this singularly peculiar voice can feel at home in broader contexts.</p>
<p>Then again, that's when you can actually hear his voice, and too much of <i>The Caliph's Tea Party </i>forgets just what an interesting instrument it is. His vocals are sporadically chopped into a hyperactive, pitched-up, stammering paroxysm of notes on Dam Mantle's dubstep revamp of ""Ageing"", to annoying and often-anonymous effect. Jeremiah Jae's remix of ""Kobwebz"" and Oneohtrix Point Never's version of ""She's Gone"" damage his timbre through filters and distortion, deadening some of the subtler nuances that give his voice character and burying them under shrill, underformed beats. But at least they make that voice prominent enough to give you an idea of what they're doing to it. Broadcast and the Focus Group hardly bother on their sound-collage title track, which erratically jumps between loosely seamed loops of backspun string sections and incidental-music cues in a way that has little to do with source material ""DedNd""; for all the straining you have to do to find any trace of Gonjasufi's voice, it might as well be an outtake from <i>Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age</i>. <i>The Caliph's Tea Party </i>isn't without its highlights, but it's biggest strength is an ironic one: listening to this only reinforces how great <i>A Sufi and a Killer </i>is.</p></div>"|14704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14704-the-caliphs-tea-party/|6.2|Nate Patrin

All this constant action has understandably led to moments of both brilliance and self-indulgence. Hill's 2008 solo debut, <i>Astrological Straits</i>, was an impressive but exhausting affair, filled beyond the brim with non-stop, torrential drumming. On <i>Face Tat</i>, however, Hill puts as much focus on his oddball, malformed songs as on his world-class musicianship, resulting in an album that feels more compact, slightly less metallic, and altogether more fun.</p>
<p>When you've recorded and toured with as many different musicians as Hill has, you can assemble a pretty talented roster of guests. <i>Face Tat</i> features contributions from Devendra Banhart, Guillermo Scott Herren (Prefuse 73) and members of No Age, Hella, and Deerhoof. There's such a rotation of guests, in fact, that it hardly resembles a solo project at all. Yet each of these songs is shot through with Hill's distinctive personality and the restless, athletic agility of his drumming, forming a cohesive whole despite the music's frequent hairpin turns and switchbacks.</p>
<p>About the last thing any Hill song would seem to need is more drums, but that is exactly what the opening ""Memo to the Man"" delivers, as Hill is joined on percussion by Deerhoof's Greg Saunier. Though that might conjure images of a drum clinic at Guitar Center, the track leaves a refreshingly light footprint by emphasizing its squiggly melodic instrumental hooks over what is, by any standard, some pretty fine drumming.</p>
<p>Several other tracks here, such as the frantic ""House of Hits"" or ""Burner in the Video"", sport memorable but similarly off-kilter hooks, alternately calling to mind the work of Liars, Battles, or vintage Brainiac. The album's slightly disorienting effect is due in part to its construction, which according to Hill began with sound sources that included smashing computer screens, street-level field recordings, and peeing on a stack of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazines. Though it would be tricky to pinpoint any of those exact sounds, such techniques do help explain why so many sounds on <i>Face Tat</i> are difficult to identify. This is particularly the case on ""Ex-Ravers"" and ""Jackers"", two tracks that are such mosaics of disconnected noises and shifting perspectives that they can appear to get lost in their own haphazard circuitry.</p>
<p>In contrast, some of <i>Face Tat'</i>s best moments occur when Hill and company simply pin their ears back and go. ""The Sacto Smile"", which features No Age's Dean Spunt and Randy Randall, is a wildly cathartic punk screed, as is the near-anthemic ""Total Recall"", either of which could slip handsomely onto a Lightning Bolt album. As is the case on most of the album, Hill's distorted vocals can sometimes seem like an afterthought, but perhaps they are intended to be just one of the many ingredients squashed into the album's vibrant mixture, to be heard as one final act of creation-through-destruction.</p></div>"|14727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14727-face-tat/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

Conboy co-founded Williamsburg's Death By Audio venue, where the band found its footing playing impromptu hallway sets between regularly scheduled programming. The band eventually hit on a sound built on two elements: noise and hooks. Supported by engineer Jeremy Scott (Vivian Girls, Woods, These Are Powers), the two members make as much noise on <i>Ghost Fits</i> as a band three times its size. The songs can go beyond surface pleasures thanks to Conboy's ferocious rhythms and Pfannebecker's voice, which combines a sweet, boyish delivery with occasional hiccups, whines, and other charming imperfections. Between those two elements sits Pfannebecker's guitar, which he uses to brandish a handful of diverse textures.</p>
<p>Sisters may be married to noise (their name is a nod to Sonic Youth's 1987 album, <i>Sister</i>), but their brand of it is friendly and oftentimes poppy. <i>Ghost Fits</i> is full of highly rhythmic, fast-paced songs made of staticky chord shifts and half-asleep vocals. Things get intriguing when the band pulls in new textures and sounds, like the gurgling, bass-like chord progressions on ""Visions"", the flanging, feedback-heavy ""Ghost Fits"", ""Wake Me Up"", and ""Sky"", and the acoustic guitar paired with a xylophone on the upbeat, fun ""Highway Scratch"". But these moments of adventure are fleeting, and the persistent noise in its place starts to sound monotonous.</p>
<p>Part of the problem lies in the disconnect between Pfannebecker's lackadaisical vocal delivery and the relentless instrumentation, as if playing were so physically exertive that the vocals become an afterthought. But in place of sheer power, the singer employs a couple of interesting techniques: on standout ""Highway Scratch"", he detunes his vocals slightly, sliding down half a note for emphatic effect (the song also features some memorable lines, and Pfannebecker seems to know it, yelping passionately for the first and last time on the album: ""Make up something to come true/ Set it free/ Before it breaks in two."" If only this happened more often.) On ""Synesthesia"" he slices off certain lyrics to give them a punky, staccato bite, and he uses a similar sing-speak technique across the album. But there is a lot of verbal shrugging, and it doesn't come across as interestingly as the band might have hoped: It can render songs patchy and unhinged, especially if the songs don't go beyond vague melodies and percussive acrobatics.</p>
<p>There is momentum behind every song on <i>Ghost Fits</i>, but momentum is different from drive. Sisters are clearly working within the framework of contemporaries like No Age, Wavves, and Women, but this debut lacks bravado: a willingness to make each song memorable and distinctive, through, say, cacophony, unique vocal delivery, or experimentation with effects-- all three of which Sisters only dabble in. The band achieves some success by dividing its time between catchy pop and the feedback-heavy rock of the previously mentioned acts, but too often the distance between the two styles feels vast and uneventful in Sisters' hands.</p></div>"|14715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14715-ghost-fits/|5.7|Liz Colville

This time, instead of painstakingly humanizing the locations, historical inhabitants, and trivia of a certain slab of America, he's more concerned with his own state of mind. Banjos are out; moody electronics, deep bass, and drums that burst like geysers are in. The lengthiest song title on his last LP, 2005's <i>Illinois</i>, was 53 words long; here, that same superlative goes to a tune called ""I Want to Be Well"". He's whispering less, hollering more. And at the climax of <i>The Age of Adz</i>, the devout Christian and poster boy for mannered indie-dude sensitivity shouts, ""I'm not fuckin' around!"" no less than 16 times. Believe him.</p>
<p>Yet, there is no mistaking this as a work by the Detroit-born, Brooklyn-dwelling overachiever. Trilling flutes, meticulously arranged choirs, and an overarching sense of hugeness are still apparent. The record's last track, ""Impossible Soul"", is a five-part suite that lasts more than 25 minutes and boasts harps, horns, blips, Auto-Tuned vocals, a twee-dance breakdown, some cheerleader call-and-response, and even a little trad-folk guitar picking, you know, for kicks. That single track bulges with more engaging ideas than most artists could muster in a career, and there's no one else on earth that could've come up with it. Even the record's glitched backdrop isn't entirely unprecedented; Stevens' pre-breakout 2001 instrumental album <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i> could be looked back on as a sketchbook for what would become <i>The Age of Adz</i>. So as Stevens' current restlessness fights it out with his past accomplishments, the listener ends up winning.</p>
<p>Once again there's a concept tying everything together, though it's not quite as educational-- or virtuous-- as before. <i>The Age of Adz</i> is a reference to Louisiana artist and self-proclaimed prophet Royal Robertson, whose work appears on the album's cover and liner notes. A paranoid schizophrenic, Robertson translated his anguish through apocalyptic sci-fi posters after his wife left him following nearly 20 years of marriage. His comic-book style pieces-- which have been shown at the Smithsonian, among other museums-- are colorful, vengeful, and crazed. They feature B-movie style robot monsters who spout cartoon captions like, [<i>sic</i>] ""I'll distroy much town's of adultress !!WHORE'S!!"" Robertson's work is a long way from the cutesy cover of <i>Illinois</i>, and the fact that Stevens chose such an eccentric and hate-prone avatar for inspiration this time is telling.</p>
<p>Because <i>The Age of Adz</i> is a relatively dark affair, with the 35-year-old songwriter sometimes forgoing his child-like naïveté for something more oblique and adult. Considering the triumph of style that was <i>Illinois</i> (and the legions of lesser lights that subsequently turned it into some sort of over-the-top Disney on Ice parody), the change of perspective is welcomed.</p>
<p>The record is book-ended by two quaint, characteristic acoustic passages that find Stevens reconnecting with a past love. ""It's been a long long time since I've memorized your face,"" he starts. This is the Sufjan we know. But, in between that short intro and outro, the album tells the story of a relationship with fantastical zeal. The tale is sordid and a little absurd, filled with betrayal, selfishness, frustration, suicidal thoughts, a raging volcano, and a space ship. ""I've lost the will to fight/ I was not made for life,"" he confesses on the title track, as robo-noises and churchly backups translate Robertson's futuristic drawings into sound.</p>
<p>Across the album, he relives the more harrowing aspects of a deep personal bond, pinging from bitterness (""At least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye,"" he sings over gloriously spare electro-pop on ""I Walked""), to confusion (""I thought I was so in love/ Some say it wasn't true,"" he head-scratches on the hymn-like ""Now That I'm Older"", a masterclass in modern vocal arrangement), to, um, melodramatic transmogrification (referring to himself in the third person, he inhabits the Pompeii-burning volcano of ""Vesuvius"", singing, ""Sufjan, the panic inside, the murdering ghost that you cannot ignore""). Surrounding himself with music that expertly balances between over-orchestrated and chaotic, Stevens elevates his pedestrian travails about love and lust into legendary myths in which he's rarely the hero.</p>
<p>Right before <i>The Age of Adz</i>'s back-to-earth finale, Sufjan finally overcomes his emotional stupor as a host of voices join him for the singalong, ""Boy! We can do much more together!/ It's not so impossible!"" And then he shakes out of the grandeur, goes back to the finger picking, and sighs the album's more realistic final line: ""Boy! We made such a mess together."" It's an ambiguous conclusion that, like the rest of the album, was seemingly in jeopardy of not happening at all. In a <i>Signal to Noise</i> interview last year, Stevens said, ""I definitely feel like the album no longer has any real bearing anymore. The physical format itself is obsolete; the CD is obsolete and the LP is kinda nostalgic. I'm wondering, 'What's the value of my work once these forms are obsolete and everyone's just downloading music?'"" It's a valid question. But instead of succumbing to trends, Stevens barrels through with another long-form work that requires-- and rewards-- time and devotion. As important questions about music's worth in the age of free continue to swirl around him, Sufjan's still combating instant-gratification culture the best way he knows how.</p></div>"|14738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14738-the-age-of-adz/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

He's got a Tom Petty, a Nick Drake, and a David Bowie that wouldn't get him kicked out of Vegas. Throughout Stoltz's decade-plus career, one name that hasn't always found its way into the discussion is his own; too often bedraggled by their influences, his songs-- never less than competent juxtapositions of glam, folk-rock, orchestral pop, and hints of proto-psych-- can feel like the work of a gifted stylist searching for a style to call his own. Stoltz's latest, <i>To Dreamers</i>, finds him dressing down the pocket symphonies that marked his two previous Sub Pop efforts, throwing a little more grease and grit at his well-oiled tunes. <i>To Dreamers</i> is one of Stoltz's most satisfying efforts to date, sounding bolder and more invigorated than nearly anything before it. Yet, when Stoltz sneers ""Do you want to rock'n'roll with me?"", exactly who's doing the asking gets a little lost in the tune's glammy shuffle.</p>
<p>Stoltz, a San Francisco mainstay with a decidedly backward-looking sound, has watched a little like-minded scene build up around him over the last few years; the Bay Area's been hemorrhaging great psych-pop revival acts of late, many of whom Stoltz can count as friends and collaborators. Bands like Sonny &amp; the Sunsets (for whom Stoltz has been drumming) and the Fresh &amp; Onlys may, like Stoltz, have the dust settings in their tube amps dialed in just so, and <i>To Dreamers</i>' uptick in rockers slots it in nicely with this scene. But the standouts in this crowd are cutting their retro pastiche with daring, funny, distinctive songcraft that tends to obscure any notions of excessive borrowing. <i>To Dreamers</i>' homespun style and its uptick in straight-up rockers slots it in nicely with this thriving scene, especially as Stoltz moves away from Nick Drake delicacy and Brian Wilson idolatry towards a looser, rockier sound. But no matter who he's gunning for, the ever-adaptable Stoltz, unlike some of his newfound contemporaries, still seems uncomfortable peeling off the costumes and letting a little more of himself shine through.</p>
<p>Like his previous work, <i>To Dreamers</i> is a mostly solitary pursuit, with Stoltz handling the lion's share of instrumentation and production himself. Yet even alone in the studio, Stoltz tends to get crowded out by his influences. His voice-- generally easygoing yet plenty chameleonic-- tends to adapt to the style of the music he's emulating; he drawls and draws out syllables like Petty on ""Keeping the Flame"", channels Ray Davies' terse early delivery on the Kinksish ""Little Girl"", and while he stops short of karaoke, there is a sense that this one's the Bowie song, this one's the T. Rex, and so forth. Lyrically, Stoltz isn't so much a phrase-turner as a place-setter, opting for the kind of identifiable sentiment that marks many of his influences; he may land a chorus in your head, but chances are you won't be taking the verse lyrics with you. His melodies are unwaveringly graceful, good humored, approachable; they're just not all that arresting on a case-by-case basis, and time and again, the best moves on <i>To Dreamers </i>seem channeled from anywhere but Stoltz's cellar.</p>
<p><i>To Dreamers</i> hinges around ""Baby I've Got News For You"", a cover of a shuffly 1965 number from British garage-popster ""Big Boy"" Pete Miller. Miller himself appears on the track, laying down some guitar through the very same amp on which he recorded the original. Perhaps in deference to his special guest, Stoltz's ""Baby"" is awfully faithful; it's a nice song in either context, but if you've only got one life to live, the Miller version's a little pluckier, and better for it. The tune plugs along charmingly enough until its bridge, at which point Stoltz and Miller sing, ""Some folks are content to exist in a small tent/ I want a mansion with room for expansion."" It's an unusually strident, ambitious statement for the modest Stoltz; no wonder he didn't write it. <i>To Dreamers</i> seems to suggest that Stoltz really is content in his little world, crafting elaborate, enjoyable enough mash notes to his favorite records in his basement.</p></div>"|14734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14734-to-dreamers/|6.8|Paul Thompson

A good set builds momentum, orchestrates an extended rhythmic narrative, and throws together a couple of surprising juxtapositions along the way. But the great mixes are the ones that do all of that while making some greater statement about all the work they collect together. When Cut Chemist was tapped to create a DJ set in opening for Ethiopian jazz icon Mulatu Astatke back in 2009, he took the opportunity to delve into the sources, influences, and echoes of the Ethio-jazz scene that Astatke and others developed in the 1960s and 70s. <i>Sound of the Police</i>-- named for the tendency for many Ethio-jazz recordings to originate from military bands-- does a lot to contextualize that musical terrain for hip-hop heads who might not have delved too deep into its shared roots.</p>
<p>This mix runs on an interesting setup: <i>Sound of the Police </i>was assembled and recorded in real time on an unusual one-turntable rig, with a loop pedal and mixer taking the place of a second deck for transition-building purposes. (Think a stripped-down, single-turntable equivalent of Cut Chemist and DJ Shadow's 8-deck<i> Hard Sell </i>setup.) It's a deft highwire act, and it allows him to pull off some agile scratching, sonic layering, and self-overdubbing with original, unearthed vinyl records he likely couldn't find a second copy of. In other words, it has all the careful, hands-on, as-it-happens nature of a DJ mix combined with the loop-constructing composition of a beat tape-- and it's a pretty impressive technical achievement in that sense.</p>
<p>That structure's well-served by a wide itinerary of the African musical diaspora. And while this mix's tendency to work the slow build means it lacks the frenetic, quick-cut energy of similar-minded beat tapes like Oh No's <i>Dr. No's Ethiopium </i>or Madlib's <i>Beat Konducta in Africa</i>, it does have a continent-hopping nature that branches out into longer threads of shared stylistic heritage and blurs lines in a telling way. Heavy as it is on the fluttering horns, glassy guitars, and dense percussion that denotes a certain era of East African music-- think Buda Musique's excellent, exhaustive <i>Ethiopiques </i>series-- it frequently pits it in a free-flowing conversation with Nigerian Afrobeat, Cuban percussion, Brazilian Tropicália, and that deathless old-school b-boy break, the Incredible Bongo Band's ""Apache"".</p>
<p>That these musical cultural identities flow in and out of each other so freely is what gives <i>Sound of the Police </i>much of its resonance: The evolution of beat music across borders draws distinctions between eras and regions, but they're far from insurmountable. The lack of a full-credit tracklisting only highlights that: You might catch a moment of organ-heavy garage-funk or sax-driven, Middle Eastern-inflected melodies and find yourself unsure as to what that sound's geographical ties might be. And while not actually knowing the source might feel like the side effect of the old DJ tradition of never revealing where your breaks come from, it also gives this mix<i> </i>a purpose: Sometimes when you don't know the origin of a piece of music, you have no preconceptions to grab onto and you gravitate instead toward the things you most immediately recognize as familiar. <i>Sound of the Police </i>acknowledges its roots, but the common language of the beat is what truly drives it.</p></div>"|14716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14716-sound-of-the-police/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Every five or 10 years, we remember the island nation to our south still exists. We briefly import a few Jamaican crossover acts to lend spice to the charts. We absorb a little of its color into our own music. Then we forget about it just as quickly. Ultimately any deep American engagement with Jamaica is still limited to collectors and cultists.</p>
<p>Not so in the UK. Ska, reggae, dancehall, dub are inside of just about every brand of ""urban"" music Britain has produced in the past 30 years. The best UK hip-hop stood out from its American cousin precisely because its architects were kids immersed in Caribbean sounds since the cradle. That's why Roots Manuva's flow has always been the aspect of his music that's the most ""English,"" the voice of a late-20th-century Londoner surrounded by first-generation Jamaican immigrants, blending the two cadences until they're inseparable. And though American rap hasn't been short on skeletal, synthetic beats, Manuva's rhythm tracks stagger their punches, just like dancehall, in a way that that's been passé in U.S. pop since Timbaland discovered trance.</p>
<p>The best of Manuva's music has always existed in a tense suspension between styles. Too Jamaican to pass for American rap, too full of hip-hop to be simple dancehall fetishism. Thus, UK hip-hop. Occasionally, however, he tips the balance, releasing a dub remix album like <i>Duppy Writer</i>, where old Manuva songs are given radical makeovers by producer Wrongtom, that makes his debt to Jamaica overt, like a kid who grew up spinning Burning Spear and Ninjaman singles returning briefly to his first love. If Manuva's densely packed verses still link him to U.S. indie hip-hop in unspoken opposition to Waka Flocka style shouters, the music on <i>Duppy Writer</i> will have little pull with what's left of the Fat Beats crowd.</p>
<p>On <i>Duppy Writer</i> Roots draws more from, well, roots than he ever has before. Some tracks are indistinguishable from the hazy reggae you'll find on a compilation of classic Trojan 45s, and thankfully these reproduction antiques sound like the warm, fat, analog real-deal rather than the chilly, ersatz synthetic shit that makes up so much neo-roots. When the rhythms do bang, they're closer to Steely and Clevie than Drumma Boi. And instead of keyboard hooks or old funk samples, we get a full slate of lovingly recreated reggae touches: ""Sleng Teng""-style basslines, extreme dub echo effects, choppy rhythm guitar doused in reverb.</p>
<p>Manuva sounds perfectly at home here, of course. This is the sound that shaped his voice. Like the classics it evokes, <i>Duppy Writer</i> is loose and likeable, casual-sounding despite the high level of craft involved, probably the most playfully pop album Manuva's ever put his name to, even if the ""pop"" in question has more do with 1978 or 1988 than 2010. Wrongtom and Manuva realize that Jamaican music has always been dance music, even at its most righteous or menacing. <i>Duppy Writer</i> pulses and breathes with that familiar, laid-back funk, and Manuva's voice dips and booms theatrically to match it, which is kind of amazing considering his verses are essentially unchanged from the original tunes, a small testament to what good remixing is all about. If your interest in Jamaican music is limited, then <i>Duppy Writer</i> will probably be of even less concern to you than the usual Roots Manuva album. But you also shouldn't dismiss an album this end-to-end pleasurable as some dry retro curio.</p></div>"|14742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14742-duppy-writer/|7.0|Jess Harvell

His instrumental sketches rarely exceed the five-minute mark, and they completely eschew ""big"" dramatic moments. At their best, they function like a series of a wistful, drifty postcards from some middle memory of places and things. This approach served his 2008 album <i>Ferndorf</i> well enough; an homage to his childhood village in Germany, it's charmingly naive and occasionally bittersweet, something you could imagine nicely scoring a sentimental coming-of-age film.</p>
<p><i>Foreign Landscapes</i> takes <i>Ferndorf</i>'s chronicling principle on the road.  The album consists of pieces inspired by locations around the world, from New York City's Union Square to Berlin's Alexanderplatz. Like its predecessors, it is scored mostly for three or four chamber musicians and Hauschka's piano, which he lightly prepares, John Cage-style, by placing objects on the strings. A colorful travelogue concept could be ideal for the prepared piano's wilder possibilities: in the right hands, it can resemble a Chinese zither, or a gamelan ensemble, or a horde of buzzing locusts. But Hauschka's preparation serves only to make his piano sound slightly more toylike; the result is that on <i>Foreign Landscapes</i>, the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira and the Japanese city Kamogawa come off sounding like the same quaint, sleepy little 18th century village square.</p>
<p>There are fleeting moments of prettiness in all of Hauschka's work; he has a wonderful ear for evocative bits of sound. But when he fails to find anywhere convincing to steer them, they don't leave lasting marks. ""Alexanderplatz"" opens with a pungent gypsy violin scored by some bracingly sour woodwinds; in ""Iron Shoes"", a violin sings a lovely almost-quote from the second movement Dvořák's famous ""American"" string quartet. Rather than build on this, however, Hauschka falls back on the same sprightly, anonymous churn all of his pieces eventually succumb to.</p>
<p>As a result, it becomes kind of hard to know what to <i>do</i> with his music, exactly. It doesn't reward close attention, but it doesn't fade successfully into the background, either; his arrangements are too scrappy and jostling for that. The strings and woodwinds often just sort of rattle around each other like loose parts in a shoebox, jolting the music to the forefront without doing much to command it once there, and it can make for a maddening listening experience, like someone tapping you insistently on the shoulder only to stare at you blankly when you finally turn around.</p>
<p>The best moments come when the tootling woodwinds and strings disappear, and Hauschka just lays out a pretty piano melody. The drunken, faux-Rachmaninov sway of ""Mount Hood"" is the album's richest piece, and the only work that makes truly compelling use of John Cage's prepared-piano technique. What sounds like a combination of pins, screws, and ping-pong balls bounce up and down on the strings while Hauschka plays a mournful minor-key piano steeped in pedal haze. The rickety, groaning sounds that result add an ineffable layer of sadness: It evokes the image of a pair of ghosts dancing together slowly on a sunken ship. It is the exception to the rule, unfortunately, and <i>Foreign Landscapes</i> enters a deadly boring lull before its second half and never recovers. The result has the energy of a cup of tea slowly going tepid in the Sunday afternoon sun.</p></div>"|14726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14726-foreign-landscapes/|5.5|Jayson Greene

He's their main singer, their frontman, the guy who wrote everything on their first two albums and almost all the good stuff they've done since then; when the band started incorporating other members' songs and voices, they made a couple of dodgy records. But last year's <i>God Help the Girl</i> project-- songs from what seems to be an entirely hypothetical movie musical-- put the lie to the ""Belle and Sebastian are <i>both</i> Stuart!"" theory: even though Murdoch wrote all of it (and members of Belle and Sebastian played on it), it came off as a misstep, stagier and more ungainly than anything the parent band had ever done, mostly because it felt like the work of a revue-with-backup rather than an ensemble.</p>
<p>And they really are an ensemble, even now, after a nearly five-year break since <i>The Life Pursuit</i>. Playing as a group has always been one of their strengths; for a band that has an instantly recognizable sound (the first 12 seconds of ""I Can See Your Future"" or ""Write About Love"" might as well be someone yelling ""THIS RIGHT HERE IS A SONG BY BELLE AND SEBASTIAN""), they have no particularly distinctive instrumentalists, just a finely developed sense of how to support each other's timbres and rhythms.</p>
<p>This time, they're integrating their voices into their collective sound, too. Murdoch's honey-ripple tenor appears, one way or another, on almost everything here, but it's not the first voice on the album: That belongs to Sarah Martin, whose opening imperative, ""Make me dance/ I want to surrender,"" is, in its way, Murdoch's version of PJ Harvey's ""Lick my legs/ I'm on fire."" All over the album, the band's members and their guests harmonize with each other, trade off lines, sing in counterpoint. That's generally a great idea, with one prominent exception. Belle and Sebastian occasionally like to do the last thing you'd expect them to do: cover ""Freak Scene"", get produced by Trevor Horn, have ?uestlove sit in on drums. The sore thumb here is ""Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John"", a torchy duet between Murdoch and Norah Jones, who seems to be trying to channel Dusty Springfield but ends up channeling, well, Norah Jones.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, <i>Write About Love</i> is a consolidation of Belle and Sebastian's strengths, rather than an expansion into new territory. Murdoch is still writing long, curly, elegant melodies-- ""Come on Sister"", in particular, is a magnificent piece of construction. He's still writing lyrics about a fraught but unshakeable relationship with Christianity: When he sings ""I know the way/ Get on your skinny knees and pray,"" ""Write About Love""'s guest singer Carey Mulligan chirps back, ""Maybe not today,"" and the refrain of ""The Ghost of Rockschool"" namedrops God repeatedly. He's gotten a little cagier about telling stories and outlining characters in his lyrics, although a few of them vaguely allude to a breakup, and ""Read the Blessed Pages"" seems to be addressed to a former lover/bandmate. (That might be just another storytelling gambit: Murdoch's always fictionalized and mythologized the band's history in his songs, too.)</p>
<p>Musically, the band's settled into one of the modes they've repeatedly touched on in the past: a chiming, mod-inflected variation on early-70s AM pop. Stevie Jackson's showcase here, ""I'm Not Living in the Real World"", even incorporates multiple ""truck-driver's gear-shift""-style upward key changes. There's nothing as adventurous as ""Your Cover's Blown"" (or as overreaching as ""The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House"") here-- nothing, in fact, that couldn't easily have descended from early songs like ""The Stars of Track and Field"" and ""You're Just a Baby"". Still, the album includes some of their smartest, most intricate arrangements ever. ""I Didn't See It Coming"" lives up to its title, quietly slipping in one instrumental detail after another until it's worked itself up into an enormous fugue.</p>
<p>Playing it cool might be the band's strategy with the album in general, too. <i>Write About Love</i> is a grower-- the sort of record you need to play repeatedly, listening to how it fits together, before it can really ingratiate itself. Belle and Sebastian have been making records this good, and very much in this vein, for a long time; the other mistake it's easy to make with them is taking their consistent excellence for granted.</p></div>"|14731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14731-write-about-love/|8.2|Douglas Wolk

They both like pretty songs with abrasive embellishments, and their voices sound startlingly alike. As a bigger fan of Xiu Xiu than Shearwater, I had to listen to this collaborative album by Stewart and Meiburg several times before realizing that the songs where Stewart sounded more like Carey Mercer than usual were actually sung by Meiburg. I might still be getting them mixed up in some places, and that's fine-- the haziness of identity suits both musicians' personae. Unfortunately, ambiguity also pervades at the musical level to less interesting effect.</p>
<p>Stewart is always best as his most extreme-- not just the violence and volume of ""I Luv the Valley OH!"", but the restraint and grotesque intimacy of ""Fabulous Muscles"". When he goes all-out, his music can be riveting even when it's disastrous by conventional standards of taste. Meiburg, too, thrives when simmering or combusting more than anywhere in between. This album downplays both of their strengths. The band name comes from a 1971 documentary about reckless shark hunters, but the air of danger and excitement is thin. Stewart turns in a few inspired passages of ominous lyricism, but the music itself is a rickety stage for them.</p>
<p>The opening track is short and boiling, like a warm-up for a big, scary album to come. But then it just keeps warming up. ""Grunt Tube"" is good, with Stewart's layered voice hovering over the piano for a big Antony-style climax, but many other songs are forgettable and embryonic. ""Song for the Greater Jihad"" and ""Death for Christmas"" are interminable, their meandering acoustic arpeggios and organ blears haphazardly splattered with power-tool sounds and noisy percussion. They tread a safe middle road between traditional beauty and experimental ambition. I'd be all for Stewart trying out an album of traditional songs-- he's got a great voice and an under-appreciated knack for catchy tunes-- but this is too equivocal; its conventional gambits are slackened by peripheral noise and draining repetition.</p>
<p>The record was conceived and recorded in a single week, and it leaves you wondering what would have happened if they had done more sketching beforehand. A couple of the best and most polished tracks are tucked away at the end, creating the impression that Stewart and Meiburg were just starting to seriously gel when they called it a wrap. ""Gall"" has a deep and dreamy feel, with hints of classic soul, and points toward the mannered singer/songwriter-style work this could have been. ""Rendering the Juggalos"", a glorious noise-pop topiary, raises another compelling ""What if?"" It's intriguing enough to warrant hope for a second record, but this complacent first try-- neither too pretty nor too ugly, too conventional nor too experimental-- feels inessential for all but the most sympathetic Xiu Xiu and Shearwater fans.</p></div>"|14701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14701-blue-water-white-death/|5.8|Brian Howe

Guitarist/vocalist James Petralli attached a note to the posting on their homepage, asking that, should you be compelled once you clicked, you please donate some/any cash for an upcoming tour. In addition to confirming that the trio-turned-foursome's (guitarist Austin Jenkins has been welcomed to the fold) next studio LP was within days of being finished, he wrote, ""[<i>Last Day of Summer</i>] is something we made as a little summer retreat from our ongoing work on the third full length... We were super pumped to utilize a few fresh and casual musical approaches on this record."" So they likened recording to summer vacation; you can feel the freedom shine through in every cut.</p>
<p>Here, White Denim run down some ideas that might not have fit flush in the more pressurized context of a wide release: a couple of jazz instrumentals sidled up next to funk tonics and British folk forays; everything they not so secretly love anyway and all of which congeal into a family of recordings that's still totally, deliciously listenable. ""Light Light Light"" and Tropicália-tinged ""Incaviglia"" contain the aforementioned jazz intermission, the former (with production that echoes Modest Mouse) propelled along by a thumpy, roadhouse bass figure and wooly, sometimes atonal sax. They're experiments, fleshed out with great affection and an outside-the-indie-rock-box artistry that makes this band's more straightforward garage jams equally bold.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you'll find treasure. ""Tony Fatti"" is predictably twitchy and clipped, the repetitive drive of drummer Josh Block and bassist Steve Terebecki's rhythm section providing strong license for Petralli to color in and outside and all around the lines vocally. ""If You're Changing"" is a Byrds-indebted strummer that eventually shakes the pretty stuff and breaks into a strut, demonstrating White Denim's ability to sew together different styles. (The flip side is that this band isn't able to contain its many influences.) But what makes <i>Last Day of Summer</i> engaging has as much to do with White Denim's potential future as it does its roots.</p></div>"|14733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14733-last-day-of-summer/|7.4|David Bevan

He has followed the gentle trajectory of Border Community labelmates like Nathan Fake and (label founder) James Holden.  Five years, a half-dozen or so releases, one album.  One album with little fanfare and no obvious banger.  Last year's <i>Whitebox Stereo</i> EP impressed but hardly foretold future riches.  His bashful, warm-hearted techno moves slowly, but apparently not slow enough; Abbott has camouflaged it with the word ""drones.""</p>
<p>Abbott hails from Norfolk, England, home of a small village named Holkham.  The reference fits. <i>Holkham Drones</i> is techno for the English countryside.  There is heartiness and contented fatigue in Abbott's music.  It toils and labors, but only at a reasonable pace.  Abbott often finds himself on the woozier side of Kraut-oriented beat music and the more rhythmic side of British atmosphere-building.  His influences are easy enough to suss out: Harmonia and Manuel Gottsching, Seefeel, and the Cocteau Twins.  Oval is an obvious influence.</p>
<p>Abbott, though, doesn't seem to care much for context. <i>Holkham Drones</i> feels like a self-contained world in which there is always an additional hour of sunlight.  The album isn't some homogenous mishmash-- there are substantial differences between, say, the chiming, uptempo gleam of ""Hello Tazelaar"" and ""Whitebox""'s thwumping sequences-- but Abbott seems to care less about their functional variances than their enduring moods.  It's really difficult not to hear <i>Holkham Drones</i> as a <i>positive</i> album.  At times the record sounds like a summer-months complement to Pantha du Prince's wintry romance, but there's nothing epic about Abbott.  The good vibes here are tidier, perhaps as simple as enduring a day in which nothing negative really happened.</p>
<p>Abbott accomplishes this through mostly traditional sounds.  There are no skewed rhythms, no wild programming adventures on <i>Holkham Drones </i>(Abbott comes closest to adventure on ""Baalnk"", an athletic, filter-laden pyschedelic frolic).  Instead, there's a meticulous blend of wired static and gooey keyboards.  Abbott's chords and progressions can be off-balance, but his drums are major and wide open.</p>
<p>The above makes <i>Holkham Drones</i> sound boring, but it's not.  It's just regular in a way that makes some of Abbott's electronic peers seem skittish or overly ambitious.  It's the rare electronic album that requires neither patience nor insider knowledge to admire. <i>Holkham Drones</i> is modest and quick to reward.  If Border Community were taking over the world very slowly, Luke Abbott would be their newest lieutenant.  But Abbott would probably rather you just enjoy your day.</p></div>"|14730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14730-holkham-drones/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Christian Marclay is best known as an experimental turntabilist, and for collaborations with John Zorn, Lee Ranaldo, Okkyung Lee, and Elliott Sharp, among others. But he's more a conceptual artist, reaching beyond music into photography, video, collage, installation, and curation. Through these varied pursuits, he's built an impressive oeuvre, recently celebrated in wide-ranging three-month <a href=""http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/ChristianMarclay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibition</a> at New York's Whitney Museum. The downside is that, because his art is so idea-heavy, his records can be more interesting to think about than to listen to.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Take his most famous album, 1985's <i>Record Without a Cover</i>, fascinating mostly due to its lack of sleeve, which meant that accumulated scratches and debris would make it sound different every time it was played. To be fair, Marclay's discography isn't all abstract. His turntable and sample-based records can be entertaining-- 1989's <i>More Encores </i>features chopped-up collages of Johann Strauss, Louis Armstrong, and Jimi Hendrix, and 1997's hyper-cut <i>Records </i>has the cartoon-ish appeal of Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott. But his latest, <i>Graffiti Composition</i>, falls on the more overtly conceptual side, and as a musical experience it's uneven.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The concept behind it goes like this: In 1996, Marclay posted blank music sheets around the streets of Berlin, then returned to photograph them after they had been torn, smudged, and covered with graffiti. 150 of those photos were selected to form an open-ended graphical ""score""-- the kind without any traditional notes or time signatures. In 2006, that score was given to Elliott Sharp to arrange and conduct for a single performance. The resulting recording is as much a Sharp album as it is a Marclay one, since Marclay doesn't actually play on it himself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Which is not to say that the unevenness of <i>Graffiti Composition</i> is Sharp's fault. He assembled a strong lineup of guitarists for the event-- including Ranaldo, Living Colour's Vernon Reid, and Mary Halvorson-- and directed them into a busy mélange of sounds. Drop your digital needle anywhere among the six tracks, and you'll find something interesting-- a tearing note cluster, a thick swath of distortion, a beatific chord. But over 40 minutes, the tonal range of this ensemble turns out to be narrow, and their sounds blur together. Even abrupt shifts in volume feel smooth and unsurprising.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">More importantly, <i>Graffiti Composition</i> rarely coheres into something larger than a collection of sonic events. Of course, you can't expect a one-time improvised concert based on an abstract score to produce some kind of linear narrative. But even the most abstract record should possess a memorable cohesion if it's to reward repeated listens. Here, the sounds are often so unconnected, they could be rearranged at random and it would be hard to tell the difference. Perhaps <i>Graffiti Composition </i>would've been best left as a had-to-be-there event<i>, </i>memories of which wouldn't be dulled by the harsh light of repetition. As an album to be enjoyed over and over rather than admired once, its impact is fleeting.</p>

In an article for <i>Butt</i> magazine last year, band member John Holland copped to a past lifestyle of heavy drug use and teenage prostitution-- then he offered the interviewer some speed. The band was featured in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> Arts section's fall preview this year, but one member couldn't be bothered to wake up on time for the interview. When <i>Times </i>writer Ben Ratliff pressed the band on the lyrics to early single ""Trapdoor"", Holland replied, ""It doesn't really matter to me whether people know what the lyrics are or not."" Even when <i>XLR8R</i>'s Brandon Ivers recently asked Salem about their much-blogged-about disaster of a FADER Fort appearance at last year's SXSW-- a performance that could be featured in the dictionary as the definition of ""not giving a shit""-- band members Heather Marlatt and Jack Donoghue claimed not to have seen the video, while Holland later stated about the band's live presence, ""I don't even care. I totally don't.""</p>
<p>So it's safe to say that Salem aren't concerned that the slowed-down, culturally mishmashed electronic music on their debut, <i>King Night--</i> referred to by some as witch house, drag, or haunted house-- has its share of supporters and detractors alike, and has inspired endless arguments about authenticity, cultural sensitivity, and whether ""witch house"" is a pretty stupid fucking name for a genre, anyway. But when you actually <i>listen</i> to <i>King Night</i>, it's easy to be amazed that these dickheads made a record so interesting and sonically detailed. Their early original material and Gucci Mane remixes spawned a legion of imitators who attempted to replicate the formula with shoddy craftsmanship; <i>King Night</i>, accordingly, finds Salem pushing their sound far enough to create artistic distance from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>They pull this off mostly by way of increased fidelity, which, thanks to the mixing talents of Dave Sardy

Oasis), teases the sonic depth out of these songs. The title track didn't need its ""O Holy Night""-lifted melody to sound like it was recorded in an Austrian cathedral, but there's that chorus, their voices being abused by the debris launched in the air by the track's low-end explosions. Album centerpiece and highlight ""Release Da Boar"" starts out with a city-street pulse and midnight tones, and slowly opens to reveal a brutally beautiful void where Marlatt's dead-eyed vocals hover in an amniotic haze. Even ""Redlights""-- aka the ""FADER Fort YouTube Video Song""-- is lent a spacey atmosphere, its slow burn not too far off from vintage Slumberland noise pop.</p>
<p>Despite what some say, this is music, and it's music made by people with wide-ranging tastes. The aforementioned Slumberland similarity is only one of the genre signifiers employed during the course of <i>King Night</i>, as the band traffics in crawled-out rave-recalling synth lines (""Asia""), low-riding Houston lean (""Sick""), grime-flecked trip-hop (""Trapdoor""), and the hollow, thudding rhythms of juke and footwork (""Hound""), just to name a few. That they're able to incorporate these disparate sounds in a recognizable fashion proves their ability; the fact that, through it all, Salem still sound like themselves and no one else is a testament to their vision.</p>
<p>And if you don't think Salem have done something impressive here? That's okay. Honestly-- and this gets lost in the hype cycle that most fresh-sounding new acts get sucked into these days-- this music is not for everyone. Not because of its ""Werewolf bar mitzvah"" affectations, but because it's just not the easiest thing to bump in your headspace. Some will take issue with the EQ'd-to-shit click tracks, or the sheer noise that's being produced here. Personally, I'm not a fan of the pitched-down, chopped-and-screwed rapping that pops up periodically-- not because of the arguable minstrelsy, but because I just think it's an aesthetically ugly add-on this music could do without.</p>
<p>However, considering that snatches of decipherable lyrics reveal threats of rape and murder, as well as excessive use of the word ""bitch,"" maybe we're better off not knowing what they're saying, regardless of how they go about it. These are the contradictions you run into when inhabiting the world of <i>King Night</i>. And while it's possible that discussi

on of these contradictions might end up outlasting the music itself, it's hard to deny that the group has carved out an original and compelling niche.</p>

Since then, drummer Janet Weiss released albums with Quasi and Stephen Malkmus' Jicks, while guitarist Carrie Brownstein embarked on a comedy career with Fred Armisen and became a music blogger for NPR. (The two women also recently announced a new project together, Wild Flag, alongside Mary Timony.) But Corin Tucker has been strangely quiet-- which is ironic given that she was the shrieking-banshee warbler of the group. Out of the spotlight, Tucker has spent the last four years attending to her family in Portland, Oregon-- she has two children with filmmaker Lance Bangs-- and, more recently, working on her own songs around her kids' school and playgroup schedules with a new eponymous band that includes former Unwound drummer Sara Lund and guitarist Seth Lorinczi of the Golden Bears.</p>
<p>These new tracks, which now comprise <i>1,000 Years</i>, are recognizably Tucker's, though they derive their intensity not from volatile guitars, driving rhythms, or brash vocal melodies, but from their surprisingly muted, slow-burning intimacy. So be forewarned, though: fans jonesing for a Sleater-Kinney fix will be disappointed. Instead of bursting into the expected shrieking choruses, these songs smolder. Melodies meander, encouraging patience in their listeners. Tucker uses her bold caterwaul sparingly, which is partially a shame since we are so starved for it, but also gives great weight to the few moments when she finally unfurls the full force of her yelp (as on ""Riley"", one of the few tracks that recalls Tucker's more incendiary Sleater-Kinney past).</p>
<p>Yet these songs have a quiet power of their own, and many surprise listeners by relying on gently finger-picked guitar lines or dreamy, sparse piano arrangements (as on the originally-made-for-<i>Twilight: New Moon</i>
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
track ""Miles Away"" or the opening of the life-during-recession tale
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
""Thrift Store Coats""). Without Weiss' fierce fills and Brownstein's fiery riffage, Tucker's tunes sound tame and downcast. Sometimes that restraint is lovely, as on ""Half a World Away"", a spare, staccato track about the difficulty of being separated from Bangs while he's traveling for work. That song is a bit of a fake-out for S-K fans, as it's built on a hiccupping vocal melody that recalls <i>One Beat</i>'s ""Combat Rock"" in its verses, but fails to explode into a hollered chorus, which only makes its lyrical longing more palpable. But sometimes that restraint disappoints, as on the wilting, acoustic ""Dragon"", whose cutesy string pizzicatos only add to its overworked chamber-pop ambiance.</p>
<p>This album's strengths-- its intimacy, its containment, its subtlety-- are not the qualities that made Sleater-Kinney great, but it would be ungenerous to dismiss this because it's not as thrilling, confrontational, or exuberant. Plus, <i>1,000 Years</i> is clearly a personal collection-- it's hard to not hear songs like the aforementioned ""Half a World Away"" or the loneliness-tinged ""It's Always Summer"", with its lines about hotel bars and counting the days, as autobiographical tales of a marriage that is often plagued by work-related distance and separation. And the comparably subdued nature of the album's music complements such lyrical confidences. So, if you are looking for catharsis via Sleater-Kinney, pull out your copy of <i>Dig Me Out</i> or <i>The Woods</i>, but if you are interested in where Corin Tucker is now, <i>1,000 Years</i> provides a thoughtful, subtle snapshot.</p></div>"|14700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14700-1000-years/|6.5|Rebecca Raber

Music from this sphere tends to move pretty fast, but in the case of these three, they've mostly stuck with variations on their distinctive, well-honed sound. For Jeck, that sound is built from old vinyl. His training is as a visual artist, and his primary medium is his live show that sometimes touches on installation art. Using a few turntables, a keyboard, and pedals, Jeck expertly mixes, loops, and layers passages from old records and molds them into an instantly identifiable aesthetic. At his best, he makes some of the most moving and replayable experimental music around.</p>
<p>There are ideas running through Jeck's music that have been at the forefront of conversations in the last couple of years. He digs up cultural artifacts from the past (in his case, vinyl) and recontextualizes them, so his music touches on nostalgia and memory and the passage of time, and it invites you to meditate on the way that cultural information disappears and reappears and what that might mean. But where younger artists are applying these ideas to the music of their childhood and turning over signifiers of the 1980s and 90s, Jeck takes a longer view. He's almost 60 years old, and for him, the entire history of recorded sound is fair game. Couple this with his high-art background, where he's much more likely to play an auditorium or art gallery than a club, and it makes sense that Jeck's music has a symphonic character. His records feel more like classical music, and, unlike so much turntable-based music since the rise of hip-hop in the late 1970s, they have no overt connection to pop. Jeck's music seems designed for a big room where people want a certain kind of overpowering experience, and he knows how to deliver for this audience.</p>
<p><i>An Ark for the Listener</i> is Jeck's first widely available solo album since 2008's <i>Sand</i> (he had a vinyl-only live album in between, along with a couple of other small-scale releases). Where <i>Sand</i> was built around a central idea-- it was a concept album that riffed on the notion of the ""fanfare""-- and had a unified sound, <i>An Ark for the Listener</i> is held together more loosely. The music here was developed in live performance and was based around a stanza from an epic Gerard Manley Hopkins poem about a maritime disaster, ""The Wreck of the Deutschland"", but there aren't obvious connections between that source and the music at hand. <i>Ark</i> comes over more like a survey of some of the things Jeck does best.</p>
<p>I will say that the Hopkins poem that inspired the project explores death, and <i>Ark</i> is an especially dark LP that is particularly heavy on drone, as Jeck loops and layers dissonant passages of strings into tense and uneasy held tones. ""The All of Water"" is especially stirring in this vein, with a richness in texture reminiscent of the spiky drones of Tim Hecker, even though the sources here sound like old classical recordings. The following ""The Pilot (Among Our Shoals)"", which builds on that template and adds a drum roll and indistinct screeching tones that echo and flange wildly, is the sort of track that virtually no one else could have pulled off. It feels like a scratchy black and white film with bits of music from all over fluttering into the frame, and somehow manages to reach back 100 years while sounding utterly contemporary. And then ""Ark"" finds Jeck experimenting with a greater amount of space, as he opens with a long passage of creepy bell tones that sound like a ghostly music box from another realm. Each track here has its own character and establishes its own context, and Jeck's finely-tuned ear manages to bind them together. And if <i>An Ark for the Listener</i> may not be the best place to start for the curious (<i>Stoke</i> or <i>7</i>, both of which add more lyricism to the mix, are better in that regard), it finds him working at a characteristically high level, which is very welcome indeed.</p></div>"|14724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14724-an-ark-for-the-listener/|7.9|Mark Richardson

Just look at the guest list on this thing: Helmed by Pyramids' R. Loren, the SWWW crew includes Swans' Ted Parsons on drums, Prurient's Dominick Fernow handling the noise, James Blackshaw on piano, vocals from Marissa Nadler, and a plethora of other duties handled by members of Unwound, Krallice, Slowdive, Nadja, Current 93, and more. Add to the fact that the record was inspired by a tripped-out encounter Loren had with <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> author Stephen Crane's ghost, and you've got what appears to be one heady, crowded outing on your hands. In reality, <i>Sailors With Wax Wings</i> is anything but convoluted, using most of its sticky-slow 53 minutes to focus on ghosted textures, squalling riffage, and melodic theatrics. Think Earth taking on the brash demonstrativeness of Muse, and you're pretty close.</p>
<p>The result is neither as mismatched nor potentially intriguing as that equation might indicate. Sailors With Wax Wings are instead perfectly happy doing one thing and doing it fairly well. Almost every track (each of which derives its title from the hand of Crane himself) follows a prescribed set of rules and features a few definable, overlapping segments: swelling guitars, wind-swept atmospherics, shrouded vocals, and the occasional break in the slow-rolling tension for nuanced flecks of cello or piano.</p>
<p>Possibly as a byproduct of their literary genesis, these songs seem built to take you on little journeys. When executed properly, the results feel genuinely cinematic: ""Yes, I Have a Thousand Tongues, and Nine and Ninety-Nine Lie"" opens as a goth-swaddled chant-along before settling into an airy, cosmic psych breakdown. Moments like this seem to favor the drawn-out, peak-and-valley structure of these songs, but after the same effect eight times in a row, <i>Sailors With Wax Wings</i> is a bit harder to swallow whole.</p>
<p>The lack of deviation helps foster a cohesive, singular feel-- impressive considering how many hands are in this pot. So it's to be expected that this exercise could get a little tiring after a while. When attention is paid to detail, it's easy to get back onboard: Genuinely mighty guitars make it easy to forget ones that are noodled aimlessly, and the ethereally twisted jangle of ""There Was One Who Sought a New Road"" makes it easy to forgive the dull waltz of the following ""Strange That I Should Have Grown So Suddenly Blind"". But with so many wicked tongues at Loren's disposal, it may prove too difficult to overlook <i>Sailors With Wax Wings</i>' underdeveloped spots.</p></div>"|14707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14707-sailors-with-wax-wings/|6.0|Zach Kelly

Long Island's Roc Marciano follows his own advice. Once destined to be an also-ran of Busta Rhymes' Flipmode Squad, Marciano has locked himself in a dilapidated apartment and recorded a masterwork of insular, borderline-sociopathic hip-hop, much in the vein of the mid-1990s heyday of Mobb Deep. Prodigy once threatened to stab you with the bone of your own nose, and Marciano also comes from the streets of pre-Giuliani New York, where it's so dark you can barely see three feet ahead of you, where ""niggas [are] duct-taped up and mistaken for lunch."" In Marciano's New York, the weak get devoured and smacking someone is explicitly referred to as an involuntary movement.</p>
<p><i>Marcberg</i> could be heard as revivalism in the vein of <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Pt. II</i> from kindred spirit Raekwon, mainly because it sounds like it was released in 1992. Marciano still refers to police officers as ""jakes,"" Naughty by Nature and Earl Boykins(!), as well as London Fog(!!) are all referenced. The beats are minor-key, sample-based boom-bap, as if Swizz Beats, shiny suits, and rappers in skinny jeans never happened. The key to the record's appeal is that while it clearly pays homage to a bygone hip-hop era, it never sounds dated or overtly reverent.</p>
<p>Much of that is due to Marciano's hyper-syllabic and percussive flow, narrative flair, and fastidious eye for detail as both a rapper and producer. Along with the eerily visceral thump of ""Pop"", he keeps his eye on the kids on roller skates, hoping none of them get hit with a stray bullet during an impending gunfight. The blaxploitation groove on ""Whateva Whateva"" serves as the perfect backdrop for Marciano's gifted wordplay and dark comedy, where Marciano threatens to ""pop the air out of your balloon and the spare, too."" None of the music on <i>Marcberg</i> rises above a dull roar, but that makes it that much scarier; here, you have no idea when someone is going to jump out of the corner and shoot you.</p>
<p>Even when Marciano tips toward cliché, he finds a way to make it work. The whole drug-as-woman metaphor has been around forever, which makes ""Jungle Fever"" all the more impressive. A tender ballad centered around a bright-but-dusty piano sample, Marciano attacks the subject of dealing cocaine by envisioning it as an interracial relationship. But what makes ""Jungle Fever"" special is that while other rappers might adopt the obvious ""Hey, white girl, let's have fun"" pose of the song's premise, Marciano lets his guard down after he and the girl in question start making money together, letting her buy him clothes and hiding her from his mother. By the end, he's waiting by the phone for her to call, stressing over when she's going to return, or if she's even going to return at all.</p>
<p>""Fuck being a taxpayer,"" Marciano snorts. If <i>Marcberg</i> sounds so claustrophobic and unconcerned about the rap scene surrounding it (one that has changed over at least four or five times since this record's closest counterparts have been recorded), it could be because Marciano has been too busy honing his craft to worry about swag rap.</p></div>"|14720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14720-marcberg/|8.1|Martin Douglas

Her complex arrangements evoke  emotional turmoil as the songs ping-pong between excitement and panic,  ecstasy and despair, extraordinary confidence and harrowing self-doubt.  It's intense stuff, and given its jittery rhythms and extreme treble,  it's not always easy on the ears. Still, Stern's songs invite a  strong bond with the listener-- for all its charged-up rock power, this is intimate music. It's like jumping headfirst into someone's psyche.</p>
<p>Stern's last two albums were long on self-directed pep talks, and channeled  the nervous energy of her guitar playing into optimistic anthems like  ""Ruler"" and ""Transformer"". Her latest isn't quite so  positive. Though her words still show some faith in her ability to  overcome adversity and change bad habits, the tone is far from  triumphant-- in fact, some of these songs are outright defeatist. Stern's  approach to songwriting and performing hasn't changed much, but  the mood is darker, and the lyrics linger on loss, regret, doubt, and  failed love. It's an album full of heavy, noisy catharsis, and the lines  that stand out amidst the clatter are the ones most at odds with the  can-do spirit of her last record. The fact that she spent so much time  in self-help mode last time around makes the moments of crippling  self-doubt all the more gutting-- it's hard to hear the woman who once  declared, ""nothing can hold me down!"" and sold ""WIN 'MARNIE' WIN"" t-shirts  at her merch table insist that she is ""not enough"" on two consecutive  tracks. You just want her to believe in herself all the time.</p>
<p>The  bad vibes on <i>Marnie Stern</i> have a way of highlighting an expressive,  emotionally resonant quality that's been in her work all along. ""For  Ash"", a song written in memory of a deceased ex-boyfriend, opens the  album by cycling through stages of grief in waves of speedy riffs and  harsh percussion before ending on a lovely, brittle melody-- ""I want to  be in your imminent, elegant light."" ""Transparency Is the New Mystery""  is the closest Stern has come to a power ballad, and its equal measure  of longing and hopelessness is totally heartbreaking. ""Her Confidence"" gains its power from an atypically blunt  riff that blurs the line between terror and empowerment. Many of these  songs would be little more than pyrotechnics and flamboyant gestures in  lesser hands, but Stern infuses every moment of her songs with odd humor  and wounded, fragile humanity. It's impossible to miss the distinct  person at the center of this noise.</p>
<p>Given  that Stern is a genre of one-- art-metal math-rock  bubblegum pop, basically-- there's always going to be some novelty  factor to her music for certain listeners. But with this set of songs, she's proving that  the bells and whistles of her style are less important than what she's  trying to express. This isn't to say that her technical prowess isn't  still dazzling, or that her chemistry with drummer Zach Hill has become  anything less than a thrill. As usual, Hill is her secret weapon. His  percussion consistently enhances and complements her parts, and rarely  in obvious ways. In some songs, such as ""Gimme"" and ""Female Guitar  Players Are the New Black"", his fills seem to fight it out with Stern's  notes, while in others, his accents  fall on surprising beats. There's plenty here for musicians to analyze  and dissect with envy, but first and foremost, this is an album for the  body and the soul.</p></div>"|14705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14705-marnie-stern/|7.9|Matthew Perpetua

Sometimes they were even addressed to Pallett <i>himself</i>. Despite this, <i>Heartland</i> managed to be Pallett's most accessible album to date.</p>
<p>The four-track EP <i>A Swedish Love Story</i> is a continuation of <i>Heartland</i>, and reflects Pallett's new live setup, which features multi-instrumentalist Thomas Gill augmenting Pallett's once-solo performances. Gill's presence provides Pallett more flexibility onstage, and apparently in the studio too, as this EP nudges Pallett's sound into slightly less familiar territory. While <i>Heartland </i>opened up his previously razor-thin aesthetic to electronics and percussion, the most noticeable addition here is the increased use of synthetic drum sounds. Pallett mostly crafts fussy orchestral pop, and the addition of beats (albeit polite ones) hints that his elegant but forceful stringwork wouldn't be out of place in a more danceable setting. The shift is most pronounced on ""Don't Stop"", which rigs a juddering hip-hop beat to slightly dissonant violin in service of Pallett's graceful melodies-- which, by the way, are every bit as anthemic as those of his Arcade Fire colleagues.</p>
<p>Despite the EP title, <i>A Swedish Love Story</i> is nowhere as cohesive or fluid as <i>Heartland</i>. Pallett usually works in set pieces, but here the lyrics leave a little too much to the imagination-- you'd need a libretto, or at least a productive gchat with Pallett himself, to fill in the blanks. Perhaps the biggest revelation is one that should've been clear all along-- that Pallett's blanched vocal tone isn't far removed from the mid-80s bedsit pop it's sometimes compared to. ""Honour the Dead, or Else"" is evidence enough of that, with its Morrissey-level misery situated amongst flanged guitars, hollowed kettle drums, and a plucked violin that veers ever so close to a synthesizer string tone.</p>
<p>Still, if you were hoping this sort of low-stakes venture would find Pallett taking wilder chances, it may be a minor disappointment. Even with the apparent shifts and changes, all four of <i>Swedish</i>'s songs would have fit snugly on <i>Heartland</i>. But Pallett is hardly running in place, either. In fact, he's created such a comparison-resistant framework for his unique sensibilities that no matter where he takes his sound, he'll sound like no one other than himself.</p></div>"|14723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14723-a-swedish-love-story-ep/|7.4|Ian Cohen

It was not a new Bon Iver tune but a cover culled from the songbook of Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten. The way Vernon wandered through the slow, often overwhelming beauty of that song, one walked away from it feeling as if he needed to hear more from and about Van Etten. It's a song that seizes you.</p>
<p>Van Etten came to Brooklyn by way of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and her parents' basement in New Jersey. Her first album, the self-released <i>Because I Was In Love</i>, was a tuneful set of simple, spare, acoustic-based travails. It wasn't remarkable, but at its heart was a voice that begged to be uncovered: an instrument as chilling as it was opaque, as wounded as the title of the record seemed to suggest. <i>Epic</i>, her first wide release, feels like the unveiling of her full talents. Classic songwriting with an ethereal delivery is central to her appeal, but it's her sense of confidence that really sells it, as the first lines of opener ""A Crime"" attest: ""To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime/ To admit I'm still in love with you after all this time/ I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die."" On paper, those words might read a bit like coffee-shop fodder. But the cool grace with which Van Etten belts every line, and the dangerous force with which she strums every first count, make for an explosive sound that didn't seem possible from her earlier. She sounds as though she's arrived.</p>
<p>From there, Van Etten doesn't loosen her grip. As <i>Epic</i> progresses, her vocals couple with an array of sonics and styles (see: the pedal-steel country saunter of ""Save Yourself"", the electric punch of ""Peace Sign""), though it's the slower, more atmospheric numbers that remain the album's most arresting. ""DsharpG"" is one gorgeous, six-minute crescendo, Van Etten's voice haloed by Mellotron and kick drum. Lyrically, she explores relationships from a number of vantage points, and <i>Epic</i> was recorded so intimately that Van Etten sounds as close as she does gutted. It all comes together on the hopeful tones of ""Love More"", as her voice pirouettes and heaves over a story of learning to love again in spite of pain: ""Tied to my bed, I was younger then, I had nothing to spend,"" she sighs. ""But time on you, it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more."" And so the titular mantra unfolds. It's one of the more emotionally draining songs I can remember hearing, and yet as soon as it's over, it turns out I want to listen again.</p></div>"|14690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14690-epic/|7.8|David Bevan

In the intervening time, the Pack's producer, Young L, has developed into a formidable talent, and rapper Lil B has overshadowed the group that spawned him. Lil B feels like a non-factor here, since <i>Wolfpack Party</i> bears no resemblance to the meme-generating phenomenon that is Lil B the solo artist. The album works mainly as a business card for Young L, mixed with a love letter to some of the more grating elements of late-00s club music. Oh yeah, and most of the rapping is pretty dull.</p>
<p>There are a few notable tracks on <i>Wolfpack Party</i>, the best of which is ""Bend That Corner"" featuring Husalah, one of West Coast rap's most charismatic and undervalued performers. Unfortunately, his scene-stealing verse draws immediate attention to the album's biggest weakness-- a lack of vibrant rap performances. It reminds listeners how generally vapid the rappers in the Pack are-- and not just topically, but stylistically. It's a struggle to recall a creative lyrical moment on the entire record that doesn't include Husalah's reference to his ""'73 chariot.""</p>
<p>Still, Young L is a force to be reckoned with, having developed a personal touch that makes his tracks more readily identifiable. His beats are taut, shuddering constructs, relying on novel use of fresh and abrasive sounds, and he creates a good balance of creativity meeting songcraft. By contrast, the Cataracts, who produce most of the remaining cuts, channel 2007-era L.A. club music for inspiration (surprisingly, Lindsey Lohan co-DJ Steve Aoki reportedly makes a partial production appearance alongside Young L, rather than the Cataracts, on ""Dance Floor""). The production duo provides a cheesier party vibe that provides balance to an otherwise ""banger""-heavy record, but their lack of craft and overreliance on 00s dance-rap clichés are largely to blame for the record's more embarrassing moments, from the trance-rap title track to ""Sex on the Beach""-- the less said, the better.</p>
<p>As a beatmaker's business card, <i>Wolfpack Party</i> makes a great case for Young L's rising profile. There's a dynamic energy to his production that few other producers can harness. But as a whole, the harder <i>Wolfpack Party</i> tries to be a fun party record, the more forced it feels. And as solid as L's beats are, they can't stand up on their own. Here's hoping his future collaborators are on his level.</p></div>"|14719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14719-wolfpack-party/|5.7|David Drake

Formed in 2007 from the remnants of the band Shitshorm after drummer Frankie Rose moved on to Vivian Girls, Grass Widow's three members share vocal duties, and the voices range from child-like to choir-ready, making for a delivery that can be harmonious when it needs to be, but is just as interesting when it isn't.</p>
<p>Hannah Lew (bass), Raven Mahon (guitar), and Lillian Maring (drums) each seem to represent a different set of emotions with their voices-- say, timid and shy, sad and mournful, and strong and bitter-- as if they're performing three different dramatic parts. This probably isn't their intention, but the mix of tones is nonetheless a powerful complement to the textures played out on their three instruments, and the vocals add a distinctive pop element to the post-punk roots of the music. It's a sound in keeping with Grass Widow's self-titled debut, released last year on the small label Make a Mess (and followed by an EP on Captured Tracks last August). Those songs, few of which clocked in over three minutes, feature the same raw, disjointed guitar patterns, call-and-response vocals, sashaying, tambourine-driven rhythms, and delightful, quick-shifting harmonies that sometimes sound centuries-old. The band gets an improved production quality on <i>Past Time</i>, but it's still bare-bones, with no dramatic effects added in the studio.</p>
<p>If the trio wants to bring in more drama, they add more instruments. ""Give Me Shapes"" is a sliver of a song at 1:49, but it shimmies and charges with all the force of a longer song with help from a string section. It's a nice surprise to hear the strings, which show up again with more to say on ""Uncertain Memory"". Some listeners might wish they'd come back again a few more times. Maring's rapid, pitter-patter drums and the simple Liz Phair-like vocal melody on ""Old Disguise"" prove that the band doesn't always need the extra help, but there are certain songs that feel more like sketches: less structured, less keen to find resolutions. Pinback comes to mind: lots of surf-inspired noodling, but none of surf rock's woozy effects, and sometimes a flat dramatic progression from start to finish. But sometimes, as on ""Landscape"", the vocals swoop in to save the song, cutting through the instruments' hollow searching with bright harmonies.</p>
<p>While there is certainly a catchy element to these songs, what holds some of them back is the deemphasized lyrics. The songs may sound lovely, but the vocals are recorded at the same volume as the instruments, so it takes a conscious, exclusive listen of the lyrics to notice that they're there, then to try to parse them and connect them to the music. Exacerbating this is the fact that there are three voices: They often sing right over each other with three different sets of lyrics, enhancing each other on a musical level, but dizzying the listener on a verbal one. <i>Past Time</i> certainly isn't background music, but the vocalists' missives might be understood as simply the core of the band's sound-- and perhaps something more, if you're able to divert your attention from the charms of the music.</p></div>"|14595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14595-past-time/|6.7|Liz Colville

On recordings as Manitoba or Caribou, Dan Snaith exhibits the demeanor of an electro-psychedelic perfectionist, layering sounds and textures into a dense swirl. That's the kind of drag-and-drop approach that doesn't always translate well to the stage, but it's never thrown off Snaith, who has turned his band into a ferocious live animal. With a PhD in mathematics, Snaith is aware of the Boadrum Theorem-- live awesomeness increases exponentially by the number of drummers onstage-- and bolsters that rhythmic attack with projections, costumes, and a willingness to expand upon a song's recorded blueprint.</p>
<p>For 2009's All Tomorrow's Parties festival in New York, Snaith was able to indulge those practices to their fullest with the 15-piece Caribou Vibration Ensemble, a two-off (including a Toronto warm-up show) project now commoditized into a limited-edition double-vinyl live release. You want drummers? They've got four of them, plus a horn section led by Sun Ra sideman Marshall Allen, Four Tet's Kieran Hebden on the knobs, and a gaggle of other friends to broadcast the noises in Snaith's head. The crowded stage allows him to gets closer than ever to replicating the overstuffed studio sound of Caribou, while also enabling a few flashes of deep musical exploration.</p>
<p>The songs picked for this set were already pretty busy on record, where Snaith seems determined to find the maximum amount of sound he can pack into a song without collapsing into chaos. Here, he finds that tipping point and then unleashes Allen's alto saxophone into the carnage on the other side. ""Skunks"", from the Manitoba days, already had a healthy dose of free-jazz skronk, so it doesn't change much under this strategy. But ""Barnowl"", from 2005's <i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i>, gets a full makeover, almost doubling its recording length. On the album version, the song's motorik beat chugs along relatively unperturbed; here,
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
it's tormented and decimated until it flies apart into a thrilling wall of freeform noise, then reconstructed more menacingly than before.</p>
<p>Not everything here is so densely exhausting. ""Melody Day"" is a haunting exception, reversing the more-is-more premise and stripping down the original to harmonies, a moving, unnoisy sax solo, and ghostly electronics. Other songs don't receive dramatic reworkings from their album version, but still get a fresh gloss from the large ensemble taking the place of backing tapes. Manitoba/Caribou records benefit from being played at loud volume, but here the live mix does the work for you, unleashing the overwhelming drum corps stampede  of ""Every Time She Turns Round It's Her Birthday"" and ""Hendrix with Ko"" while Allen's horn section wails like a circus tent full of frightened elephants.</p>
<p>Of course, hearing that noisy ruckus on wax is likely a poor substitute for seeing the set live; the multiplicative majesty of multiple drum sets is an effect that needs to be felt as much as heard. Through home speakers, the set feels a bit claustrophobic in a way that probably didn't hurt experiencing it live in the Catskills, where all those vibrating reeds and drum heads would wash over and through the crowd. Such is the curse of any live recording, which makes it all the more important for the event being documented to be something special, to provide more than just crowd noise and stage banter. That's not a problem here, where the brief, fascinating existence of Snaith's impractical ensemble was definitely worth preserving.</p></div>"|14714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14714-caribou-vibration-ensemble/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

Basically a rundown of hot new acts at the time, turns out the thing was pretty farsighted-- more than a couple of the bands it featured (Girls, Salem) went on to find big audiences. It was also the first time many of us heard Cameron Mesirow aka Glasser, whose track ""Apply"" was one of the disc's standouts. Back then Glasser was a solo project-- just Mesirow singing over GarageBand beats-- but the song had a great mix of electronic drag and skyward pop, and showcased Mesirow's impressive vocal range.</p>
<p>Fast-forward almost two years later and it seems like the kind of music Glasser makes-- sort of quasi-mystical, swirling electro-pop-- has become a lot more popular. On the indie side you've got Bat for Lashes (Glasser's closest sonic relative), Zola Jesus, and Fever Ray, as well as Florence and the Machine threatening to break big in the mainstream. So the timing's definitely right for Glasser's full-length, and with <i>Ring</i> she's enlisted the help of producers Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid to help flesh out her sound. Tracks are still based on Mesirow's early sketches, but now they've got more weight and sheen.</p>
<p>There isn't an easy descriptor for Glasser's sound-- she incorporates bits of tropical pop, tribal percussion, and a couple of different strains of electronic music. Her songs sidestep traditionally linear arrangements for a more open, circular approach-- they kind of swoosh around without pausing at verse-chorus intersections. Interesting as this is, the main draw of Mesirow's music is her voice-- warm and flexible, she can bend it to suit different moods and tempos. <i>Ring</i>'s best tracks, like ""Home"" and ""Glad"", create space for her vocals to soar. In ""Apply"", which gets an update here, heavy tribal percussion and grinding synths give way to a sunny refrain where she just bursts into the upper register.</p>
<p>Mesirow's from California and comes from a family of artists, and her lyrics, which are sometimes vague and loosely metaphysical, bear the mark of a free spirit. To be honest, they can skew a tad squishy for me, but it's easy to overlook a line like, ""What's real can be anywhere, so put your faith in me and we can be free,"" when it's sung so beautifully. Content-wise, the most interesting cut is ""T"", an ode to Mesirow's best friend, New York artist Tauba Auerbach. Presumably the two share a special bond, both getting a certain level of fame from their creativity, and it's about experiencing something only one other person you know can identify with.</p>
<p>Separate all of this from <i>Ring</i> and you're still left with a remarkably listenable album. People have compared Glasser to Björk but this isn't difficult music-- ultimately it feels more in line with loose, melodically generous records by Joni Mitchell or maybe even Feist. Granted, there's tons of sounds in this thing (in addition to the genre-blending are all sorts of orchestral and percussive touches) but Mesirow and her producers never let it become overwhelming. It's not an incredibly daring or cerebral record-- <i>Ring</i> is electic, beat-heavy, and easy to like. A sneakily confident debut that should please listeners at almost every turn.</p></div>"|14703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14703-ring/|8.0|Joe Colly

For more than a decade, Boris have moved seamlessly from rigorous thrash to colossal drone to soaring psychedelic metal; but those two qualities-- concision and power-- have often been mutually exclusive. These four tracks, however, each feel like a condensed epic that allows the band's love of dynamics and development to find thoughtful focus. And then, over it all, former Cult singer Ian Astbury croons about animals and witches. Yikes.</p>
<p>The brisk, confident rock punch of the Cult often swept Astbury's histrionic vocals inside. Tracks like ""She Sells Sanctuary"" and ""Love Removal Machine"" guided his bombast, never letting him shine too long in any particular spotlight. On <i>BXI</i>, Astbury treats his position as the temporary leader of one of the best, most interesting rock bands in the world like a bully pulpit. During opener ""Teeth and Claws"", Boris teases again and again, lurching forward just to ease back the volume. Astbury takes the empty space as an invitation to merely roar. Closer ""Magickal Child"" opens beautifully, with electronic hum and drifting chords; when the band explodes in a haze of cymbals and distortion, Astbury leans back to belt some blend of Wiccan and New Age ideals in a stagy, lachrymose delivery.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>BXI</i>-- ""Boris multiplied by Ian,"" we can presume-- is one of the most ignorable releases for a band with nearly a hundred of them. It's not a complete waste, though, neither with regard to the songs themselves nor with what it might mean for Boris' future. Again, the playing is excellent, and when Astbury backs away from the microphone, Boris sound masterful. Guitarist Wata leads the quartet through a cover of the Cult's 1985 hit ""Rain"", and her soft, wispy coos offer the perfect contrast to the band's rhythmic maw and suffocating guitars. Boris capture the march of the original take perfectly but send it spiraling through the final minutes.</p>
<p>The negative flipside to Boris' eclectic approach has been a tendency to make records that feel like mixtapes, records without a real aim (see 2008's <i>Smile</i>, especially). But the material on <i>BXI</i> proves that, just as they're able to devote an album to resplendent drone, they're as capable of crafting an album of relatively straightforward though still imaginative rock'n'roll. Maybe it took Ian Astbury to show them they could do it; here's hoping that, now that <i>we</i> know, they no longer require his imperial, aggressive British lead.</p></div>"|14713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14713-bxi-ep/|3.3|Grayson Currin

His 15-year recording career has found him equally at home as a leader and collaborator. He's a member of Fieldwork, has worked with hip-hop producer Mike Ladd and innovative saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, he's been involved with members of the M-Base improvisation collective and written orchestral works-- he's even on the new Das Racist mixtape (he co-produced the hidden track, ""Free Jazzmataz""). Last year, he made some waves outside of jazz with his trio's thunderous cover of M.I.A.'s ""Galang"", and this year he received the Jazz Journalists Association Jazz Award as Musician of the Year, which is a pretty big deal (he's keeping company with Ornette Coleman and Herbie Hancock there).</p>
<p>But for all that, he's never done a record all on his own until now. A lot of jazz pianists eventually get around to a solo LP-- the instrument provides an ample platform-- and when they do, it becomes a matter of figuring out how to structure it. You can give it a conceptual underpinning, focus on one element of your style, or  essentially do a studio recital that aims to show some range, and Iyer takes the last route, cushioning a suite of originals with a couple of clutches of interpretations. Among the covers, the two best both tackle classics by Duke Ellington. Iyer's version of the 1927 Ellington/Bubber Miley composition ""Black &amp; Tan Fantasy"" embraces the weird, dark drag of the original, ending quotation of Chopin's funeral march and all. The original ""Fleurette Africaine"", from Duke's 1962 collaboration with Charles Mingus and Max Roach <i>Money Jungle</i>, was a beautiful, diffuse meditation-- Iyer's take is stormy and slow, cloaked in the same shade of midnight blue as the Anish Kapoor sculpture that adorns the album cover.</p>
<p>His version of Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke's 1942 compositional breakthrough ""Epistrophy"" is off the wall, dancing around the melod
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
y and speeding up Monk's left-hand patterns to a dizzying blur in tune with the sheet-of-sound technique Iyer has perfected over the years. He uses it more as a launch pad for a series of exploratory runs and tone clouds where he occasionally hints at Monk's rhythmic eccentricities. His cover of Michael Jackson's <i>Thriller</i> ballad ""Human Nature"" seems like it took a lot of planning to devise-- a few clever reharmonizations of the original's descending chorus hook keep it from getting too twinkly, but it's hard to pull off an instrumental version of a song like that without sounding precious in places, and it does at times.</p>
<p>The originals Iyer places at the heart of the album begin ominously with ""Prelude: Heartpiece"", a track that lives in the lower octaves of the piano-- a gentle, high pulse is the only ray of light. ""Autoscopy"" is more like an earthquake, with fingers flying as patterns collide and the piece appears to collapse on itself at nearly every turn before settling into a quiet middle-- Iyer has a physics degree, and it's as though he set out to write a song that's essentially a self-ordering system, solidifying out of chaos. The interlocking figures of ""Patterns"" work on a similar principle-- the piece proceeds elastically, each new surge forward sounding like the path of a ball set to bounce within a room.</p>
<p><i>Solo</i> ultimately reveals little we didn't already know about Vijay Iyer as a pianist, but to hear him explore these facets of his sound on his own, with no one to lean on, is still interesting. The central suite  is where the album and the artist truly shine-- Iyer's concepts of harmony and rhythm are laid out so clearly here that it will be interesting to go back through his other records and search for the analogues in his group work, to see where his collaborators fit into his patterns.</p></div>"|14702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14702-solo/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Theories crumble, according to the compilation's own description, when trying explain the current wave of lo-fi, synth-heavy nostalgic bedroom production. And attempting a timely, authoritative statement about a decentralized, Internet-driven scene seems bound to be frustrating. It doesn't help when some acts are less-than SEO friendly and self-applied genre tags like shitgaze mock the whole genre concept in itself. The ""escapist music from the youth of a crumbling superpower"" angle even gets a passing reference on the comp's microsite. After everything this country has been through in the last decade, chillwave is not the soundtrack of American decline.</p>
<p>Where's the definitive narrative in music built in part from obscured samples and dance rhythms, evocative of a gauzy nostalgia and often decorated with deliberately unpolished cover art? <i>Fuck Dance, Let's Art </i>doesn't quite spell it out, if it is there to be spelled out, or offer anything new. Exploring how tools and trends have conspired to bestow authenticity to homespun productions of digital detritus seems beside the point. But its roster-- notable omissions such as Neon Indian and Salem non-withstanding-- does provide a crash course on this ill-defined movement. The inclusion of a Phenomenal Handclap Band song and HEALTH remix of Crystal Castles provide some broader context and Animal Collective's glittering ""My Girls"" touches on a future tribal sound (though the song's direct embrace of adult pressures seems contrary to the album's escapist threads). Boundaries are left undefined when you have chillwave acts like Washed Out next to a newer class of artists like Slava and Peter's House Music.</p>
<p>The title of one of the tracks, Toro Y Moi's ""Fax Shadow""-- a suspended song with a distorted, bumpy bass line that sounds as warped as unspooled tape being fed back into a reel-- speaks to a shared fetishization of retro technology and a drive to add analog wear to digital production. Along with Small Black's ""Despicable Dogs"" and Balam Acab's ""See Birds"", it exemplifies intensely personal songcraft and perhaps touches on early adult uncertainty. As a takeaway from this compilation, it seems to suggest that, as exciting as some of these producers are, in many ways the new underground isn't that different from the old underground.</p></div>"|14712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14712-fuck-dance-lets-art-sounds-from-a-new-american-underground/|6.9|Patrick Sisson

Not yet. As of this writing, he's due to be released from the Eric M. Taylor Center at Rikers  Island on November 4. But even  when he switches from inmate #02616544L to Dwayne Carter,  free man, will he return as the world beater who stunned us with mixtapes like <i>Dedication 2</i> and albums like <i>Tha  Carter III</i> or will he continue to explore (um) riskier sonic territory á la  <i>Rebirth</i>? And, considering his penchant toward exuberant rhymes  and a lifestyle blissfully unaware of the word ""no,"" will we ever see  the same Wayne that stomped straight into the camera rapping ""I'd rather  be pushin' flowers than to be in the pen sharin' showers,"" in the ""A  Milli"" video? On July 22, 2007, just hours before he would be caught  with the .40 caliber pistol that would eventually land him in jail, I saw Wayne end  a triumphant NYC show at the famed, fancy Beacon Theater  by blaring Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" through the  speakers. That night he was funny and dangerous and unpredictable. So: Even when Wayne ends his eight months of forced containment, will that Wayne really be back?</p>
<p>As we prepare to find out, we first get <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i>,  an album's worth of material recorded before his jail stint and featuring some tracks originally intended for his proper  return LP, <i>Tha Carter IV</i>. The record is supposed to act as a  reminder of his existence and a precursor to his freedom. And, since  it's a genuine hip-hop record with Wayne rapping most of the time, it  helps to put his guitar-torturing, choke-throttling <i>Rebirth</i> incarnation to rest. <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i> is the latest in a long line of songs and videos Wayne has appeared on since entering Rikers on March 8; we've seen green-screened versions of him in clips with Eminem, along with his Young Money cohorts Drake and Nicki Minaj.  These appearances are meant to show his resiliency and relevancy but  oftentimes come off a little depressing-- since he's usually standing in  front of an obviously phony and confined backdrop, the videos emphasize  his absence more than anything else. <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i> draws a similarly conflicted response. He's there but he's not there.</p>
<p>We get Wayne spouting classic Weezy-isms-- explicit sex, cartoonish gunplay,  and allusions to the intricacies of the digestive system abound-- over at-least-decent  original beats, several of which attempt to replicate the space-snap  wallop of his biggest hit, ""Lollipop"". But there's a lingering sense  that the rapper is not in top gear; his flow is often slow  and static, his wordplay lively yet less energized than what we're now used to. When he says, ""I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin'  plane,"" or, ""So far ahead of them, I feel outdated"" in this context,  the lines could be taken as a boasts or sighs. And while Wayne was  presumably aware of his impending jail term during the recording of some  of these tracks, you'd never know it. The most real-life anxiety shown  is on the title Run-D.M.C.-style track, when he admits, ""Still get a stomach ache every  time I see cops."" It's a far cry from his ""A Milli"" invincibility: ""Tell  the coppers: 'Hahahaha!'/ You can't get him, you can't stop him.""</p>
<p>There is one distinct upshot. The finest three songs on <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i> all feature the man who has quickly become Wayne's best-ever  counterpart, Drake. The two rappers' contrasting qualities-- Wayne is  coarse and random and hoarse while Drake is smooth and exact and clear-- bring out surprising sides of each other.  On the sweet-soul track ""With You"", the<i> Pretty Toney</i>-style beat and  Drake's croon draw out Wayne at his most human. Meanwhile, the superhero-synth track ""Right Above It"" would seemingly fit well on an idealized <i>Tha Carter IV</i> with Drake rhyming breathless as Wayne handles the Auto-Hook.  The two have teased at a full collaborative album and, considering the  tracks here-- along with worthy past collaborations like ""Miss Me"" and ""I'm Goin' In""-- it has the potential to be one of those rare dream projects that lives up to its promise.</p>
<p>Speaking of Drake, he had this to say about <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i> when talking to MTV recently: ""I think it's just a lotta Wayne songs that... you know, it's just that pre-... it's that pre-... it's that stuff that people wanna hear-- but I think <i>Carter IV</i> is gonna be on another level."" Not really a sticker-ready quote. His  hesitation is justified-- this release has neither the conceptual,  lasting power of <i>Tha Carter III</i> nor the inspired spontaneity of Wayne's best mixtapes.  And since it was recorded before such a traumatic, life-changing event,  it's likely to serve more as a clearinghouse than an indication of  what's to come. In one of the more lucid moments in the must-see  documentary <i>The Carter</i>, Wayne-- then 25-- looks into his crystal ball  and says, ""[When I'm] 28, 29 you'll be lookin' for a Lil Wayne album to be full of rap-- the best rap. Full of singin'-- the best songs, not the best singin'. Full of music. Not just whatever you look for now."" Wayne has already done better versions of almost every song on <i>I Am Not a Human Being</i>, which was released on his 28th birthday last week. It's not exactly what we're looking for now.</p></div>"|14711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14711-i-am-not-a-human-being/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

First emergent in Ghana at the end of the 19th century, highlife is a buoyant, joyful strain of Afro-pop characterized by clean, weaving guitar lines, generous use of space, punchy horns, and crisp, round melodies. Save the horns, highlife is essentially the sound of Highlife. Imagine Interpol instead calling themselves ""Post-Punk"" and you've got an idea of just how on-the-nose this moniker seems.</p>
<p>Coming from Highlife leader Sleepy Doug Shaw, a Brooklyn via London musician from the band White Magic who is an associate of Gang Gang Dance and Animal Collective, the band name also serves as an end-around that deflates those who criticize Western pastiche of African sounds. And why shouldn't Shaw be upfront about his inspiration? If you bleed all African, African-American, or Caribbean influence from your record collection, that pretty much just leaves you with a bunch of Stephin Merritt. These days, Western listeners can and do regularly embrace once ""exotic"" sounds without much of a thought; for musicians, dipping their toes into these sounds isn't a fad, it's simply an option. One Shaw exercises here with a deft, agile hand.</p>
<p>Shaw's been doing that for years, granted. His fingerpicking guitar style owes a lot to highlife, even when the debt isn't this obvious. Decamping to Trinidad last year, he went all the way with his fascination of the sound and emerged with a handful of blog hits that, a year later, and now collected on the <i>Best Bless</i> EP, still sound as vibrant as they did then. Early tracks ""F Kenya RIP"" and ""Burying Stones"" were Technicolor and cheerful enough to get lumped into the glut of summer/beach/etc musings at the time, but they're light years away from your average home electronic Washed Out forgery.</p>
<p>For one thing, Highlife's songs are expertly crafted and meticulously assembled. Shaw's a patient, careful technician, putting together songs that are quite obviously fussed over. And yet they aren't fussy: Shaw's vocal style may be reminiscent of another dandyish indie star,
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
Destroyer's Dan Bejar, but his chiming, bright guitar lines and circular, surefooted rhythms puncture any potential air of pomposity that might otherwise surround his work. The whole effect sounds like Dirty Projectors, if their overriding goal were to entertain rather than impress you.</p>
<p>""F Kenya RIP"" is still likely the highlight, but all three tracks that make up the meat of the record-- ""Tuareg Dancehall"" is the third-- are winners. The EP is filled out with an intro, a more desolate closer, and the vinyl comes with a bonus 7"" whose B-side is a cover of Sierra Leone native S.E. Rogie. Throughout, Shaw has honed in and located a sound that weaves dense, complex lines yet feels almost effortless to enjoy. It's a trick that you can't fake or borrow or steal, and in the end it's the trait that Highlife most closely shares with the great West African guitar groups they so obviously admire.</p></div>"|14708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14708-best-bless-ep/|8.0|Scott Plagenhoef

The city boasts an elite university, Queen's, and birthed one of the most popular rock bands in Canada (if nowhere else), the Tragically Hip. It also happens to house one of the country's most notorious maximum-security prisons, and spawned boorish rock-'em-sock-'em hockey proponent Don Cherry. Given the city's conflicting histories, it's appropriate that noise-pop native sons PS I Love You are such a wonderful mess of contradictions. The odd-couple duo of Paul Saulnier (guitar/vocals) and Benjamin Nelson (drums) couch their considerable technical skill in a grungy garage-rock dressing, conveying palpably heartfelt emotion through mostly indecipherable yelping. And with <i>Meet Me at the Muster Station</i>, they've produced a compact debut that nonetheless feels momentously epic.</p>
<p>As indie-rock has splintered into myriad variants over the past 20 years while simultaneously becoming part of the mainstream, it's rare to hear a young band fulfill one of the music's initial primary functions: to give voice to those back-of-the-classroom loners who are ostracized by the jocks, but aren't quite willing to embrace the rigid aesthetic codes of goths or metalheads. In Saulnier, we see a cross-breed of two outsider archetypes that rarely figure in contemporary indie. He's a Black Francis-like barker who'll happily break out into nonsensical, throat-shredding hysterics in order to scare away the normals, but he's also a J Mascis-ian introvert who finds it easier to express his true feelings through his fretboard. The duo's calling-card track, ""Facelove"", is a perfect encapsulation of how Saulnier compensates for social anxieties with guitar heroics: after spending the song's first and only verse trying to spill his guts out to a girl, he essentially says ""fuck it"" and launches a series of majestic phase-pedalled swirls that translate his garbled words into a crystal-clear, six-stringed communiqué.</p>
<p><i>Muster Station</i> is rife with similarly thrilling displays of the frantic and the ecstatic: the sustained, skyward surge of ""Butterflies &amp; Boners"" proves every bit as glorious as its title, while ""Breadends""-- inspired by a friend's revelation that he used to rob banks-- sees Saulnier reveling in the vicarious thrill of shouting, ""gimme all your fucking money!"" It's apt that this declaration of criminal fantasy is one of the album's few easily discernible lyrics. While Saulnier's maniacal-misfit act may be reminiscent of certain 1980s indie-rock icons, the elusive elucidations of <i>Meet Me at the Muster Station</i> are symptomatic of a wired world where social-media dependency and online role-playing have made verbal, face-to-face communication feel all the more awkward and difficult. This is an album fueled by the frustration of not being able to adequately express your frustration, no more so than on the roiling tempest that is ""2012"". Saulnier's bottom-of-a-well vocal makes it hard to tell if the song is in fact about the popular end-of-the-world prophecy, but the urgent, thrashing delivery makes PS I Love You's intentions crystal clear: they want apocalypse now.</p></div>"|14709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14709-meet-me-at-the-muster-station/|8.1|Stuart Berman

The three-piece, comprising sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson and friend Michael Collins, grew up in a Hare Krishna community where their version of Sunday mass was a ceremony with people ""chanting and dancing and freaking out,"" they told us back in June. Some of their tracks are based on Sanskrit chants, and they rep artists like Paul Laffoley, a dude who makes paintings about time machines and wormholes. No surprise, then, that they caught the ear of Animal Collective and got scooped up by the band's Paw Tracks imprint.</p>
<p><i>Shadow Temple</i> is Prince Rama's fourth record, and it's less noisy than previous efforts but still pretty raw and unrestrained-- more about energy than structure. The band doesn't use a ton of instruments (tribal drumming, chugging synths, and crunching guitars are the main components) but its tracks are sonically dense and propulsive. The album has a nice element of surprise. ""Om Namo Shivaya"" is sort of fluid and droning, but once you give into its haze, a buzzing electric guitar line pops out of nowhere to jerk you back into reality. The band also does well with mood: Even though most of the lyrics aren't discernable, you still get a clear sense of foreboding from these songs.</p>
<p>There aren't many hooks on this record, and the tempo shifts are sometimes subtle, so it can feel overwhelming-- kind of a constant onslaught of sound. This is a taste issue, but if you require a respite now and again, it might be a difficult listen. The other issue I have with <i>Shadow Temple</i> centers on how the band treats its vocals. Most of the singing comes from the Larson sisters, who have airy falsettos that could provide great contrast if they weren't always buried in the mix. ""Thunderdrums"", all clattering percussion and heavy, moaning guitar, feels cloudy and half-finished with the Larsons' chants washed out in the background.</p>
<p>After a few bumpy moments in the middle stretch, Prince Rama hit a nice stride toward the end of the record. The final two songs, ""Satt Nam"" and ""Raghupati"", are arguably the best. It's here where the band finally open things up-- arrangements aren't as cluttered, vocals are clearer, and each instrument has room to breathe. Particulary on ""Satt Nam"", which has a memorable synth melody and a throbbing club undercurrent like something out of a Crystal Castles track, you start to get a sense of how this band's psych experiments-- which can be heady and evocative on their own-- might become something more.</p></div>"|14710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14710-shadow-temple/|6.2|Joe Colly

Under the moniker oOoOO (pronounced ""oh""), he's releasing his self-titled debut EP on Tri Angle-- a label that has come to be associated with the trendy sound through releases from like-minded acts such as Balam Acab<i>.</i> And though certain hallmarks of the genre's syrupy electro-goth can be detected on <i>oOoOO</i>, from the trap-hop drum machines to the frosted synths, he seems determined not to be pigeonholed, all while remaining one of the frontrunners of the scene.</p>
<p>Simply put, the guy isn't easy to peg. His earlier material explored spatial Dirty South trademarks (""NoSummr4u"") alongside a lantern-lit sea chanty (""No Shore""). But the synthesis of these seemingly opposite styles-- along with Greenspan's ability to make them work in a purely electronic setting <i>and</i> feel comfortable up against one another-- has lead to this solid debut. Opener ""Mumbai"" is a brief, dystopian dirge that mixes a chopped Hindi-pop vocal with droning Middle Eastern atmospherics and hollow claps. It's not an unexpected introduction-- it's spooky, witchy-- but it's born from a variety of approaches.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it's also approachable. Thus while making music that practically prides itself on being druggy and other-wordly, Greenspan is able to rise above his peers. Highlight ""Hearts"" drops a pin at the crossroads where commercially viable hip-hop gravitates toward left-field electronic influences. Talking to Pitchfork a few months ago, Greenspan discussed his admiration for pop-centered hip-hop and R&amp;B artists like Nicki Minaj and Usher, and much of <i>oOoOO</i> (like the woozy club vibe of ""Burnout Eyess"" or the uncharacteristically sensual allure of ""Sedsumting"") manages to bridge these two worlds. Greenspan feels so comfortable in his own skin that, by following his own unique patterns, he's able to defy the confines of a genre that seems especially susceptible to bandwagon-jumping.</p></div>"|14674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14674-ooooo-ep/|7.2|Zach Kelly

But while the 26-year-old Brooklynite's music is steeped in 1980s new wave-- he sometimes takes on Morrissey's vocal tone and phrasing, and threads of British bands like Echo and the Bunnymen and Depeche Mode run through his songs-- Lewis does well by this much-revisited era. Simplicity is part of what carries it over. On <i>Forget</i>, his debut full-length, he mostly sticks with a small collection of synth sounds-- strings, organ, piano, and brass-- along with electric guitar and drum machine. The instruments are clean, shimmery, and carefully placed. With Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor handling production, this limited palette proves to be more than enough to work with, and each song is immediately distinguishable from the others. Lewis' execution is immaculate, and he manages to make these familiar sounds into something that sounds refreshing and even dazzling.</p>
<p>The hotel-room production is ideally suited to the subject matter, matching the charged emotions of the lyrics. ""Yellow Balloon"" is full of vignettes from youth-- ""If you hear your mama calling/ Get away from me/ Secret handshakes/ The swimming hole""-- and the icy atmosphere, along with a creepy piano line, suggests that these memories aren't necessarily good ones. On another standout, ""Tether Beat"", a ghostlike synth ranges around in the lower registers as Lewis asks over and over, ""Does your heart still beat?"" Album highlight ""Castles in the Snow"" creates a metaphor from the imagery of the title, using sharp hi-hats, handclaps, piercing strings, and bird-like vocal calls to show that everything the narrator touches ""turns cold."" Tracks like these create a mood that is nostalgic, regretful, and even sinister.</p>
<p>Roughly half the album consists of these slower, dreamier turns; the other half is faster paced and thus better tailored to the live setting (or a high school dance). On these songs, Lewis tackles the same broad subject of love-- forbidden crushes, dance floor flirtations, serious relationships-- with the same overall aesthetic. But he abandons menace in favor of sweetness: the bass on ""Shooting Holes"" and ""When We're Dancing"" thumps out locomotive disco beats; pretty flutes and strings accent the excellent dance floor saga ""I Can't Wait""; and the sparkling synths on closer ""Forget"" create a lulling slow dance for Lewis' loaded refrain, ""They'll give us so much to forget."" Here, Lewis' lyrics are more narrative and romantic, but they're no less witty or poetic.</p>
<p>Taken whole, <i>Forget</i> feels undeniably of the moment, fitting in nicely with the craftsmanship of 80s pop revivalists like the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Lewis' labelmate Class Actress, and, to some degree, the xx. And like the best of this wave, the album also has a function beyond its danceable beats and electronic fireworks: It is sophisticated enough to withstand close, repeated listening. The songs may be catchy, but their intricacy and thoughtful storytelling makes them stick. And for its impressive sonic sheen, the album's skillful restraint makes it sound better with every spin. Instead of merely evoking an established style, Lewis' songs feel honest and straightforward, so the new wave glances are a vehicle for the songwriting rather than the whole point.</p></div>"|14675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14675-forget/|8.4|Liz Colville

The problem wasn't so much that the band was trying to find its own voice, but that Chris Cornell wasn't always sure how to best utilize his. Cornell's apocalyptic shriek is the sort of weapon of mass destruction that needs to be implemented with care and precision. Letting it run free on the sludgy metal-punk of ""All Your Lies"" or faking the funk on a cover of the Ohio Players' ""Fopp"" were baby steps. And yet, getting to hear songs like these-- and, more importantly, to hear the band hit its stride on ""Hunted Down"" (from the <i>Screaming Life</i> EP) or ""Beyond the Wheel"" (from their first full-length, <i>Ultramega OK</i>)-- alongside the alt-rock standards, is a big part of the hook for <i>Telephantasm.</i></p>
<p><i></i>This new career-spanning collection comes in a few packages-- the woefully skint single-disc version that will be packaged with copies of <i>Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock</i>, the collector-baiting 2xCD/DVD/3xLP/book-and-pictures version, and a 2xCD version that serves as a somewhat serviceable overview of Soundgarden's career. For most people, the one to consider is the 2xCD version, and if there's one thing it does better than its best-of predecessor (1997's now-deleted <i>A-Sides</i>), it's acknowledging that the band released a fair amount of music before signing with A&amp;M Records.</p>
<p>The potential displayed in their early years, coupled with the group's impeccable pedigree-- not many bands can say they released records on both Sub Pop and SST-- made that major-label jump a foregone conclusion. When Soundgarden did issue their A&amp;M debut, 1989's <i>Louder Than Love</i>, they were still trying to figure things out. A track like ""Hands All Over"" has Cornell and friends striking the sort of po-faced martyrs' pose they'd later mock mercilessly, while ""Big Dumb Sex"" (the ""I wanna fuck fuck fuck fuck you"" song) seems to confuse being a parody of overblown cock rock with being the real thing. Group those two tracks with a half-decent live version of the half-decent ""Get on the Snake"" (speaking of cock rock) and a sloppy pre-<i>Badmotorfinger</i> take on ""Room a Thousand Years Wide"", and that's a third of <i>Telephantasm</i> out of the way without much of note happening.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the <i>Telephantasm</i> compilers (mostly) get out of their own way when picking what to include from 1991's <i>Badmotorfinger</i>-- they simply run with the album's first four tracks, and it's by far the best stretch of music on <i>Telephantasm</i>'s first disc. By now, Kim Thayil's thick yet fluid guitar leads meet up with an equally heavy and flexible rhythm section to create a menacing backdrop that's perfect for Cornell's ungodly holler. Even better, Cornell's learned that the nuclear option works just as well as an implied threat-- and that makes his shriek that much more effective when it's let off the leash. On tracks like ""Outshined"" and ""Jesus Christ Pose"", Soundgarden figured out how to balance their messianic metallic tendencies with both a sizable helping of self-awareness and a fondness for off-kilter time signatures. The addition of bassist Ben Shepherd gave the group both a strong foundation and an off-kilter songwriting voice to add to the mix.</p>
<p>Alas, <i>Telephantasm</i> aims to bait fans by including a live version of ""Jesus Christ Pose"" instead of the album cut-- a pattern repeated too often on Disc Two, which (aside from the group's contribution to the <i>Singles</i> soundtrack, ""Birth Ritual"") covers Soundgarden's final two albums. 1994's <i>Superunknown</i> is, of course, the record that transformed the group into alt-rock superstars, so of course ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" are here. Two of the album's other singles, the surf-flavored ""My Wave"" and the fittingly pessimistic ""Fell on Black Days"", are also in the mix, though ""Black Days"" is represented by its lesser video-edit version. <i>Down on the Upside</i>-- <i>Superunknown</i>'s gentler and more unfocused sibling-- has both of its most notable singles (""Pretty Noose"", ""Blow Up the Outside World"") repped by live versions, the former represented by its performance on ""Saturday Night Live"", a venue infamous for making almost every musical performer that's graced its stage sound like ass. Also here is the album version of ""Burden in My Hand"" and ""Dusty"", an unremarkable album track that gave their final record its title.</p>
<p>Finally, as with every career-spanning compilation looking to make a buck, there's the rare or unreleased track: Where <i>A-Sides </i>offered an import B-side (""Bleed Together""), <i>Telephantasm</i> unearths a <i>Badmotorfinger</i> outtake, ""Black Rain"", which sounds exactly like... a <i>Badmotorfinger</i> outtake.</p>
<p>Even if you're not specifically on one of the group's many wavelengths, there's plenty to enjoy on <i>Telephantasm</i>-- fans whose tastes lean towards heavier stuff might find something to like in the <i>Badmotorfinger</i> tracks, while folks whose rock sensibilities are more melodic can dip their toes in the <i>Superunknown</i>. That said, for one extra dollar, curious iTunes shoppers can bypass the middle man and just buy copies of <i>Badmotorfinger</i> and <i>Superunknown</i>-- those albums' deep cuts are much better than most of the tunes on <i>Telephantasm</i>, and you'll get studio singles rather than cut-rate bootlegs.</p>
<p><i>Telephantasm</i> was an opportunity to redefine Soundgarden's somewhat disparate career: to better illustrate the stylistic throughlines that connect <i>Screaming Life</i> to <i>Down on the Upside</i>; to take cuts from their neglected albums and place them in a more forgiving context; to breathe new life into well-known singles. It's a trick the band itself managed to turn with its first post-reunion gig. Performing as Nudedragons, the group took the stage at the Showbox in Seattle this past April and played a set that showed as much love to <i>Louder Than Love</i> and <i>Ultramega OK</i> as any other album in their catalog, giving each portion of their career equal respect without resorting to simply playing just the hits. Succeeding at this sort of task is easier said than done, but it would've been nice if <i>Telephantasm</i> at least tried.</p></div>"|14706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14706-telephantasm/|5.0|David Raposa

Their debut album, released in 1991, was a double-vinyl epic entitled, with a knowing nod to the bongs-and-blacklights crowd, <i>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i>. Despite being marketed as house music, <i>Ultraworld</i> was really designed to flow like those spacey prog-song suites that so captivated stoned 70s kids who gorged on sci-fi novels. (The Orb just ditched the ""songs"" part of the suite equation.) And though the rhythms on the new <i>Metallic Spheres</i> occasionally recall techno and hip-hop and other more recent inventions, this albums sounds a hell of a lot like it could have been playing in a planetarium circa 1974.</p>
<p>Again, as much of that is due to the Orb as to special guest legend David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. The Orb's music got chillier, tighter, and altogether less shaggy as we moved away from rave's sloppy love-in and toward the precision-tooled club music of the 21st century. But over the past few years, Orb co-founder Alex Paterson has been gently nudging the group's sound back toward its techno-hippie roots. Collaborating with Gilmour feels in some ways like the Orb's coming home after a good many years spent wandering the post-rave wilderness. Their last few albums have sounded as if the band were wondering where exactly they could take their music next, while not quite sure if they truly wanted to revert to their old sound, and the master's presence feels like it gave the disciples license to go all-out retro.</p>
<p>Mostly wordless, full of spaced-out sound effects, and making no concessions to good ol' verse-chorus-verse structures, <i>Spheres</i> is a trip, to use a term once unabashedly uttered by Floyd devotees and revived by Orb aficionados with more of a knowing wink. A headphones record, in other words. Light show and chemical refreshment totally optional. Over two long tracks subdivided into shorter movements, Paterson and fellow Orb-er Youth thread together a post-rave library's worth of slow-rolli
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ng chillout-room rhythms, referencing everything from dub to krautrock along the way, as Gilmour sweeps in and out on guitar, dropping little shiver-inducing melodic runs like it's no big deal. Though his playing here meanders by design, Gilmour sounds neither lazy nor indulgent, more like a virtuoso who doesn't want to actually seem like he's sleepwalking through his performance. The Orb, on the other hand, are showing off in the best way possible, again crafting the lush, cosmic rhythms they were once so good at, hoping to impress a long-time hero. In the process, they also manage to impress listeners who've stuck with the band through some pretty ropey recent material.</p>
<p>Records like <i>Spheres</i> usually get filed as ""ambient"" these days, but that's not quite right here. Sure, it's gorgeous and hypnotic and more about beats than songs and all the things you'd probably expect from this pairing. It's also immersive in an old-school way, a long-player of a very pre-digital vintage, a record for people with enough free time (or a long enough commute) to lose themselves in a 50ish-minute composition. With its dramatically orchestrated peaks and valleys, it's an album designed to be listened to, to Take You Somewhere as you lay on your bedroom floor, to conjure futuristic images in the mind's eye of folks who were once teenage fans. In that sense, it's still not quite as successful as the Orb's classic material, and a little too subdued, lacking both the goofy sampleadelic grandeur and the ear-grabbing pop pulse of the <i>Ultraworld</i> era. But it's still the most focused and listenable Orb album in years. And hey, if you want to treat it as background music, that'll work just fine, too.</p></div>"|14692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14692-metallic-spheres/|7.0|Jess Harvell

But there was an even greater sense of injustice when, in 2005, Collins suffered a series of strokes and brain hemorrhages that sent him to the hospital for half a year and left him unable to read, write, walk, or talk.</p>
<p>Yet as befits a man tenacious enough to thrive largely in the margins for so many years, Collins resisted the urge to retire and instead began a rigorous regimen of physical rehabilitation. Struggling with wheelchairs and dysphasia, Collins was nonetheless able to complete 2007's <i>Home Again</i>, the album he began before his setbacks. Even more remarkable, he made a confident return to the stage, albeit in limited form. Still, it's a small miracle that Collins created <i>Losing Sleep</i>, his first new album since starting his recovery. The title refers to Collins' restless nights kept awake by his creative impulses-- ""I'm losing sleep, I'm losing dignity,"" he sings-- but despite the consciously autobiographical bent of many of the tracks, Collins is not out for sympathy. The album, with its ever-thrilling underpinning of northern soul and cool post-punk grooves, is no mere comeback. It's a victory lap, capping off all Collins had to go through to get this point.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Collins remains unable to play the guitar, and beyond that his distinctive voice honestly isn't quite what it once was. But, hey, the man's 51, and abetted by a fine team of friends and collaborators, damned if his knack for melody hasn't remained intact. For that matter, said friends and collaborators do an ace job bringing Collins' inner vision to life. Ryan Jarman of the Cribs helps give ""What Is My Role?"" an agitated edge that finds Collins (not surprisingly) wondering aloud about his current place in the world. ""Do It Again"" was recorded with Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy, but were their names omitted (and their backing vocals dropped) we'd be none the wiser as to their input. The same goes for the soaringly romantic ""In Your Eyes"", which teams Collins with the Drums-- and recalls early New Order at their warmest and most approachable.</p>
<p>No shock that likeminded soul Johnny Marr helps get the most out of the sunny ""Come Tomorrow, Come Today"" (with its defiant declaration: ""no more tears""). But the best pairing may be Collins teamed up with longtime Scot-pop peer Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera fame for ""All My Days"". If much of <i>Losing Sleep</i> features Collins coming out swinging and aiming to please-- ""Bored"" may be the most swaggering track ever recorded about literally learning to walk again-- the moving ""All My Days"" features him vulnerable and laid bare. ""I'm trying to comprehend the force, the fear,"" Collins croons before delivering the more optimistic kicker: ""I'm willing to accept the good that's near.""</p>
<p>Things get even more hushed and introspective on the concluding ""Searching for the Truth"", but if one thinks listening to Collins sing, ""I will always be lucky in my life, and I will find a way to get there,"" will provide nothing but heartbreak, well, that's only half the story here. It's sad, yes, to consider all he's gone through, but that sadness is ameliorated by what's come out the other side. Is Collins fully recovered? Overlooking his ongoing physical struggles and instead focusing on ""Losing Sleep"", the answer must be a resounding and inspiring ""yes.""</p></div>"|14699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14699-losing-sleep/|7.0|Joshua Klein

He's a troublemaker, a possessor of a hyper-caustic (and often side-splitting) wit, and you wouldn't want to find yourself in his crosshairs. But you get the feeling from his recordings that he always has a story to tell, and if you <i>don't</i> kick back for a few beers with him, you're going to miss something great.</p>
<p>The former A Frames drummer has put his wry sense of humor to good use over the past few years, recording off-the-cuff garage-punk as the Intelligence, hitting his stride with last year's excellent <i>Fake Surfers</i>. With <i>Males</i>, his sixth album in as many years, the slate has been wiped clean. In addition to working in his new professional studio, Finsberg here collaborates with other musicians rather than handle all the work himself.</p>
<p>And, in true Intelligence fashion, it takes them only one-and-a-half songs to botch a chord. On early-album highlight ""Tuned to Puke"", the band stomps as Finberg spouts, ""Everything's ruined and there's nothing to do on someone else's birthday."" Without having to worry about playing every part, Finberg seems to place more focus on his vocals; he croons and shouts in equal measure, even barking the chorus to ""Chateau Bandit"" in French. Finberg's new rhythm section provides a more stable backbeat than any previous Intelligence record had, and the full band re-records a handful of older Intelligence tracks with varying results. One of those re-recordings, ""Like Like Like Like Like Like Like"", is biting satire behind a gloriously dumb veneer, a catchy Fall-inspired tune that pushes that Valley-rooted word to an unreasonable extreme-- all while explaining its Southern California origin. ""The Beetles"", on the other hand, takes one of Finberg's best lyrical turns and places it on top of plodding, garden variety garage-rock. Coupled with filler tracks like ""The Universe"" and ""White Corvette"", you have a 25-minute record that could still stand to be even shorter.</p>
<p>There's a moment toward the end of the title track that reveals the key to the Intelligence's appeal; after Finberg finishes his vocals, he leans into the microphone, shrugs, ""That's it,"" and walks away with his band still playing the coda. Eventually, the song and the record close with the coda disintegrating into a vat of grumbling white noise, confrontational yet warm and inviting at the same time. Ultimately, <i>Males</i> is a record that's much like a night out with your most sardonic friend; it has its lulls, but it's mostly a good time and you wake up in the morning with all of your teeth, smiling that you didn't miss anything.</p></div>"|14689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14689-males/|7.3|Martin Douglas

The confusingly titled <i>Chrome Dreams II</i> was one highlight, but some of its best tracks were decades-old. Last year's <i>Fork in the Road </i>was a lark, a neo-concept album about electric cars whose humor undersold Young's convictions. His angriest albums, <i>Living With War</i> and <i>Greendale</i>, were each instantly dated time capsules. His prettiest, <i>Silver &amp; Gold </i>and<i> Prairie Wind</i>, were also pretty disposable, and there are likely about as many people who pull out <i>Are You Passionate?</i> as there are those waiting for a <i>Road Rock Vol. 2</i>.</p>
<p>Yet all those subpar, uneven, or just plain odd releases matter, because they show the guy's still trying to bottle whatever it is that's been swimming in his soul for the better part of five full decades. Which brings us to <i>Le Noise</i>, Young's perhaps inevitable team-up with famed producer Daniel Lanois. The album features mostly just Young, electric guitar, and a battery of effects-- echoing, resonating, occasionally roaring, and raging. Not that Young necessarily needs all that. With his sneering warble and ragged but right guitar playing, he's always been his own best effect, but here Young and Lanois relish the happy accidents both producer and artist have always embraced, resisting the urge to sand off the jagged edges into the ambient ether.</p>
<p>Of course, ambience is a big part of <i>Le Noise</i>'s widescreen appeal, and Young's playing is as intriguingly exploratory as it is sometimes explosive, taking advantage of Lanois' trademark bag of tricks like a kid testing pedals in a guitar store. Still, given its familiar crunch and gait, it's hard to hear <i>Le Noise</i> without imagining the famously ramshackle backing of Crazy Horse anchoring the riffy murk of songs like ""Walk With Me"", ""Sign of Love"", ""Angry World"" or even the queasy, off-kilter ""Rumblin'"".</p>
<p>Admittedly, the lyrical nod in the long unreleased drug epic ""Hitchhiker"" (which has been floating around in some form for years) to <i>Trans</i>' ""Like an Inca"" implies Young understands he's working in curveball mode. Regardless, there's never any denying the guy on the mound-- <i>Le Noise</i> is as closely linked to Young's primal instincts as anything in his catalog. Like many of Young's most formidable works, the specter of death hangs over the record, too, specifically his recently passed collaborators Larry ""L.A."" Johnson and especially long-serving guitarist Ben Keith.</p>
<p>Considering the demons creeping deep through the disc, it's perhaps no surprise that the sole pair of acoustic tracks, ""Love and War"" and ""Peaceful Valley Boulevard"", are as heavy as the louder tracks, their relative clarity almost disconcertingly intimate compared to the surrounding racket. In fact, for all its hushed restraint, the eerie ""Peaceful Valley Boulevard"" is a real highlight, a paean to a doomed America that plays like a tragic lyrical descendent of ""Pocahontas"" and ""Cortez the Killer"".

I disagree. While it is true that Clinic have always sounded more or less the same, they have made a point of introducing new textures and affects with each new record. The group changes in gradual, largely superficial ways that may not be entirely perceptible unless you've been paying close attention all along. Take, for example, the way they have embraced the aesthetics of late-1960s psychedelia. Those elements are hardly present on their debut, <i>Internal Wrangler</i>, but have become central to their style since 2006's <i>Visitations</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bubblegum</i>, the band's sixth proper album, goes a few steps further in their ongoing exploration of vintage psychedelia. ""I'm Aware"", the opening track and lead single, signals a substantial change in approach, if not a drastic stylistic departure. The track begins with gently strummed acoustic guitar, and progresses to include lush strings, mellow coos, and an unusually clear and direct vocal performance by singer Ade Blackburn. Still, despite all these un-Clinic creative decisions, it still sounds exactly like the Clinic we've known for years. The melodies, the cadences, the rhythms, that distinct and vaguely creepy voice-- if you've heard a Clinic album, any Clinic album, you have heard this before. Though the group has consistently modified its approach to arranging its material, their songwriting has barely budged since 2002's <i>Walking With Thee</i>.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean they haven't written a great deal of excellent songs. <i>Bubblegum</i>, like the five albums and slew of singles that came before it, delivers several strong tunes. Blackburn and his bandmates have a way of getting the most out of the limited parameters they have set for themselves. The mellow, acoustic psychedelia and relatively hi-fi production values of <i>Bubblegum</i> lends its tracks a touch of novelty
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
, but the songs that work best succeed on the same terms as anything else they've done over the past decade. Clinic are always going to excel when they go for hypnotic, swooning ballads like ""Baby"" and menacing garage rockers like ""Orangutan"", but they stumble a bit when they wander slightly beyond their comfort zone. The record's second half has too many soft, drifting acoustic numbers with pleasing textures but forgettable melodies. These slight missteps aren't enough to derail the album or distract from its high points, but they certainly drag on the momentum. The most exciting cuts revel in their newfound lushness. ""I'm Aware"" and ""Milk &amp; Honey"" are sweet and airy; the title track sounds as though it is being presented in full saturated color in comparison to the stark black and white tonality implied by the band's earliest work.</p>
<p>Clinic are a tricky band to judge, if just because their consistency can seem so much like artistic stagnancy. They've never made a bad album; they always deliver at least a few undeniable gems per record. Nevertheless, as much as <i>Bubblegum</i> evidences a lot of thought and effort on the part of the band, it still has the sound of musicians going through the motions and sticking too close to their formulae. Their craft is impeccable, and they still sound like no one else despite lifting from all sorts of obvious and obscure source influences, but there isn't enough spark to this material. It may be time for Clinic to begin experimenting with song forms rather than textures. At this point, a song that sounded like ""classic"" Clinic but had surprising melodic and rhythmic twists and turns would be much more exciting than the familiar Clinic moves dolled up in fancy clothing.</p></div>"|14691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14691-bubblegum/|6.7|Matthew Perpetua

As if updating the sounds of Madchester for the 21st century, Working for a Nuclear Free City's debut joined albums by Caribou, 120 Days, and Fujiya &amp; Miyagi, ready to soundtrack rainswept city errands or some idealized Factory-like party. Fast-forward to 2010, and Caribou has once again changed pace with the beatific <i>Swim</i>; Fujiya &amp; Miyagi are doing their own quirky thing, admitting they ""were just pretending to be Japanese""; and man, it's been a while since we heard from Norway's 120 Days.</p>
<p>So the return of Working for a Nuclear Free City is a welcome reminder that the samples and electronic beats of blog house, chillwave, or post-dubstep are not the only directions for headphones-friendly psych-dance. <i>Jojo Burger Tempest</i> clocks in near 90 minutes, and once again it's a double: one disc of 17 individual songs, one of a single 33-minute suite. Such an ambitious sophomore outing is a lot to take in, but with its blend of live drumming, textural guitars, skittering electronics, and wistful harmonies, it's worth braving <i>Jojo</i>'s, uh, storm.</p>
<p>As in the late 1980s and early 90s, when Balearic and ambient house emerged from acid house, Working for a Nuclear Free City achieve remarkably adventurous results from indoor rave-y dance music. ""Silent Times"" beckons toward Byrdsian psych-rock, while the intricate ""Alphaville"" manages to be both gentle and shrill while referencing Jean-Luc Godard (or 80s German synth-pop ""Forever Young"" band). There are sing-song vocal exchanges one moment, cymbal-smacking drum crescendos the next, minimalist piano atop a droning bass the next, and so forth. If nu-shoegaze rocker ""Low"" is a nod to David Bowie's Berlin era with Brian Eno, it's a fitting one.</p>
<p>Then there's the second disc. Made up of only the album's title track, this ""Part Two"" starts with a spoken-word performance by Chicago's own ""rock poet,"" Thax Douglas, a longtime fixture at local shows before he moved last year to Austin. From there, the winding, crystalline track climbs from guitar patterns that echo the Edge (in a good way) to Aphex Twin-like synth experiments to hypnotic tone loops to video-game fuzz to motorik grooves to campfire lullabies and, well, round and round again, back to some more spoken word by Douglas. ""A long time ago,"" ends the first disc, or ""long time gone,"" or something like that-- you get the feeling, anyway-- and then there's a resounding echo.</p></div>"|14632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14632-jojo-burger-tempest/|7.7|Marc Hogan

And why not? The shit-talkers are more fun. This is why the best everyman-rap practitioners make sure that their beats punish speakers and their punchlines are more than your typical rimshot fodder.</p>
<p>Shad recognizes this, and that's why <i>TSOL </i>is a modest but admirable success. The Kenya-born, Ontario-raised rapper has been pegged by the faithful as a new standard bearer for positive rap, and somewhere between this album's Polaris Prize nomination and its recent rollout to markets outside Canada, a lot has been made of his potential to be a new voice for fans of Talib Kweli and Common. It definitely aims for that: Despite a discreet indie-rock crossover vocal from Broken Social Scene's Brendan Canning on ""Lucky 1's"", the production-by-committee sound doesn't stretch the backpacker boom-bap parameters too far.</p>
<p>Still, Shad's a bit different from your typical conscious figurehead in that he seems more interested in contemplating than crusading. He notes the trap of his supposed niche with some self-awareness on ""Keep Shining""-- ""it's funny how words like 'consciousness' and 'positive music' can somehow start to feel hollow""-- a line that's dropped in the process of declaring that dudes need to stop just rapping about strong women and actually give them the mic for once.</p>
<p>What Shad reveals of himself on <i>TSOL </i>is spiritual without being preachy, righteous without being self-righteous, and human without sounding mundane. ""Telephone"" is a rare breakup track that doesn't devolve into self-pity or bitter finger-pointing-- instead, it slips its matter-of-factness inside some simple wordplay without
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ducking culpability. ""At the Same Time"" deals with emotions introspectively. And ""Listen"" is a compelling portrait of someone who gets completely lost in music, as it shifts from a display of his eclecticism (""listening to 'Strange Fruit', Jeru, and Beirut"") to an examination of how he draws his inspiration. If all this humble empathy means that he sounds a bit out-of-character (albeit entertainingly so) when he goes into world-beating battle-monster mode on ""Yaa I Get It"", at least he compensates by following up his bragging with a bit of meta-self-awareness: ""I hope I ain't boring y'all rappin' 'bout rap/ But the only thing I love more than rappin' is nappin'/ And I know nobody want to hear me rap about that."" I don't know-- he's probably relatable enough to get away with it.</p></div>"|14686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14686-tsol/|7.2|Nate Patrin

Or if you don't believe them, you at least have to <i>sell</i> them. Robert Plant and Ozzy Osbourne and Bruce Dickinson sold the living hell out of their silliness. And even an album as recent as High on Fire's truly badass 2010 offering, <i>Snakes for the Divine</i>, made its power-fantasies work, since Matt Pike grunted and growled that stuff as hard as he possibly could. J.D. Cronise, frontman for Austin retro-metal dudes the Sword, doesn't sell his lyrics. On <i>Warp Riders</i>, Cronise gets into some serious <i>Lord of the Rings</i> nerdery; a line about ""the properties of certain herbs"" is one of the <i>first lyrics</i> on the <i>whole album</i>. But Cronise doesn't sound like he believes these lyrics, and he also doesn't sound like he's kidding. The lines just lay there, absolutely distinguishable but rendered inert when Cronise belts them out in a flat, monotonal wail.</p>
<p>Of course, this whole thing is nothing new, and the Sword have barely altered their crunch-rock one bit over three albums. But their 2006 debut album, <i>Age of Winters</i>, pulled all its time-tested tricks with assurance and teeth, vrooming from one Sabbath-style stomp-riff to the next at exactly the right moment. The 2008 follow-up, <i>Gods of the Earth</i>, had a bit of that same punch, too, but that unceasingly trad sound feels a bit tapped-out on <i>Warp Riders</i>. On those first two albums, Cronise himself served as producer. For <i>Warp Riders</i>, the band has recruited Matt Bayles, who has two of the past decade's greatest and most influential underground-metal landmarks, Isis' <i>Oceanic</i> and Mastodon's <i>Leviathan</i>, on his résumé. But as a producer, Cronise was actually way more attuned to the Camaro-ready riff-rock that the Sword does best. On <i>Warp Riders</i>, that same approach seems overly compressed and washed out, the riffs themselves just not connecting as hard even though the band is playing them the same way they always have.</p>
<p>But then, maybe that sameness is the problem. The Sword's songs seem to follow the same basic blueprint: Opening-riff trudge, part where Cronise sings about magic, solo, more crunching, more magic, another solo. Even on the instrumental tracks here, you barely miss the vocals, since the other stuff sticks so closely to what came before. We get a few stylistic switchups, but none of them go far enough-- the approaching-thrash speed of ""Astraea's Dream"" and the vaguely ZZ Top blues throb of ""Lawless Lands"" don't exactly qualify as bold reinventions. Instead, the album just pounds on and on and on, feeling much longer than its 48 minutes. None of it is awful, and some of the soloing is truly impressive, but it's tough to figure out why this album needs to exist at all.</p>
<p>Then, after final track ""(The Night Sky Cried) Tears of Fire"" fades out, we get the album's one and only left turn: A minute or so of legitimately creepy Goblin-sounding gothy synth. That part sounds really good! And if the Sword are capable of making stuff like that, why not find a way for it to work within the rest of the album? Maybe next time.</p></div>"|14549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14549-warp-riders/|5.2|Tom Breihan

It's a name you'd normally find in classical music-- a collection of Beethoven sonatas, for instance, might be called this. In James Blake's hands, it's something different. The gifted British producer's new EP is rooted in the piano (he's classically trained), but he gave it a German name as an homage to famed Berlin techno spot Berghain. It's easy to see why Blake might feel at home there-- the club is known for showcasing fresh and innovative sounds, and few artists are stretching the boundaries of dance music wider than he is right now.</p>
<p>Blake's accomplished two things so far that make him stand apart. First, he established a signature style almost right out of the gate-- a kind of ""grinding, mechanical soul,"" as my colleague Mike Powell put it, that's both stark and evocative and shows an impeccable use of blank space. Second, he's proven with two consecutive EPs-- <i>CMYK</i> and now this one-- that he can apply this technique to conceptually distinct projects. Like <i>CMYK</i>, this album is made primarily from samples, but instead of using shards of 90s R&amp;B, here he manipulates his own vocal and piano recordings for a totally different effect.</p>
<p>Blake told us back in April that this album ""is a lot more personal,"" and that immediately comes through-- where <i>CMYK</i> was jittery and club-leaning, these tracks are much more inward-looking. Even if he's more focused on emotion this time, Blake's production is still something to marvel at. His source material is raw-- hissy snippets recorded on a laptop microphone-- but he offsets it with crystal-clear sounds in a way that creates rich contrast. (Hear this tension in the title cut when vocal static rubs against those dry handclaps and dubby bass notes.) Each detail is carefully chosen: He can let a tinny piano note sit by itself for a few seconds because he's presumably picked that one from dozens.</p>
<p>The EP's finest moments come when Blake sets his meticulous ear on sounds that ache with longing and soul, and there's no better example of that than ""I Only Know (What I Know Now)"". Here, he puts his trademark pitch-shifted vocals over a spare piano-and-bass arrangement that gives way to open space every few seconds. The way he tweaks his vocal-- speeding it up one second, then choking it and dragging it out the next-- creates this push-and-pull between hope and dissatisfaction, and ultimately makes it sadder. There are a lot of guys doing this sort of thing well right now (Balam Acab springs to mind) but it's hard to remember a bit of vocal processing this effective since Burial.</p>
<p>That's admittedly lofty praise, but the more music Blake makes, the more he inches away from the competition. Part of the reason is that his work feels very singular-- sure, he'll incorporate bits of garage or dub here and there, and his sound is ostensibly a descendant of dubstep-- but there really isn't anybody else making music quite like this. Especially in a genre where the next sound is absorbed and repurposed with lightning speed, that's not an easy thing to accomplish.</p></div>"|14696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14696-klavierwerke-ep/|8.1|Joe Colly

The Calgary-based post-punk quartet dished out gritty drones and pristine pop with equal aplomb, but the album's highlights-- the spiky and dissonant ""Shaking Hand"" or the melancholy psych-pop nugget ""Black Rice""-- stuck to one camp or the other. Two years later, Women have bridged the divide. The group's sophomore effort, <i>Public Strain</i>, pushes forward in both directions-- the hooks are noisier, the noise is hookier, and both are fogged over with enough reverb to make Felt records seem bone-dry by comparison. Fidelity-wise, it's a step down. But in just about every other sense, <i>Public Strain </i>is an improvement-- a bleak but beautiful record, full of subtly skewed melodies.</p>
<p>Women's debut revved up quickly-- a minute's worth of garage-rock stomp dropped straight into the throbbing art-noise of ""Lawncare"". <i>Public Strain</i> is a more subdued record. Album opener, ""Can't You See"", drifts gradually into form-- the bass anchoring Patrick Flegel's vocal amid a haze of bowed guitars and abstract sampler-squeals. ""Narrow With the Hall"" pits ghostly vocals against a sea of feedback, bound together only by a couple of wiry, tremolo-riddled chords. The atmosphere owes a distinct debt to the noisier side of 1980s underground music-- particularly Sonic Youth's darker, skuzzier early days. But the when it comes to melody, Women dial things back a few extra decades. The Flegel brother's vocals are harmony-heavy, recalling the work of ornate 60s pop acts like the Zombies and the Electric Prunes. The mixture produces a unique, gray-paisley vibe-- the sound of vintage psychedelia bleached of its color.</p>
<p>But by the halfway point, <i>Public Strain </i>shifts toward darker, more paranoid territory. ""China Steps"" rides the eerie, tick-tocking, interplay between the rhythm section and two de-tuned guitars. The Flegel brothers' ethereal vocals drift in and out of key, creating an unsettling call-and-response at the song's climax. For all the sonic bric-a-brac, it's these vocals that push Women off of the retro-rock grid and into territories unknown. Their songs start out familar enough, but the Flegels-- along with guitarist Chris Reimer, who also sings-- frequently dovetail into unexpected, crooked-sounding harmonies. In the first minute, ""Venice Lockjaw"" screams Velvet Underground knock-off. But by the time the chorus swings around, things have been screwed an octave up into choir-boy territory, giving the song an awkward but tender resolution.</p>
<p><i>Public Strain</i> was recorded alongside producer Chad VanGaalen, who also helmed Women's self-titled record. His production is chilly and thin-- possibly a nod to the early-80s indie bands that Women hold in high regard. Or maybe it was just the weather--the sessions were conducted in Alberta, Canada during the dead of winter. At first listen, <i>Public Strain</i> is impenetrably cold. But deep down, beneath the blizzard of noise and hiss, something's burning.</p></div>"|14694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14694-public-strain/|8.0|Aaron Leitko

Whether in the guise of Cursive's caustic, thrashing emo or the perpetually evolving Good Life's intimate confessionals, Kasher and the central figure in his songs have often seemed like the same guy: someone all too aware of his own flaws but almost entirely unsympathetic; someone condemned to doomed relationships who'd likely still be miserable without anyone else's help. As he states on <i>The Game of Monogamy's </i>""Strays"",<i> </i>""writers are selfish, writers are egotists/ I'm afraid I'm as bad as it gets""-- and that's this record's <i>love song</i>.</p>
<p>After Kasher's 2003-04 career peak (Cursive's <i>The Ugly Organ</i>, the Good Life's <i>Album of the Year)</i>, his musical horizons and themes broadened. And although Kasher had proven to be a master of self-immolation, when tackling Big Topics, his flame only burned lukewarm. As the title of <i>The Game of Monogamy </i>indicates, Kasher's back in his wheelhouse of pain, rendering married life in such suffocating and punishing terms that even the most militant Proposition-8 opponent will think, ""we're fighting for <i>this</i>?"" It's probably the most typically ""Kasher"" theme possible, but musically it also serves as a compendium that reconciles his two main projects. Awkward Baskin-Robbins/ sexual dissatisfaction metaphor aside, ""Cold Love"" is Kasher at his most power-pop, with the sarcastically neurotic ""Bad, Bad Dreams"" not far behind. On the other end, the delicate acoustic picking on ""Strays"" makes it sound like a heartbreaker, even if the wearied contentment of finding love amidst lost souls is the closest he gets to happiness. Between those two poles are the bandcamp orchestration you've come to expect from Saddle Creek-- the upbeat brass pomp of ""I'm Afraid I'm Gonna Die Here"" comes off as totally sarcastic considering its lyrical misery, while the strings of ""There Must Be Something I've Lost"" throw Kasher even deeper into despair.</p>
<p>Even so, as with most of Kasher's work, the main draws of <i>Monogamy </i>aren't really musical-- words always get prominence over melody. Simply put, if you get a spark out of idealizing your romantic failures by doing things like drunkenly Googling ex-girlfriends (as he does in great detail on ""There Must Be Something I've Lost""), listening to <i>Monogamy </i>as a whole is like dousing yourself in gasoline. There's little poetry in Kasher's poisonous lyrics, he barely even bothers to rhyme them, and he'll ignore meter altogether if it means getting the last word in. But his directness can prove to be a bandage-ripping rush that gets the core of feelings that are repressed only to reveal themselves uglier than ever. ""I am a grown man/ How did this happen? People are gonna start expecting more from me,"" is the first line Kasher sorta-sings and from there on out, it's something like if Arcade Fire's <i>The Suburbs </i>was written by Grinderman, middle-class, middle-age anxiety filtered through a prism of psychosexual panic.</p>
<p>As cathartic as it can be, a big reason that Kasher's never pitched a perfect game can be chalked up to how the accumulative effect of his unyielding cynicism feels like self-fulfilling prophecy: Though ""No Fireworks"" is the ninth song on <i>Monogamy</i>,<i> </i>by that point, it feels like the 10th song about how committing yourself to one person will inevitably result in an unsatisfying sex life. Still, if you want to take yourself to the edge of emotional catastrophe while maintaining a safe distance, Kasher's got the best shit in town: I'm always hesitant to use the term ""guilty pleasure,"" but I'll stop short and suggest that the pleasure that <i>Monogamy </i>provides is at the very least unhealthy, a controlled substance that packs less buzz with each use and that Saddle Creek should at least have put a warning on saying ""do not combine with alcohol or listen to while operating within heavy relationships.""</p></div>"|14685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14685-the-game-of-monogamy/|6.6|Ian Cohen

OK, now who's gleaned a vague but evocative <i>interpretation </i>of the 70s through its music? Inevitability, the latter group is going to eventually outnumber the former group, and eventually the archivists and revisionists and reinterpreters will be all that's left. And while it'd be nice to think that this group of historical translators is going to do that weird, alternately maligned and lionized pop-music era justice, it's easy to overlook just how received some of that wisdom might be. Yes, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye were great-- but they were great when there wasn't an established standard for what Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye <i>were </i>yet. Following their lead might take you places, but you don't sweat too much when shadows that tall give you shade every step of the way.</p>
<p>Aloe Blacc's recently taken this classic-soul path after years of laboring under an intriguing indie-rap jack-of-all genres approach. And while he clearly studied the vintage R&amp;B greats before creating <i>Good Things</i>, he's content just building a reasonably convincing backlot replica of classic soul rather than putting a new twist on it. Blacc doesn't display the sweet vocal flair of a Raphael Saadiq à la <i>The Way I See It</i>, or the modernized post-hip-hop touch of Ne-Yo in ""Back Like That"" mode. What he does have is a sort of straightforward emulation of that certain R&amp;B singer-songwriter vibe, a modest, filed-down compromise somewhere between Bill Withers' raw, aching warmth and the smooth, subtle intensity of Donny Hathaway. That voice isn't without his strengths, and lead single-slash-<i>How to Make It in America </i>title theme ""I Need a Dollar"" is the best exhibit: His voice is strong enough to push back against the spring-step backbeat and turn the chorus into an earworm. If it's the song people know him for from here on out, he could do a lot worse.</p>
<p>While <i>Good Things</i> is well-constructed and boasts some inspired touches (the backbone-shivering strings on ""Take Me Back"" and ""Life So Hard""; a slick, skulking reggae groove on ""Miss Fortune""), it lacks the foggy, borderline-sinister allure of the best El Michels Affair compositions it strives to match. And with Aloe Blacc's lyrics skewing toward sentiments that straddle the line between ""universal"" and ""so what else is new,"" <i>Good Things</i> doesn't do much to catch you off guard. He can tug at your heartstrings when the opportunity presents itself; good luck listening to ""Momma Hold My Hand"" without getting a lump in your throat when he sings, ""Momma used to be strong, but she ain't now."" But enough of his lyrics lean heavily enough on generations-old songwriting tropes-- pouring his heart out for a woman by telling her that ""you make me smile""; lamenting about ""families in the street with nothing to eat/ Little baby boys and girls, no shoes on their feet""; calling politicians ""hungry wolves dressed like sheep""-- that genuinely human and heartfelt ideas, even sung as warmly as they are, come across through their words like slogans you've long since tuned out.</p>
<p>Complicating things is the fact that Aloe Blacc's last album, 2006's <i>Shine Through</i>, was an inspired and often-innovative shot at pushing hip hop-inflected R&amp;B forward; there were a few baffling moments, but he was defiantly ambitious enough to do some pretty out-there things to minimalist disco, Tropicália, and Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"". The one time <i>Good Things </i><span> actually hits on a comparable throw-out-the-blueprint moment, it's with an unlikely cover-- in this case, the Velvet Underground's ""Femme Fatale"", re-envisioned as a satin-suited ballad for slow dances. That's a neat bit of unconventional thinking that this album could've used a little more of-- less by-the-book horn charts and worn-out homilies, more era-hopping hybrids and unexpected detours. As it stands, <i>Good Things </i>feels like hopping into a time machine, dialing it to 40 years ago, then forgetting to bring a stack of recent 12"" singles with you to completely blow 1970's mind.</span></p></div>"|14695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14695-good-things/|6.7|Nate Patrin

In 2009 he released the deservedly well-received singles ""Hypercolor"" and ""Agnus Dei"" on his own Ancestor label, and then he scored one of the best remixes on Bibio's <i>The Apple and the Tooth</i>, a molten vamp on ""Dwrcan"". This led to an invitation to perform with Nosaj Thing at one of Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder sessions, to working with Amon Tobin as Eskamon, and to releasing his own tracks on Warp and Planet Mu. With the release of his debut LP on Ninja Tune, it seems clear that his moment has arrived. Unfortunately, he hasn't quite risen to meet it.</p>
<p>Eskmo's music incorporates hip-hop, glitch, and, increasingly, dubstep. His self-titled debut has all the right trappings: It sounds like a malfunctioning arcade cabinet, it's knee-deep in bass, the percussion appears to consist mainly of dice and bubbles, the synth lines are pinched-off and squealing, and there are some denatured vocals. But only a couple of tracks, the wriggly ""Moving Glowstream"" and the mildly irritating ""Starships"", have anything like the lopsided textures, rhythmic swerves, and glowing colors that made Eskmo's 2009 singles so appealing. The other tracks are pretty flat and unmemorable, with the exception of the opener ""Cloudlight"", which provides a sense of colliding weathers that's sorely missed elsewhere. In particular, the record's home stretch is just kind of a mess, seeming to lose all regard for melodic and rhythmic center. What happened?</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the inclusion of vocals made Eskmo feel the need to thin out his productions, clearing out the knottier and thicker parts-- the most interesting ones. The vocals are in the archly louche, coarse-grained, low register that seems so prevalent since Matthew Dear's <i>Asa Breed</i>, and since they're neither novel nor especially charismatic, the production suffers needlessly. The acute angles and purposeful evolution of his prior singles are replaced by long, endlessly re-sliced bass and synth grooves, though there are flashes of life throughout, like the daisy-chained burps of the clearly Timbaland-inspired ""The Melody"". Without much variety to spice it up, the overall sluggardly pace is energy-sapping. An album of the sort of tracks on which Eskmo earned his reputation might not have gone amiss before he ventured a more songwriterly statement, but there's no reason he can't regroup and pull that off yet.</p></div>"|14680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14680-eskmo/|4.8|Brian Howe

David Bowie, on the other hand, produced <i>Station to Station</i>, an album he allegedly doesn't remember making, but which, ironically, stands as his most immaculately constructed album, and the most important tactical transition in a career built upon aesthetic reinvention.</p>
<p>Arriving in the wake of 1975's glam-rock-shunning, Philly-soul-fetishizing <i>Young Americans</i>, <i>Station to Station</i> offered proof that Bowie's fascination with American funk and disco was no one-off lark. But if <i>Young Americans</i> often felt like a studied genre exercise, <i>Station to Station</i> filtered that rhythmic influence through some of Bowie's other obsessions at the time: the austere Krautrock of Neu! and Kraftwerk, the occult, Nazism, and, yes, a whole lotta blow. And yet, for all the tales of late-night black-majick ceremonies and Hitler-salute scandals that surrounded its release, perhaps the most bizarre thing about <i>Station to Station</i> is that an album of such sinister orgin would turn out to be Bowie's highest charting album ever in the U.S., peaking at No. 3.</p>
<p>By the mid-70s, it was customary for pop stars to sing of their disillusionment with fame (see: <i>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</i>, Neil Young's <i>On the Beach</i>) but they usually did so in an insular, introspective fashion, after they had gained some distance from the storm. By contrast, <i>Station to Station</i> finds Bowie expressing his weariness while the party was still rages on around him<span>; even in the midst of his ""Golden Years"", he's yearning to ""run for the shadows."" </span>In essence, the album is a cry for help from <span>the champagne room</span>: On the hymn-like piano-ballad ""Word on a Wing"", the career chameleon decries this ""age of grand illusion"" (tellingly, this LP's Thin White Duke persona would be the last character Bowie  introduced), while the title track's momentous prog-disco suite-- with references to Aleister Crowley and Kabbalism-- charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening. ""It's not the side effects of the cocaine,"" Bowie declares as the song hits its funky, 4/4 stride, ""I'm thinking that it must be love."" Rarely have delusions been rendered with such grandeur.</p>
<p>This repackaged 3xCD <i>Station to Station</i> arrives as part of an ongoing campaign of deluxe Bowie reissues, and this one's primary selling point-- a remastered version cut from the original analog tapes-- should pique the interest of more than just ardent audiophiles. For all its futurist intimations, <i>Station to Station</i>'s most integral elements are acoustic-- E Street Band member Roy Bittan's luxuriant piano rolls, drummer Dennis Davis' dexterous grooves, and Bowie's sax-squawking, which meld to glorious, otherworldly effect on ""TVC15"". The new master perfectly mediates between the album's surface elegance and underlying menace.</p>
<p>And in lieu of any studio outtakes or rarities, we get a complete, two-disc version of Bowie's famed March '76 Nassau Coliseum concert, a long-time bootleg that also provided bonus-track fodder for Rykodisc's 1991 <i>Station to Station</i> issue. The need for another mid-70s Bowie live album may seem minimal given the relatively recent reissues of <i>David Live</i> (1974) and <i>Stage</i> (1978), but the Nassau concert is a rousing document of the <i>Station to Station</i>-era line-up (with Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye subbing in for Bittan and Stacey Hayden in the place of Earl Slick) eagerly applying its slick, polyrhythmic panache to glam-rock warhorses like ""Suffragette City"" and ""Panic in Detroit"", and compacting ""Life on Mars?"" and ""Five Years"" into Broadway-scaled medleys. In retrospect, the Nassau show represents something of a last lap around the arena for Bowie as the show-stopping, populist entertainer, before he laid his early-70s material to rest for a while and delved into the more experimental terrain of <i>Low</i>, <i>""Heroes""</i>, and <i>Lodger</i>. To paraphrase another enigmatic pop icon who had a conflicted relationship with stardom: first he took Long Island, then he took Berlin.</p></div>"|14687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|9.5|Stuart Berman

Regardless, it was a bit of a surprise when Arthur Cayzer, the UK post-dubstepper who works as Pariah, revealed to me that his beat-building process usually begins with a vocal sample: ""I find that vocals make it much easier for me to connect emotionally  with a tune, so I guess it makes sense that I have taken to using them  in almost every tune I've written.""</p>
<p>I've never really thought of the genres Cayzer works in as being particularly voice-centered, but maybe it's time for that to change. He counts Burial and James Blake, two like-minded artists who also showcase some sort of prominent vocal style in their work, as influences-- and that influence is definitely apparent to a point on Cayzer's debut EP, <i>Safehouses</i>. Save for the closing title track, all of the cuts here feature vocal samples in some way, whether it be the chopped-up cries within ""Crossed Out"" or the ghost-in-the-machine moans folded within ""Railroad"".</p>
<p>Cayzer isn't just an effective imitator, though; he's doing something distinctly different from his peers here in terms of presentation. Burial shrouds his melodies in bomb-shelter lockstep rhythms, while Blake usually turns vocal lines into putty in his hands, amorphously draping them over whatever screwed rhythm he's dumbing out to in his own mind; Cayzer, by contrast, presents his melodies nakedly, with precious few effects applied. This stylistic approach is aided by the pristine production at work here; every rhythmic hit and clapping backbeat sounds crisp and sharp-- almost the polar opposite of the bitrate-blown terror-juke of Werk Discs head Actress' fascinatingly complex release earlier this year, <i>Splazsh</i>.</p>
<p>The most stunning aspect of <i>Safehouses</i> isn't any singular stylistic tic, though: it's the overall sweep of the thing. Cayzer works through a breadth of sub-genres-- the bass music of ""The Slump"", ""Prism""'s whomping acid-house squelch, the digitized hip-hop clap of ""C-Beams"", and most impressively, the Gas-recalling ambient smother of the title track. That he's able to incorporate so many recognizant signifiers while transcending pastiche is impressive; the fact that he's done so while moving light years away from his breakout single, last year's ""Detroit Falls"", is astounding.</p></div>"|14683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14683-safehouses-ep/|8.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

While there's variety from track to track, the group continues to mine the common ground between Silkworm's tasteful classic-rock inclinations and the pastoral majesty of Seam.  (It's only fair, given that three-fourths of Bottomless Pit came from those groups.)  Not much has changed lyrically, either. When Tim Midgett's at the microphone, he offers disarmingly guileless phrases and thoughts, and imbues them with a heartening vulnerability.  Andy Cohen's tracks feature him unspooling noir-flavored narratives whose tumbling rush of words mesh perfectly with the artful sloppiness of his guitar playing.</p>
<p>In that light, it almost seems appropriate for <i>Blood Under the Bridge</i> to feel less like an actual follow-up to <i>Hammer</i>, and more like the second half of a sprawling yet cohesive double-album set. <i>Blood </i>even seems to begin in the middle, with the understated ""Winterwind"". Behind that track's relaxed gait and resigned sigh, however, is an unflinching resolve that Midgett ably puts into words: ""Waiting on deliverance is just like waiting on a tree that you can't get out from under."" The tension exemplified in that lyric-- torn between being in a place you don't want to be, and not having the ability (or desire) to escape--  informs most of the tracks on <i>Blood</i>. Midgett doesn't necessarily betray his emotions when he sings, but whether he's navigating a vengeful line like ""so many fuckers in this world to line up and trade for you"" (from the raucous ""Late""), or offering a more plaintive sentiment (""I've been waiting on the real you all along,"" from ""Kiss Them All""), that push-pull impulse is always evident.</p>
<p>It might be harder to keep up with what Cohen's singing about on ""Summerwind""-- he spends most of the track's four minutes spitting out lyrics in a ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" style-- you only have to catch a couple of fragments to realize the song's nostalgic regret.  He's a little more to the point on album closer ""38 Souls"", painting a portrait about a punch-the-clock grim-reaper type whose frustration is best expressed through Cohen's holler and intermittent bursts of over-amplified guitar.</p>
<p>Ending on this burst of seemingly impotent anger is where <i>Blood </i>best distinguishes itself from its predecessor.  The closing track on <i>Hammer of the Gods</i>, ""Sevens Sing"", offered a despondency similar to ""38 Souls"", but in a more restrained and resigned manner.  The difference between that song's mood and the cautious hope offered on album opener ""The Cardinal Movements"" could be measured in light years. <i>Blood</i>, on the other hand, lets the quiet resolve voiced in its opener find a more insistent and active voice at its ending.  It might be nothing more than fitful raging against the dying of the light, but sometimes that rage is what's needed most of all.</p></div>"|14682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14682-blood-under-the-bridge/|7.4|David Raposa

The blip of abbreviated sound clips bridged by the static of switching stations has become sonic shorthand in postmodern pop music for a good reason. Exile's 2009 album, <i>Radio</i>, was a jumbled, quasi-Steinski sample collage that tried to make some kind of sense of all that airwave debris. In the process, the West Coast indie hip-hop beatmaker played up a sort of assaultive, yammering overload you only get from that particular medium. He sabotaged some interesting post-Prefuse 73 beats in the bargain, too, obscuring his fine-tuned sense of nuanced production techniques with a lot of uncharacteristically obvious pseudo-comedic nonsense. But that's what remix albums are for, right?</p>
<p>Eh. <i>AM/FM</i> does give some of Exile's peers a shot at reinterpreting <i>Radio</i>'s plunderphonic drive-time routine, and given the structure of the original album, it actually seems like a logical conclusion. But while the introduction of other producers gives the raw material the sort of thematic eclecticism that <i>Radio</i>'s one-man aesthetic only met halfway, it also means that it comes across like one of those freeform shows where the DJ just throws incoherent sets together at the last minute.</p>
<p>Most of <i>AM/FM</i> falls in that odd space between familiar California underground rap (with appearances by the likes of Blu, Fashawn, and a couple of dudes from Living Legends) and the West Coast's hazy, psychedelic mutations of neo-soul. For instance, there are two remixes of ""It's Coming Down"", a burbling, soulful Detroit-style beat in its original form. One of the remixes, by Shafiq Husayn, is a slow-boiling mess of noodly synthesizers and false-start basslines that eventually oozes its way into some kind of vaguely funky lava-gurgle throb. The other one takes the source beat and adds Alchemist and Evidence going all classic-backpacker over it. Well, at least it's versatile.</p>
<p>That does seem to make a sort of sense if you picture that dichotomy as the same one alluded to in the title-- two different approaches on two different wavelengths, just like the Top 40 vs. freeform disc jockey split between the AM and FM bands a few decades back. But it doesn't make for the most consistent listening, and whether the MCs are at their best (Blu on ""Love Line""; the Fashawn/Blame One/Big Tone/ADaD montage on ""Mega Mix"") or just filling space (Grouch &amp; Eligh on ""Population Control""), they do a better job of adding something new to the tracks than the knob-twiddling guest producers do.</p>
<p>Aside from a couple of revamps of ""In Love""'s soul-jazz breaks by Milo1 (a short but sweet Dilla-style transformation) and DJ Day (throwing a fiercer break beneath the stand-up bassline), most of the altered beats are tweaked for the worse. What do ""In Love"", ""Population Control"", or ""In Tune"" have to gain from being turned into chirpily inebriated junkshop-band rehearsals by Clutchy Hopkins, Samiyam, or Assembly Line? <i>AM/FM</i> isn't cohesive, it drops two unremarkable-at-best songs for every interesting one, and it sounds like it's trying too hard to get your attention. At least that makes it a lot like actual radio.</p></div>"|14644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14644-amfm/|5.6|Nate Patrin

It makes you sound pantheistic and totally in tune with nature, yet also more primal and badass than if you'd just invoked trees or rivers or something.  So-- Fleet Foxes, Band of Horses, Grizzly Bear, Department of Eagles-- I get it. But the Moondoggies? Really? Doesn't this name sound like it'd belong to a group of genial, balding, middle-aged dudes singing jokey songs about life on the prairie? Something not too far removed from the Gourds maybe?</p>
<p>Nope, the Moondoggies actually have far more in common with those aforementioned, better-named bands, making a manful, harmony-heavy brand of Americana rock modeled after fragile but forceful legends Neil Young, the Band, and the Grateful Dead. <i>Tidelands</i>, by contrast, finds the Moondoggies (and particularly lead singer Kevin Murphy) admirably striving to find their own voice, yet it's frequently a more crabbed and deliberate album than its predecessor. In other words, a quintessential example of artistic growing pains.</p>
<p>The Moondoggies, like indie-folk leading lights Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, draw great strength from their vocal harmonies. In the Moondoggies' case, these harmonies frequently take on a gospel tinge, and they're intrinsic to the success of all of <i>Tidelands</i>' best songs. But unlike those freak-folk-friendly acts, these guys don't really isolate their harmonies or deploy them in unexpected places, instead tying them down pretty firmly to trad-rock strictures.</p>
<p>That's not to say this strategy can't be effective-- for proof, look no further than the churning, prophetic title track, the <i>Music From Big Pink</i> doppelgänger ""What Took So
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
Long"", or the violin-sweetened ""Lead Me On"". Still, it's a fine line the Moondoggies are walking, between something familiar but stirring and something utterly pedestrian, and they start straying across the bad side of the divide with frequency during the back half of the album. ""Down the Well"" and ""Can't Be in the Middle"" kick up a fair ruckus, but absent sufficient harmonic sweetening they end up sounding like the Drive-By Truckers with weaker drums and considerably worse lyrics. And at least the brooding guitars and boiling organs of those two cuts keep the words from commanding too much attention. No such luck on disappointing acoustic spotlights ""Empress of the North"" and ""We Can't All Be Blessed"", the latter of which finds Murphy awkwardly trying to shoehorn too many unnecessary syllables into nearly every one of his lines. Those kinds of issues are harder to overcome than the Moondoggies' unfortunate moniker.</p></div>"|14650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14650-tidelands/|5.3|Joshua Love

But L.A. dream-punks No Age seek to straighten up and fly a little straighter on <i>Everything in Between</i>, tamping down their whiplash tempos, prying open their songs to let a little more air in, further settling into their frantic sound. Their songwriting's grown in leaps and bounds, evincing unexpected depth yet never shying from a satisfying detour. And their sound's become more balanced; hot blasts of dissonance have been turned into smoldering pockets of noise. <i>Everything in Between</i> is a grown-up, downright respectable record about the pitfalls of being a lifer with a 9 to 5, and the sound's matured along with their outlook. Less ferocious, more deliberate but in many ways more compelling, <i>Everything in Between</i> finds No Age matching a new, nuanced approach to their expansive noise.</p>
<p>By this point, you probably know what goes into a No Age song: A scuzzy intro jumps face-first into a thrashabout hook, either jumping again into another firestorm or swelling to a swift end. On 2008's <i>Nouns</i>, they cut these ripcords through with huge, gorgeous clouds of sound. It worked beautifully at the LP level, but the songs themselves felt shot out of a cannon. They didn't always leave room for nuance.</p>
<p><i>Everything in Between</i> fiinds a little space for everything. Randy Randall's guitar now buzzes and howls throughout these songs, providing them with a backbone rather than simply standing behind them and shoving. Dean Spunt's drums go from a wet thwack to a wild carnival stomp as the situation dictates, seeming to take on new forms as the LP progresses. Every tone, from Randall's guitar squeals to Spunt's impassioned shouts, feels treated, scuffed up, warped. But the sounds are more spectral, less squalid, a product of Randall's varying his guitar tones and the duo's embracing a few more patient tempos. Rather than stepping to one huge precipice at the edge of every song, they've made them more jagged, played up the inter

tensions, and traded in one big thrill for a seemingly self-propelled series of precision blasts.</p>
<p>Structurally, <i>Everything in Between</i> doesn't shy far from the <i>Nouns</i> formula: Several hook-forward numbers anchor the front half, the floatier stuff mostly shows up around the two-thirds mark, and they close the thing out with a total banger. But the tunes themselves are longer and slightly more traditional (they actually liked a couple of these choruses enough to sing them twice), and the punk rock urgency of their past work's been tempered slightly by a more deliberate pace and Randall's trickier, rustier, less world-beating guitar riffage. It all calls to mind less straight-up SoCal punk and more rangy, roughhewn indie rock; there's flecks of Dinosaur Jr.'s lazy crunch in ""Valley Hump Crash"", plenty of Hüsker Dü's pop urgency in ""Common Heat"", enough Sonic Youth to go around everywhere. They've opened up their tone palette so much here, it's as though just about anything could be around the corner. The drone bits feel especially purposeful this time around; ""Positive Amputation"" has all the skyward motion of an Explosions in the Sky tune, and nearly every time they pull back into these sonic curlicues, the record seems to breathe. They've long felt like a hardcore band with excellent noise instincts, but <i>Everything in Between</i> is where you realize they're mostly a rock band with a ridiculously good ear for sound.</p>
<p>Tuning into No Age for Dean Spunt's lyrics has always seemed a bit of a fool's errand; his tales of youthful malaise are accurately but rarely vividly rendered, and besides, it's not always been easy to make him out through the din. Spunt's voice, though still occasionally inaudible, sits far higher in the mix here on <i>Everything in Between</i>, sticking his lyrics-- and his thin, pleading voice-- at the center of some of these songs. Spunt's still not exactly a masterful singer, and he's just shy of the pitch a time or two here. He's putting his voice to better use though, with a batch of lyrics that underscore the motivational appeals to action that have long hovered around the No Age project. If the record's got a thesis statement, it's somewhere in its first line: ""One time is all I need to know my job's complete,"" Spunt notes, before proceeding with his most detailed, deliberate record yet. Despite the obvious care that went into it, <i>Everything in Between</i>'s hewn-from-pure-noise songwriting still feels more like a ridiculously good run of happy accidents than anything resembling hard work-- and it's shot through with an unassuming left coast attitude that makes the record all the more ingratiating.</p>
<p><i>Everything in Between</i> begins with a series of hits from Spunts' drums; it ends with fireworks. Not the big crash-boom city-spanners, nah; strictly bodega-special bottle rockets, popping along behind Spunt's drums in the chorus of ""Chem Trails"". It's sort of perfect; this is no lavish, decadent affair, no grab at some greater glory. This is a pair of friends getting together to make a truly compelling racket, and while the wildly successful <i>Everything in Between</i> is certainly cause for celebration, making some big scene would throw its balance off completely. <i>Everything in Between</i> certainly doesn't feel like some huge statement of purpose, some radical reinvention, some big move toward the mainstream; simply a sonically chameleonic, musically generous, seriously compelling record from a couple guys who've once again got all their pedals in a row.</p></div>"|14688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14688-everything-in-between/|8.8|Paul Thompson

And it's a pretty lavish format for a label to splash out on, at least considering the presumed death of the physical music object. But then Ninja Tune's earned the right to show off a little. At 20 years in the game, they're right behind Warp as the two longest-running (and successful) UK indie labels to come out of the late-1980s/early-90s explosion in dance music and hip-hop. So here's <i>Ninja Tune XX</i>, nearly 100 songs mapping out the label's current place in the scene.</p>
<p>How did Ninja get here? The label's had three key phases. In the early 90s, they helped to usher in trip-hop/instrumental hip-hop, with artists like Coldcut and DJ Food claiming that the future of music would be written in breakbeats and fuzzy samples. By the late 90s, they'd taken in neo-jazz cats and underground rappers, both of which had a live and loose fluidity that ran counter to the label's rep for downtempo loops. By the end of the first decade of the 21st-century, they'd absorbed many of the complementary/competing currents of post-rap culture: dubstep, UK hip-hop, grime, various hybrids of all three. The label debuted as a leader, then retrenched when rave culture exploded in a million directions, and came out the other end with a savvy magpie approach, which makes sense considering it's a label founded by DJs.</p>
<p>Ninja Tune's always evolved, adding new styles and refining the old, more than it's out-and-out reinvented itself. They never stopped releasing slow, moody instrumental hip-hop singles, for instance, even if they were no longer operating in a world where DJ Shadow flirted with mainstream stardom. And today's cutting-edge producers still owe plenty to the sort of thing Ninja Tune was doing a decade ago. (See the broken-jazz drum programming on the Zomby tune on <i>XX</i>.) Autechre's fractured-but-not-unfunky remix of the Bug's ""S
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
keng"" on <i>XX</i> sounds like both old-school IDM and up-to-date dancehall. It's a pretty perfect summation of a label that grabs for what's hot without rejecting its roots.</p>
<p>On <i>Ninja Tune XX</i>, things tend as always toward the instrumental, and those instrumentals still favor low-end inventiveness over trad hooks. Indeed, most of the weak tracks are the ones which abandon beat-science for undercooked melodies and less-than-striking singers. (The lukewarm trip-hop torch songs can be ignored outright.) The ""beats"" part of the label's famous ""beats and pieces"" equation certainly connects back, at various points, to Ninja's long history. But <i>XX</i> also feels very different from the 10-year-anniversary collection the label released in 2000, back when ""indie-friendly beats"" still meant turntablism, while dubstep was just a dark glimmer in the eyes of a few South London producers.</p>
<p>The scratchy vinyl-based warmth of the label's early days seems to be all but gone; a chillier digital-era sound palette predominates. Songs are more likely to be driven by frizzing 8-bit synth riffs than samples, and the drums often owe more to modern dancehall than Golden Age hip-hop. As for the rappers, it's the Brits who stand out, which points out how confident and pleasurable UK rappers have grown over the last decade. Back at the turn of the millennium, most people would have chosen rap-free beats over the contemporaneous crop of Brits imitating their NYC peers. Now there's a thrilling range of voices-- Ms Dynamite's smoky ragga-derived menace, the surreal vaudevillian back-and-forth of Big Dada Sound-- all working within very British idioms. Meanwhile, you've got American indie rapper Spank Rock backed by Todd Edwards' fluttering gospel samples, Four Tet softening the hardcore rhymes of the Anti-Pop Consortium with gently rolling techno, and Brit-rap survivor Roots Manuva refashioned into clockwork Rough Trade synth-punk by Micachu.</p>
<p>And I've described, what, less than 10 contributions? It's a lot to process. (It's got to be the only comp in history to feature both El-P and El-B, Michachu and King Jammy.) That breadth can seem a little intimidating if you're dipping into this stuff for the first time. <i>XX</i> might feel more like a gift to longtime fans-- you've seen us through both the boom times and the fallow patches, so here's your overstuffed reward-- but Ninja newbies shouldn't be put off. With the exception of house and techno, just about every crucial 21st century electronic style is touched upon here, a pretty excellent education with the feel of a well-stocked party playlist. <i>Ninja Tune XX</i> feels like both a late (if fond) farewell to the opulent multi-disc box sets of the 20th century <i>and</i> an announcement that Ninja Tune's A&amp;R instincts remain strong enough to survive the craziness of the 21st.</p></div>"|14672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14672-ninja-tune-xx-20-years-of-beats-and-pieces/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Four of the 11 songs on <i>Help Me Name Melody</i> are nameless, as if the Austin quartet actually needed assistance. Those four are also the only instrumentals, so maybe the lack of titles just corresponds to lack of lyrics. But there is something about this open, exploratory music that makes the album title fitting. These aren't experimental songs-- there are definite melodies, well-written and deftly played. But they also sound unconstrained and natural, more like growing plants than man-made constructions.</p>
<p>That organic effect comes not so much from the songwriting, which is often quite careful and precise, as how the songs are played. Subtle and confident, Weird Weeds control the music's continuous flow-- many of the tracks meld together across index breaks-- without sounding like control freaks. In other words, they let sounds happen as much as they make them happen. In that way they evoke the similarly authoritative nuance of Low. On the surface, that comparison is clearest in the band's penchant for reverent male-female vocal harmonies. But the connection goes deeper. Mining patient rhythms, minimal arrangements, and committed repetition, Weird Weeds reach peaks that match Low's most moving work.</p>
<p>Those are techniques the band has used before, but <i>Help Me Name Melody </i>is their most coherent result to date. Much of the cohesion comes from the lyrics, even though they total less than 250 words. In short phrases and humming deliveries, Weird Weeds capture glimpses of nature that reinforce the music's organic qualities, preferring words like sun, rain, rivers, and grass. ""Weeks of warm weather/ When does lovely weather become dry?"" Sandy Ewen moans in ""A Drought"", mimicking the solemn music that preceded her. Again like Low, there's a religious feeling to such prayer-like tunes, as if the band's patience has a divine quality.</p>
<p>On paper that might sound overly somber, but <i>Help Me Name Melody</i> is much more celebratory than meditative. There's a country-ish sway throughout, with Nick Hennies' drumming adding pulse to even the most reserved sections. Often that pulse and the sounds that grow around it produce sneaky crescendos. The sneakiest comes at the end-- a final untitled instrumental marches into a buzzing nest of guitar, evoking Earth's recent dusty post-metal, before melting into closer ""Sun Comes Up"", a hymn to the pleasures of contrarianism. ""When it's hot I stay cool/ When it's cold I stay warm/ When it rains I stay dry""-- sounds illogical, but for Weird Weeds, contradiction is as natural as a sun-lit rain shower.</p></div>"|14673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14673-help-me-name-melody/|7.6|Marc Masters

Veteran artists and familiar labels are leaning towards influences from pop or R&amp;B or house. The throb has turned into a wobble, and from there into a glitched-out burst of shrapnel. Everything's all tinted purplish and refracting neon off chrome surfaces where grey concrete used to stand. And maybe that's how it should be. Instead of disappearing into its own navel or mistaking alienating inscrutability for artistic advancement, dubstep's propensity for spinoff mutations has resulted in a branching evolution that's been accessible to a lot of longtime fans every step of the way. But not every pillar of the scene is restless enough to head in that direction. And whether the new Digital Mystikz album is a bold affirmation of tradition or just an artist content to stick with what worked from the start, it should appeal to listeners who missed the idea of what dubstep used to be.</p>
<p>Not that <i>Return II Space</i> is irrelevant-- in fact, it's the continuation of an aesthetic that a lot of genre enthusiasts thought was sorely missing. As the solo-album-in-all-but-name from DMZ co-founder Mala, it's closer to the King Tubby and Scientist affinities of classic dubstep sonics than the glossy electro inflections that rock trendier speakers. This is hoodies-up music, engineered with the kind of echo calibrated to meet thousand-yard stares in dark corners. Drums are heavy on lab-sterilized snare hits; low frequencies are split between subtle-toned hums and subdued burbles; the actual basslines are heavy, but they submerge you instead of launching you.</p>
<p>Yet there's enough unique ornamentation to push things ahead. It could be as coldly serene as the crystalline bells in ""Unexpected"" or as pacing-tiger ominous as the vintage synth in ""Pop Pop Epic""; as forward-looking as the tweak of Joy Orbison's choppy drones in ""Livin' Different"" or as historically evocative as the title track, which rides on an aluminum propeller whir that sounds like it was extracted from the Prodigy's <i>Music for the Jilted Generation</i> highlight ""Skylined"". Or it could be ""Mountain Dread March"", which is all seething buildup with the big knock-you-on-your-ass payoff largely withheld-- and that, cleverly enough, makes the whole trembling procession feel epic in its own way without having to drop a shit-ton of lead-weight low-end on your skull. It's just a snowball of trap hits rolling downhill, and it does more for the idea of momentum than an armada of gut-churn bludgeon-bass singles could.</p>
<p>Still, there's a good chance that this album in the form attainable by you the consumer is not the best way to experience it. <i>Return II Space</i>-- which, at six songs, seems a bit brief-- should be looked at as a triple-12"", even if you snagged it in digital form. This music was built for sound systems, not headphones, and while they stand strong on their own, it feels like these would sound best pitted against other tracks that take different angles to the sound. Sure, ""Mountain Dread March"" sounds massive here, but it might not even reach its full potential until you can hear it in a mix, like what Kode9 does with it on his <i>DJ-Kicks</i> installation. There, it doesn't really sound like a preservation act at all-- it feels more like the glue that holds all the pieces together.</p></div>"|14663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14663-return-ii-space/|7.5|Nate Patrin

Over the course of 41 minutes, the NYC duo deliver slice after slice of buzzy, dancey new wave, with little fanfare or provocation; there's something to admire in how capably they capture their genre's most crowd-pleasing signifiers. In a musical culture when artists are sometimes awarded points just for showing up, these two come to the party dressed to the nines, with a few bottles of (tastefully presented) booze and their genre's most crowd-pleasing, familiar signifiers to share.</p>
<p>In terms of cheap thrills, then, there's plenty to like here-- particularly, the echoed throb of single ""Pigeons"" or ""Dead Ending""'s slinky disco. As a front-to-back listening experience, however, most of these songs lose any sort of pleasurable impact they'd have as standalone cuts, instead coagulating into a near-shapeless mass of mid-tempo melody. As a whole, the thing kind of feels like a dulled switchblade: it might look shiny, but good luck drawing blood with it.</p>
<p>One problem is Everdell's vocals. Throughout the record, she alternates between a cool, cosmopolitan patter and the kind of high-pitched, volume-raising plead that has made Karen O famous. You don't get the feeling that anything's at stake, and the fact that most of her lyrics could be mistaken for leftovers from the last Metric record doesn't help.</p>
<p>If the Hundred in the Hands want to find success beyond getting remixed on a future Kitsuné compilation (trust me, it'll happen), they're going to have to build some sort of discernible identity first. They might want to take some cues from the record's pair of standouts, ""This Day Is Made"" and album closer ""The Beach"". Both cuts have a deliciously downtempo feel that suits Everdell's voice quite well, the latter sounding like a Cardigans song that never was (and should've been). Otherwise, this record is the SoHo-boutique equivalent of a Thanksgiving dinner: it tastes all right, but good luck staying awake 'til dessert.</p></div>"|14670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14670-the-hundred-in-the-hands/|4.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

In revisiting that youthful enthusiasm, Deerhunter brilliantly rekindle it, and the result meets <i>Microcastle/Weird Era (Cont.)</i> as the band's most exhilarating work to date. Whether those halcyon days were real or just idealized doesn't matter. With producer Ben Allen, who lent a bass-heavy sheen to Animal Collective's <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, these four guys-- lead singer Bradford Cox, singer/guitarist Lockett Pundt, bass player Josh Fauver, and drummer Moses Archuleta-- have created a seamless album of startling emotional clarity.</p>
<p>Deerhunter have never lacked ambition. 2007 breakout <i>Cryptograms</i> came as two discrete halves: one front-loaded with ambient drifts and clanging post-punk aggression, the other blasting off into sunny psych-pop. <i>Microcastle</i> turned out to be a sprawling, ghostly amusement park of a double album, with violence and frail beauty never far from each other. And then there are all those EPs, side projects, and rarities. In blog posts and interviews, Cox has shown himself to be a music lover of the highest order, almost a platonic ideal of the artist as fan.</p>
<p>This record marks a distinctly different approach for the band, more streamlined and stripped down, and in its sparest moments, it echoes the stark intimacy and one-take effortlessness of records like Neil Young's <i>Tonight's the Night</i> or Chris Bell's <i>I Am the Cosmos</i>. Fans of the band's earlier stuff may understandably miss some of the old  electric-guitar squall, but <i>Halcyon Digest</i>'s expanded instrumental palette-- acoustic guitar, electronic percussion, banjo, autoharp,  harmonica, vocal harmonies, and saxophone (!)-- creates endless depths of intricacy and nuance to explore in headphones.</p>
<p>In the past, Deerhunter's gift for garbled sonics and Cox's stream-of-consciousness methods made it easy to downplay the group's lyrical ability. That's not the case here. Whether by Pundt, who sings lead on two of <i>Halcyon Digest</i>'s best songs, or Cox, Deerhunter's songwriting congeals into a style all its own, with lyrics moved front-and-center. The words fit perfectly together,  down to the most trivial minutia: Cox asking, ""Did you stick with me?""  at the start of garage-pop fist-pumper ""Memory Boy"", right after the  track people are most likely to skip (funny!), or Pundt mentioning a  ""marching band"" on another uptempo proto-anthem, ""Fountain Stairs"", as  Bill Oglesby's sax first appears.</p>
<p>The topical ground covered here is inspired, too: ""Revival"", a sort of Southern gothic folk-rock baptism, embraces religion. ""I'm saved, I'm saved!"" Cox exalts, ""I felt his presence heal me."" Recorded to four-track, ""Basement Scene"" ""dream[s] a little dream"" that soon turns nightmarish: ""I don't wanna get old"" quickly becomes ""I wanna get old"" as Cox weighs the alternative. And first single ""Helicopter"" is a beautifully watery electro-acoustic farewell that uses a tragic Dennis Cooper story about a Russian prostitute (graciously reprinted in the liner notes) to support its emotional bleakness.</p>
<p>Then there's seven-and-a-half-minute finale ""He Would Have Laughed"", dedicated to Jay Reatard, the Memphis garage rocker who died last winter of drug-related causes at age 29. Its lyrics are the most cryptic on <i>Halcyon Digest</i>-- full sentences are rarely formed before Cox closes them off with his usual crisp consonants. A simple acoustic guitar riff repeats as other percussion elements and electronic tones pan across the track, occasionally joined by the full band. Cox admits to growing ""bored as I get older,"" and then goes into a dream-- ""I lived on a farm, yeah/ I never lived on a farm""-- until he finally all but asks, ""Where are your friends tonight?"" The track cuts off unexpectedly mid-note.</p>
<p>Deerhunter unveiled their new album by asking fans to print out a vintage DIY-style poster, photocopy it, and tape it up all over town. In the last couple of weeks, band members have participated in all-night online chats with some of their most devoted fans. We'll never be able to parse every lyric or tease out every technical intricacy-- though somebody will probably try-- but <i>that</i> is what <i>Halcyon Digest</i> is all about: nostalgia not for an era, not for antiquated technology, but for a feeling of excitement, of connection, of that dumb obsession that makes life worth living no matter how horrible it gets. And then sharing that feeling with somebody else who'll start the cycle all over again.</p></div>"|14681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/|9.2|Marc Hogan

But <i>The Trip</i>, her first album under her own name, still feels like a coming-out party. Following Stereolab's recently announced hiatus (the band's upcoming <i>Not Music</i> was culled from the sessions for 2008's <i>Chemical Chords</i>) and the disbanding of Monade, Sadier is finally on her own. She didn't waste the opportunity: <i>The Trip</i> is breathtaking, a rich collection of torch songs and subtle, meandering melodies that clear away the distracting frenzy and Byzantine flourishes of her past groups to expose the humane beauty of her voice.</p>
<p><i>The Trip</i> was produced by Emmanuel Mario, who recorded Monade's last album, and Richard Swift, the American lo-fi songsmith who makes his own quirky chamber-pop albums for Secretly Canadian. Both are smart matches for Sadier. Mario brings the wisdom that comes with familiarity, knowing how to capture the airy voluptuousness of Sadier's voice without indulging in the drama of its detachment. And Swift, who could make even the most self-serious artist sound whimsical, brings levity and fluidity to the collection, allowing its melodies to amble without Stereolab's laser-focus. Both producers capture Sadier's aesthetic through an appropriately sepia-toned lens, but also leave the palette clean enough so that the emotional weight of the tracks-- be they smoldering or melancholic-- comes from her voice. So, in lieu of bouncy pop melodies, cool, jazzy exotica, or cerebral genre experiments, <i>The Trip</i> is full of autumnal ballads. The instrumentation is graceful and measured, giving Sadier's willowy songs a cozy underpinning.</p>
<p>Sadier's lyrics and delivery, though a wonderful and essential part of Stereolab's aesthetic, have sometimes felt secondary, as if they are chasing bandleader Tim Gane's instrumental ideas. But <i>The Trip</i> is gentler and less melodically direct than her work with that band, so pointedly narrative (and disarmingly personal) lyrics can drive the hazy arrangement. Like on ""One Million Year Trip"", a haunting number that explicitly deals with her sister's suicide. The light krautrock pulse and gentle, ascending synth chords are muted and stay out of the way, and the tune's power comes from its vocal. ""She went on a million-year trip and left everything behind-- her skin, her hair,"" Sadier sings, ""She has a long way to travel, so I will open my heart, and let the pain run along as there is no point in holding on.""</p>
<p>Though notably subdued and tinged with sadness, the album isn't a downer. There are a few brisk moments to the dreamy collection-- most notably Sadier's striking version of Les Rita Mitsouko's louche disco rocker ""Un Soir, Un Chien"", which toys with the playfully mechanical synthesized textures of her former band. She even manages to turn Wendy &amp; Bonnie's somber folk ballad ""By the Sea"" into a sexy, propulsive swirl of regret.</p>
<p>It's not that Sadier sounds fundamentally different here than she does in Stereolab-- her voice still oozes ethereality and sophistication. But <i>The Trip</i> feels like an expansion into new territory. Without Gane and his spacey-cool affectations, Sadier is free to revel in warm, rich balladry. You sense an artist known in part for her detachment leaning in close to share a secret.</p></div>"|14660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14660-the-trip/|8.2|Rebecca Raber

The list of things Tricky does poorly (rock, house, singer-songwriter pop, ska, disco, etc.) is much longer than the list of things he does well (which basically amounts to the sound he invented and perfected on the music he released between 1995 and 1999). For 10 years, he's refused to accept that an inimitable style can be a strength as much a limitation, a foundation to build from rather than something to reject as predictable. His music's suffered horribly thanks to many, many failed attempts to show off a versatility that just isn't there.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st century, Tricky decided to ditch his dank, anxiety-ridden, and reputation-making brand of UK hip-hop. Critics had been carping that he'd devolved to pastiching himself on records like 1998's <i>Angels With Dirty Faces</i>. Fans wondered if his relentlessly bleak sound had anywhere left to go. Stretching the formula might not have been such a bad idea. Unfortunately Tricky's reinvention was a little more scorched-earth than anyone expected. On 2001's execrable <i>Blowback</i> and 2003's ever-so-slightly-less-awful <i>Vulnerable</i>, he flipped both middle fingers at his audience while running straight into the worst music of his career, a sad stew of lazily executed alt-rock and dance-pop clichés. Tricky had often been blasted for having a one-note sound, but these failed attempts at schizoid genre-mixing proved that at least he'd really <i>believed</i> in that one note.</p>
<p>On 2008's <i>Knowle West Boy</i> and the new <i>Mixed Race</i>, the two tentative comeback albums he's released since the <i>Blowback</i>/<i>Vulnerable</i> fiasco, the standout tracks continue to look back to Tricky's bleaker (and better) 90s records. His music sounds as visceral and committed as ever when he's working with materials he's mastered: hip-hop, dub, urban dread. And a few <i>Mixed Race</i> tracks do give up the goods: The ravaged voice that sounds both sexy and sinister; the oppressive atmosphere he can still conjure effortlessly; the way his slow, bleary rapping meshes so beautifully with low-key female vocalists. On opener ""Every Day"", he adds a new and blessedly subtle country blues vibe, and it suggests that, hey, maybe he really <i>can</i> expand his music without totally ditching what makes it special.</p>
<p>But no, he'd still rather try his hand at spacey Kompakt-esque techno-disco (""Really Real"") or Middle Eastern music (""Hakim""), even though the evidence suggests he's got very little feel for either. And those are the album's more successful stabs at style hopping. There's also the anemic riff on Daft Punk (""Kingston Logic"") and the lifeless hip-house track he flogs with a big cheesy hunk of Henry Mancini's ""Peter Gunn Theme"" (""Murder Weapon""). True, these missteps aren't as embarrassing as the ones on <i>Blowback</i> or <i>Vulnerable</i>. For one thing, there's no Alanis Morissette collaboration, and Tricky seems to have at least accepted that his music only works when he goes for darkness, eeriness, creepiness, whatever. But his attempts at rock or club music invariably have the touchy-feely quality of a dabbler who's moved out of his comfort zone but lacks the craft or confidence to pull it off. At this point, he's released enough terrible-to-mediocre records that releasing a strong ten-track album in the vein of his old stuff wouldn't be blasted as backpedaling.

Though known for their punk roots and political lyrics, they are not cynical. And when bass player Nicky Wire goes around telling interviewers that the new record is going to sound like ""heavy metal Tamla Motown,"" you know he desperately believes it-- doesn't really matter what it actually sounds like. ""We're going for big radio hits on this one,"" said the band's guitarist James Dean Bradfield about <i>Postcards From a Young Man</i>, presumably talking about radios outside of the United States. So mission accomplished, I suppose.</p>
<p>The band seemed to undergo a sort of catharsis making last year's <i>Journal For Plague Lovers</i>, which used lyrics from a notebook left behind by long-disappeared (and presumed deceased) band member Richey Edwards. They made their best record since the 1990s and gave their friend a last airing, and now on to the next thing. <i>Postcards</i> goes in a distinctly different direction, and I'd say the previous Manics album it most closely parallels musically is 1998's <i>This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours</i>. It's packed with soaring string arrangements, massive choruses, guitar pyrotechnics, guest spots, and a gospel choir that shows up on four tracks. It's big, colorful, and determined in a way this band has pretty much perfected.</p>
<p>Some of those guest spots are hard to notice without liner notes (John Cale playing keys on ""Auto-Intoxication"", Duff McKagan (!) playing bass on ""A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun""), but they make sense given how much looser the group sounds here. Echo and the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch duets with Bradfield on ""Some Kind of Nothingness"", and while they both offer commanding vocal performances, they are a bit overwhelmed by the choir that swells up at the end: There's just a bit too much going on at once, which turns out to be the album's one weakness. When they pull back a bit and just rock, though, it works. ""A Billion Balconies"" runs headlong into its guitar-strangling midsection, and ""Auto-Intoxication"" is ragged and heavy-- when it goes into the bridge after a stinging guitar break, you hear how galvanizing this band can be.</p>
<p>Some of the band's bigger gestures come off. Lead single ""(It's Not War) Just the End of Love"" is grandiose and intentionally sweeping, opening with a huge string theme, but the compact writing, tuneful guitar solo, and instantly memorable chorus make it easy to enjoy. ""All We Make Is Entertainment"" is a slow anthem, and Wire's lyrics pile on the irony: ""All we make is entertainment/ It's so damn easy/ And inescapable/ We're so post-modern/ We're so post-everything."" Bradfield as usual does an otherworldly job of making melodies out of words like that-- he's an outstanding vocalist, which makes it curious that Nicky Wire takes the lead on a song here. His reedy turn on ""The Future Has Been Here Forever"", which also features drummer Sean Moore on trumpet, is better than his past lead vocals, but still a work in progress.</p>
<p>While I wouldn't say that <i>Postcards From a Young Man</i> is quite the late-career masterstroke <i>Journal For Plague Lovers</i> was, it is still a product of a re-energized band. Whether or not it actually garners them the hits and mass audience they're aiming for (and at least in Britain, it seems inconceivable that it won't), they've managed to make an inviting, populist album that deserves the attention. It's maybe not quite heavy metal Tamla Motown, but it is Manic Street Preachers, and here, that's enough.</p></div>"|14665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14665-postcards-from-a-young-man/|7.5|Joe Tangari

In the case of Marcus Lambkin aka Shit Robot, that's just the education he's enjoyed: Now 39, the Irish-born producer started DJing in Dublin in the late 1980s before moving to New York in 1992 to absorb the acid house and disco bubbling up in the city's underground clubs. There he'd eventually link up with James Murphy and have a hand in creating DFA.</p>
<p>Weirdly, though, this is Lambkin's debut full-length. The record features a host of high-profile collaborators-- Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, Juan MacLean-- and is executive-produced by Murphy himself. This, in addition to Lambkin's history and pedigree, possibly gives <i>From the Cradle to the Rave</i> an inflated sense of promise-- it's the kind of record you almost expect to be good. But as with any debut, it's important to try to strip away some of those associations and see what's actually under the hood.</p>
<p>On some level Lambkin's sound is classic DFA-- sturdy dance numbers augmented with vocals-- but stylistically he's more scattered than his peers, integrating not only disco but sounds from all across the house music spectrum. He's obviously got great taste, and his production skill is immediately clear-- there's a real mastery of space in these tracks, full of sound but never overcrowded. So these are all really good instrumentals, but Lambkin struggles a bit in turning them into something more. If LCD or Hot Chip are a clean genre hybrid, then this sometimes feels like club tracks with vocals added in after the fact.</p>
<p>That's not always a bad thing-- occasionally you wind up with something that sounds like a cool vocal edit of an extended house jam, for instance. What usually tips the scales one way or the other here is the singer. ""Take 'Em Up"", for example, is steamy disco-funk, and guest vocalist Nancy Whang is a great fit-- her singing tends to be flat, but on this cut it's just the right contrast with the bouncy arrangement. The flip side is a song like ""Grim Receiver"", which is a killer acid-house instrumental that's ultimately spoiled by Juan MacLean's croaky talk-sing, or ""I Found Love"", where Lambkin lays a bizarre country-western vocal on an otherwise rad minimal-house thumper.</p>
<p>There's of course something appealingly raw about classically not-good singing alongside crisp electronics, and bands like the Human League and LCD have shown how that can work. But especially with disco and house, a great vocal doesn't hurt and sometimes an instrumental is enough. Not surprisingly, the best cuts here are the ones like ""I Got a Feeling"" and ""Triumph!!!"" where Lambkin's able really to sprawl out and let his synths and beats do the talking. On these, it's easy to hear the decades of dance music this guy's absorbed and appreciate how he's able to spin that into sounds that are at once reverential and future-forward. This doesn't happen on every track, but when it does, it's something special.</p></div>"|14679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14679-from-the-cradle-to-the-rave/|7.1|Joe Colly

The music on these mp3 releases consisted of cheap-sounding home recordings that were murky and blown out, but the style drew on the ethereal end of contemporary R&amp;B, with layered vocals, falsetto, and tons of reverb. They turned out to be the work of Tom Krell, a philosophy student who splits time between Brooklyn and Cologne, Germany. The online buzz surrounding HTDW built steadily through 2010, and now we have <i>Love Remains</i>, a collection of songs taken from the EPs (some of which have been re-touched in the studio) plus a handful of new tracks.</p>
<p>Krell has clear and specific ideas of what he wants to do with How to Dress Well, many of which use the process of memory as focal point. According to blog posts and interviews, Krell cares deeply about R&amp;B from the late 1980s and 90s, and he's creating a ghosted version of the music, suggesting how sounds wear down and fade over time. ""I Started Remembering in 1989"" was the title of a blog post from just before that first EP, and it accompanied an iconic photo of Bobby Brown; as Krell noted on his Twitter, it would be a good title for some future How to Dress Well retrospective.</p>
<p>The conceptual foundation is interesting, but <i>Love Remains</i> succeeds because you don't have to think about that stuff to absorb its peculiar magic. For one thing, it has an arresting surface-level prettiness that offers an easy way in. ""Ready for the World"", a sort of half-cover of ""Love You Down"", the silky 1986 slow jam by the Michigan group Ready for the World (it was also a minor hit in the 90s for singer INOJ), sums up the How to Dress Well aesthetic. The lyrics are indecipherable, suggesting that feeling where you're trying to sing an old song you love but can't remember the details, so you mumble along with the melody; the percussion is crude and indistinct, and somehow sounds halfway between a sample and a bad recording of hand
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
claps in a bedroom; a sampled voice from elsewhere repeats through the track, sounding both machine-like and human. Interesting questions come to mind-- Is this a cover, and do I need to know the original? Why is it so distorted?-- but it's also easy to let ""Ready for the World"" wash over you, which turns out to be true of the album as a whole.</p>
<p>The basic template of ""Ready for the World"" is subtly modified from track to track, so while the album feels very much like a complete statement, individual songs also stand out. One major highlight is ""Decisions [ft. Yüksel Arslan]"", a lurching waltz with voices piled up into a mini choir that hits with an almost symphonic grandeur. The hugeness of its sound is something considering how modestly it was recorded, and ""Decisions"" manages to feel both tragic and uplifting at once. The opening ""You Hold the Water"" is HTDW at its ambient extreme. Beginning with a sample of dialog from Todd Haynes' film <i>Safe</i>, it pulses along with darker, almost industrial samples bumping up against Krell's voice, offering a mood that intentionally avoids coming together as a song. ""Endless Rain"" gets an unbelievable amount of mileage from a single loop of drum and piano: As the Soul II Soul-like rhythm bit repeats, Krell ad libs vocals that seem to bubble up from some kind of pre-verbal place. You can pick out ""you"" and ""say"" and not much else, but it doesn't matter; the track still manages to capture a feeling in its two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>If the contemporary R&amp;B slow jam thrives on the tension between earthy sexuality and the spiritual concerns of gospel, How to Dress Well mostly does away with the sex part. The thin recording and distant-sounding vocals cause the physicality of the music to dissipate into a spectral fog, leaving behind music that feels intimate and devotional and ultimately lonely-- there's a song called ""Can't See My Own Face"" and another called ""My Body"", and you get the feeling that the domain of the music probably stops there. This isn't a space for probing the specifics of relationships; it's far too hermetic for that. There's a lot of rain and a lot of death-- two tracks called ""Suicide Dream"", another called ""You Won't Need Me Where I'm Goin'"". An album I keep thinking of when listening to How to Dress Well is Panda Bear's 2004 LP, <i>Young Prayer</i>. That was another homemade record haunted by mortality with blurred words that nonetheless managed to communicate a powerful and highly personal sense of spiritual yearning. There are also hints of Bon Iver in Krell's falsetto and in the way he transforms the signifiers of R&amp;B into something homegrown and personal. You can sense a few different strands of music from the last few years coming together with the sounds of an earlier era to form something new.</p>
<p>The distortion is at places so harsh, it's hard not to wonder why Krell doesn't do away with it. But with the sex and romantic yearning removed, the tension between the ethereal and prayerful mood comes from the quality of the recording, the way the music seems to be breaking apart as you are listening to it. How to Dress Well is to my mind the biggest breakthrough in home-recorded lo-fi in years. It feels brave, like it's going places a lot of artists in this sphere are afraid to go. And since the emotions communicated are direct and palpable even if the specifics are elusive, it also has something for people who don't follow this world of music closely. I can promise you that as I type this right now, 15-year-old kids who have been freaking out over this album are in front of their computers, trying to make their own version of this music. We'll see how that goes. But the impulse makes sense. <i>Love Remains</i>, because of its construction, feels like music that comes from inside, as if the act of listening completes it.</p></div>"|14678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14678-love-remains/|8.7|Mark Richardson

Like all the other bands in that scene, they traffic in hazy, faraway memories and languid longing. Unlike all those other bands, they do it in as few notes as possible, getting in and getting out, leaving you with their basslines reverberating around in your head. Melodically, they keep things as direct as possible: big choruses, propulsive beats, very few wasted moments. In a way, they belong to this whole zoned-out landscape the same way the Cars were a new-wave band. They're classic-pop types happy to dress their shameless, timeless hooks up in the flavor of the day. And in a lot of ways, that makes them ideal remix material.</p>
<p>At this point, we almost don't have to mention how ridiculous it is for these indie rock remix albums to exist. When you round up 10 remixers to play around with one band's output, you're putting together a full-length that, by nature, is going to lack a sense of flow or cohesion. And when you insist that these remixers take on <i>every song</i> on the original album, you're further ensuring a mediocre product. Not every song on Bear in Heaven's great 2009 album <i>Beast Rest Forth Mouth</i>, after all, is on that ""Lovesick Teenagers"" level; virtually every album ever made has a filler track or five. The best we can hope for from these records is a reasonable, well-curated dance-music compilation with a few unifying threads, and that's basically what we have here.</p>
<p>This particular remix album can claim better existence-justification than most, since it's being sold as a bonus disc on a <i>Beast Rest Forth Mouth</i> reissue rather than as a standalone. It's also a curious little artifact: The rare remix album where the net result is, by and large, less dancefloor-ready than the original album being remixed. <i>Beast Rest</i> isn't exactly a dance album, but it does boast some big, physical grooves; the band has enough disco pedigree that its been covering Lindstrøm and Christabelle's ""Lovesick"" live lately. But on this remix album, they've recruited a roster of remixers who don't seem particularly interested in housing these tracks up much. Arty club types like the Field and the Hundred in the Hands do show up, but they share equal time with leftfield picks like diffuse exoticists High Places and space-metal mind-expander Justin K. Broadrick. So while it's as spotty as any other remix record, it's at least spotty in interesting ways.</p>
<p>There are some severe lowlights here, like Epstein's smudgy, aimless ruination of ""Casual Goodbye"" and Brahms' obnoxiously blippy, unimaginative pillage of ""Fake Out"". But the better remixers here seem to realize that they're dealing with something special. Bear frontman Jon Philpot's voice is a keening, otherworldly tenor that reminds me of Barry Gibb at times, and only the shittiest remixers here bury that voice in effects. Most of them know better. Even the Field, who loves to chop his samples up into unrecognizeable shards only to reveal them at track's end, leaves Philpot relatively intact, letting him flit through the usual slow pulse and keyboard fogbanks. It was bold of Bear to entrust ""Dust Cloud"", one of their prettiest songs, to a denizen of darkness like Broadrick, but his take works because he treats it like the tenderest moment of a Jesu track, piling on the layers of stretched-out guitars without obscuring the central melody.</p>
<p>But the best remix here is the one that might be even more straightforward than the original track. Pink Skull build on the wounded-kid romanticism of ""Wholehearted Mess"" by creating a towering synth-disco jam underneath it. The thudding bassline and rippling keyboards and relentless hi-hats interlock perfectly, building and building into a moment of catharsis that disappears too soon. Nine more like this and we'd have a real album on our hands.</p></div>"|14653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14653-beast-rest-forth-mouth-remixed/|6.1|Tom Breihan

Tillman is not a man of peaceful, easy feelings. His solo albums are muted, grave, and of a single, sepia-toned piece: his husky, trembling voice, his acoustic guitar, and a pervading sense of nearly medieval severity. The characters in Tillman's songs bring to mind photographs of unsmiling Depression-era families, people too busy coping with drought or fending off consumptive disease to do much more. <i>Singing Ax</i> is his seventh full-length album, and it is one of his grimmest and sparest yet, sucked dry of even the pastoral grace that lightened 2008's <i>Vacilando Territory Blues</i>.</p>
<p>The bleak tone is established from the opening dirge ""Three Sisters"", in which Tillman moans about hallucinatory night visions over a slowly ticking guitar vamp. The production is vividly stark, drawing your ears to the sound the pads of his fingertips make as they lightly drum the body of his guitar. It is a measured, somber song, and the rest of the record proceeds apace. The album's title is apt, not just for the hint of menace the image contains but for the appreciation of yeoman's work it implies: You can almost hear the methodical whistle and thunk of the blade cleaving wood in the record's grave, prayerful progression.</p>
<p>""Prayerful"" is not an incidental world choice: There is a lot of religious imagery in J. Tillman's music, and <i>Singing Ax</i> is no exception. The pensive open-string drone of ""Diamondback"" hinges on Biblical serpent imagery, while ""Mere Ornaments"" opens with the apocalyptic vision of a ""pale moon at the end of days."" What distinguishes <i>Singing Ax</i> from its predecessors, though, is its startling and sharp turn into Freudian territory. ""One Task"" and ""Our Beloved Tyrant"" locate their power in some fairly twisted familial drama. ""I had one task in our home/ I had to draw water from the well for my father's horse/ I was the least among my brothers/ And I would be the last among them to hold the reins,"" Tillman bleakly sings in the opening of ""One Task"". ""Our Beloved Tyrant"" is even darker, with Tillman bitterly addressing a father figure whose reign of terror over his home is seemingly on the wane: ""it's true, you strike me as less godlike with no son to crucify,"" he mutters. It brings to mind Daniel Day-Lewis's ""bastard in a basket"" speech at the end of <i>There Will Be Blood</i>, with Tillman playing the role of pale-faced H.W., and it taps into some of the same elemental power.</p></div>"|14671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14671-singing-ax/|7.4|Jayson Greene

On 2004 debut <i>Goodies</i>, Ciara Harris really did deserve her title as the ""princess of crunk&amp;B,"" a Lil Jon-bestowed honorific that turned out to be premature only insofar as you still call anything ""crunk&amp;B."" Since then, the Atlanta starlet has been the artistic equivalent of the tease from that album's chart-busting title track: She'll tantalize with stunning electro-R&amp;B singles, but her albums never quite bring home the goods. So the sensual seduction of 2006's ""Promise"" gave way to half-baked sophomore effort <i>Ciara: The Evolution</i>; CiCi's third album, last year's roundly disappointing <i>Fantasy Ride</i>, didn't even spawn a better than so-so single of its own, but it did follow a poised, mature guest spot on Enrique Iglesias' <i>Greatest Hits</i> hit ""Takin' Back My Love"". You get the idea.</p>
<p>Fourth album <i>Basic Instinct</i> is beginning to look like a case of déjà vu. Ciara's label keeps pushing back the release date. BET banned the desperately floor-humping video for uninspired first single ""Ride"". And this summer The-Dream, supposedly set to executive produce the record alongside Tricky Stewart, actually quit Twitter after he was quoted suggesting that if Ciara's next album flops, she's finished (he says he was taken out of context). In the meantime, the Internet's powers-that-be have leaked a few pretty great tracks, plus several others that explain all the delays. A couple of online mixtapes collecting various potential <i>Basic Instinct</i> material are floating around out there. While another bootleg, <i>Ride It</i>, has more songs, <i>The Princess Is Here</i> is a better, more cohesive listen. Either way, the results so far are discouraging.</p>
<p>When Ciara gets a summery, sultry ballad she can still own it like nobody else. A case in point is The-Dream duet ""Speechless"", which basically takes the giddy smolder of her ""Promise"" and the meta-absurdity of his ""Falsetto"" and turns them into something horn-bedazzled and radiant, crazy in love as much as in lust. Another is ""I Run It"", a rare moment on <i>The Princess Is Here</i> where Ciara really sounds like the boss-- and exuberantly, melodically so, all twirling synths and pillowy beats, with a little something otherworldly, too: ""So let this ATLien give you what you deserve."" Self-proclaimed ""banger"" ""Gimmie Dat"" is no ballad-- just the opposite-- but its hyperactive dancefloor wiggle combines with an icier, more robotic vocal, serving as sort of a circa-2010 equivalent to 2004's ""1, 2 Step"". These are the highlights.</p>
<p>But it's like even when Ciara wins, she loses. The mixtape version of ""Speechless"" strips away The-Dream's weirdly sweet, old-fashioned verse, instead leaving Ciara emoting awkwardly: ""Your love is my muse/ No more will I have to choose."" Um. Other tracks that appear to aim for similar sensuality just fall flat. ""This Is What Love Is"" is like a trance-inspired take on the breathy spoken word of Janet Jackson's vastly superior ""That's the Way Love Goes""; ""Upside Down"" renders unsexily explicit what ""Promise"" was confident enough to evoke. Another problem: When Ciara ad libs, she comes off as deeply boring as she did during <i>The Evolution</i>'s misguided inspirational interludes. At one point, thanking her fans for their support, she says blankly, ""It means so much to me."" A politician never sounded so rehearsed, which makes it harder to root for her.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>The Princess Is Here</i> is most interesting when Ciara reaches out toward rap. First there's ""Ride"", on which Ludacris reprises his starring role from 2004's impossibly slinky ""Oh"". Here, though, he's uncharacteristically lazy (""Ride it like a thoroughbred?"" Luda!). Also less than his typical spectacular self is André 3000, who appropriately endorses Ciara as ""Chaka Khan fine, Anita Baker sweet"" on a ""Ride"" remix. Gucci Mane is amusingly obvious, as usual, on ""Feelin' on My Ass"", although the scolding refrain contrasts oddly with other songs' naked shamelessness. Yo Gotti and Waka Flocka Flame also make leering tough-guy appearances. While the ""Eye of the Tiger""-sampling ""Basic Instinct (U Got Me)"", on which Ciara actually raps, isn't here, she does jump ably on a Young Jeezy instrumental for ""Lose My Mind""-- one of too many complaints about haters-- while her Soulja Boy response ""Pretty Girl Swag"" is a reminder, like <i>Fantasy Ride</i>'s ""Pucker Up"", that swag simply isn't this Princess's strong suit. Just a thought: Now might be a good time for Lil Wayne, who famously (and endearingly!) proclaimed his love for Ciara on 2007's <i>Da Drought 3</i>, to scrounge up a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card.</p></div>"|14659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14659-the-princess-is-here/|5.5|Marc Hogan

Recorded in Los Angeles with producer D. Sardy (Black Mountain, Holy Fuck), it finds the band peeling back the psychedelic murk and tempering its bad vibes with a hint of flower-power homage. It's about time, too. After two records of hazy drones and mid-tempo grind, the Black Angels desperately needed to hit the defog button and get some perspective.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It helps that the group has flushed out its Rolodex of Acceptable Psychedelic Influences. On ""True Believers"", frontman Alex Mass bends his voice into a spooky and near-perfect approximation of Jefferson Airplane singer Grace Slick. ""Haunting at 1300 McKinley"" borrows some bluesy shuffle from the Animals. ""Yellow Elevator #2"" slips from a spiky Pink Floyd-inspired organ hook to an eerie <i>Odessey and Oracle</i>-worthy outro. These are welcome additions to the band's sonic palate, but the past doesn't hold all the answers for the Black Angels. Their eerie vibe doesn't mesh very well with the hippie decade's perkier moments. ""Sunday Afternoon"" brings those 13th Floor Elevators riffs back up to speed, but lacks that band's cult-ish quirks. ""Telephone"", the album's up-tempo tambourine-fueled first single, comes off as an underdeveloped British Invasion pastiche.

at defined its sound early on. Whether pushed by Sardy or entirely of their own volition, the Black Angels have tightened up their songwriting. It's the subtle things that make a difference-- laying off the atmospherics, incorporating sudden shifts, and clamping down on the meandering jams. Album opener ""Bad Vibrations"" starts pretty much where <i>Directions to See a Ghost</i> left off, but it gets an adrenaline shot for a noise-addled final minute. The album's heaviest track, ""River of Blood"", cycles from steady groove to free-form freak-out to precision-wound fuzz riffage in just four minutes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Black Angels had some great songs on <i>Passover </i>and <i>Directions to See a Ghost</i>, but after a few tracks, they all began to sound the same. <i>Phosphene Dream </i>is a step up, if only for the little bit of variety that the tighter arrangements and genre-hopping provide. You can take it a piece at a time or swallow it in one big dose.</p></div>"|14669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14669-phosphene-dream/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

<p>Judging by <i>Sit Down, Man'</i>s impressive production roster, a lot of fellow artists embraced the <i>Shut Up </i>mixtape.<span> </span>The sheer variety and quality of those producers aren't just important co-signs, however; they provide a context for Das Racist to bring their best.<span> </span><span> </span>It also opens them up to the fruits of collaboration and, over 80 minutes, diversifies their sound. Despite the range of collaborators, Das Racist never have to break character, whether going abstract and abrasive with El-P, bareknuckle street brawling with Roc Marciano, counting major label young money with Boi-1da, or canoodling to Teengirl Fantasy's wobbly R&amp;B.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The stars of the show though are clearly MCs Kool A.D. and Heems, who here blow their previous work out of the water. Heems told <i>The Village Voice</i> he chooses beats ""so Talib Kweli fans wouldn't like it,"" but while Das Racist go great lengths to separate themselves from the pejorative connotations of ""lyrical hip-hop,"" the main draw are the lyrics. Das Racist turn rap into Calvinball, making and breaking the ground rules with no warning whatsoever: One moment, they'll be calling Mobb Deep's Prodigy ""more Picasso than Schnabel,"" and the next they'll be doing cold-rock-a-party Q&amp;A-- ""you puff herb?"" ""Dog, I smoke weed too!"" Or, in what I guess could be a one-line summary of Das Racist's mindset: ""I'm counting Jacksons with black friends/ I'm counting tens in Benzes with white friends/ Wonderin' if suicide's a largely white trend/ Google it later and confirm that, aight then.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's precedent in the hyper-referential raps of Beastie Boys and MF Doom as well as the abstract-gone-mainstream wordplay of Dipset and Lil Wayne, but Das Racist are a singular act.<span> </span>Google and Wikipedia get several shoutouts, and it makes sense since <i>everything </i>under the sun is fair game for these guys, but they never rhyme for the sake of riddlin'.<span> </span>The lyrics themselves have an orderly and logical nature about them, pop culture crosswords that draw connections between completely unrelated objects. Listening to their music doesn't require deep cultural or musical knowledge to enjoy it-- it's pretty damn enjoyable purely as pop-- but you'll get more of a charge from it the more often you decode it. In that sense, Das Racist's music feels closer to Girl Talk's than any other current rapper.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Das Racist could stand accused of sinking into trivia as a means of obscuring a certain sort of modern emptiness, but in between all the proper nouns are some disarmingly humane moments.<span> </span>The Brooklyn group Keepaway lends ""Amazing"" a sparkly, champagne-spilling luxury as Heems gives a tender, relatable treatise on the effects of soft substance abuse. Though he notes that fan interaction tends to be way friendlier when you rap about weed, he reminisces about a youth of ""Yo! MTV Raps"" cards and Nautica sweatshirts and realizes ""we used to play basketball, then we started drinking.""<span> </span>Meanwhile, on the Diplo-produced ""You Can Sell Anything"", A.D. bemusedly imagines a record exec thinking, ""maybe we can cake off the weirdos,"" while Heems kicks a bravely honest and timely verse where he ""celebrate[s] the fact I moved back into my mom's basement,"" seeing the bright side of having no rent and the freedom to ""sell old books for new ones,"" do shows, and hang with guys like Diplo.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And yet, although the upgrade in production and increased confidence in their lyrics are certainly a big part of <i>Sit Down, Man</i>,<i> </i>the most important growth for Das Racist is that they're learning how to write <i>songs </i>instead of just rap for four minutes at a time.<span> </span>Most people who've enjoyed Das Racist to this point probably wouldn't mind if they stuck with the latter, but for people who don't share their encyclopedic knowledge of turn-of-the-century mainstream rap, the sheer density of that would understandably be exhausting.<span> </span><i>Sit Down, Man </i>works every bit as well in a house party as it does for a solitary geek-out session: the coked-out couture-rap of ""Fashion Party"" shows surprisingly easy chemistry with indie mystics Chairlift and should be appreciated by anyone who's ever felt odd at a gallery event but enjoyed the free booze. <span> </span>And while there's plenty of recognizable interpolations (Jay-Z's ""Run This Town"", ""Days of Our Lives"", the Very Best's ""Julia"", ""We Are Family"", ""People Are Strange"", ""Addams Groove""), perhaps the best is where they feed Enigma a couple of Irish car bombs and turn ""Return to Innocence"" into a drunken singalong.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Some may still resist embracing Das Racist, but I imagine it's not so much a matter of race or privilege, though they do have a lot of fun playing with those two issues.<span> </span>It's more reflected in their hook from ""hahahaha jk?""-- ""we're not joking, just joking, we are joking, just joking, we're not joking.""<span> </span>It's always difficult to convince someone that a rapper's the real deal with ""they're <i>really </i>funny"" as the selling point, since it gives the impression that neither you nor the artist appreciates the daunting cultural import of hip-hop.<span> </span>It's the same reason a lot of us would reserve a circle of hell for ""comedy rappers,"" who figure that the mere medium of rapping is funny and let that do the heavy lifting.<span> </span>That's not how Das Racist roll: They kid because they are deeply and madly in love with hip-hop, and <i>Sit Down, Man </i>is an infinitely entertaining result of extreme reverence toward rap and irreverence toward everything else, themselves included.</p></div>"|14662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14662-sit-down-man/|8.7|Ian Cohen

A Swede of Argentine extraction with an affinity for African rhythms, González initially drew worldwide-- or at least World Wide Web-- attention when his acoustic Knife cover turned up on a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_kLwQJUqYU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco-shot commercial for a Japanese high-def TV</a>. The clip demanded a soundtrack with warmth and genuine feeling, but also a kind of cultural open-endedness, and González's wave-lapping ""Heartbeats"" fit the bill so well it's hard now to imagine other options ever existed. As one of the Bravia ad's producers prosaically put it, the song ""makes you feel nice.""</p>
<p>Feeble as that ""nice"" endorsement rings, it's a pretty accurate description of what González's reedy voice and nylon-stringed guitar do-- both on the two albums under his own name and as part of Gothenburg-based band Junip. I'll toss another faint-praiseworthy-
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
sounding adjective into the ring-- easy. Easy-sounding and easy to like are what Junip are all about on <i>Fields</i>, their first full-length record since González teamed up with keyboardist Tobias Winterkorn and drummer Elias Araya almost a decade ago. The trio put out one EP in 2006, but the project seemed stalled as a sideline to González's flourishing solo career until Junip nonchalantly dropped the surprisingly mature <i>Rope and Summit</i> EP this June.</p>
<p><i>Fields</i> makes good on <i>R&amp;S</i>'s promise with 10 new tracks (plus a reprise of ""Rope and Summit"") that casually assert there's more than one way to do chillwave-- and it involves psychedelic-space effects (""In Every Direction"", ""Without You"", ""Tide""), bossa nova sway (""Always""), economical song structures (pretty much all of them), and high-fidelity recording (ditto). Indeed, <i>Fields</i> is exactly the album you'd expect these guys to make. González's smooth synthesis of classical guitar playing, English folk traditions, and pan-African rhythms have long made clear that he values quality and consistency over risk and innovation and doesn't much care for trends or scenes. And while Junip clearly says ""rock"" and ""band,"" they perform the same values with brisk professionalism.</p>
<p>So the record sounds contemporary and urbane but isn't stamped with a specific sell-by date or target demographic. Take terrific track ""Without You"", which relies on the vintage prog charm of whooshing organ builds, an <i>au courant</i> sound among Brooklyn/ Portland/ Montreal's young and false-nostalgic. Junip caps their track at 5:30, at the very point of saturation, the second before ""Without You"" would have tipped into an overcooked and noodly ELO or Yes tribute. On the other hand,<i> Fields</i>' dearth of surprises makes it a little disappointing even for those with more conventional tastes-- listeners who generally value stuff like quality and consistency more than the shock of the new.</p></div>"|14668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14668-fields/|7.5|Amy Granzin

Even into her 70s, she still has dynamic range that goes from a full-throated shout to an intimate whisper without losing her easy authority over a song. Over the decades, many musicians and producers have tried to wrangle that voice onto record, with varying degrees of success. With her father, Pops Staples, she recorded a string of songs that combined gospel and folk music, many of which-- ""Respect Yourself"" and the sublime ""(If You're Ready) Come Go with Me""-- became hits that soundtracked the tumultuous civil rights movement. In the 1970s and 80s, she worked with Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, and Prince, even signing to his Purpleness' Paisley Park label for a brief period.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, Staples has entered an unlikely third stage in her career, with a string of inspired albums that exhibit new range. <i>We'll Never Turn Back</i>, recorded with producer Ry Cooder, revived civil rights anthems for the dying days of the Bush era, and they still sound prescient and powerful. Following the fierce <i>Live: Hope at the Hideout</i> in 2008, her latest album, <i>You Are Not Alone</i>, was recorded with Wilco frontman and fellow Chicago resident Jeff Tweedy. Tweedy clearly has a deep knowledge of and appreciation for Staples' career, and he gives her a warmly textured backdrop that's both familiar and inventive, with nods to past glories. He cherrypicks a number of her old hits to revive and chooses some new covers for her to sing, with a keen understanding of her strengths and weaknesses. In turn, Staples gives him intuitive and moving performances on each song, whether she's celebrating her own salvation or bemoaning a lost love.</p>
<p>On ""Downward Road"", a Pops favorite that the Staples Singers recorded decades ago, she's casually scolding as she relates the story of a woman who revels in sin and pays a hefty price. A fat bass thwacks along, creating a strange gospel plod that makes Staples sound like she's marching against the downward tide. By contrast, ""In Christ There Is No East or West"" is so delicate that it threatens to blow away with the breeze. It's a risky tack, as Staples could very easily have bulldozed such light accompaniment, but she adjusts her delivery to convey her awe in God's unfathomable omnipresence. This, she seems to say, is something to celebrate, and ""I Belong to the Band - Hallelujah"" and ""Creep Along Moses"" sound like party gospel-- jubilant cries heavenward.</p>
<p>As covers go, Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Wrote a Song for Everyone"" is an obvious choice considering the public quality of Staples' music, and she sings it with such humility that it's surprising she's never recorded it before. On the other hand, Randy Newman's ""Losing You"" is much more private, and Staples communicates stoic, dignified heartbreak with every syllable. It's a remarkable performance, matched only by the reassuring title track, which Tweedy wrote especially for her. ""You Are Not Alone"", as its title suggests, intends to be a salve in hard times, and Staples rallies her most sympathetic delivery, as if comforting her listeners individually.</p>
<p>Rather than protest the state of the world, Staples is toasting human endurance-- hers as well as ours. After decades in the music industry, she still sounds invigorated and ecstatic, unburdened by cynicism or disappointment. With Tweedy, she has created a record that is mindful of her own past, yet these songs sound fresh, original, and often inspiring.</p></div>"|14666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14666-you-are-not-alone/|8.2|Stephen M.

It's a far cry from their early sugar-rushes, and even more deliberate-sounding than their more recent forays away from whimsy. The record's dedicated to the memory of the band's late friend and frequent collaborator, fellow Athenian Vic Chesnutt, and its shift in tone seems to reflect the loss. But the mournful air that hangs over much of <i>Elf Power</i> seems to bog down the band's oft-lively songcraft; despite a few bright spots, the record often feels more depleted than elegiac.</p>
<p>Always an outlier in the Elephant 6 fold-- less out-there than the Olivia Tremor Control, sneakier with the hooks than the Apples in Stereo-- the once fairly freaky Elf Power have gradually mellowed over the years. Ever since 2004's <i>Walking With the Beggar Boys</i>, they've taken more steps away from straight-up psych-rock, further tugging out the strands of British folk, alt-country, and power-pop that've long run through their records. <i>Elf Power</i> is perhaps their quietest and certainly their least excitable LP to date; kaleidoscopic instrumental flourishes are now the exception, not the rule, and the clear, tidy production puts the emphasis square on the songs themselves rather than any of the window dressing.</p>
<p>If only the songs themselves were a little more dazzling. The stately ""The Taking Under"" sets things off in high style, its grandiose shuffle sounding far richer and more vibrant than anything from 2008's <i>In a Cave</i>. But ""Wander Through"" meanders its way off course, and lead single ""Stranger in the Window"", with its limp folk-pop strum and wince-conjuringly earnest lyrics-- ""tell me your secret if you'd like to meet the freak inside my mind,"" yikes-- grates, each coming across a mite unsure what to do with themselves. It's a problem Elf Power have all too often here; the once dynamic band plugs away tepidly, their mood somewhere between indifferent and cheerless, their arrangements often at odds with the songs' moods, their songcraft itself oddly hesitant.</p>
<p>Strange that a veteran band would seem to've taken such a hit in the confidence department, but more than anything, <i>Elf Power</i> feels frail, retreating. For the most part, the song structures themselves are strummy, plaintive little things, bereft of much internal tension. Andrew Rieger rarely brings rarely brings his voice too far above a hum, and his tunes only seem to approach the mid-tempo with caution. Rieger's imagistic lyrics bounce from the literal to the obtuse so often, it's tough to latch onto much beyond the occasionally prominently positioned clunker; Rieger's cryptic way with words clouds any direct reference to Chesnutt, but the funk that hangs off his every word is nevertheless palpable. Even a comparatively lighthearted song like ""Tiny Insects"" is delivered with a straight face. And all the sleepy balladry and morose ambling starts pushes every outlier to the forefront; the Alan Sparhawk-like snarl of ""Boots of Lead"" and the punchy ""Goldmine in the Sun"" would be strictly second-tier on almost any other Elf Power record, but here, they prove rare signs of vitality.</p>
<p>A cavalcade of Athenian indie rock royalty-- from Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss of Olivia Tremor Control to Heather McIntosh of the Instruments-- drop in to busy up Elf Power's sound, and the occasional off-kilter arrangement or leftfield instrumental flourish provide this drizzly LP much of its color. But this crop of songs simply isn't sturdy enough this time out to prop up all that extraneous noise, and the ensemble overpowers the blankest of these tunes just as often as they flatter some of the stronger stuff. Fans of the band's older, funner stuff will be left cold by the glum <i>Elf Power</i>, and those who've dug into the band's more cultivated records will likely come away feeling as drained as the band seems to. Were its songs more dynamic, its arrangements less haphazard, its tone more even, its sentiments a bit more clearly stated, <i>Elf Power</i> could really be affecting. But as it is, it just feels affected; the sound of a band in mourning seeking a musical catharsis they can't quite extend to the listener.</p></div>"|14667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14667-elf-power/|5.6|Paul Thompson

Their last was 2003's <i>Hold On Love</i>, and a year later, for various reasons, Azure Ray went on indefinite hiatus, and the childhood friends went their separate ways. In the interim, they both stayed typically busy: Each released a few solo albums and recorded various side projects. But even in 2004, it seemed inevitable that they would one day gravitate back toward each other. Sure enough, they started playing shows again in 2008 and now have released their fourth album as Azure Ray, <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>.</p>
<p>Listening to these songs, it's like the last six years have been erased; Fink and Taylor pick up right where they left off, building on the spare arrangements and hushed vocals that have always defined their sound. Eric Bachmann even returns to produce the album, making him the unofficial third Ray. In a niche now crowded with similar harmony acts like the Watson Twins and the Chapin Sisters, Azure Ray still sound idiosyncratic, eschewing pop-historical settings for quietly, almost casually innovative arrangements.</p>
<p><i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> begins with a gorgeous flourish of harp, an overture in miniature, but it's more Disney than Joanna Newsom, more ""Baby Mine"" than <i>Ys</i>. The song that follows, oddly, is a lullaby in reverse, gently rousing you-- or perhaps the long dormant Azure Ray-- from slumber. Rather than jump back in, Fink and Taylor ease into the album. ""Don't Leave My Mind"" is equally hushed, a plea to a former lover who's going somewhere beyond the reach of texts and cell phones. Again, the sentiment could apply to their own lengthy absence: ""You can go where each day takes you, some place I can't find,"" they sing together, ""but don't leave my mind.""</p>
<p>At times, the songs sound so light they threaten to fade out of existence altogether. With its simple acoustic guitar, ""Larraine"" is so hushed as to be a cappella, which doesn't serve the indignation of the story especially well. While the pair's harmonies remain as tightly and gracefully intertwined as ever, such a near-silent hush has never been their most flattering setting. In fact, <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> is best when Bachmann pairs Fink and Taylor with music as interesting as their vocals. A floor tom beats a curious tattoo through ""Make Your Heart"", lending the song its tense momentum and providing the foundation for a full string arrangement. ""Shouldn't Have Loved"" shimmers with thrumming keyboards, dramatic chimes, and a shuffling live beat, which nicely offset their sustained harmonies.</p>
<p>That song stands out primarily because it sounds new, like something the Azure Ray of 2003 wouldn't have done. But such moments are rare on <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>, which wants merely to pick up where <i>Hold On Love</i> left off. The upside is that it sounds warmly familiar, a reminder of why we missed them in the first place, but the downside is that the album gives very few indications of what Fink and Taylor have learned during their hiatus-- the new tricks they've picked up from their various projects and collaborations, the ways their individual outlooks might have changed, and why they got back together at all. Of course, if Azure Ray prove as productive now as they were eight years ago, we may not have to wait very long for such revelations.</p></div>"|14676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14676-drawing-down-the-moon/|6.5|Stephen M.

It's as if they spent three years inhaling the entire repertoire of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis before putting that knowledge to action. The record is their first on Atlantic, and they've put that major label money to good use: This sounds expensive and studio-finessed, a facet no doubt aided by Cassius member Philipe Zdar's mixing skills. The depth of production here is quite literal; when there's space to breathe on these tracks, it feels like a cavernous expanse rather than dead air. Their previous work had big aspirations, but this record cements their potential as a marquee band.</p>
<p>More money means more studio time, and more studio time can lead to more experimentation; as such, <i>Business Casual</i>'s most successful moments are the result of genre-related leg-stretching.  ""Don't Walk Away"" captures the symphonic grandiosity of side-long disco edits in under four minutes, syrupy strings and all. Elsewhere, the record's showstopping midsection-- ""Night by Night"", ""Don't Turn the Lights On"", and ""You Make it Rough""-- dives deep into icy, moonlit electro sounds, the latter taking a seven-minute journey from the heart to the stars. If that description brings to mind Junior Boys, it's because at their best, Chromeo are doing something not too dissimilar in function: synthesizing a wide range of erudite musical signifiers into something more tangibly direct and pop.</p>
<p>The duo succeed at constructing sumptuous backdrops on this record, almost to a fault. Despite its richly detailed excesses, <i>Business Casual</i> nonetheless feels slighter than Chromeo's previous efforts due to a relative lack of hooks. Opener ""Hot Mess"" oscillates tediously, with near-ridiculous spoken word interjections. The Solange Knowles collaboration ""When the Night Falls"" is a missed opportunity, as Solange is reduced to wailing the ill-fitting chorus while Dave 1 turns in a weak, barely murmured vocal performance. If you want a soft-rock update of Billy Joel's ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"", see album closer ""Grow Up"" (but don't say we didn't warn you).</p>
<p>Granted, <i>Business Casual</i> comes close to superseding previous LP <i>Fancy Footwork</i> in two ways: ""J'ai Claqué La Porte"" combines the seemingly now-token ""sparse song"" and ""French song"" into one to minimize filler, and there's not a single song here that's named ""Tenderoni"" (ugh). Otherwise, the record is a unique situation, as it represents Chromeo's growth as master arrangers and producers, despite feeling like a step backwards in overall quality.</p></div>"|14649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14649-business-casual/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

The Minneapolis indie-rap titans had their breakthrough with 2001's <i>Lucy Ford</i><i>: The Atmosphere EPs</i>, a collection of previously released EPs that still somehow stands as their best and most cohesive album by far. <i>Lucy Ford </i>put all the group's pieces together; it's an eloquent, charismatic piece of work that helped ""emo-rap"" come into existence. For all its self-deprecating introspection, though, it never sacrificed humor or swagger, and its beats banged. Atmosphere followed it with a couple of truly impressive rap records. But about five years ago, the group started recording and touring with a live band that, despite its best efforts, has always come off sounding way too session-musiciany. And with all those watery blues guitar lines and rapper Slug's increasing reliance on singsong, the group has pushed ever closer to G. Love territory on recent albums.</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>And that leads us to <i>To All My Friends, Blood Makes the Blade Holy</i>, the best thing the group has done in years. The new record is 12 songs in 41 minutes-- an album then, basically-- but Atmosphere is still selling this one as a ""double EP"" for some reason. If that's what they needed to do to edge just a little bit closer to that <i>Lucy Ford</i> frame of mind, fair enough. <i>To All My Friends</i> isn't a classic record or anything. That live band makes its presence known on every track, and sometimes that brings truly regrettable results, like the irritatingly flinty pseudo-reggae of ""Americareful"". And Slug hasn't quite reached the levels of slippery arrogance he displayed on something like <i>Lucy Ford</i>'s ""Guns &amp; Cigarettes"". Still, it's a big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>For one thing, there are a couple of honest-to-god battle-raps here, and Slug's always at his sharpest when he allows himself a few moments of straight-up shit-talk. ""Until the Nipples Gone"" and ""Shotgun"" come with terse, hard tracks. Laser-precise guitar lines weave in and out of each other, while Slug brings breathless urgency for the first time in a minute. Slug's brag-rap lyrics don't always make sense, but they avoid sense in fun, inventive ways: ""You can call me Sean like nothing's wrong/ I'm the early dawn/ I'm the dirty bomb.""</p>
<p>For most of <i>To All My Friends</i>, though, Slug doesn't talk shit; he tells stories. And he's a good storyteller. On recent records, he's faltered a bit by talking about generic concepts and other people instead of his own specific, detailed experiences. He spends a lot of time here talking about others, but he brings back that old sense of storytelling focus. When Slug attempts to de-glamorize the act of coke-dealing, for instance, he doesn't attack the entire genre of coke rap; he tells the story of some kid he knew in high school who started doing that and fucked his whole life up. He doesn't moralize; he just <i>talks</i>, and it turns out much more effective. ""The Number None"" is just an embarrassing story about an old girlfriend who dumped him and fucked his friend; I can't believe he hasn't already used that story for a song. ""Scalp"" is an expertly rendered shaggy-dog tale and a fitting sequel to <i>God Loves Ugly</i>'s ""Hair"". These tracks don't make big sweeping points, and that's why they work.</p>
<p>Not everything on the record works so well. There's also ""Commodities"", a somewhat embarrassing rant about the deadening effects of social networking websites. There's ""The Loser Wins"", a generic thing about fake friends. There's ""Freefallin'"", a great indication of why Slug is not the guy you want dispensing wise truisms. But even with those tracks, <i>To All My Friends</i> hits its mark more often than not, and it shows a group starting to remember what made it great in the first place.</p></div>"|14664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14664-to-all-my-friends-blood-makes-the-blade-holy-the-atmosphere-eps/|7.3|Tom Breihan

Melody, nuance, and gentleness came later, but by then it was too late. Swans' rep as unrepentant industrial brutalists had stuck. Sure, it was unfair, but that's what happens when you introduce yourself with a sound that singular and abrasive.</span></p>
<p>Swans frontman/mastermind Michael Gira was notoriously unhappy about that rep. His early records made their point-- music can sometimes hurt, and sometimes that hurt is weirdly pleasurable-- and by the late 80s his interests lay elsewhere. Sure his lyrics remained oppressive, abject, and generally icky, but his bellowing and moaning became a mournful croon. Humanity and beauty kept leaking in, almost despite the band's best intentions. As the 90s went on, Swans albums became as much about exploring gorgeous (if disquieting) ambient texture as crushing heads. Gira's songs blossomed from skeletal rhythmic sketches into lush epics that predicted a lot of post-rock.</p>
<p><span>But Swans' music, whatever the period, was driven by a philosophy of no compromises. Gira wanted the freedom to change direction whenever he wished. Swans fans and critics refused to shut up about his earlier, more brutal records, as if Gira were Woody Allen raised on Marquis de Sade. So he did the only reasonable thing an intractable man could do: He killed the band in 1997, dumped its historical baggage, and tried to enjoy the freedom of no expectations in a new project, Angels of Light.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps 13 years was enough time to put Swans into perspective, though, because here's </span><span><i>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</i></span><span>. Its existence is surprising to say the least, especially considering Gira's sneering dismissal of the whole idea of bands reuniting. What's less surprising is that Gira's shifted musical directions yet again, though his voice and the inimitable end-times vibe make </span><span><i>My Father</i></span><span> instantly recognizable as a Swans album.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I understand why Swans' music, even the later and more melodic period, can be off-putting to those who prefer their music more humane and humorous. Gira can be a blackly funny fucker, but to truly enjoy Swans, it does help to have some affection for music that's, well, bleak. Really bleak. Theatrically bleak. Because however funny or lovely or melodramatically stirring he can be, there's always going to be a core of desolation to Gira's songwriting.</span></p>
<p><span><i>My Father</i></span><span> reinforces that fact, but it does so with a stomping, swinging, snarling live-band urgency that sounds little like Swans' last album, 1996's </span><span><i>Soundtracks for the Blind</i></span><span>, which leaned heavily on the band's love for tape loops and ambient soundscapes. </span><span><i>My Father</i></span><span> is less about the Eno-esque sonic tapestries and more about Gira's love for apocalyptic country blues. The musicians sound go-for-the-throat savage after their long absence, as if Gira presented them with a batch of blackened lyrics and they couldn't wait to pound the songs into shape.</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, </span><span><i>My Father</i></span><span> grooves, and grooves hard. ""Eden Prison"" features one of Gira's most menacing performances in recent years, but really his snarling contempt is a bonus given the intensity the band brings to the galloping rhythm. Unlike the keyboard-driven </span><span><i>Soundtracks</i></span><span> material, which often had to be radically reconstructed for the band's final tour (as heard on 1998's posthumous live album, </span><span><i>Swans are Dead</i></span><span>), you can imagine the reconstituted Swans taking these new songs to the stage and kicking them out as-is.</span></p>
<p><span>Gira's new songs are obviously far more refined than band's bash-and-groan 80s material. (Just about every song ever written is more refined than something like 1984's ""Raping a Slave"".) There are still touches of the </span><span><i>Soundtracks</i></span><span> era and its atmospherics, though it's usually restricted to intros and outros. But this is the closest Gira's come in decades to the band's old immediacy, intensity, and brute force. ""My Birth"" is traditional hard rock filtered through Swans' drone-happy sensibility, the one to play for Queens of the Stone Age fans. And while ""No Words/No Thoughts"" opens the album with a moody wash of church bells, it immediately drops into the kind of swampy lurch that once made Swans heroes in the sludge metal community.</span></p>
<p><span>But if Gira got his Swans groove back, he also got his Swans bile back. This album is the antithesis of 2010's gooey let's-all-be-friends chillwave fun. The only way </span><span><i>My Father</i></span><span> would make sense on a beach is if nuclear winter had broken out. After all, there's a song here called ""You Fucking People Make Me Sick"", which sets a new standard for Gira's spit-in-your-eye venom. It is also sung, in part, by Gira's</span><span> three-year-old daughter (she duets with Devendra Banhart) and opens with what sounds like a didgeridoo. That's Gira's kind of comedy. He always seems to having the most fun when he's at his most sardonic, and when he's at his most sardonic, he's also at his most memorable.</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of people have died in Swans songs over the years. (They've also been abused, degraded, violated, and made to wish they were dead.) On </span><span><i>My Father</i></span><span>, there's ""Reeling the Liars In"", a full-scale moral cleansing where </span><span><i>E</i></span><span><i>very Liar on Earth</i>,<i> </i></span><span>or at least as many as Gira can get his hands on, is loaded onto a pyre and set ablaze. It's the slightest song on the album, and the most vicious, and also the catchiest. I only mention it here at the end only to let new listeners know what they're in for when Gira's in a </span><span><i>good </i></span><span>mood. Longtime Swans fans are, I'm sure, already smiling.</span></p></div>"|14651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/|7.7|Jess Harvell

Åkerfeldt can emit guttural snarls with the best of them, but it doesn't tell the whole story to tag Opeth as a ""metal band."" Culturally, they're metal, longtime titans of the ridiculously fertile Scandinavian scene. But musically, they're prog. Their songs regularly go way past 10 minutes and frequently break into Ren-fest traveling-minstrel frippery. In this ridiculously huge box set's liner notes, they thank Joni Mitchell and Scott Walker alongside Morbid Angel and Ronnie James Dio. Death metal is Åkerfeldt's favorite toy, the same way the band's 1970s forebears loved playing around with traditional English folk or Howlin' Wolf, but the band makes a huge show out venturing across as much landscape as possible. And inside the ornate venue, they look very much at home. A stoned, pasty mass of British people swaying and headbanging as a group of curtain-haired virtuosos wheedle out extended multi-movement works-- this is something that could've happened at any point over the last 40 years.</p>
<p>Over three CDs and two DVDs, this box documents one show, which stretched across nearly three hours. Opeth were celebrating their 20th anniversary as a band, so they played one album, 2001's masterful <i>Blackwater Park</i>, in full, then picked one song per album from all their other albums. This is a neat idea to showcase the band's musical evolution, but Opeth hasn't exactly <i>had</i> a ton of musical evolution, at least not on record. They were playing these wide-ranging epics from jump. And on a live album, it's not like you can hear the differences in production between all these different records. It just feels like one endless wander after another.</p>
<p>Everything about <i>In Live Concert</i> is extraordinarily well-done. The recording is full and warm, and nothing ends up buried the way things often happen on live albums. The DVDs are nicely shot and crisply edited-- professional pieces of work where nobody involved got too showy with anything. The band, obviously, plays everything with just ridiculous amounts of technical skill; they wouldn't set off on these staggering epics if they weren't total wizards on their instruments. And over all these discs, there's a ton of material to process. The second DVD comes with a 45-minute life-on-the-road documentary, one that doesn't bother with anything as distracting as subtitles. Even if you speak Swedish, the thing probably isn't terribly interesting-- and yet, they <i>know</i> there are superfans out there who will absolutely eat this up. If you're an Opeth superfan-- and the band has plenty-- you probably already have this thing on pre-order, and you won't be disappointed.</p>
<p>But anyone not already absolutely converted will have a tough time with the sheer volume and density of this box. Ideally, a live album that touches on every era of a band's career should serve as a pretty good introduction to that band's work. That's not the case here-- and, really, it never could be. Opeth are an albums band, and the way they organize their set around their albums bespeaks that. They like their works to be long and immersive, and even the best-recorded live album can't swallow you up into its world the way Opeth's albums do. Opeth's records seem to convert their own environments, giving you time to roam over all their peaks and valleys. Playing live, they just seem like dudes doing very impressive things with their instruments. That's an easy thing to admire and a tough thing to love.</p></div>"|14661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14661-in-live-concert-at-the-royal-albert-hall/|6.3|Tom Breihan

It does this both conceptually-- find whatever plane techno, house, dubstep share-- and physically.  <i>The Traveller </i>will not transport you or rock you or bend your mind.  When you turn it up, it will not volley off your walls or rattle your windows; it seems to head straight for the corners, or the hollow spaces behind the drywall.</p>
<p>On his second album, the Berlin-based Rene Pawlowitz abandons his knack for long, clubby tech-house jams in favor of a loosely tied LP of short, fragmented compositions.  <i>The Traveller</i>, in both its title and its cover art, seems to suggest movement, but imprecisely.  What the record really evokes is infrastructure-- roads, bridges, tunnels-- but without the actual transportation they encourage.  There are no nine-minute motorik jams, no mind-altering drift.  Shed seems to aim for a loose connectedness.  These tracks-- 14 in total, though you'll barely notice the spaces between them-- have alleys and cubbies.  Some of them barely seem finished.  If Shed's 12""'s are self-contained declarations, tracks like ""Keep Time"" and ""Atmo - Action"" are sighs.</p>
<p>That's a lot of talk about what <i>The Traveller</i> isn't, but that's partly because it's difficult to pin down.  I think of infrastructure and construction because it's a tough record; when a track like ""44A (Hardwax Forever)"" moves into a hard, thumping passage it stings like a scraped knee.  Shed programs his drums so that they're big and overbearing but not thumping or anthemic.  The rhythm of ""Mayday"" was made for stalking, but the Boards of Canada-y synths that float over it lend it an innocence.  It's difficult to imagine moving your body at all-- stalking, dancing, etc.-- to the nutty palpitations of ""Final Experiment"".</p>
<p>None of this would work so well if <i>The Traveller</i> wasn't recorded quite so beautifully.  Knock the volume up on ""Hello Bleep!"" and listen to the echoing, choral beauty.  The spaces between the ghostly keyboards and the anvil-like kick drum on ""The Bot"" feel like they have real depth, like you could peer into them without seeing a bottom; the song sounds like dub reggae percolating.</p>
<p><i>The Traveller</i> is a techno record without many of techno's signifiers.  You will not lose yourself in repetition; if you try you will probably end up stomped by an unforeseen bass kick. <i>The Traveller</i> is hard, singular music that takes you nowhere.  That's its beauty.</p></div>"|14657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14657-the-traveller/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

Those bands stole plenty of winking heartfelt whoa-oh-ohs and ragged sugar-rush tempos from Superchunk's playbook. Since then, emo has gone through at least five or six sea changes; it now sounds absolutely nothing like Superchunk. The world has changed. Superchunk haven't.</p>
<p><i>Majesty Shredding</i> isn't a reunion album, though bands break up and reunite in way less time than Superchunk took between albums. And it's not an album that Superchunk needed to make to keep their collective name out there. After all, Superchunk's Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance founded Merge Records; these days, they're making that Arcade Fire and Spoon money. So for at least a few years, Superchunk have operated something like a fun hobby; the band accepts whatever shows it feels like playing, and it has no pressure to crank out another album every few years. Even though <i>Majesty Shredding</i> has been a long time coming, it's not some grand statement. It's not some stylistic leap forward, either; the band still sounds very much like the one who released <i>Here's to Shutting Up</i> in 2001, which in turn sounded very much like the band who released its self-titled debut in 1990. Instead, it sounds like McCaughan had another 11 Superchunk-sounding songs sitting around, and the band finally found time to record them.</p>
<p>Pretty incredibly, this band has cranked out snarky bruised-romantic pop-punk anthems for two decades now, without any dip in energy level or quality control. They've made a few tweaks and improvements over the years, but they've all been in service of these scrappy, frantic singalongs. The only real new wrinkle on <i>Majesty Shredding</i> is McCaughan's newfound upper register; his yelp verges on Ted Leo status a few times here. But the real joy on the album lies in the little details, tiny and brilliant songwriting choices that bespeak all Superchunk's years in the game. The gorgeously liquid jangle-riff that kicks in just at the very end of ""Winter Games"", the whooping ""yeah! yeah!""s that close out ""Crossed Wires"", the viola that heroically fights upstream on the excellent ballad ""Fractures in Plaster""-- younger bands might be able to come up with stuff like this, but they rarely execute these tricks with this level of confidence.</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot at stake on <i>Majesty Shredding</i>, but there never has been for Superchunk; their biggest anthem, after all, is a matter-of-fact rail against an annoying co-worker. Much of <i>Majesty Shredding</i> seems to concern the importance and difficulties inherent in maintaining a fantasy life as you get older, but it's not a morose or self-involved album. Instead, they've made a total wheelhouse record, and a very good one. The same qualities that make <i>Majesty Shredding</i> sound perfectly at home in Superchunk's discography also make it stand out in today's climate, where nobody really does straight-ahead wide-eyed power-punk well anymore, give or take a Surfer Blood or Japandroids. When lead Mountain Goats barker John Darnielle sings backup on one song and you <i>don't even notice him</i>, you're dealing with a band whose members know exactly who they are. So: A fine entry in a fine catalog. They aren't wasting that Arcade Fire money.</p></div>"|14642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14642-majesty-shredding/|8.0|Tom Breihan

They lost Darren Emerson to globetrotting, Ibiza-rocking DJ glory at the beginning of the decade and they haven't quite found their stride in the two (now three) albums since.  This was perhaps inevitable: Karl Hyde's wild-eyed, front-of-the-mix personality always ensured that Underworld would age more like a rock band than an electronic act.  (Witness how a touch of gray has bolstered the wisdom of folks like Carl Craig and the Chemical Brothers.)</p>
<p>My favorite song on <i>Barking</i>, ""Diamond Jigsaw"", talks about a white stretch limo and features ""pre-mi-um te-qui-la"" prominently in its chorus.  It sounds cheesy, but it's fantastic: the world absolutely needs more songs about those nights when you're flush with cash and having a really good time.  Moreover, Underworld is exactly the type of band to write these songs, because aside from aging like rock stars, they also got rich like rock stars.  There are worse places to end up than ""thoughtfully content headliners,"" and a recent, leaked live set/mix from the Privilege club in Ibiza proves that they can still transform their mid-level angst into thumping party-starters.</p>
<p><i>Barking</i> doesn't contain nearly enough of these moments, but the ones it does contain feature the kind of backlit, uplifting anthem-making that Underworld have only occasionally dabbled in (think: ""Rez"" or, more recently, ""Two Months Off"").  It's a really good fit for the band.  On ""Scribble"", Hyde sounds reconciled: ""And it's okay/ You give me everything I need.""  The arrangement is bright and lithe.  It features the same rush-rush-rush drum programming of heyday Underworld, but it doesn't feel like the song is trying slap you in the face; it feels like it's trying to make you drive your car a little faster.  It's refreshing to listen to Underworld embrace small, personal thrills.</p>
<p>Hyde may well be the same drug-addled crazyman he was during the 1990s, but he doesn't sound like it anymore.  ""Grace"" is a classic ""the club...<i>is dark and confusing</i>""-track, but Hyde sounds like he's envious of Interpol's pathos, which, Jesus.  ""Louisiana"", a slothful, album-ending ballad, immediately enters the competition for ""worst ever Underworld song,"" so pale is Hyde's slurring.  At different points on the album he talks about being ""violently in love"" and ""quietly violent,"" but these sort of ominous dictums seem sapped of any real strength.  It's weird to say, but Hyde just sounds so much better now when he's celebrating.</p>
<p><i>Barking</i> inhabits an odd place: half-dolorous electro-pop, half-affirming sunnyside jams.  You can attribute this to some of the help they had: Underworld farmed <i>Barking</i>'s tracks out to various producers, and it shows.  ""Hamburg Hotel"" contains hints of Appleblim's tense nighttime wandering, and Paul van Dyk is all over ""Diamond Jigsaw"".  These ""collaborations"" seem like a better marketing tool than a musical one, however, as <i>Barking</i>'s sonic variance is truthfully no greater than that of most Underworld albums.</p>
<p>Underworld receive a lot of credit for being a great albums band in a singles genre, but the lukewarm reception their last two albums received glossed over the fact that each has housed one or two great tracks.  So <i>Barking</i> stays the course, with the added prospect of a fitter, happier Underworld on the horizon.  It's about time.</p></div>"|14655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14655-barking/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

The culmination of a series of scene-stealing split 7"" appearances and featured spots on Underwater Peoples compilations, the album feels homespun, recalling Phil Elverum's defunct Microphones project in its attention to lo-fi detail. Whether he's rocking out or quieting down, you can practically hear him doing his thing in your basement-- well, until the neighbors call the cops, at least.</p>
<p>Because, yes there is a lot of rocking out on <i>Moon Deluxe</i>-- as you'd expect from an ex-Titus Andronicus guitarist-- and Cedermark lends extra oomph with his muscular guitar playing, which also recalls Elverum's own fancy fretwork. However, his own bombastic sound is far removed from that of his former act. You won't hear many call-to-arms chants or throat-shredding sloganeering here, as Cedermark's songwriting feels a little more introverted, making the sweeping, anthemic bursts of melody that close out ""Ad Infinitum"" and ""Hard Livin'"" less like teenage angst, more post-adolescent catharsis.</p>
<p>That intimacy owes more than a little bit to Cedermark's lyrical style, which favors fully realized thoughts and statements addressed in absentia. He writes in complete sentences, e.g. from ""Your Dream Is Killing Me"": ""I could've built a fire with these desires, and if nobody knows, the heat will still glow."" Elsewhere, on the title track, he expresses a unique disappointment that stems from isolation: ""My loneliness was pure until someone noticed it."" As hard as it is to lyrically convey one's emotions, it's even harder to achieve that task with a level of artifice, which makes it all the more impressive that Cedermark succeeds at both. When the lyrics on <i>Moon Deluxe</i> aren't confessional, they're evocative, even mythical, sure to invoke comparisons to Jeff Mangum.</p>
<p>Another trait that <i>Moon Deluxe</i> shares with Neutral Milk Hotel's catalog: there's a temptation to overthink this stuff. Resist, and indulge instead in Cedermark's opulently lo-fi excesses. As a front-to-back record, this thing is a monster, with winding melodies that ebb and flow at just the right times, wall-crumbling feedback breakdowns,  <i>lots</i> of glockenspiel, and one of the most satisfyingly raucous album closers in some time, ""I Won't Know Me Anymore"". The song kicks off with the burbling croak of horns and works itself into a heavy-strummed lather, as Cedermark sings through static about lust, nostalgia, and stealing beer. Just when you think the tune couldn't get any more gloriously overstuffed with paint-stripping guitar blasts and ramshackle breakdowns, Andrew enters a stream-of-consciousness spoken word rant about his future self's abandoning his family and decamping to a house by the beach: ""I'm gonna live there all alone and watch the waves destroy the shore.""

As she bounced from one project to the next (in some cases before she was even considered a proper member), the distinctive threads that joined these bands-- garage-rock ethos, dour jangle pop, 60s girl-group harmonies, questionable sonic fidelity-- suggested Rose had a clearly defined musical M.O. But with her fourth project in almost as many years, Rose is taking on a different approach: She seems intent on creating a harmonically driven, high-fidelity throwback pop album-- a novel concept among the dozens of her lo-fi peers looking to similar sounds for inspiration.</p>
<p>While <i>Frankie Rose and the Outs</i> lacks some of the charge of her former projects, her restraint feels as brash and satisfying. The key is subtlety and refinement: The guitars here do none of the heavy lifting, often left to only punctuate or reinforce the cascading vocal harmonies and rolling bass that anchor these songs. ""Memo""'s sharp, lightly reverbed notes are whisked away by charging drums and voices; the buzzy flat tone in the background of ""That's What People Told Me"" exists only to offset the song's cautious, lilting shake before shaping itself into a spy-movie riff.</p>
<p>At times woefully angelic (like on the sublime cover of Arthur Russell's ""You Can Make Me Feel Bad"") or richly layered (the soaring ""Little Brown Haired Girls""), Rose's harmonies nail down the technical aspect of what made these girl groups so appealing. For a record this simple and, even at its punchiest, seductively serene, it might seem far-fetched to compliment it for being daring. But considering its own orbit-- and her eschewing lo-fi recording techniques-- Rose cuts right to the chase, making lean, elegant music that practically glows in the face of exceptional fuss.</p></div>"|14634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14634-frankie-rose-and-the-outs/|7.4|Zach Kelly

The group still leans hard on their most beloved sounds: single-note guitar peals that bounce off springing reverb, softly mumbled vocals, thick bass riffs, and big, billowy swaths of synthesizer. But while they once had a sort of rainy-day murk about them, these textures now sparkle like burnished silver.</p>
<p>Certainly, the transformation is a good look for a band that spent too long playing in the shadows. The pitch-shifted samples and electro-drum rattles of ""Heart Full of Pentagons"" give a slick and stylish underpinning to Greg Bertens' unusually forceful vocals. ""Heart"" is a definite career highlight, starting off an album-opening triad where Film School sound like they're on the verge of establishing a distinctiveness that their prior work lacked. ""When I'm Yours"" and ""Time to Listen"" are hard-charging and simultaneously spooky, something closer to the Cure at their most post-punk. And while the group still isn't going to be known for big hooks, the double-time kick of ""Distant Life"" and ""Sunny Day"" are accessible enough to frame Film School as students of the pop side of shoegaze as opposed to just the blown-out part.</p>
<p>Despite of all the sonic additions, the album's urgency is what feels most new. When <i>Fission</i> is at its best, you feel like Film School was tiring of being a band that could accurately call an album <i>Hideout</i>. Though the airhorn guitar blast of ""Waited"" would've fit on their prior records, here it feels like a veil of secrecy has been lifted on an intimate conversation between Bertens and bassist Lorelei Plotczyk. But then the energy seems to float away during the pleasant but anodyne electronic indie-pop of <i>Fission</i>'s midsection.</p>
<p>To play off something Jayson Greene wrote on this site last year, whether it's gangsta rap or Appalachian folk, there's always a pleasure in hearing an artist expertly working within the parameters of their idealized form of music. In Film School's case, that terrain encompasses pretty much anything that's ever been released on the 4AD label or held the appellate of ""-gaze."" The problem is that their particular field never lacks for competition, and when a younger act like Wild Nothing or the Depreciation Guild puts their own stamp on this sound by stressing a winsome melodicism or electronic trickery, you get a weird disappointment from the fact that <i>Fission</i> is Film School's most diverse album to date. In some ways, the diversity works against them. Rather than establishing their own identity or finally making the leap from good to great, they simply remind you of more bands than they did before.</p></div>"|14627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14627-fission/|6.3|Ian Cohen

Most artists would take some time off after releasing a record as all-out, balls-to-the-wall ambitious as this year's dazzling <i>Cosmogramma</i><span>, his</span> most recent full-length as Flying Lotus. Yet here we are three months later, with a new EP, the seven-track <i>Pattern + Grid World</i>. Between this and Ellison's constant stream of remixes for other artists, it's hard to imagine when he finds time to sleep.</p>
<p>Unlike those remixes, which mostly fall between the range of good and competent, <i>Pattern + Grid World</i> sounds fully formed and precisely assembled. That shouldn't be surprising, considering Ellison's growing reputation as an album artist, but the fact that early single ""Camera Day"" originally made an appearance as the backbeat for Killer Mike's ""Swimming"" in June hinted that this release might wind up more of an odds-and-ends set. However, <i>Pattern + Grid World</i> feels as much like a complete work as its full-length predecessor, from the engine-revving opener ""Clay"" to the squelching closer ""Physics For Everyone!"" And this despite its ultra-short (barely 19 minutes) runtime.</p>
<p>Because of its brevity, the EP serves a solid entry point to Flying Lotus' work. Perhaps the only serious complaint that could be lodged against <i>Cosmogramma</i> is that it was daunting-- too dense, complicated, and harsh for casual listeners and first-time beat freaks. This EP, by contrast, feels a bit like Baby's First Brainfeeder: you've got the speed-addled drum'n'bass freakout (""Kill Your Co-Workers""), the off-kilter post-Dilla thumper (""Time Vampires""), and a midsection so swampy that you can practically see the flies hovering above the surface (""Jurassic Notion / M Theory"").</p>
<p>Which isn't to say that this is a beginners-only record. There's plenty of detail to revel in on <i>Pattern + Grid World</i>-- new surprises are unlocked with every listen. The chintzy ""Amen"" break that serves as a foundation for the 8-bit expansiveness of ""Kill Your Co-Workers"" might be recognizable from that first skittering breakbeat. But it takes a few listens to realize that the wobbly horn amidst percussion of ""Jurassic Notion"" has an enticing riff reminiscent of Missy Elliott protégé Tweet's ""Oops (Oh My)"". Elsewhere, revelations are found in the synth lines that twist above the low-riding beat on ""Camera Day"", and the rigid snare-and-hi-hat abstractions of ""PieFace"". For now, FlyLo's well of invention looks to be in no danger of running dry.</p></div>"|14643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14643-pattern-grid-world-ep/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

The stumbling block that really sticks with me, however, was one of the first to arise: there was initially opposition-- certainly from musicians but also from patrons-- to recorded music being played in public places.  The thought, presumably, was that if a crowd and venue were sufficient to support music, it should be live music.  Matthew Herbert's <i>One Club</i> is composed from sounds recorded during one night at the Robert Johnson nightclub in Frankfurt; it is a self-professed attempt by Herbert to document the vibrancy and chaos of an ad-hoc community brought together by recorded sound.  It is sort of a will-the-circle-be-unbroken?-artifact for DJ culture, if you enjoy thinking conceptually (Herbert does).</p>
<p>Nothing with Herbert is merely an artifact; everything is a statement. <i>One Club</i> aims to combat what Herbert sees as the growing corporatism in club culture.  He will combat this corporatism with high art, natch, but <i>One Club</i> is actually one of Herbert's least overbearingly wacky ideas this decade.  (It is also the second volume of this year's ""One"" trilogy. <i>One Pig-- </i>volume three, scheduled for later this year-- attempts to document the life cycle of a swine.)</p>
<p>Herbert functionally stopped making club music several years ago, so <i>One Club</i> represents something of a return to his roots, though it has little in common with the jazz-inflected microhouse he helped pioneer in the late 1990s.  The points Herbert seems to be making-- that clubs are foggy, wonderful, frightening social habitats-- are elementary enough, but the way he makes them is natural.  There is chatter, haze, long stretches of aggressive percussion.  More than once a crowd starts chanting.  I think of my bleeding-together club experiences: DJ call and response sessions (""Marcus Bujak""), bathroom breaks (""Alex Duwe""), stumbles to the bar (""Jalal Malekidoost""), and unmalicious elbows in my side while dancing (""Oliver Bauer"").  In what is either a move of astoundingly precise conceptual execution or, well, compositional failure, <i>One Club</i> also embodies the ills of clubgoing: It is loud and too long and leaves you fatigued.</p>
<p>Whereas 1998's <i>Around the House </i>(composed of recordings of household objects) always just sounded like techno, it's actually possible that listeners could suss out <i>One Club</i>'s source material without prior knowledge.  ""Loud, emotionally conflicted public event"" really shines through; ""football game"" (the sponsorship and corporatism of which would likely cause Herbert's head to burst) wouldn't be a bad guess. <i>One Club </i>ran a risk of its source material and subject matter ending up in a weird feedback loop.  But the best part about it is that it evokes a club experience without actually sounding like club music.  Herbert's re-imagined club is capable of leaving you groggy and sore as well as excited and nostalgic, though that's probably exactly his point.</p></div>"|14648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14648-one-club/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's a pretty evocative title for a mini-album like this one, which follows Megafaun's breakthrough full-length, <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i>. The word itself suggests the present moment as the point of intersection between the past and the future<b>, </b><span>which</span> is exactly where the North Carolina trio find themselves. They tease out old ideas and combine them with new ones, affixing Appalachian folk to classic rock, ambient, avant garde, and a kind of musical entropy that pushes many of their songs into sputtering, oddly compelling noise. On <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i> they found a way to integrate those compositional and decompositional urges, creating songs as postcards from the deepest backwoods: creased and worn, grass-stained and dotted with dirt and grit, possibly crawling with critters, but with a simple, genial message scrawled on each one.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Megafaun wrote and recorded these six songs in January and February of this year, with a coterie of friends and fellow musicians chipping in (notably, members of the Slaraffenland adding horns). So the easygoing mood of <i>Heretofore</i> sounds primarily social, at times even gregarious, which crucially gives shape to the band's rickety excursions. ""Eagle"", with its loping pace and halting melody, crams so many ideas in its seven minutes that it might burst its seams, yet the arrangement moves between them mercurially and with real curiosity. So it's not unexpected to hear studio applause as it winds down; simply keeping the song together sounds like quite a laudable accomplishment.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Eagle"" would have slotted nicely in the middle of <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i>, but the instrumental ""Comprovisation for Connor Pass"" is less familiar and more ambitious. Another carefully chosen word, ""comprovisation"" involves the creation of a new composition through various improvisations, which means the song rambles with a sense of purpose. Megafaun assemble it patiently over 12 minutes, shifting styles and sounds fluidly. The song dips sharply at the eight-minute mark, increasing the tension before launching into a widescreen finale that is all the sweeter for the long journey that preceded it. ""Comprovisation"" sounds like a daring piece of music, exciting and absorbing in the way it builds up instead of falling apart.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That track represents only one side of Megafaun, of course; as much as they work off the cuff, the band also writes tightly structured songs that toy with the traditional blues and pop forms. With its breezy pace and classic-rock melody, ""Carolina Days"" isn't just good roadtrip music; it's a roadtrip in itself, a cross-country travelogue that starts among the redwoods of California and ends up at a ""pink house in the Catskills."" They could be chronicling a recent tour or mapping out their own musical inspirations. ""Volunteers"" is stationary by comparison, its high-lonesome chorus celebrating the band's home state as a place to nurse deep regret: ""Sun light, silhouettes of dogwood trees,"" they sing in unison, ""swayin' all alone in the Carolina breeze.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Bookending <i>Heretofore</i> are two songs that effortlessly reconcile the band's seemingly conflicting impulses. With a slow, scene-setting guitar riff and a simple melody that showcases their brotherly harmonies, the opening title track gathers form quietly, reaching its full stride as the music grows noisier and arrhythmic. The mess complements the order, as it does on ""Bonnie's Song"", a wisp of a valedictory that sounds all the more elegiac for being so ephemeral and final. It's a fitting conclusion to an album that tweaks the past to point the way forward.</p>

In the 1990s, they ably blended rave's currents of sound with shoegaze's tempos and wash.  At their best they were light and bliss-y without feeling insubstantial, providing excellent fodder for remixes.  Writing for <i>Melody Maker</i> in 1993, Simon Reynolds cleverly called them ""womb-adelic.""  The <i>Faults </i>EP is Seefeel's first recording since 1996, with principals Mark Clifford and Sarah Peacock convening with Shigeru Ishihara and Iida Kazuhisa, a former Boredoms drummer.  Most notably, it's not very smooth: rather than gracelessly grasping at their old sound, Seefeel have taken a stab at something new.  It's an unexpected, difficult path that has yielded unexpected, difficult music.</p>
<p>If Clifford and Peacock still have theirs ears tied to British electronic music-- it seems likely they do-- then a new direction makes perfect sense, as UK techno has changed immeasurably in the last 15 years.  <i>Faults </i>at times approximates the blocky, ornate musicality of Britain's promising post-dubstep scene: Darkstar, Untold, and Mount Kimbie come to mind.  The similarities are not necessarily born of execution-- <i>Faults</i> doesn't sound exactly like those young artists-- but in the way Seefeel use sound: piecing it together, stacking it.  Where previous Seefeel recordings often sounded like purees of their source elements, <i>Faults</i> finds the band pre-blend.</p>
<p>You can chalk some of the difference up to the new personnel.  Kazuhisa paces the band with choppy, concentrated drumming; gone are the whirring palpitations of the younger Seefeel.  On the title track, everything comes together: ghostly, pitch-shifted vocals balance on the crevasses between bass drum kicks as the song builds to a chalky, sour anti-climax.  It is charmingly indecisive and unpredictable, as the song feels like it could develop in many ways but instead just teeters on its axis.  The remaining three songs are cut from similar sonic cloth but don't feel as restless.  They are too content to let keyboard noise sink into drum patterns or to knob-twiddle into knots.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Faults </i>feels like a band working on something.  They seem creative, full of new blood and old friendships.  <i>Faults</i> is airy and tactile, its failures full of queasy keyboards and structural percussion.   In an era that has seen dozens of 1990s bands reunite, Seefeel have done so under the impression not that their old material is relevant and worthwhile (though it is), but rather that their new material might be.  More, please.</p></div>"|14646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14646-faults/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

Pollard doesn't so much have fans as obsessives, and-- coupled with his beyond-prolific release schedule and seemingly willful inconsistency-- at this point it can almost seem like you're either in or you're out. But every nut out there divebombing their credit scores to chase the Fading Captain through his many diversions got hooked the same way: on the strength of one perfectly weird, immediately ingratiating pop tune after another. And neophyte and fanatic both will find much to like about the sharp, spirited <i>Our Cubehouse Still Rocks</i>, the fourth LP from the Boston Spaceships. Though still strange and singular enough to only be Pollard, the warm, exuberant songs that comprise <i>Cubehouse</i> don't take a master's in Pollardiana to dig into.</p>
<p>Though it lifts its title from James Joyce's improbably dense <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, <i>Cubehouse</i> is a decidedly straightforward affair, a bright, rollicking blast of nearly fat-free power-pop with a few more nods than usual to Pollard faves Cheap Trick. Like the Spaceships records before it, <i>Cubehouse</i> keeps the tempos up and the spirits high; Uncle Bob's in a good mood. Decemberists drummer John Moen and multi-instrumentalist Chris Slusarenko are, as ever, an extremely complimentary musical unit for Pollard's songs, tight and tuned-in but unafraid of a little dazzle. And here on <i>Cubehouse</i>, their warm, worn-in arrangements serve as ideal foils for Pollard's most genial, generous collection in years.</p>
<p><i>Cubehouse</i> kicks off with ""Track Star"", which finds Pollard devising new and exciting ways to sing, ""I'll bet he runs,"" over a splashy little rumbler. From there, <i>Cubehouse</i> teeters between surefooted riff-rockers and quietly triumphant power balladry and the occasional chiming R.E.M.-derived lope, bashed out enthusiastically without a lot of monkeying around. There's little of the proggy convolution or slow, sickly sweet numbers that can drag a Pollard album down, just a briskly paced collection of hooky, undemanding rockers with nary a bad song in the bunch; a rare thing indeed for a Pollard project.</p>
<p>Expertly paced, <i>Cubehouse</i>'s highlights are judiciously spread out, its occasional down note always quickly offset by something more boisterous. It's the Spaceships' most consistent listen; with no lows to speak of, it's easy to see this becoming the go-to for fans. The highs here aren't quite as high as those on <i>The Planets Are Blasted</i>, but they are still well in range of some of Pollard's best stuff; the starting gun of ""Track Star"", the deliberate stagger of ""I See You Coming"", the towering yell-along ""Come on Baby Grace"", the magisterial room-spinning ""In the Bathroom (Up 1/2 the Night)"". On each-- and throughout <i>Cubehouse</i>, really-- Pollard sounds like he's having a blast affixing all these good-time melodies together; you'd swear you can hear the smile spread across on his face as he's asking the titular Baby Grace not to punch him in it.</p></div>"|14656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14656-our-cubehouse-still-rocks/|7.4|Paul Thompson

Indeed, there is something of a noticeable ""return to form"" about <i>Hurley</i>-- their best album since at least, uh, <i>Maladroit</i>.<span> </span>The first single, ""Memories"", is actually <i>about </i>older Weezer-- sure, the lyrics are sub-Ben Folds nyuks (""playin' hacky sack back when Audioslave was still Rage"") and the X Games-style brass fanfare can be a turnoff, but as with 2008 single ""Pork and Beans"", the autobiographical framework of it gives it a certain charm.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Nobody is going to confuse this with 1990s Weezer-- there are still plenty of oddball collaborations (Michael Cera, Linda Perry) for one thing-- but the lows aren't as low or as frequent as they were in recent years. This is still a Mk. III Weezer album where songs are constructed more like sitcoms: each has a single premise based on a rigid structure and a comforting predictability, and each can be experienced in virtually any order.<span> </span>The listenability is at its lowest when it sounds like the producer was meant to pipe in a laugh track.<span> </span>""Where's My Sex?"" is pretty much D.O.A., and Cuomo doesn't do much to revive it, the ""big reveal"" being the phonic similarities between ""sex"" and ""socks"" (""I can't go out without my sex/ It's cold outside and my toes get wet""). ""Smart Girls"" is laughably half-assed, which is more than I can say about lyrics that lack so badly for any sort of detail that you could simply replace ""Smart"" in the title with ""Dumb"" or any other adjective.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's a shame <i>Hurley </i>is so dependant on such lyrical hijinks, because the one thing Cuomo's never abandoned is a ruthlessly economical approach to songwriting.<span> </span><span> </span>When <i>Hurley </i>works, it's because Cuomo is a master of form. Even if you're not going to be the one singing along, it's easy to imagine ""Ruling Me"" offering some sort of platonic radio-rock pleasure, while ""Hang On"" positions itself as the one where the kids will be waving their iPhones in the air.<span> </span>But when the two instincts clash on ""Trainwrecks"", you hear a perfectly anthemic chorus get lost in a confused verse where Cuomo doesn't put in enough effort to indicate whether it's a riff on hipsters or on himself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Which leads to the question that's accompanied pretty much everything Weezer's done since <i>The Green Album</i>: Is this a bad album on its own terms, a rush job that could have worked better were the band not releasing records at this pace? Or was Weezer <i>always </i>a goofy pop band subjected to indie ideals they never believed in?<span> </span>The answers depend more on the listener than anyone else. You can't deny that Cuomo feels no shame and is making exactly the kind of music he wants, and there's ultimately something disarming about that.</p></div>"|14652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14652-hurley/|5.0|Ian Cohen

So it's unusual to be confronted with one, and the first question that comes to mind is, ""Is this really a live performance at all?"" DOOM has a purported tendency to send phony ""Doomposters"" to perform in his place at shows-- and a reputation as a terrible performer when he does show up-- so he must have titanium balls to even consider putting out a concert album. So <i>Expektoration</i>'s validity has been called into question, particularly since it sounds so much better than his other concert release, 2005's <i>Live from Planet X</i>. That record is so bad that you <i>know</i> it's legit.</p>
<p><i>Expektoration </i>does feel like the genuine article though-- the crowd at least is real (right off the bat, they shout along with the ""Super!"" drops in ""Hoe Cakes"")-- and there's a feel to this album that transcends the redundant and sloppy nature of your typical<i> </i>barrel-scraping live rap album. One of the probable reasons people thought this was a phony show is this is a ridiculously clean-sounding recording, a soundboard job where the audience and the ambient sound pop in only when they're needed. Sure, you can occasionally hear another voice interject a phrase in the background, one of those stage-sharing dudes that may or may not be a weedcarrier and traditionally is there to pick up the slack if an MC doesn't feel like finishing a line. But that stuff's minimized on this album-- for the most part, it's all DOOM, and he sounds a damn sight more dedicated here than his sullied reputation might have you assume.</p>
<p>If you want preliminary evidence, just take note of how diabolically energized DOOM's voice sounds compared to the cool, calculated, almost deadpan muttering of the studio versions. That laidback demeanor sounded great on record, but the dynamics of a live show are different enough that he'd need to crank things up in the liveliness department to really engage with the audience. His success is established in short order, as <i>MM.. Food? </i>highlights ""Hoe Cakes"", ""Kon Queso"", and ""One Beer"" are pushed up from blunted stream-of-consciousness raps to animated diatribes. He snarls and chortles, he sells his own punchlines, he gets jovial one moment and guttural the next, he turns periods and ellipses into exclamation points. Even his banter slays; at the threat of a stage-dive moment, he warns the crowd, ""You don't want me to do that shit, I'm a good 220!""</p>
<p>And yet it's hard to shake the feeling that something's up the longer this set goes. It's not just the inexplicable decision to string all the songs together, presenting this set as a two-half, two-track performance with a brief ""Star Trek""-quoting skit/intermission squeezed in the middle. That does make a kind of sense-- the show's paced briskly, and it's probably fair to have the listener experience the same uninterrupted event as the audience. But eventually you'll come around to the big question: ""When <i>was</i> this recorded?"" The set's heavy on prime mid-career material from <i>Madvillainy</i>, <i>Vaudeville Villain, </i>and <i>Take Me to Your Leader</i>, not to mention 1999's legendary <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>-- but nothing from <i>Born Like This </i>or Danger Doom. In fact, none of the songs performed on <i>Expektoration</i> postdate <i>MM.. Food?</i>, DOOM refers to crunk as ""that new shit,"" and he actually shares the stage with his now-estranged former collaborator MF Grimm, who dropped the DOOM-baiting dis track ""Book of Daniel"" four years ago.</p>
<p>In fact, DOOM's between-songs mention of a food drive concurrent with the show is the big giveaway, since fans who shelled out for the <i>MM.. Food? </i>deluxe reissue back in 2007 were given a DVD of highlights from his '04 <i>MM.. Food? Drive </i>tour. And the album's notes, not to mention the promotional push, tellingly gloss this over. In light of that fact, as well as <i>Expektoration</i>'s <i>Operation: Doomsday-</i>heavy second half and its subsequent overlap with the similarly inclined <i>Live from Planet X</i>, this is almost insultingly deceptive. That's a shame: <i>Expektoration </i>is DOOM at his live-show peak, and people who go into this knowing this set's from six years back might feel a bit more charitable. But releasing a concert album with an ""Act 1""/""Intermission""/""Act 2"" structure instead of a telltale tracklist, and obscuring its actual place in a years-distant history? That's not supervillainy, that's antagonism.</p></div>"|14629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14629-expektoration-live/|6.0|Nate Patrin

<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you dug Abe Vigoda's last album, <i>Skeleton</i>, but slept on the follow-up EP <i>Reviver, Crush </i>might come as a bit of a shock. Where <i>Skeleton </i>solidified their rep as ""tropical-punk"" workaholics, spitting out blasts of chiming guitar and gnarled beats, <i>Crush </i>indulges their love of goth and coldwave, with synths often louder than guitars. <i>Reviver </i>nudged things in that direction, sounding more emotive and less claustrophobic (there was even a maudlin remake of <i>Skeleton</i>'s ""Endless Sleeper"" that did away drums entirely), but here they go full-bore, evoking the drama of Psychedelic Furs or Echo and the Bunnymen.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It was a big risk to take, and it's paid off: The songs may sound more conventional, but they're no less complex. The music is hard-wired and overflowing with activity, even in the record's sparsest moments. For me, Abe Vigoda's trademark is tightly-wound songs that spill into chaos, and that's here in spades-- the heightened accessibility never comes at a compromise. Being into Abe Vigoda still means being an adrenaline-junkie, and much of <i>Crush</i> is as frenetic and engagingly exhausting as anything on <i>Skeleton.</i></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Where the latter<i> </i>slammed quickly into that frenzy, <i>Crush </i>takes more time to crest into its darker waves. Early tracks are marked more by Dane Chadwick's sharp drumming and Michael Vidal's smoldering voice (recalling Richard Butler and Peter Murphy) than any of the sounds in between. But midway through, <i>Crush </i>really flames up. ""November"", ""Pure Violence"", and the title track all weave spiraling structures that constantly ride curves and turn corners. It's easy to hear echoes of <i>Skeleton </i>in the cascading guitars, but the increased prominence of Vidal's singing gives it all an aching, moody edge, as if the band's tropical locale has become shrouded in sun-blocking clouds.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At times those clouds can be oppressive. Vidal's moan on the Simple Minds-ish ""Repeating Angel"" becomes a bit of a mope, and closer ""We Have to Mask"" feels slightly lethargic, its canned beats and strained emoting bearing the feel of an outtake. But even if those tracks aren't great on their own, they don't nearly break the spell of <i>Crush</i>, whose combination of hard-charging energy and world-weary moods is less an unexpected curveball than a well-earned step forward.</p></div>"|14647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14647-crush/|7.8|Marc Masters

He also mentioned that someday he wanted to make an electronic record inspired in part by <i>Plux Quba</i>, an obscure late-1980s album by Portuguese composer Nuno Canavarro that got a second life when it was reissued a decade later by Jim O'Rourke's Mokai imprint. ""That's the high-water mark, in my opinion, of electronic music,"" Prekop said. ""It's a really delicate, beautiful, and really weird record."" I can remember reading that quote and getting excited. <i>Plux Quba</i> is indeed a very special record that is also hard to pin down, and it's a good feeling when you find out that someone else hears what you were hearing in an album-- especially one that never really got around. A record inspired by <i>Plux Quba</i> was promising to say the least.</p>
<p>Three years later, Prekop returns with <i>Old Punch Card</i>, an instrumental album that's very different from his two song-based solo records. Whether or not this is the album Prekop was thinking about in early 2007, to my ears it shares a spirit with <i>Plux Quba</i> and brings with it some of the same slippery qualities. In describing the record, it's easier to begin with what it's not: It's almost all electronic, but it's not drone, not really ambient, and doesn't conform to the structures of pop. It's not cinematic, not minimal, and not focused on the sound of technology as an end in itself.  It's an album that thrives in the gaps between established categories, with music that can come over as cool and cerebral or tinged with longing and melancholy, depending on what the listener brings to it.</p>
<p>Though it is abstract, <i>Old Punch Card</i> is playful. It's like the sound of a guy bumping around in a room filled with weird noisemakers, trying out one and then another until he finds one that sounds especially interesting. At which point he sticks with it for a while to see what it does and what sort of feelings might be coaxed out of it. So the first three minutes of a track called ""Array Wicket"" consist of static and a warbly organ line that doesn't go anywhere in particular, and then in the last two a pulsing synthesizer line out of an early Tangerine Dream record comes marching through, conveying something sonically clear and direct in contrast to earlier ambiguity. These sharp movements from one sound to the next happen a lot on <i>Old Punch Card</i>, but the overall effect is soothing rather than jarring. There are passages of quiet noise, retro-sounding sequencers, indiscernible electronics that sound vaguely like broken music boxes, bits of guitar. A mood of thoughtful contemplation mixed with blurry flecks of sadness and joy is maintained throughout.</p>
<p>Since the music on <i>Old Punch Card</i> isn't trying to do anything in particular and the rules of composition are pretty loose, the guiding principle seems to be to maintain a careful sense of balance that reinforces the music's curious Zen-like character. Prekop is also a painter, and you can imagine these pieces being assembled like canvases-- this one needs a little color in this corner, maybe, and that one could use a little more prickly texture in the center. The subtle and seemingly simple music that comes from such an approach is easy to overlook, and it's not going to appeal to everyone. But it can also lead to records like <i>Plux Quba</i>, records you can return to for years and never get tired of, in part because you can never quite ""solve"" them. I'm hearing some of that open-ended mystery in <i>Old Punch Card</i>; we'll see what it grows into.</p></div>"|14654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14654-old-punch-card/|7.6|Mark Richardson

For all its barbed melodies and immersive murk, <i>Hate</i> was mired by a reverence for its influences-- the dark jangle pop of the Jesus and Mary Chain and Echo and the Bunnymen, mostly-- that bordered on mimeograph. Its songs were decently crafted, the production fittingly dank. But the record felt bored with itself, almost like it, too, wondered why they'd write the ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat or a ""Darklands"" guitar swirl into so many tunes. It all needed some sorting out.</p>
<p>Enter James Ford of Simian Mobile Disco, who mans the boards here on <i>Sleep Forever</i>, Crocodiles' improved second go. With him, Ford brings in a slew of new instrumental textures and an update to the influences mainframe to go with the sharper songwriting. With Ford doing the sorting, the difference is immediately clear.  <i>Hate</i>'s dry heave has been replaced with a muggy churn that builds on Echo and company's own <i>Crocodiles</i> while working in more krautrock palpitations and a druggy Madchester-like bustle. It's brasher, fuller, woolier, with little shards of sound scraping against the speakers, laying on the much-needed grit. Next to this, <i>Summer of Hate</i> sounds like a demo.</p>
<p>Expansive sound in place, Crocodiles bring the tunes to match. Opener ""Mirrors"" unfurls slowly, gracefully notching up the racket before sliding into its monstrous verses. The lurching ""Stoned to Death"" has a good char on it, while the title track just glows in amniotic warmth. But it's ""Hearts of Love"", with its bold glockenspiel-assisted melody, that's <i>Sleep Forever</i>'s peak, a rollicking devotional that suggests the weary grandeur of Spiritualized with the Flaming Lips basher Steven Drozd on drums. <i>Summer of Hate</i> felt meek at times, content to retreat into its own shadow; <i>Sleep Forever</i>'s many oversized melodies and wider-reaching sound prove that these guys do a lot better taking a few steps into the light.</p>
<p>There are still some weak spots; singer Brandon Welchez comes over a tad blank, at times oversinging and underenunciating. Though they've taken pains to expand their sound, the least of these tunes feel almost as though they've simply switched out JAMC jangle for Primal Scream peal without injecting much of themselves into it. And, while they seem to do bigger best, they do occasionally slip into empty bombast; closer ""All My Hate and My Hexes Are For You"" repeats its title line at least a dozen times when once would've done it. But these are minor missteps for a band that seemed to be stumbling right out of the gate barely a year ago.</p></div>"|14645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14645-sleep-forever/|6.8|Paul Thompson

In 2007, Nick Cave gave up the ghost of youth, declaring an out-and-out midlife crisis with Grinderman, a brilliant, crude, stripped-down quartet. Made up of members of his Bad Seeds, the nascent group's self-titled debut was naked about its grotesqueries, as Cave futzed with a guitar for the first time, wailed about the ""No Pussy Blues"", and sucked in his gut with hopes of getting laid.</p>
<p>It was an inspired late-career move for the then 50-year-old, invigorating and recalibrating the piano-affixed, doom-saying troubadour. Critics fell over themselves proclaiming the return of the former Birthday Party frontman's skuzzy side. A year later you could hear the punk reverberations in 2008's Bad Seeds album, <i>Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!</i> But Grinderman, though fierce and often hilarious, weren't exactly a great band. Young bands-- no matter how old-- have to learn new tricks, and this one had to find interesting ways to be messy. <i>Grinderman 2</i> is a sequel of sorts, but mostly an improvement. The band has widened their sound and sexual pursuits, but also poked around at the edges of decrepitude. What does life look like on the other side of crisis?</p>
<p>Well, it's schizophrenic and sloppy. Those feral urges are still there; consider the album cover's lupine avatar. But Cave and the band-- who typically improvise structure and lyrics-- have kept the themes consistent across nine songs. And they're not terribly different from what interests him on albums with the Bad Seeds: God, Death, and America are gospel. But sexual filialness-- Cave seems to be calling himself ""Daddy"" and yowling at his child-lover a lot here-- takes an uncomfortable precedence. ""Worm Tamer"" and ""Heathen Child"" are almost comically lascivious. ""I stick my fingers in your biscuit jar/ And crush all your gingerbread men,"" he moans, aping Howlin' Wolf on ""Kitchenette"", one of the album's best songs. And later, ""What has that husband of yours ever given to you?/ Oprah Winfrey on a plasma screen."" That's a great line, the sort of insinuating thing that might get Cave into bed with a frustrated housewife, but it's also miserably desperate, self-deprecating stuff.</p>
<p>Cave has been leading a full life lately, finishing his second novel in 2009, composing scores for John Hillcoat's films, and writing a few screenplays of his own. But he has rarely been as experimental and unafraid as he is here. The pastoral ""Palaces of Montezuma"" is a ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" for heroin addicts, haunted by visions of Miles Davis, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, and ""a custard-colored super-dream of Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen."" It's unhinged and unerringly beautiful. So often, Cave is wise about the state of it all; he seems to know he's on the wrong side of things-- life, love, fear-- but he won't give up the fight.</p>
<p>Like much of Cave's work, there is an ominous sense of dread always creeping. But unlike previous work, there's a speed and intensity to <i>Grinderman 2</i> unheard before. From the chugging build of ""Mickey Mouse and the Goodbye Man"" through the psych-haze of ""Bellringer Blues"", there are few opportunities to catch your breath. ""Evil"" even lurches toward death metal. ""What I Know"" is a rare and tender respite from the fury; it's a plaintive ballad to precocity, process, and nothing. ""Oh I know, yeah I know,"" Cave intones, never quite revealing what it is. There isn't much to the song-- a stray, buzzing crackle; a far-off wordless melody; a quietly strummed guitar. It's just a simple moment in a savage life.</p></div>"|14622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14622-grinderman-2/|8.1|Sean Fennessey

While many post-LP EPs round up same-session tracks or studio experiments for diehard fans, these five austere folk songs were written on the road and recorded during a recent break from touring. They're unmistakably Tallest, marked by the vulnerability in Kristian Matsson's croak of a voice, the strident complexity of his guitarwork, and his thoughtful, often fractured lyrics inspired, ostensibly, by his native Sweden-- specifically the mountainous region of Dalarna, northwest of Stockholm. And yet, despite the same elements, <i>Blues</i> has a very different character from <i>The Wild Hunt</i>. It's slightly darker, more wounded, muted, and meditative, lacking the fanfare of the album's more heraldic moments. While limited in scope and tone, the EP allows Matsson to explore one particular mood: a primary color in his palette, a bluesy melancholy that defines and permeates every song here.</p>
<p>He is, however, never dour or grim. Matsson's songs fashion hooks out of stones and branches and whatever else he encounters along the trail. Opener ""Little River"" bends on a melodic curlicue, a wish tossed into a well: ""Is it honest like a falling log to dream of things like a little river to the golden ground?"" Similarly, ""The Dreamer"", whose lyrics give the EP its title, turns on a modest yet elegant upsweep of melody. It is, perhaps, more notable for being the first and so far the only Tallest Man song to feature electric guitar, and the punch of those resonant strums is abrupt and startling. This isn't <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> revisited, but rather introspective folk simply plugged in and reverbed.</p>
<p>That song especially broadens Matsson's stark sound, which emphasizes the nuanced interplay between voice and stringed instruments. The splintering notes that open ""Like the Wheel"" (which has been closing his live shows lately) give way to some of his tenderest vocals, while closer ""Thrown Right at Me"" is so quiet it sounds like it might slip away at any moment, and his playing is so hushed and hesitant that the song is practically <i>a cappella</i>. Start to finish, <i>Blues</i> is as thoughtfully and carefully constructed as either of Matsson's albums, revealing the nuances of his sound and subtly putting the lie to the notion that he needs anything besides his weathered voice and beat-up guitar.</p></div>"|14639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14639-sometimes-the-blues-is-just-a-passing-bird-ep/|7.8|Stephen M.

The Miami trio sits near the top of the underground-metal heap, but they're also the rare underground-metal band happy to come off as regular dudes rather than medieval warriors or swamp monsters. They churn out fuzz-rock bangers with mechanistic precision, never betraying any signs of pretension or mystique. Since the departure of guitarist Juan Montoya, they're an entirely short-haired band, and frontman Steve Brooks sings in a beer-belly bellow, not an elemental rasp. The band take as many cues from ragged 1990s indie as they do from bongwater-dripping 70s crunch-rock, and you can hear echos of Guided By Voices and Superchunk reverberating around in there. They never sacrifice melody for volume, or vice versa-- and somehow, that quality makes them exceptional.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the band came out hard with <i>Meanderthal</i>, which the metal mag <i>Decibel</i> called their album of the year while admitting that it sometimes sounds like the Foo Fighters. On <i>Songs for Singles</i>, their new eight-song EP, there's nothing that leaves as deep an impression as some of the best <i>Meanderthal</i> moments. Instead there's an intense focus on brevity, as the first six songs stick as tightly as possible to a very basic formula, sort of like the Ramones did. These songs never get far beyond the two-minute mark. The band plays with heads down, never taking time for solos or anything that registers as a chorus. If you're not paying much attention, the tracks bleed into one another and feel like one long rush of effects-pedal rumble and chunky riffage.</p>
<p>Nothing during these first few songs is all that memorable, but it's always impressive that they're able to work up such furious grooves in such confined spaces, hardly even altering the tempos. This is fun, assured heavy rock, and it gets the job done. But the last two tracks-- the ones where Torche give themselves room to stretch out-- are where <i>Songs for Singles</i> really takes off. ""Face the Wall"" and ""Out Again"" are still very much wheelhouse songs for this band, but they slow down their attack noticeably, letting space and dynamics creep
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
into the guitar-storm. ""Out Again"" is six minutes of relentless pounding, and the band spends its back half abandoning the song-form stuff completely and just vamping hard. It sounds awesome.</p>
<p>With that title, <i>Songs for Singles</i> practically announces itself as a stopgap release, a breather after the breakthrough. If it doesn't shake the earth the way <i>Meanderthal</i> did, it's not really supposed to. But the EP does show that this band remains in fine working condition, and another full-on album from these guys would be a welcome thing indeed. Until then, this will do just fine.</p></div>"|14612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14612-songs-for-singles/|7.4|Tom Breihan

That approach continues here, and it seems to have led them in a more pastoral direction that has more in common with <i>Songs From the Wood</i>-era Jethro Tull and the folkier, jazzier end of 1970s European prog than the heavy psych they referenced on earlier records. Where 2004's great <i>Ta Det Lungt</i> had a fair amount of psychedelic punch, especially in its single, ""Panda"", the music here feels more like a caress.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes sense-- the band's name means ""the Grove,"" after all-- but I'd say the album works best when heard as part of the band's overall output and probably isn't the place to start. The title track (Swedish for ""fuck all"") is the lead single, and the video emphasizes the group's recent ensemble approach, showing them playing while crammed together in a tiny room. Reine Fiske's harmonized lead guitar part is ultra-smooth and occasionally doubled by flute, which makes it interesting as a sonic throwback but also corresponds with the general lack of energy in the song, which is ultimately fairly forgettable rural psych-rock. Fiske fares better when he's let loose, and his instrumental work is one of the album's highlights. His bizarre lead on ""Barnen Undrar"", centered around a creative, siren-like hook, takes the song to another level, while his rough leads on the rhythmic ""Brallor"", one of the album's best songs, add a much-needed crunch, cutting through the sea of reverb. His acid-stained leads on the airy instrumentals ""Högdalstoppen"" and ""Blandband"", which finds him dueting with Ejstes' flute, likewise give those tracks a fire they'd otherwise lack.</p>
<p>""Högdalstoppen"" sounds as though it's a few spliced excerpts of a much larger jam, which tells me that this could have been a much longer, more indulgent record than it is if the band had decided not to keep it to an economical 34 minutes and 10 songs. There are a few surprises-- for instance, Ejstes' double-tracked vocal on ""Soda"" sounds almost exactly like Elliott Smith-- but for the most part, <i>Skit I Allt</i> features a gentler Dungen, one that sounds comfortable as a band and perhaps at a bit of a crossroads as to where to take this sound. People who've appreciated the band's last three albums will find time for this once it has a chance to sink in, but it's not essential for people who got a charge out of <i>Ta Det Lungt</i> and passed on the rest.</p></div>"|14604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14604-skit-i-allt/|6.8|Joe Tangari

After leaving Black Dice to focus on his painting, Blanck returned to music, but veered away from his former band's electronic aesthetic and started writing mostly unplugged folk songs. <i>Alibi Coast</i> came together as Blanck mourned the loss of his brother, who died in a drowning accident in 2007. A reimagination of the mysterious last few months of his brother's life, the album is a sweet and sometimes dark tribute highlighted by guest vocal contributions from Olivia Mori, Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark, Chairlift's Caroline Polachek, and fellow Rare Book Room artist Lia Ices.</p>
<p>Co-produced with Jorge Elbrecht of Violens, the album has a warm, wide-open atmosphere reminiscent of Simon &amp; Garfunkel and, with the help of the female vocalists, the Mamas &amp; the Papas (adding to the effect, Blanck often doubles his own vocal track). These production choices help make Blanck's deeply personal studies on love and death more intimate and accessible. But while there's an undeniably studious musician at work on every track, Blanck's most instrumentally bare-bones and lyrically explicit songs are the least interesting.</p>
<p>Still, hidden among all their slow tempos and saccharine vocal lines are messy details that perhaps speak to the most frustrating and unsettled aspects of the mourning process. Blanck is at his best when he gives himself over to these unresolved, knotted issues, accepting that a song doesn't have to end with an answer. On ""One Sided Town"", the album's dominant breezy tone is replaced halfway with dark, hungry, and uncontrolled electric guitars, wailing, fuzzed-out and feedback-heavy. The lyrics deal with alienation and regret, but in veiled and abstruse ways that invite deeper listening. ""Black Sanded Beach"" features more haunting passages, including moving allusions to death and an attention-grabbing guitar solo that fits right in because the song builds layers gradually to meet it.</p>

collaborators. On the single-worthy ""Answers"", the sharp tambourine percussion and heavier pop influence speak to Polachek's musical background, while the vocally driven ""Don't Let the Darkness Gather Me"" speaks to Stark's. ""Answers"" is another example of ambiguity and complexity working in Blanck's favor. The refrain-- ""The answers that I gave/ Helped to lay the trap that I'm caught in/ The questions that I raised/ Won't help the guilt you feel lessen""-- leaves ample room for the listener to explore and interpret. Blanck's collaboration with Lia Ices, ""Tumbling Skies"", is another standout track featuring her stamp of understated, wandering piano and wounded vocals. It's a lot to ask to share a loss so openly-- not only with listeners but with other musicians. But <i>Alibi Coast</i> is undoubtedly a better album because Blanck was willing to do so.</p></div>"|14607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14607-alibi-coast/|7.0|Liz Colville

In the past three years, the waifish Of Montreal auteur has reinvented himself as a psychedelic Prince, leaving behind the innocent Elephant 6 storybook for a sweaty concoction of synthesizers and seduction. On the masterful <i>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</i>, Barnes battled depression and gave birth to a lascivious Mr. Hyde. Things only got more X-rated on <i>Skeletal Lamping</i>, an overstuffed orgy in both lyrical content and musical density overseen by Barnes' transvestite alter ego, Georgie Fruit. <i>False Priest</i>, the third part of this tarted-up trilogy, shows that Barnes is serious about his new phase, while also suggesting it might have gone stale.</p>
<p>For someone so concerned lately with coupling, Barnes' recording process over this period has been a largely solitary pursuit. <i>False Priest</i> is billed as a more collaborative effort, both on the production end with musical savant Jon Brion and in the spotlighted duets with divas Janelle Monáe and Solange Knowles. The outside influences play the role of Ritalin to Barnes' ADD, but the leaner sound reveals flaws even as it proposes ways to rebuild.</p>
<p>Take the duets, which offer the opportunity for Barnes' R&amp;B fantasy camp to become reality; putting aside the fact that Barnes had already gotten pretty good at singing in duet, or trio, or chorus, with himself. ""Enemy Gene"", with Janelle Monáe, fares better of the two, not surprising given how her <i>The ArchAndroid</i> revealed Monáe as one of the few spirits restless enough to keep pace with Barnes. Turning particle physics and evolutionary biology into pillow talk, the (relatively) subdued track both features and is aptly described by Mellotron. However, Knowles' appearance, ""Sex Karma"", is a straightforward Jacksons pastiche built around the lamest double-entendre in Barnes' career: the John Mayer-esque leer, ""you look like a playground to me.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the duet is less between voices but between the musical palettes of Barnes and Brion, which prove compatible but are clearly differentiated. The letdown is that Brion's influence sounds less collaborative than cosmetic, as though Barnes showed up with a 95% complete album on his laptop and the duo merely set about punching up Of Montreal's characteristically thin sound. Still, the places where Brion's fingerprints (and gear) are most apparent are some of the album's highlights: the Wendy Carlos-style vocoder on the chorus of ""Like a Tourist"", the thicker guitar chug of ""Coquet Coquette"" and ""Famine Affair"", the lush, astral coda of ""Our Riotous Defects"".</p>
<p>But the first part of ""Our Riotous Defects"", handcuffed by funny-once spoken-word, is one of several indications that this Of Montreal era is running on fumes. The most enticing aspects of the band's R&amp;B are the places where it deviates from the recipe: its acidic, self-loathing undercurrent, its sugar-high unpredictability. Barnes' tongue isn't quite as sharp on <i>False Priest</i>, and all the shock value has worn off of falsetto-funk tracks such as ""Hydra Fancies"" or ""I Feel Ya' Strutter"".</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry about Of Montreal, as they've proven themselves more than capable of evolving. The distance from their early tales of wax museums and mad scientists to Barnes' electro-glam hedonism is immense, but the switch produced an unlikely second, higher peak in the band's career. If <i>False Priest</i> signals that we may be on the downhill side of that summit, it may also contain the embryonic stages of the next ascent, just as 2005's <i>The Sunlandic Twins</i> contained the seeds of Barnes' metamorphosis. Should budget allow, a truer collaboration with Brion could speed the arrival of Of Montreal Mk. III, but it might also be time for Barnes to find his muse outside of the bedroom.</p></div>"|14640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14640-false-priest/|6.7|Rob Mitchum

What made that record so fresh and engaging, though, wasn't its crystal-ball nature; it was Díaz-Reixa's disorienting, drum-heavy style and use of repetition. Sheets of pounding rhythm, joy-packed vocals making every structural shift sound like a parade turning a street corner-- El Guincho knows repetition can be bliss, but he also knows (unlike many of his followers these days) that bliss doesn't have to sound so goddamn boring.</p>
<p><i>Alegranza!</i>'s formula seemed as if it would benefit from further refinement-- which is why it's more than a little disappointing that <i>Pop Negro</i>, Díaz-Reixa's follow-up, ditches said formula almost entirely. Instead of feeling warm and a little bit lived-in, the songs here sound relatively chilly and fussy. The percussive elements are more conventionally linear-- less a full-on rhythmic assault-- and the song structures are frequently disjointed and fidgety, as if he had trouble in staying in one place for very long.</p>
<p>This new approach ends up working a few times<i></i>, most successfully on opening track and lead single ""Bombay"", which carries more than a little bit of a Balearic bounce in the steel drum hits that vibe under Reixa's expressive melodic phrasing. ""FM Tan Sexy"" embodies at least two of the words in the title (guess which ones) with a taut backbeat and sliding sighs, while ""Ghetto Fácil"" and ""Novias"" aim upward with tropical effervescence.</p>
<p>More often than not, though, the restlessness of <i>Pop Negro</i> cements its mediocrity. Too often, Reixa works himself into an enjoyable groove that is then disrupted by melodic transitions so ill-fitting they seem nearly discordant. There's some good ideas in these songs-- see: the carnival chorus of ""Soca Del Eclipse"", the ocarina'd fluttering of ""Lycra Mistral""-- but all the clutter and overstuffed arrangements (really, every time a saxophone shows up here, it doesn't work) seem designed to ensure that those ideas only half-stick before sliding down the wall. Indeed, <i>Pop Negro </i>feels transitional. El Guincho has a clear abundance of talent; he simply didn't harness it this time around.</p></div>"|14637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14637-pop-negro/|6.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

And you might note the potential tongue-in-cheek hubris in calling his follow-up <i>Album of the Year </i>and assume that he feels untouchable now. But the self-congratulatory name of his new release is deceptive. The year in question isn't the 2010 that the drop date places its contention in, though anyone who loved <i>Tronic </i>or hard-bumping, densely expressive hip hop in general wouldn't be off base in considering it as a candidate. The title is actually more closely connected to a different year: 2009, when Black Milk lost his close friend,  Village's Baatin, and saw his manager HexMurda go through a life-threatening experience after a stroke left him comatose.</p>
<p>""'09, hardest year in my lifeline,"" he admits in leadoff track ""365"", and you can hear the evidence in this album. But it's not some morose attempt to dwell on a rough period-- it's more like the product of a deeply determined effort to persevere through it all. Some artists redouble their work efforts when they're confronted by trying times, as though hours spent over a notebook or an MPC is the one thing that'll keep them centered. And whether or not that's what pushed Black Milk to another solid album, it's clear he came out of his time in the studio with something more to him: an even tighter grasp on his production-auteur approach.</p>
<p>That approach stretches out a bit more in ambition, even as the sonic imprint becomes more recognizably his. <i>Album of the Year </i>might be called his acid-soul record: ""Gospel Psychedelic Rock"" practically asks for that tag, but its Westbound-era Funkadelic allusions and heavy R&amp;B mood are echoed throughout the album. And it's a logical progression from his previous work, whether placed up front (the metallic funk of ""Keep Going""; ""Distortion"" and its reverbed, congealed-mercury wah-wah) or woven into beats that recall <i>Tronic</i>'s digital pulses and the rich analog bass. In his work with straight-up samples, like when he reconstitutes Blackrock's garage-funk monster ""Blackrock Yeah Yeah"" for ""Deadly Medley"", he translates a dusty cratedigger discovery into one of his characteristic headknock beats while amplifying the strengths of the source material. And when he brings in live-band musicians to complete his compositions-- drummer Daru Jones and keyboard player AB chief amongst them-- it all snaps into a deep-breathing focus worthy of the latest Roots record.</p>
<p>There's a lot of sprawled-out jamminess to those tracks, and at their best-- like the understated Afrobeat inflections of ""Round of Applause"" and the sun-drenched guitar in closer ""Final Chapter""-- they ride out in a way that reveals a certain synergy between the way Black Milk approaches rapping and the way he builds beats. There's a real musicality to his flow, and he raps like a producer in that it's hard to tell whether he tailors his voice to his backing tracks or vice versa. He does sound a bit more comfortable riding a sparse groove than a busy one; the wall-to-wall drum fills of ""Keep Going"" make his voice push like a sprinter trying to charge through knee-high surf, while sparser cuts like the electro-soul ""Welcome (Gotta Go)"" foreground it in a way that makes it the strongest, most elastic piece of percussion. Either way, he's got enough authority to thread his voice into a rhythm in a way that takes it over, and enough confidence in the beats themselves to let their outros ride out unaccompanied for a good minute or so.</p>
<p>As a lyricist, Black Milk's typically come across as a man who makes being down-to-earth sound like a source of strength. And while there was an unspectacular battle-rap anonymity to his past lyrics, they were at least spit in the service of a strong overall style. Now he's grown a bit, upping the emotional dimension subtly and letting some more specific humanistic details come through, even in the lines that read like average boasts on paper. There's still plenty of quoteworthy moments that serve equal measures of acrobatic internal rhymes (""Coolest flow, signal to my crew the cue to go/ With they fingers on triggers, gunpowder under cuticles"") and rib-jabbing punchlines that might risk some eye-rolls. But they wouldn't mean as much if they weren't coming from a man who now drops them in the service of working through some heavy thoughts, dealing with the trials in his life (""Distortion"") and the perseverance that helped him get through it (""Final Chapter"") in a way that only makes the triumph sound that much more rewarding.</p></div>"|14619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14619-album-of-the-year/|7.5|Nate Patrin

Like that disaster, Everything Everything's debut LP, <i>Man Alive</i>,<i> </i>is proof that enthusiastic experimentation can't save your end product when the underlying elements are so incompatible and unappetizing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even before you consider their name, song titles like ""My Kz, Ur Bf"", ""Qwerty Finger"", and ""Photoshop Handsome"" imply EE are a product of media overload and social-networking culture-- the self-absorbed musical equivalent of having 12 browsers open at the same time. To apparently a lot of people this is a good thing. (Sample prerelease hype: EE sound like the Futureheads <i>and </i>Animal Collective.) But stuffing everything humanly possible into your songs can be overwhelming, if not identity-sapping.<span> </span>The first 10 or so seconds of this record is pretty much the only span with any negative space-- and even that resembles the obelisk-staring intro of Coldplay's ""Square One"".<span> </span>From there on, <i>Man Alive </i>is jacked up with bizarre key changes, superfluous time-signature switches, electro noodling, and half-rap lyrics delivered in run-on melodies, and you ultimately think, ""hey, what would happen if Dismemberment Plan got a crash course in Pro Tools and a record deal with Fueled By Ramen?""<span> </span>Everything Everything aren't afraid to answer those tough questions.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">All jokes aside, it actually is an interesting gambit to find a continuum within all of those coordinates in terms of bands interacting with personal computing-- after all, D-Plan had a frontman who was essentially a poptimist blogger before we knew what to call it.<span> </span>But even crediting Everything Everything's unclassifiable combination of itchy art-rock, pop-locking electro, and straight-up Brit indie to musical omnivorism, there's a problem that is impossible to get around: If anyone's got a more irritating voice than Jonathan Everything, they probably also have a harp and a few good stories to tell.<span> </span>It's not the constant falsetto that's the problem-- Passion Pit and the Darkness had that, but they also owned their own ridiculousness (not to mention songwriting chops). Jonathan Everything merely inflicts wispy, intrusive papercuts on your eardrums.<span> </span>Hearing it for the first time is akin to seeing a roach-- unpleasant and unexpected, but then you start to worry about where you'll find the next one.<span> </span>And <i>Man Alive </i>is absolutely infested.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And yet, I'd still recommend at least a cursory shot at ""My Kz, Ur Bf"", because even if it's a particularly annoying song and you can't quite pick out whether Everything is seeking to get caught <i>in flagrante</i> with your boyfriend or your girlfriend, it does have something of a pleasant whiff of 90s alternative radio.<span> </span>Granted, it comes on way too strong and is a complete mess, but it's certainly <i>their <span style=""font-style: normal;"">mess.</span><span> </span></i>Credit Everything Everything for finding their own niche, but it's one that's been unoccupied for good reason.</p></div>"|14611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14611-man-alive/|3.8|Ian Cohen

(Never mind the fact that its most prominent mouthpieces-- Kyuss' John Garcia, Monster Magnet's Dave Wyndorf-- sounded like they'd rather start a bar brawl than smoke a bowl.) Upon their 2007 formation, Toronto's Quest for Fire were quickly stamped with the stoner-rock tag, no thanks to their longstanding association with Black Mountain (QFF singer/guitarist Chad Ross was once their roadie) and their signing to Tee Pee Records, a long-time facilitator of fellow wah-wah-pedal abusers. But compared to the muscular, magma-thick riffage that has come to define the genre, Quest for Fire's sophomore release, <i>Lights From Paradise</i>, is less stoner rock than stoned rock, marked by a patient pace and a foggy-headed whimsy that lingers even as the VU levels surge into the red.</p>
<p>The members of Quest for Fire all have roots in loud, raucous rock bands (most notably Ross and guitarist Andrew Gunn in the Deadly Snakes and drummer Mike Maxymuik in metal-core thrashers Cursed), but more so than their 2009 self-titled debut, <i>Lights From Paradise</i> posits Quest for Fire as an outlet through which they can explore more sonically expansive, texturally rich modes of composition. Where the band introduced themselves on their debut with the strobe-lit psych-punk stomp ""Bison Eyes"", <i>Lights From Paradise</i> immediately distinguishes itself with the slow-percolating, seven-minute ""The Greatest Hits By God"", which leavens its caveman rumble with foreboding violin swells (courtesy of Godspeed veteran Sophie Trudeau) in a manner that suggests Spacemen 3 by way of Constellation Records. The longer tracks on the album (""Confusion's Home"", ""Sessions of Light"") exhibit a similar restraint-- they may get progressively louder and more intense over their extended durations, but they never accelerate or derail; their intent is to envelop rather than overpower.</p>
<p>It's thus fitting that Quest for Fire's definitive quality is also their least pronounced: Ross' drowsy David Gilmour-ian drawl, which never rises above a breathy sigh. While that means his voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the sounds swirling around him-- particularly when QFF revert back to acid-rock rager mode on ""Set Out Alone"" and ""In the Place of a Storm""-- it also makes him an effective harbinger of calm-before-the-storm unease; even the disquieting build-up of ""Hinterland Who's Who"" provides scant preparation for the monstrous, fuzz-metal attack unleashed in its closing stretch. So as it turns out, Quest for Fire are actually a stoner-rock band in the truest sense of the term-- one that understands every buzz is fleeting, and that the most blissful high is inevitably answered by the cruelest of come-downs.</p></div>"|14638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14638-lights-from-paradise/|7.3|Stuart Berman

Sure, when the band debuted, a huge share of conversation revolved around the other acts they sounded like. But no matter how familiar any of the parts were, the band had welded them together into a whole that was instantly recognizable and easy to grasp-- they'd carved out the simple, narrow box of how an Interpol song worked, and they could put it across clearly, quickly, and thrillingly. Maybe the suits they wore were supposed to say something about style, but they also said something about professionalism: This was a band with a clear agenda, and they were all business about it, every last detail engineered to work. And it <i>did</i> work, which led the band to great success and only one little problem: Their box is a small one, and it's been difficult for them to sneak out of it.</p>
<p>That dilemma's surely not lost on them. This self-titled album is their last recorded with Carlos D.-- the bass player whose sense of pacing was the secret motor of their best work-- and one of the good things about it is that it's very honest. It's an album about exhaustion, confusion, the hollowness of success, the bitter feeling of having few options worth chasing, and the realization that endlessly satisfying your own desires can turn you into a pretty shitty person. Paul Banks' lyrics seem preoccupied with what kind of man he's turned out to be, from the declaration, ""I'm a good guy,"" to a song actually subtitled ""The Man I Am"". He kicks off the album by announcing that he's found success, but he doesn't sound remotely pleased about it.</p>
<p>Elsewhere he's pleading for someone to just tell him what to do, because his own desires are leading him in the wrong directions. The songs keep skirting away from hooks and tension in favor of still air, exhausted drizzles of guitar, and portentous piano figures; the big hooks and builds they <i>do</i> try out seem all the more half-hearted and workmanlike, surrounded as they are by the sound of a band wondering why it bothers trying anything in the first place. The whole thing sounds like the eighth day of an endless party where everyone's already slept together, burned themselves out on drugs that used to be fun, and developed systems of grudges and resentments that make it barely worth talking to one another. And yet the party goes on and there they sit, sighing bitterly while confetti pours down and the drinks go around.</p>
<p>The problem is that the music <i>feels</i> that way, too-- and who'd have thought that this band, of all bands, would miss the mark on a bleak, depressive album? Plenty of great records have been made from this end-of-the-rope feeling; I'm pretty confident the members of Interpol own a few by the Cure. And it'd be the height of arrogance to suggest that Interpol should be making records about feelings other than the ones they have. It's just that, as a listener, it's easy to get the feeling that any other version of this band-- happy Interpol, smarmy Interpol, pissed-off Interpol, the tense-and-edgy Interpol of their debut-- would be more entertaining to listen to than the tapped-out, unsure act that shows up here, sounding like people who have come to loathe certain motions but can't stop going through them.</p>
<p>The good news is that they're too skilled, experienced, and important to make a record that's just a mess, and for a while there's nothing so terrible about this one. In its first half, songs are carefully assembled; ""Summer Well"" packs some gorgeous hooks; the band's rhythm section is always a treat; and if nothing else there's always that singular Interpol atmosphere, the pure sound of a group a lot of us will always like hearing. That sound is compelling enough to keep someone searching for a secret payoff to this record, some dark heart to sink into. The problems here, though, aren't in execution-- they're more existential. Cross over into the wrecked second half, and every song makes this sound more like an album that's not really ready to seethe, not really cathartic, not really full of painful hopeless beauty or any of those other things that make bleak records worthwhile. With every listen it just sounds like more of a fucking <i>drag</i>. For a moment, ""All of the Ways"" seems like it's prepared to lean into its own feelings of helplessness, and turn into the kind of desolate, bottomless song that feels good to fall into-- but then Banks can't help trying to sing it into something grand, trudging hopelessly through the same old routine. The ninth day of the party.</p>
<p>It's too bad. The album is asking honest and important questions about disillusionment. What do you do when you can have too much of what you want? What do you do when you get it and find you don't want it anymore? How do you manage your own desires and turn out a decent person? The songs might be more enjoyable if they seemed to present some glimmer of an answer, or at least some consolation-- if it could convince you that this, this music right here, was the payoff for all the agonizing, not just another job that's barely worth doing.</p></div>"|14641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14641-interpol/|4.6|Nitsuh Abebe

Not all of us could be there to experience No Wave, SST-era Sonic Youth, or My Bloody Valentine as actual recording artists firsthand, but as Blonde Redhead stated on their 1997 album, <i>Fake Can Be Just As Good</i>. The group has always strived to be a gateway to cool and, as such, would probably take it as a compliment to suggest they never sounded like they could've been from anywhere other than New York.</p>
<p>That comes to an end on <i>Penny Sparkle</i>, an album whose quest to evoke a more comfortable point in our collective lives almost qualifies it as chillwave. Yet it's not the sound of ""the beach"" or ""youth"" that <i>Penny Sparkle </i>embodies, but rather our last economic boom period, a time that inspired countless chill-out compilations and dubious record deals from labels who swear they found their more radio-friendly Portishead. If you happen to be a music coordinator for Banana Republic, <i>Penny Sparkle </i>is an early Christmas gift. For everyone else, you're left to wonder whether 2010 will produce a more profoundly boring album from a band who actually had a reputation to uphold.</p>
<p>This shift doesn't come wholly unexpectedly-- songs like ""The Dress"", ""My Impure Hair"", and ""Heroine"" leaned toward pillowy electro-balladry, but they served as important contrast between the <i>Loveless </i>worship. Here, it's the only side of the story being told, and it's being told with the kind of BPMs that could knock out a speed addict. This kind of stuff is derisively called background music, and rightfully so, since every member of Blonde Redhead here sounds afraid to step forward. Singer Kazu Makino is almost exclusively merely casting shadows over everything, and transitions from verses to choruses are merely implied. This is not the kind of stuff you need to hire Alan Moulder to mix for you.</p>
<p>Outside of a distorted vocal on ""Not Getting There"" and a slowly blooming and surprisingly gripping waltz (""Everything Is Wrong""), the arrangements seem done up like hospital rooms, every sound picked for maximum sterility. If you're in a forgiving mood, you can liken it to a chloroformed late-90s Depeche Mode or an honestly failed attempt at the frosted sensuality of <i>Vespertine</i>. If you're in a realistic mood, you'll hear Amedeo Pace carelessly whispering through the soft-focus reggae of ""Will There Be Stars"" and imagine Roxy Music stuck on a Carnival cruise.</p>
<p><i>Penny Sparkle </i>could be approached from a cynical perspective, an admission that after 15 years, Blonde Redhead have realized they'll never be called ""like <i>Loveless, </i>but <i>better</i>,"" and have decided to work in a field that isn't exactly brimming with luminaries. But there's a right way (see: School of Seven Bells' <i>Disconnect From Desire</i>) and a wrong way (see: the nearly identical shift of Asobi Seksu's <i>Hush</i>)<i> </i>to reconcile your shoegaze past with downtempo, pre-2k electronic pop: and a big part of the trick is that if you're going to drop the big, whooshy guitars, it helps to remember it was the vigorous <i>Ray of Light </i>that went multi-platinum, not Morcheeba.</p></div>"|14609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14609-penny-sparkle/|4.0|Ian Cohen

Stingley in 1965. The Beach Boys dropped <i>Pet Sounds</i> in May of 1966. Wham-O sold over six million SuperBalls by December of that year, and <i>Pet Sounds</i> will forever remain, in these halls and elsewhere, a Really Big Deal. Both are American pop touchstones in their own right, exactly the kind of iconic, immediate imagery (see also: ""Summer"" and ""Candy"") and sounds with which the Memphis outfit has been playing since they formed in early 2009. But as much as Magic Kids lean on Brian Wilson and Phil Spector for sonic cues-- they like shine, smooth textures, and cinematic transitions-- their music aims to stir up the feelings you felt the first time you kissed, crushed, and played games, the first time you heard ""God Only Knows"".</p>
<p><i>Memphis</i>, their debut LP, bottles all of that up with remarkable skill, but often to disappointing effect. Its many flourishes are much more satisfying than its songs, each dissolving on contact no matter how much buoyancy or sugar they boast for stretches. Opener ""Phone Song"" is a great, two-minute example. Strings quake. Guitars gleam. The horns are exactly where they should be, and over a mattress of synth, frontman Bennett Foster places himself next to a phone waiting for a girl to call. We're much more familiar with that image than we are with Foster, and as instantly accessible as the blueprint is, Foster doesn't make the formula his own. Just as he does in the sprint of ""Superball"" or the schooner romance ""Sailin'"", he doesn't throw his personality or memory into the fray, choosing to work instead with childhood cut outs. Think for a second on Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, who has made listeners either swoon or yawn when belting almost exclusively about boys and heartache. Cosentino, whether you think it's lazy or hilarious, has also made enough use of weed and cat and beach references to lend her pastiche its own spin, to create her own world within her music.</p>
<p>But while Magic Kids' arrangements almost always sparkle, there's little tension and release to bind them all together, leaving us instead with a salad of major chords. It requires more digging. ""Skateland"" features a fantastic sense of drama: woodwinds float over rumbling tympani, a piano pulses, and in and out, from time to time, an overdriven guitar solo adds another muscle for moving. Before that, album standout ""Hey Boy"" adds a wild card in the form of a floozy and some wild insecurity. ""My steady girl/ Don't always say,"" Foster begins, ""That she's in love with me/ But I can feel in the way/ She gives me hugs and kisses too/ And I get so many I don't need any from you."" At which point, alongside some sax and a piledriving snare beat, he starts assuring backup vocalist Alice Buchanan that his girl's no liar. Nope. All those other guys she's always talking to are just friends. The narrative bursts with an energy that matches the swerve and verve of its song, in a way that can't be found easily on <i>Memphis</i>. It all pops together at once. It sticks.</p></div>"|14636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14636-memphis/|6.1|David Bevan

But their reunion also seemed like a ""fuck it, why not?"" move. The Glasgow-based duo of Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly were never exactly careerists-- it's not their problem that Nirvana covered three of their songs-- and their 2008-2009 tour seemed like a one-off frolic rather than any kind of commitment or cash-in.</p>
<p>Yet here they are again, backed up by members of Belle and Sebastian and the 1990s, and produced by Jamie Watson (who recorded them the first time around, too). The album's got a cute title, with the double meaning of ""check out how hot we are"" and ""hooking up again with the person you used to date."" Almost any of these simple two-riff, verse-chorus songs would have made a perfectly acceptable addition to their original records (and they're better than anything either Kelly or McKee has come up with since they broke up); in particular, ""I Hate the 80's"" is a welcome bit of grumpy oldsterism and ""Turning It On"" is built on juicy love/hate sentiments. The band's twanging, strummy arrangements and McKee and Kelly's bedroom-eyed thrust-and-parry are exactly like they were the first time around.</p>
<p>That's what's disconcerting about <i>Sex with an X</i>. Significant artistic development of any kind probably would've been a bad idea for this band-- they were, as the saying goes, small but perfectly formed. Still, it's also not quite satisfying to hear 40-year-olds come back to what they were doing half their lifetime ago and approach it exactly the same way. Pretend the album was recorded at the same sessions as 1989's <i>Dum-Dum</i>, and it's a kick. But it wasn't.</p>
<p>It's instructive to compare the Vaselines to the Pastels, their contemporaries and scenemates (with whom Kelly also played). The Pastels also started off with a focus on untamed youth and speed and simplicity, and gradually came to abandon all of those things in favor of what made them distinctive: the chalk and grit of their voices and the smoky drift of their songs. Kelly and McKee, on the other hand, treat the Vaselines as a vehicle for a particular sound and attitude. They've got their formula, and they're sticking to it, whether or not it's got anything more to yield. ""Feels so good it must be bad for me/ Let's do it, let's do it again,"" they sing on the title track. They know perfectly well that what they're doing is retrograde and maybe even beneath them, and it's hard to blame them, because it's the best they've ever had anyway.</p></div>"|14631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14631-the-vaselines-sex-with-an-x/|6.9|Douglas Wolk

So begins another Boduf Songs LP (the fourth), with another deadpan fantasy about grievous bodily harm. If you're already acquainted with the project, welcome back to doom-folk machine Mat Sweet's morally ambivalent universe of violence, despair, and, not incidentally, loveliness. And if you're new to these parts... hope you're not squeamish about blood.</p>
<p>That's (mostly) a joke. Sweet's rarely macabre for macabre's sake; there's a ritualistic aspect to his recurring lyrical motifs and iterative acoustic arpeggios that suggests the Southampton, England home recorder calls up death and darkness in pursuit of life and light. Never was this more apparent than on Boduf Songs' last record, <i>How Shadows Chase the Balance</i>, where ever-bleak themes were bleached by shimmering melodies, swifter tempos, and cautiously optimistic soundscapes. Compared with <i>Shadows</i>, <i>This Alone Above All Else in Spite of Everything</i>'s relative sobriety initially suggests Sweet's retreated to his full-bore brooding ways. In addition to the aforequoted opener, there's the haunted trudge of ""Absolutely Null and Utterly Void"", and purgatorial plod of ""The Giant Umbilical Cord That Connects Your Brain to the Centre"".</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: Those are good songs. Sweet's got a sneaky gift for composition and a rare talent for selling material that in lesser hands would probably flop. But it's great to find that Boduf Songs have expanded their palette and accepted a few new risks, too. That's an honest-to-god backbeat in ""They Get on Slowly""'s mix, and Sweet switches out his standard library hush for actual singing on Radiohead-reminiscent ""I Have Decided to Pass Through Matter"" (he should sing like that more often). But the real revelation here is ""Decapitation Blues"", a zombie tale that winningly segues from Pantha du Prince-flavored oscillating bell tones to funky dance figure to post-rock jam.</p>
<p>Such minor change-ups might seem ho-hum coming from a four-member band of cross-pollinating players working with different producers on every new release. But Boduf Songs is real home-grown, small-budget solo stuff. And considering Sweet has carved an interesting, comfortable niche for himself, it's pretty amazing that he hasn't painted himself into a solipsistic corner. As long as he's okay sharing space with demons, so are we.</p></div>"|14630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14630-this-alone-above-all-else-in-spite-of-everything/|7.2|Amy Granzin

For about a decade now, they've turned their albums into symphonies of disappointment and resentment and regret. Their proudest moments, then, are also their most down-and-out. Their best song, ""The Rat"", is a world-weary, old-before-its-time rager, a song from a young guy seeing that he's already falling out of step with the universe and feeling pissed about it. Their second-best song, ""In the New Year"", sounds triumphant and optimistic at first, but on further listens it reveals itself to be as much a plea as anything else, a secular prayer that shit just please start working out right. The specific brand of desperation that the band conjures is miles away from, say, the throbbing, dread-laced depression of fellow dapper New Yorkers the National. The Walkmen are more theatrical and unwound than that-- they're the guys out in the middle of the street, screaming up at the sky, begging to know why everything always falls apart.</p>
<p>In that elegantly disheveled mutter-wail thing of his, frontman Hamilton Leithauser starts new album <i>Lisbon</i> off by singing: ""You're with someone else tomorrow night/ Doesn't matter to me/ 'Cause as the sun dies into the hill/ You got all I need."" He's sad and pathetic and needy and yet somehow still <i>smooth</i>, which is sort of the central animating paradox at the heart of the Walkmen. They make these wounded, anxious songs, but they make them so <i>confidently</i>, with such unearthly rich-guy assurance. The band's specific style of indie rock is very rooted in a scrappy, scratchy New York tradition that dates back to the Velvet Underground or Bob Dylan, but their take on it is theirs and theirs alone. You know one of their songs right away when those winding, circular guitars and surging drums and gargling vocals kick in. They're so performative in their sadness, but that stuff never rankles or comes off tantrumy, since the band is just <i>so good</i> at this stuff. There's a song on <i>Lisbon</i> called ""Woe Is Me"", and it's not even remotely a joke. Great song, too.</p>
<p>This is a band that cares deeply about things like microphone placement, and so everything sounds just unbelievably crisp and warm-- except when it's not supposed to, as on the purposefully weird, strangulated two-minute panic attack ""Follow the Leader"". And even though they sound very much like themselves throughout, there are some great variations in here. ""Stranded"" uses beaten-down mariachi horns to massively graceful effect. ""Victory"" (which, naturally, is about <i>never achieving</i> victory) has the same sort of blood-pounding chorus that ""The Rat"" does. ""Torch Song"" is a song <i>about</i> a song, about not knowing the right song to ""calm down all the madness,"" but the amber <i>Twin Peaks</i> Angelo Badalamenti fuzz on the track is just heart-stopping gorgeous. The Walkmen know what they're doing here.</p>
<p>In early interviews, Leithauser claimed that <i>Lisbon</i> got its sonic inspiration from ancestral Sun Records rockabilly. That influence never makes itself overtly known, but there are a few slick little old-school nods here and there, like the relentless Tennessee Three train-chug rhythm on ""Blue as Your Blood"", or the <i>ahh-ahh</i> backing vocals on ""All My Great Designs"". More than that, there's an economic speed and simplicity at work here; the songs might be reflective self-lacerating wallows, but they're <i>fast</i> wallows. Drummer Matt Barrick tends to play just off the beat, but he hits his drums just incredibly hard, with the sort of crisp wallop you feel in your teeth fillings. On the album's big, transcendent, loud moments, his crash cymbals sound like fists raining down on you from heaven, and he's still very much a force even on the quieter songs.</p>
<p>And that brings us to ""Angela Surf City"", the song on this album that deserves a place alongside ""The Rat"" and ""In the New Year"". It starts off tense and withdrawn, Leithauser singing about some relationship without ever letting us in on what, exactly, is going on. Underneath, there's a tense, withdrawn surf-rock beat. And when the chorus starts to well up, the music underneath keeps surging upward, becoming huger than anything the song should be able to handle, then getting even huger from there, as Barrick lets off relentless Bonham-level thundercracks. Leithauser sings guarded, terse stuff that I don't necessarily understand, but he wails it so hard that it comes out anthemic: ""You took the <i>high</i> road! I couldn't <i>find</i> you!"" The Walkmen play with restraint, and they don't usually allow themselves earth-shaking moments like that. But when those moments come, they're enough to send you spinning.</p></div>"|14605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14605-lisbon/|8.6|Tom Breihan

Beginning with the comparatively muted <i>Melody A.M.</i> in 2001 and continuing through to 2005's brighter, bolder <i>The Understanding</i>, Röyksopp fully blossomed into electro-pop impresarios with last year's <i>Junior</i>, sculpting alternately effervescent and melancholic synthesized soundscapes to accompany an expressive cadre of female singers. Looser than Air or Zero 7 yet less all-over-the-map than Basement Jaxx, Röyksopp seemed to have found their niche and hit their stride, crafting danceable, emotionally satisfying techno-pop that's neither too tasteful nor too garish.</p>
<p>It took Röyksopp, always busy remixing other artists, nearly four years to follow up <i>Melody A.M.</i> with <i>The Understanding </i>and another four to unveil <i>Junior</i>, so the release of <i>Senior</i> after a scant 18 months already suggests it's a different sort of beast. Following three albums of increasingly accessible pop, <i>Senior</i> is an entirely instrumental effort, and a moody, slowly unfurling one at that. Taken as a resolutely minor work, it yields a favorable amount of correspondingly minor charms, but there's also no mistaking that it neutralizes much of the momentum Röyksopp have gradually been building up over the past several years.</p>
<p>Röyksopp's previous albums have all been peppered with instrumental cuts, typically serving as palate cleansers or interstitial tissue to subtly strengthen the album's effect as a whole. Yet a whole LP of interstitials isn't the sort of thing that can stand on its own. The kind of downtempo stuff that makes up the majority of Röyksopp's vocal-less compositions just doesn't hold up to concentrated, repeated listens like many other forms of instrumental electronic music (techno, post-disco, wonky, etc.). Its ruminative nature is at odds with rhythmic propulsion and rarely delivers much of a ""wow"" factor. At the same time, it also lacks the precise, engrossing intricacy Four Tet or Caribou exhibit in their oft-contemplative efforts.</p>
<p>What we get instead is largely an album of langorous, meditative cuts, the best of which-- ""The Alcoholic"", ""Senior Living"", ""Forsaken Cowboy"", ""Coming Home""-- succeed by sending fragile, melancholic synth and guitar melodies loping across lush, atmospheric sonic floors. Unfortunately, over a third of the record's running time is wasted on the meandering ""The Drug"", ponderous ""The Fear"" and a pointless instrumental redux of <i>Junior</i>'s ""Tricky Tricky"". It can't be said that <i>Senior</i> fails to meet its modest wallpaper-ish aims, yet it hardly represents the best Röyksopp has to offer.</p></div>"|14624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14624-senior/|6.0|Joshua Love

More than a year and a half ago, one half of haze&amp;B dance duo Teengirl Fantasy, Nick Weiss, dropped a similarly slowed down take on Mariah Carey's ""Touch My Body"". It's more of a mission statement than a remix; even the most devout Mariah fan wouldn't be able to place the source material. Talking about the redo, Weiss said, ""I'll just be listening to a song on the radio and be like, 'This would sound cool if there was no high-end or if it was played at half-speed.' It's like a kick in the back of your head telling you how you want to hear a pop song."" That same perverting principle runs through Teengirl Fantasy's debut album, <i>7AM</i>, which has Weiss and his Oberlin College buddy Logan Takahashi working out nine tracks of gulping bass, forgotten R&amp;B samples, and diffusive synth flutters.</p>
<p>Teengirl fall in line with a current crop of very sharp twentysomething dudes who can't help but mess with the pop, R&amp;B, and dance music they grew up with. People like UK dubstep-soul guru James Blake, Keith Sweat-adoring no-fi crooner How to Dress Well, and fellow Oberlin pair Blondes are all filtering searing musical memories through their defraction lenses. It's not just that they don't have the means to replicate the top-notch production of their beat-based idols-- they don't want to. It's not a knee-jerk response against yesteryear's hits as much as an open-minded exploration of those songs' more spaced-out possibilities. ""I definitely think it's cool to go back and put the past together in any way that I want,"" Takahashi told me. Teengirl Fantasy's particular strategy for making non-club kids move picks and chooses bits of funked Chicago house, island-breeze Balearic beats, and sultry soul à la Sade. Everything comes out more liquid; the opener is called ""Vibes"", and its name corresponds with a floating vagueness that runs through much of the album.</p>
<p>While <i>7AM</i>'s half-remembered intangibility is at least intriguing on most tracks, the album often gets caught in a limbo where the blurriness becomes an unfortunate end to itself. ""In an Area"", ""In the Rain"", and ""Make the Move"" all get stuck in this zone and drag down the record's first half. But then the duo offer two glimpses of the potential of their sound. ""Four to Floor"" bounces on the sort of bassline a tranquilized R. Kelly may dream up. Joyous vocal samples whiz by and, suddenly, Teengirl are making good on their promise to revamp the past. Then it leads into the record's centerpiece, unanimous high point, and year-end contender.</p>
<p>Tellingly, ""Cheaters"" has Weiss and Takahashi taking a more background role while letting a stunning vocal sample of 70s disco-funk group Love Committee do most of the hard work. The throat-stretching, heart-bursting vox were originally attached to a bulbous, uptempo track. But recontextualized amidst Teengirl's foggy house throb, they finally sound at home more than 30 years after their initial recording. ""Cheaters"" is one of too few songs on <i>7AM</i> that offers a concrete anchor for Teengirl to work around, and it suggests they may benefit by cutting through their own haze more often in order to let those dreamy memories ring clearer. The song is the best thing this duo has ever done by a daunting degree-- whether it'll end up as a fluke or a breakthrough is tantalizingly uncertain.</p></div>"|14635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14635-7am/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

That makes it one of the Finnish producer's earliest releases, and it sounds like the work of a young artist trying to find his own aesthetic, tentatively combining a bunch of hot-in-'99 sounds like the dub techno of Chain Reaction and the early microhouse of Perlon. Halfway between a murky chill-out record and something pitched at the dancefloor, <i>Sistol</i> lacks for the craft or innovation or individualism of the records that inspired Ripatti in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Sistol</i> is juvenilia, and if you're familiar with it, you'll wonder why Ripatti even revived the moniker for <i>On the Bright Side</i>. For one thing, this album sounds nothing like its predecessor. And not just in the sense that Ripatti has grown more confident as a producer over the last 11 years. The very materials he used to make <i>Sistol</i>-- the muffled bass, gently ticking beats, and blurry ambient textures-- are nowhere to be found here. In fact, he's gone in the complete opposite direction.</p>
<p>For <i>On the Bright Side</i>, Ripatti draws from the rawness of the analog, bleep-and-bass techno that swept Northern England at the turn of the 90s-- loud and industrial-tinged rave that could never be mistaken for ambient or micro anything. Releasing this music under the Sistol alias almost feels like Ripatti is being perverse. You were expecting some light, fuzzy avant-techno? Well here's a bunch of sharp-edged bangers.</p>
<p><i>On the Bright Side</i> can be a cold, metallic record, which makes sense considering that it pays homage to the kind of music DJs once played at 3 a.m. in unheated warehouses. Despite Ripatti's deserved rep for lush deep house and softly undulating ambient, we learn he's also got a real knack for rusty jack-your-body drums and buzzsaw rave riffs. What's equally surprising is how well he manages to blend the often stiff and regimented rhythms of bleep-and-bass era techno with his own supple and deeply dub-influenced 21st-century style.</p>
<p><i>On the Bright Side</i> isn't a retro-at-all-costs kind of record. Ripatti didn't run out and buy a bunch of vintage tech in hopes of recreating a specific era down to the last canned hi-hat. Listening, I'd say he's still working digitally, and he captures the vibe of hard Sheffield techno, the brute boom-tick, while also bringing in the liquid syncopations and polyrhythmic layering that 21st-century digital editing makes possible. If you're a fan of bleep acts like Unique 3 and Sweet Exorcist, you'll certainly get a new and unexpected fix from <i>On the Bright Side</i>, but Ripatti also amplifies the latent reggae flavor of bleep by doing things with echo and reverb that would have been impossible with drum machines of 1990.</p>
<p>But there's one thing that definitively separates <i>On the Bright Side</i> from the white-label classics it references: It's not a pop album in any way, shape, or form. Bleep-era acts like LFO and Nightmares on Wax may have loved their steel-bending basslines, but they also loved hooks, be they swooning divas or Kraftwerkian vocoder japes. Despite Ripatti's facility with vocals as Luomo, here he restricts his hooks to minimal synth riffs, short but catchy bursts of blare. So <i>On the Bright Side</i> isn't precisely anti-pop either. It's just a club record, a good one, its appeal ultimately limited to those already down with instrumental techno, but especially those who might be curious as to how one of the 21st century's most adept producers can seamlessly combine old-school with new.</p></div>"|14633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14633-on-the-bright-side/|6.5|Jess Harvell

Instead, you'll be greeted with images of awe-inspiring vistas and crystalline waterfalls captured at Georgia's Cloudland Canyon state park. The connection makes some sense, especially when you consider how different Cloudland Canyon are from other bands in their sphere. On their last release, 2008's <i>Lie In Light</i>, Kip Ulhorn (ex-Panthers) and Simon Wojan (King Khan and the Shrines) erected monolithic walls of sound that suggested warmth, sunlight, and melting landscapes instead of melting faces.</p>
<p>With their fourth proper full-length <i>Fin Eaves</i>, Cloudland Canyon seem set to make you work a little bit harder for your bliss. Here they add additional players and swapping the enveloping production of <i>Lie In Light</i> for scratchy washes of dry noise and stormy atmospherics that contribute a deeper sense of mystery to the project. There is still joy in the project, as something as simple as a rising bassline or a grainy synth layer or even the shake of a tambourine can come across as strangely beautiful. And all this despite the fact that most of <i>Fin Eaves</i> is covered in a light crackle, as if the music were testing positive for radiation. Sometimes this intentional sonic obstruction makes the blooming wooziness underneath feel more seductive than a surface listen would suggest.</p>
<p>The album's more percussive back half alludes to the Jesus and Mary Chain (like on the foggy, disorienting roll of ""Pinklike"", before its clean, electronic coda reveals itself) and labelmates Wooden Shjips (""Mothlight Pt. 2""), but <i>Fin Eaves</i> is most clearly defined by its opening track. ""No One Else Around"" mixes discordant pieces of light humming, corroding electronic bell-tones, junky drums, and waves of arid white noise, and each element collides in a scatterbrained fashion. But over the course of its six minutes, these pieces begin to align and snap together. Throughout <i>Fin Eaves</i>, the kaleidoscopic growth of the tracks feels both natural and chaotic, and you get a good sense of the sounds and patterns evolving.</p>
<p>Sometimes the album's lo-fi and static-ridden production can induce a dulling sensation. As good as something like ""Sister"" already is, you can't help but wonder what a perfect late-night driving song it could be if only that haunting melodica and female vocal had the chance to stand out. But part of the reason why most of <i>Fin Eaves</i> works is because of the close listening required to break into its lush interior.</p></div>"|14610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14610-fin-eaves/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Alas, Robyn is not even close to upper-tier status, despite being responsible for some of the most indelible dance-pop of the past half-decade. ""Be Mine!"", ""With Every Heartbeat"", ""Dancing on My Own""-- in a perfect world these are all global smash hits. (""Heartbeat"" did actually reach no. 1 in the UK.) But for many reasons (being perhaps wrongly pegged and promoted as a leftfield artist, the scattershot nature of the record industry, etc.) she's stuck in a strange netherworld-- embraced by indie fans that adore her but just barely out of reach, or earshot, of the much bigger audience that should.</p>
<div>
<p>This could change, and Robyn seems to be doing everything in her power to make that happen. She'll rock a high-profile performance at this week's VMAs and is dropping not one, not two, but three records this year as part of her <i>Body Talk</i> series. This feels at first like a strange way to release ostensibly one album, but as my colleague Tom Ewing recently pointed out in <i>The Guardian</i>, it actually makes a good deal of sense. It allows her to get songs out quickly as she records them, gives music to fans in easily digestible 30-minute chunks, and ideally beats newcomers over the head to the point that they'll finally take notice.</p>
<p>The first <i>Body Talk</i> installment found Robyn doing what she does best-- drawing great work from various producers, balancing experimentation with craft, and occupying the emotional territory between heartbreak and self-empowerment. <i>Pt. 2</i> steps away from this formula some: the range of sounds and feelings she explores is a good deal thinner, but the album has more spontaneity, attitude, and traditional pop power than its predecessor. Where on <i>Pt. 1</i> Robyn messed around with Jamaican sounds and Swedish folk, here she primarily sticks with the quick-moving, clubby synth-pop that is her calling card.</p>
<p>The album's first half is especially good. Here Robyn sounds fierce and confident, the vulnerability of her previous work mostly absent. One moment she's an encouraging den mother: ""Little star, I got you. You'll be okay"", she tells us on ""In My Eyes"". The next she's an all-inclusive party-starter, repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike: ""This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me"" on ""Include Me Out"". Sonically these tracks are airtight, and you've really got to commend producer Klas Åhlund for his almost workmanlike ability to keep churning out this level of quality. Old pal Kleerup takes the reigns on ""In My Eyes"", which is strong but not his best, and elsewhere Diplo lends a hand with ""Criminal Intent"".</p>
<p>It's here where <i>Pt. 2</i> takes a small-but-noticeable dip in stature from the very high bar Robyn's set with her previous work. Teaming with Diplo worked so well on the sauntering ""Dancehall Queen"" from <i>Pt. 1</i>, but here the collaboration sputters out. ""We Dance to the Beat"" performs the same role as <i>Pt. 1</i>'s ""Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do""-- sort of spoken-word hype-up jam-- and is equally quirky but less brash. The only other complaint about <i>Pt. 2</i> is the lack of a classic single on par with ""Dancing on My Own"" or ""Heartbeat"". The closest we get is ""Hang with Me"". Still, songs like that don't come around all that often, and it might be unreasonable to expect one from her every time out.</p>
<p>Minor quibbles and missteps aside, <i>Body Talk Pt. 2</i> is a perfectly solid-- and occasionally awesome-- record. The surprise jam is Snoop Dogg collaboration ""U Should Know Better"". Dude sounds better than he has in years on this one, his laid-back cadence a perfect counterpoint to the song's grinding synth work. Funny, too, since it's not his only pop duet this summer-- and the insidious ""California Gurls"" is the one that is the global hit. Stand both next to each other and you get a clear illustration of the gulf between Robyn and someone like Katy Perry. No contest. But even if you want to compare her to more legitimate pop stars like La Roux or Lady GaGa, take ""Love Kills"". Aesthetically this song could appear in either of the latter's catalogs, and in either's hands it could be a hit single.</p>
<p>It's got to frustrate Robyn on some level, this disconnect, but she rarely shows it-- she's too cool, having too much fun. And of course there is a strong independent spirit that stems from her bucking of the major-label system back in the mid-2000s that is still very much alive in her music. At one point in the record, though, she seems to address this point directly. ""We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough,"" she blurts out in ""We Dance to the Beat"". The line is mixed in with a bunch of sillier ones about apartment evictions and ""bad kissers clicking teeth,"" but it's hard not to read it as a shot at the mainstream, a statement of purpose, or both.</p>

""I made six studio dates with this group in four years,"" he says. ""And there were some live recordings that I guess Columbia will release when they think they can make the most money-- probably after I'm dead."" I can remember chuckling at that line when reading the book the year of its publication, but it would have been difficult to imagine just how extensive and sustained the Miles Davis reissue program would actually be after his death in 1991. The anniversary sets; the complete studio sessions boxes; the boxes collecting the boxes. It goes on and on and every new gift season brings another new offering.</p>
<p>And now here's the latest, from a couple of years after the period Davis mentioned: two re-releases of the legendary 1970 2xLP set <i>Bitches Brew</i>. One is a <i>40th Anniversary Collector's Edition</i> gathering together the original album on one and a quarter CDs, along with studio outtakes, another CD containing a previously unissued set recorded at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass., in August 1970, and a DVD containing a previously unissued concert in Copenhagen from November 1969. The other version of the album is part of Columbia's <i>Legacy Edition</i> and contains the first two CDs from the 40th Anniversary set along with the Copenhagen DVD.</p>
<p>There's a reason <i>Bitches Brew</i> is getting this kind of treatment, even after the release of the 4xCD Complete <i>Bitches Brew</i> box set 12 years ago. It is, after all, one of the three or four most important albums of Miles Davis' career. And coming nine months after <i>In a Silent Way</i>, it is also one of founding texts of jazz fusion. It's a Big Deal Jazz album that's been tapped as being an essential part of any collection. Which unfortunately is something that tends to obscure the actual music. Putting on <i>Bitches Brew</i> and then straining to
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
hear why it mattered so much is a pretty lousy way to go about enjoying this music. Which is not to say there isn't a lot here to puzzle over and listen for-- the music on <i>Bitches Brew</i> is so variable and hard to pin down it rewards any amount of close listening. But <i>Bitches Brew</i> is also pretty accessible as electric Miles goes, and it's something you can put on and let wash over you for now, figuring out what it means and what everyone was doing later.</p>
<p>The first thing that <i>Bitches Brew</i> made clear is that Miles was keenly interested in expanding the idea of what his music could be, and was starting to stretch it way out. The title track runs 26 minutes, which then and now is at the extreme end of what a side of vinyl on an LP can hold; the opening ""Pharaoh's Dance"" also breaks 20 minutes. And these pieces weren't lengthy compositions or single jams, but were assembled by Miles and producer Teo Macero through editing-- unrelated tracks could become one piece through the miracle of the razor blade and magnetic tape. For an improvisatory art form that was founded on the idea collective expression in the present moment, the idea of stitching together pieces into a new whole was radical enough on its own. But Miles was changing his approach in several ways simultaneously as the 1960s came to a close.  He was processing his trumpet with echo, working with electric keyboards and electric guitar, adding new percussion colors, experimenting with rock rhythms, doing away with chord changes, and building long tracks from riffs and vamps. And, as the liner notes from Greg Tate included with these sets illustrate, he was hanging out with Betty Davis, who was introducing him to new music, and along the way he had become a fan of Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and James Brown.</p>
<p>All of these elements swirled together into a record of brilliant and fascinating contradictions. The psychedelic cover art and long electric jams on the one hand anchor the music in Age of Aquarius, but the connections to earlier jazz tradition and unmoored, floating quality of music also lend it a timeless feel. It sounds very much like a bunch of dudes jamming in the room, but some of the abrupt edits serve as a reminder that it owes a lot to technology. It finds Miles distancing himself from his musical past, but it sounds equally far from the dense abstraction his music would take on a couple of years later, especially in a live setting. It was long and hard to get a handle on, but it was also a huge commercial success. Ultimately, <i>Bitches Brew</i> seems mostly like a single beautiful frame from a jarring film filled with jump-cuts. The amount that Miles Davis' music changed from the early 60s to the early 70s is astonishing. His sound was constantly on the move, and this is what it sounded like on those August days in the studio.</p>
<p>The bonus material illustrates just how quickly Davis' music was changing, and how much his music could vary given the context. Three months after <i>Bitches Brew</i> was recorded (but before it was released), he performed in Copenhagen with a five-piece band that included Wayne Shorter. Chick Corea's electric piano aside, the music is acoustic, though several tunes from <i>Bitches Brew</i> are included (the video is exceptional in quality in terms of both sound and image). In this setting, Davis' music sounds like what most people would identify as ""jazz,"" and is less challenging than the cerebral and harmonically complex music he'd made just a few years earlier with his quintet. But by the August 1970 set included with the 40th Anniversary edition, the raging funk maelstrom that would epitomize his live shows in the next four years was on the rails. What a difference nine months made for Miles Davis as 1969 turned into 1970.</p>
<p>The two sets sit at opposite ends of the value scale. Listing at about $19, the <i>Legacy Edition</i> seems to me a very good buy-- the original album is a 2xCD set, the outtakes are reasonably interesting, and the Copenhagen DVD is a vital addition to the Davis canon. Also included on the second disc are four tracks edited down for release as 7"" singles, and they are interesting curios good for one play but not much more-- three-minute edits are the opposite of what this music is about. The 40th Anniversary Set, on the other hand, goes for over $100 and is obviously geared toward Davis completists-- for them, it actually delivers pretty well as these sets go, since the 1970 live set is excellent, there are some extra visual goodies, and it's not padded out with a promotional film masquerading as a documentary (it also comes with two 180 gram vinyl discs-- I'll never quite get why someone wants both CD and LP sets.) How much is left in the vault? We'll see, maybe when the album turns 50.</p></div>"|14623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/|9.5|Mark Richardson

But he'd prefer not to talk about his heavy history even if it would make you root for him. For one thing, he'd rather not relive some of the personal tragedy (a bad breakup, a house fire) that inspired his debut, <i>Leave Ruin</i>. But it also would obscure the otherworldly mythology he creates on <i>Pope Killdragon</i>, an astoundingly original twist on the loner-folk template.</p>
<p>He begins the mesmerizing ""Sterling"" like he's keeping an especially heavy secret, but Showalter is merely an observer and a confused one at that. If his lyrics are occasionally too loopy to pin down what it's ""about,"" they're perfectly suited for an unreliable narrator trying to piece together lost time. In the darkly comic ""Daniel's Blues"", he inhabits Dan Aykroyd, racked with depression after the death of John Belushi. I won't spoil the ending, but it's by far the most pathos-laden song ever to recall the decision to take a role in <i>Ghostbusters</i>. Meanwhile, the spare ""Alex Kona"" is the stuff of Mastodon epics-- 12-foot monsters, sermons from the mount, mothers wailing in the streets-- and to drive that point home, it's immediately followed by ""Giant's Despair"", an honest-to-god doom-metal instrumental.</p>
<p>Those are the attention-grabbing tactics, but <i>Pope Killdragon </i>maintains these strange juxtapositions throughout: historical fact with whimsical fiction, a mournful delivery of absurd lyrics, an odd allure to the bifurcated sonics where synths sidle up with acoustic guitars. It's easy to envision the ""next Bon Iver!"" plaudits-- Showalter looks and sounds the part, but that would miss the deeper commonality. Auto-Tune, Gayngs, rolling spliffs with Rick Ross-- Justin Vernon has made the most of the spotlight by cutting against an image that requires him to continually hurt harder than others. Similarly, <i>Pope Killdragon</i>'s playfulness and sense of humor allow it a broader range of emotion than the typical sadsack folkie. Showalter did a good deal of bloodletting on <i>Leave Ruin</i>, and now Strand of Oaks' horizons are limited only by his fantastical imagination.</p></div>"|14567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14567-pope-killdragon/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Both are existential mopes who did their best and career-defining work in the 1990s, but have spent the better part of the last decade chasing self-indulgences, becoming too cerebral and too coldly distant to connect with an audience. Both regularly overthink their art to the point of strangling it of all life. Like Moody's new 700-page doorstop, <i>The Four Fingers of Death</i>, Eels' latest, <i>Tomorrow Morning</i>, is far too insular to mean much of anything outside itself. It's an exercise in self-referentiality, which might be more impressive if the music didn't sound like the folk-with-beats path Beck was smart enough to avoid.</p>
<p><i>Tomorrow Morning</i> is perhaps most notable for how it complements its predecessor, the teasing <i>End Times</i> released earlier this year. That album showed E wrestling with his defense mechanisms in a way that promised to show the man behind the initial. He has never flinched from heavy issues; he wrote an album about cancer, after all. But he has always swathed any hint of confession in severe detachment, as if he could never wholly inhabit his songs for fear of the very real pain they might contain. Ostensibly grappling with a break-up with his longtime girlfriend, <i>End Times</i> toyed with expectations of autobiographical revelation, first laying out the situation in the barest lyrics possible and then twisting it into a concept album where a romantic rift brings forth an apocalypse. Musically and thematically, it spiraled out of E's control, but for a few brief moments, he became as human and as sympathetic as he had ever been.</p>
<p>Following just a few months later, <i>Tomorrow Morning</i> is the sequel that shows E recovering from his heartache and becoming a new man-- not a new musician, mind you, but a new man. He's found a new woman, and on ""Baby Loves Me"" and ""Spectacular Girl"" she gives him the power and perspective to overlook all the negativity in the world. ""Baby loves me,"" he barks Tourettically, ""and she's smarter than you."" No one would begrudge him such happiness, but the song is a contrivance of burbling synths, plastic beats, and E's own dead-eyed growl. Later, on the gospel cringer ""Looking Up"", E declares himself transformed, but the song's so ridiculous it sounds more like a pisstake on the idea of salvation than salvation itself.</p>
<p>Even when he's trying to sound upbeat, E just sounds typically downhearted. That idea could be intriguing, but even if you ignore his tired delivery of lines like ""I'm a hummingbird, beautiful and free,"" this album just sounds bad, clattering with rudimentary beats and chintzy keyboards that make the songs blur into each other. He still comes across as a bedroom auteur, shut away from the world like a DIY hermit, but aside from a bit of vinyl distortion around a few songs, the album sounds too slick to sell E's solitary stance. In that regard, the album just sounds way too long. <i>End Times </i>had the benefit of brevity-- just a few short songs that moved the plot out of the real world and into E's head. <i>Tomorrow Morning</i>, however, meanders aimlessly through 14 songs that sound like 28. How's that for existential crisis? Stuck in a never-ending Eels album.</p></div>"|14626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14626-tomorrow-morning/|3.6|Stephen M. Deusner

The songs are inventively arranged, exuberantly played, and occasionally beautiful. There are moments of disarming simplicity-- the sparse, shimmering ballad ""Misplaced""; the dusty banjo plonking of ""Slippery When Wet""-- and moments of high color and energy, like the title track, built on a needling bed of guitar harmonics and some sawing violins. Like two clear precursors, Grizzly Bear and Califone, the Acorn have a knack for accretion of tiny, engaging details: marimbas, horns, organs, and other colorful elements will often slip fluidly into the background halfway through a song, adding warmth, texture and atmosphere on an almost subconscious level. And yet, somehow, almost none of <i>No Ghost</i> manages to leave a lasting impression. Why?</p>
<p>It's a puzzling question, and it hovers over a lot of talented bands dogged by a certain hard-to-define facelessness. A unique voice is a difficult thing to talk about, since no two people can agree on what one is, exactly. The Acorn's sound is indistinct; they make pleasant, full-bodied folk rock, but their sound has a wobbly center of gravity. When they adopt the rangy slide guitar and scrap-yard percussion of Califone, like on ""I Made the Law"" and ""Almanac"", there isn't enough Acorn there to keep from the overwhelming sensation that a Califone album has unexpectedly wandered into view. Rolf Klausener's clear, high tenor even resembles Califone frontman Tim Rutili's, but without any of the ear-catching crags or world-weariness. His voice is pretty but polite; when he hits high notes on the uptempo numbers, like ""Restoration"" or ""Bobcat Goldwraith"", there is a pinched quality to it that squashes the momentum.</p>
<p>There are glimmers, in the various half-ideas that surface throughout <i>No Ghost</i>, of a vision that the band could have taken and run with. Klausener's lyrics can be appealingly morbid. It doesn't immediately register, for instance, that the opening lines of ""Restoration""--  ""concentric circles signal dinnertime""-- refers to chumming sharks. They have a good feel for ballads. On songs like ""On the Line"", the Acorn sound more relaxed than on the uptempo rockers, which betray a whiff of overachievers' strain. The album's most indelible moment is the sweet, subdued ""Slippery When Wet"". The pace slows, the arrangement opens up, and a simple, instantly affecting tune rises out of the silence. It is a humble, quiet moment, but the band sounds more at home in it than anywhere else on the album.</p></div>"|14603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14603-no-ghost/|6.3|Jayson Greene

Upstart producers rework anything they can get their hands on to get noticed, and bands that are only vaguely connected to dance culture commission whole albums of DJ edits. Most of this stuff is decent at best. But Hot Chip are different. The London electro-pop group has a dance-music pedigree as strong as anyone and are prolific, talented remixers in their own right. (They've reworked cuts by Matthew Dear, Junior Boys, M.I.A., Amy Winehouse, and many others.) A Hot Chip remix record is actually worth getting excited about.</p>
<p>This EP lets folks have a go at tracks from Hot Chip's recent <i>One Life Stand</i> album, and the band brings in some heavy hitters to do the job. House hero Todd Edwards, Caribou's Dan Snaith, and techno hotshot Osborne are a few of the guys on deck. It's an interesting task for these producers, though, because <i>One Life Stand</i> isn't the most dancefloor-ready Hot Chip record. There's propulsion behind it, sure, but <i>OLS</i> is fundamentally a poignant work-- it's lush and romantic and even ballad-driven at times. So the challenge here is to preserve these songs' emotional weight while pushing them in a bouncier direction.</p>
<p>Most of the remixers choose to highlight the optimistic elements of the source material and stretch what are ostensibly pop songs into extended house jams. Naturally, Edwards does a great job of this with his take on ""Hand Me Down Your Love"", turning the drum-and-piano driven original into a glittery seven-minute floor filler. British newcomer Hot City offers more futuristic house on his ""We Have Love"" remix and pretty much knocks it out of the park, too. It's a wild track: ultra-fast bpm and violently wobbly bass, the thing just jumps out of your speakers. Pretty easy to see why this guy's seen a lot of hype recently.</p>
<p>Some of the other producers take a more nuanced approach, deconstructing songs rather than just amplifying them. Osborne's ""Take It In"" remix does this really well. He's got a knack for mechanized funk and basically turns the steely original into a gooey slow jam that drips with emotion. Caribou's ""Brothers"" re-do is the only thing here I'm not crazy about. Admittedly Snaith's got his work cut out for him since this is one of Hot Chip's strongest, most evocative tracks. He makes it sound watery and kind of ethereal, puts lots of reverb on the vocals, and it sounds appealing but ultimately lacks the passion of the original.</p>
<p>That's the lone misfire here, though. All the other remixes give Hot Chip's source tracks a cool companion piece. (Which is an important point-- nobody here tries to improve on the originals, just taking them in a different direction.) Obviously some of the credit goes to the band. These guys could have their pick of producers, but they carefully choose people who would steer the material in interesting directions. It's a little like making a good mixtape-- you need a thematic thread running throughout but plenty of variety between songs. Both of those things happen here, and it's just another reason Hot Chip are so good at what they do.</p></div>"|14616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14616-we-have-remixes-ep/|7.7|Joe Colly

It's a rhetorical question, of course, but coming from the well-bearded mouth of Stephen McBean, the sentiment is especially pointed. For in his 10-plus years of making music, McBean has never been one to retrace his steps, venturing outward from the dirgey folk-rock of Jerk With a Bomb to the ever mercurial noise-pop of Pink Mountaintops and the earthquaking boogie of his most successful outfit to date, Black Mountain. But even the popular perception of Black Mountain as 1970s-style riff-mongers is unfairly myopic, with the seeming anomalies in their discography-- the carefree jangle pop of ""No Satisfaction"", the hypno-drone trance of ""No Hits"", or the raised-lighter sing-along ""Stay Free""-- proving just as prevalent as the Black Sabbath worship. In their heart of hearts, Black Mountain are really just peaceful hippies, but ones who aren't afraid to deploy heavy artillery to assert and protect their way of living. (Run their hearts around at your own risk: If their philosophy could be displayed on a VW microbus bumper sticker, it would read ""Make Love <i>Then</i> War."")</p>
<p>On the band's third album, <i>Wilderness Heart</i>, there's a more concerted effort to reconcile the band's inner darkness and light, a symbiosis reflected in their choice of producers: Randall Dunn, best known for his work with doom-metal giants Boris and Sunn O))), and D. Sardy, whose lengthy list of multi-platinum clients includes Oasis and the Rolling Stones. Couple those big-name producers with the decision to record in L.A., not to mention their mainstream toe-dip on the <i>Spider-Man 3</i> soundtrack, and all signs point to <i>Wilderness Heart</i>'s<i> </i>being Black Mountain's go-for-broke commercial bid. But while the new album is certainly more streamlined and luminous than 2008's weighty, apocalyptic <i>In the Future</i>-- no 17-minute prog-rock suites to be had here-- the sharper focus doesn't dilute the band's cannabis-clouded cool.</p>
<p>In FM-radio terms, <i>Wilderness Heart </i>is Black Mountain's <i>Houses of the Holy</i>, an album that shimmers as much as it bulldozes, humors as much as it rages, while flexing a more pronounced pop sensibility that mostly works in the band's favor rather than to their detriment. And just as John Paul Jones' Mellotron-based set piece ""No Quarter"" was arguably the highlight of <i>Houses</i>, <i>Wilderness Heart</i>'s most striking moments come courtesy of keyboardist Jeremy Schmidt-- his thick, Deep Purplish tones on the Camaro-rattling ""Old Fangs"" prove heavier than the glam-metal riff chugging underneath it, and instead of dropping in the <i>de rigueu</i><i>r</i> guitar solo, the band lets him slather on dreamy layers of laser-beam synth drones. Likewise, his Mellotronic backdrops on the stoner-folk reveries ""Radiant Hearts"" and ""Buried by the Blues"" refashion these downcast acoustic interludes in a more majestic light.</p>
<p>Schmidt's spotlight turns are indicative of a broader shift in Black Mountain's M.O., where the band is becoming less reliant on a monolithic power-chord attack and playing more to the strengths and subtleties of its individual members. Sure, <i>Wilderness Heart </i>boasts Black Mountain's fiercest thrasher to date in ""Let Spirits Ride""-- which takes the proto-speed-metal riff of Black Sabbath's ""Symptom of the Universe"" for a joyride-- but the real revelation is the playfully loose, stutter-grooved ""The Hair Song"", which despite being built upon contorted acoustic-guitar strums and slides, hits as hard as anything else in the band's canon. The song also charts the increasing confluence of McBean and Amber Webber's voices-- where they were initially presented as stark contrasts, the two are now practically finishing each other's sentences. And in some cases, Webber even steals the song from de facto frontman McBean, her chorus turn on ""Rollercoaster"" elevating the track out of its sludgy morass.</p>
<p>For an album that presents a more assured, swaggering Black Mountain, it's a minor disappointment that <i>Wilderness Heart</i> doesn't so much climax as gradually wind down, without a show-stopping finale to crown the victory lap. But even in their quietest moments, the band can still leave you unsettled-- the closing track may be the first Black Mountain acoustic ballad dedicated to a girl, but not coincidentally it's a name (""Sadie"") strongly evocative of the Manson murders and the tenuous line between blissful, free-loving hippiedom and violent anarchy. And as the song fades out into an ominous tribal-stomp procession, you're still not sure which side Black Mountain are going to lean toward next.</p></div>"|14620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14620-wilderness-heart/|7.4|Stuart Berman

Worthy competitors have crept up and either faded away (shuffling ""schaffel"" techno) or been assimilated so fully as to become part of the general dance-music weather (Wolfgang Voigt's minimalism, Michael Mayer's precision trance). But Superpitcher-- nobody does what he does quite as well. Nobody even really tries. What he does has also proven very prescient, especially as we hear more and more slow, bleary, moody, spooky sounds from the haunted and/or wasted outer edges of genres like chillwave and witch-house. Such is the style that Superpitcher has worked within since breaking out in 2001 with a single called ""Heroin"". And such is the style of his fine return to form, <i>Kilimanjaro</i>.</p>
<p>It's been a few years since Superpitcher churned out his last essential material, having chosen instead to mess around in the studio and explore ideas of ""singing"" and playing ""instruments"" on a string of admirable but ultimately disappointing projects, most notably his Michael Mayer-collaboration album <i>Supermayer Save the World</i>. None of his work was ever exactly bad, but none of the energy or joy evident in the making of it found a corollary in the energy or joy receptors of those of us who endeavored to listen to it. Worthy lesson for all aspiring music-makers: Just because you<i> can</i> play a slide whistle doesn't mean you necessarily should.</p>
<p>But there's a slide whistle early on <i>Kilimanjaro</i>, and it sounds great-- and not only great but integral, as if time spent playing slide whistle and sounding a little lame in the past paid off in the form of a sound now worth exploring even more down the line. Not to overstate the slide whistle, though. It's just one tool among many used in ""Voodoo"", a track that opens <i>Kilimanjaro</i> on a notably dubby note, with all kinds of sounds-- sensuous singing, falsetto yelps, ominous chimes, rattling trash-can taps-- spread across an incredibly deep sound-field and arranged in time with a sort of lilting quasi-reggae beat.</p>
<p>There's a lot going on, but one of Superpitcher's strengths as a producer is the way he employs everything he does, big and small, in service of a consistently melancholy and often menacing mood. His drum tracks, like the ones in ""Country Boy"", are great examples of how subtle changes of timing and inflection can affect machine music as much as strings or piano. And the rhythms have a way of accentuating the weariness at the heart of Superpitcher's sound by falling invariably behind the beat, always a little slower and gloomier than they should-- like a slump-shouldered teenager clomping a few steps behind his mom at the mall while humming Cure songs in his head.</p>
<p>The mood comes across explicitly in lyrics that center on loneliness and disconnection with a breathy simplicity. But the mood proves even more unmistakable in the music, whether loping at an almost Portishead-like speed or amped up in the sultry, suggestive funk of ""Black Magic"" and the anthemic rave-piano torch song ""Joanna"". It's hard to imagine anyone not being moved in some divergent but certain way by those last two tracks in succession. And it's even harder to imagine Superpitcher being gone again for as long as he was.</p></div>"|14617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14617-kilimanjaro/|7.8|Andy Battaglia

The band's debut album, 1987's <i>Pain of Mind</i>, is badly recorded hardcore. The titanic squall and face-caving tribal thump of 1996's <i>Through Silver in Blood</i> sounds like the work of a completely different and far more serious band.</p>
<p>Songs stretched to prog rock lengths without all the dainty and whimsical prog-rock bullshit. The rhythm section made everyone save early Swans-- an admitted influence-- sound weak and puny. And the riffs moved at lava-flow tempos, awesome and frightening in pretty equal measure. Neurosis weren't the first band to be ugly and majestic all at once, but at the time they felt pretty singular, especially considering their humble origins.</p>
<p>They don't sound quite so unique anymore, through no fault of their own. Neurosis' mid-90s sound has inspired more imitations and homages than most any other modern metal act. And Neurosis haven't stagnated over the last 14 years. (Melody! Who could have guessed?) But the band's basic goal remains the same as it did circa 1996: epic heaviness, music that raises you up only to pound you back down again.</p>
<p>In the absence of a new Neurosis studio album, <i>Live at Roadburn 2007</i> is the usual quick-fix dose for fans. For any potential first-timers, it's an excellent performance. The band sounds totally locked-in with each other, which is important when you're playing music this deliberately paced. You don't want your crush-kill-destroy guitar climax to come in a second too late, you know? Fidelity's great, too, even if it understandably lacks the psychedelic thickness of the band's studio productions.</p>
<p>Personally though, when I come to Neurosis I want to feel like the band is roaring right over top of me with no mercy. True, Neurosis's guitars can sound just as enormous as they did back in the band's game-changing heyday. But those pin-you-to-the-wall riffs are now usually broken up by long dips into dark folkie strumming or whooshy planetarium keyboards or other Michael-Gira-meets-Steve-Howe ambient tomfoolery.</p>
<p>So yeah, Neurosis do the quiet-LOUD-quiet post-rock thing. (No real surprise they were added to the GY!BE-curated ATP.) But then again, they were doing it when most post-rock bands were still playing twee songs in their bedrooms. (And hell, Slint stole it from metal anyway.) One reason Neurosis excel at this rather tired dynamic is the apocalyptic intensity of the vocals after all these years; the tortured bellowing makes it feel like there was some real and scary human catharsis going down on stage, rather than some sterile formal exercise. When the band kicks into those climaxes, you understand why they've endured while so many of their imitators were D.O.A.: There's a certain kind of conviction you just can't rip-off.</p></div>"|14613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14613-live-at-roadburn-2007/|6.5|Jess Harvell

This is due mostly to the fact that the music being made is fairly melodic and often pretty-- but it's also disorienting and doesn't always provide the easiest listening experience. There's lots of blissed-out stuff out there, but it's couched in enough static and noise to create a distance between mainstream listeners and the art itself.</p>
<p><i>The Soft Wave</i>, Alexis Georgopoulos' sophomore effort as Arp, serves to close that gap a little. Arp's 2007 debut, <i>In Light</i>, was a few years ahead of its time in embracing a full-on synth-heavy arpeggio assault, and here he pushes things forward as well, with a record that's the polar opposite of <i>In Light</i>'s smeared, near-psychedelic sound: light and clean, with plenty of negative space. You don't have to find a ""way in"" to this music; its construction practically leaves a door open for you, with more than enough room to wander around once you're there.</p>
<p>There's still a fair amount of oscillating drone and trance-inducing patterns here, but their components are more organic than before. While <i>In Light</i> leaned heavily on synthesizers, <i>The Soft Wave</i> noticeably uses more electric guitar and bass, which mixes with the structural void to create an almost three-dimensional texture. Thick-stringed patterns create reverberating foundations throughout, while guitar licks frequently dance lightly in the foreground. The resulting sound is simultaneously fleet-footed and humid, which lends the album a distinctly tropical vibe.</p>
<p>With more conventional instrumentation comes more straightforward ""songs."" Yes, <i>The Soft Wave</i> does open with ""Pastoral Symphony"", a nine-minute-plus, two-part odyssey filled with jettisoning synth lines and skyward tones, but there's also ""From a Balcony Overlooking the Sea"", a stately piece featuring Georgopoulos' warm vocals that recall the more ethereal moments of Brian Eno's ""vocal"" albums.</p>
<p>There's a catch, though: just as Oneohtrix Point Never opened this year's stunning <i>Returnal</i> with the ear-shattering, Burning Star Core-recalling noise of ""Nil Admirari"", Georgopoulos closes this record out with the uneasy rustling static of ""Silver Clouds"". The effect is something of a sonic swarm, akin to black ink leaking over parchment and spreading quickly over its surface. Overwhelming, yes, but beauty needs to be tempered with noise sometimes.</p></div>"|14606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14606-the-soft-wave/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

""Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination,"" he sang on ""God and Country"" in 2004, the year of the most soul-deadening American election of my lifetime. They're probably the two most infamous lines in the band's catalog, but they're not even the most crucial lines in ""God and Country"". Those come near the beginning: ""I can hope, see/ Even if I don't believe.""</p>
<p>Hope when all evidence suggests you should despair, honest confusion offered in place of stock rhetoric, music that sounds like it's fueled as much by joy as rage: The Thermals' moral indignation is never a bummer. Harris is no demagogue, just another guy looking for answers, just like me and you, and the band typically sounds like they're having a blast. Even at their angriest, the Thermals have turned out some of the giddiest, most super-charged punk of the decade.</p>
<p>This was one of punk's better life lessons, of course: We're regular folks, we've got our eyes open to the bullshit going down, but we're not going to let it grind us into apathy. We're going to use it. The Thermals understand that anger without energy (to gloss John Lydon) leads to cynicism, resentment, diffidence. If you're going to be angry, your music better not be a drag. And melodrama, however well-intentioned, is not the Thermals' bag. You sure as hell can't imagine them writing a grand concept album kvetching about suburban sprawl.</p>
<p>It's coincidental that they titled their new album <i>Personal Life</i> in a year of Big Indie Statements, but it does underline what makes them special. The Thermals were never a ""political"" band per se. On <i>Personal Life</i>, as on all of the Thermals albums, you get the sense that you're listening to an individual think out loud, puzzle through some shit, register the aforementioned hopes, confusion, and occasional joy. Sometimes that individual just happens to be thinking about the federal government, organized religion, and other ulcer-inducing topics.</p>
<p>Despite some obvious exceptions like ""Power Lies"", whose title says it all even if the lyrics are fairly vague, <i>Personal Life</i> is mostly relationship songs as far as I can read them. That hasn't dulled the passion of Harris' delivery; he gets just as worked up about love as he does about god and the president. I find that invigorating when compared to 2010's sea of lo-fi mumblers, but presumably his cracked-note intensity will still be off-putting to those who prefer singers with cooler heads and more controlled pipes.</p>
<p>What has changed is the music: This might be the least frantic record the Thermals have yet recorded. Bassist Kathy Foster is driving the songs more than ever; without her, ""Not Like Any Other Feeling"", with its almost negligible guitar hook, would collapse completely. Sure, there are a few interesting curveballs to make up for the energy deficit. ""Never Listen to Me"" is probably the closest the Thermals will ever get to dance-rock, which is to say not very close but still closer than you would have expected. But the songs that truly stick, as usual, are the rave-ups like ""I Don't Believe You"", with its perfect bubblegummy ""oh-oh-a-oh"" hook.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I do miss the messy, noisy, get-it-done-in-under-two-minutes Thermals. They were just so good at the ramshackle thing, the feeling that they were racing toward the finish line before one or all of their amps exploded. <i>Personal Life</i> is hardly a failure; much of it is excellent. But it's also missing that anger-meets-energy urgency that made the Thermals' early albums so undeniable. It's not quite clear that they've found a new approach to match it, at least just yet.</p></div>"|14615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14615-personal-life/|6.7|Jess Harvell

On 2005's <i>Strange Geometry</i>, they shifted focus for real, looking to the rich analog sound of the 1960s rather than the scrappy 1980s indie pop that reared them (which was of course already pretty 60s-indebted).</p>
<p>The Clientele are too idiosyncratic to be a straight retro act-- one listen to Alasdair MacLean's sighing delivery and you know he's not out to imitate Lennon, McCartney, anyone-- but that same strong stamp of personality means it's hard to say anything <i>new</i> about the band. So yes, on <i>Minotaur</i> they continue draw deeply from 60s soft-pop; if you've enjoyed the Clientele's last few albums, you're guaranteed to enjoy at least 6/8ths of this mini LP. It's the same gorgeous, heartsick-sounding, consciously nostalgic, folk-ish rock you can imagine jangling from some shy bookworm's transistor radio in the brief period between <i>Rubber Soul</i> and the Summer of Love. On the plus side, the band has ditched the ersatz Brit Invasion touches that marred 2009's <i>Bonfires on the Heath</i>. The Clientele, despite their unfair reputation as a one-trick band, can do many things well, but they just sound off when they go up-tempo.</p>
<p>But <i>Minotaur</i> also includes the first Clientele song you could actually describe as ""creepy."" There's a brief piano instrumental-- somewhere between Vangelis doing a slow-mo <i>Chariots of Fire</i> and Komeda's <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> incidentals-- that hints at said creepiness. But it's ""The Green Man""-- a spoken-word track, MacLean's twist on the ""Green Man"" tradition of classic Brit ghost stories, that takes off from the far sunnier ""Losing Haringey"" on <i>Geometry</i>-- that sounds very little like anything the Clientele have released so far. The backing track is almost musique concrète, a wash of eerie drones, distant footfalls, and industrial sounds, as if it were recorded from a subway platform at 3 a.m. Musically, ""The Green Man"" is more akin to late-period Coil than anything you'd find on a Time Life ""sounds of the 60s"" collection, and while it's probably a one-off experiment for the band, it also suggests that a little darkness might add a new (if not really necessary) dimension to the Clientele's sound.</p></div>"|14600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14600-minotaur/|6.5|Jess Harvell

And now that he's somehow figured out a way to sell out-- a near-impossible feat in 2010-- just about B.o.B.'s only remaining underground connection is his continued association with a much older and less famous rapper, the Atlanta mixtape monster Playboy Tre. Over the past couple of years, Tre has released two insanely strong mixtapes, <i>Goodbye America</i> and <i>Liquor Store Mascot</i>. Both tapes dealt frankly and realistically with a lifetime of disappointments and diminished expectations, then cut through all the wizened real talk with a serious dose of drunk-funny-asshole shit-talk. These days, Tre works as B.o.B.'s hypeman. Last week, I saw him playing sideman as B.o.B. opened a titanic stadium show for Jay-Z and Eminem, and it was a kick to see a perpetual underdog like Tre getting to play a part, however small, in that whole circus. And Tre also anchored the one great moment from B.o.B.'s major-label debut, the rap-for-rap's-sake workout ""Bet I Bust"".</p>
<p>So even if all the success isn't exactly <i>his</i>, Tre's new tape <i>The Last Call</i> finds him at least in a more successful <i>context</i> than his last two tapes. So it's heartening to see that Tre hasn't switched up his style at all in a misguided attempt to chase that B.o.B. money. He's still rasping hard truths over warm, heavy soul-rap production, somehow getting great tracks from total-unknown producers. He's still making fun of the parts of the rap universe that don't make sense to him; a troika of skits skewer the living hell out of invasive mixtape DJs. And he's still rapping about how good it feels to still be rapping. Like the two mixtapes that preceded it, <i>The Last Call</i> is a cohesive and powerful piece of work, more of a full-on album than most actual albums.</p>
<p>But now that Tre has found something resembling a stable career, the urgency level dips just a bit here. We get one filler track where Tre and Bay Area MC Mistah FAB shout out every important rapper they can think of from their respective regions. We get a few songs about the general importance of grinding, which rivals the concept of swag as the most overused song concept in all of rap. And on the mixtape's second half, Tre stops rapping about himself entirely for long stretches, preferring instead to stick to cautionary tales about young guys involved in dangerous business. Those tracks come with serious weight, with Tre bringing a sense of grown-man wisdom and empathy to his stories, but they don't quite carry the electric charge of the tracks where Tre tells his own stories.</p>
<p>But then, when we're talking about someone who brings Tre's level of gravity, any talk about his lack of urgency is very, very relative. So on ""All That My Life's About"", before associate Homebwoi talks about how happy he was that he didn't quit his day job after rapping on a Ying Yang Twins track, Tre gives us a detailed account of his struggles to come up in the record industry before leaving us with this: ""Mama called and said the house nearing foreclosure/ And I'm like, 'Who gives a fuck about the exposure?'""</p>
<p>This is music with something at stake, and it hits its apex on the sad reminisce ""Earline Son"", maybe the single greatest track Tre's ever made. Over a gorgeous sighing-organ beat, Tre talks about the same stuff that's served as grist for millions of rap songs-- Tre's history dealing drugs and getting shot, for instance. Except that Tre's not proud of his past; he's more embarrassed. Talking about getting shot at 16, Tre mentions that his enemy was too scared to shoot him, that he had to get his stepdad to do it. And then Tre remembers lying in the hospital while his father tells him that he got what he deserved. It's a quietly devastating track, and Tre wraps it up with a verse about how all the shit that he's survived has made him who he is. Not too many other rappers are quite this honest about the squalid shit they've gone through, and not too many rappers come through it all sounding this wise, or this focused.</p></div>"|14621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14621-the-last-call/|7.8|Tom Breihan

A pop-disco production duo from Belgium, Aeroplane have released a sporadic but endlessly enjoyable stream of singles, remixes, and collaborations since 2007.  It was a bit heartbreaking when Vito De Luca and Stephen Fasano announced their breakup this summer; they cited artistic differences (De Luca will carry on as Aeroplane). <i>We Can't</i> <i>Fly</i> will make you believe those artistic differences were real.  A schizophrenic and ultimately confused record, <i>We Can't Fly</i> abandons Aeroplane's airtight constructions for loose, haughty  tracks that are as unclassifiable as they are messy.</p>
<p><i>We Can't Fly</i> has the feel of a record that's to be everything to everybody-- hit receptacle, compendium of past works, exploration-- and as such ends up being nothing.  There are splinters of excellence: the title track weaves an unexpectedly skankin' guitar part into gospel chants, big-rock piano bridges, and miles of keyboards.  It's the antithesis of so many disco-as-savior anthems; you will nod and chant to our collective failure.  ""Good Riddance"" and ""Without Lies""-- a strange country amble and a sassy pop gem, respectively-- suggest the range and diversity of Ze Records (a clear influence), though ""Good Riddance"" mostly serves to remind that those Mutant Disco comps had some real clunkers.</p>
<p>The misses miss big, and perplexingly.  ""I Don't Feel"" splits the difference between <i>Guitar World</i> riffing and Patti LaBelle to disastrous effect.  ""The Point of No Return"" auditions for <i>Top Gun</i> montages past and future; ""Fish in the Sky"" for Bowie's mid-90s blind spot.  This from a band who had shown commendable restraint-- no wailing divas or 22-minute Kraut-funk jams; just tight, languorous bodyrock.  It's not that these songs are gregarious, silly, and overstuffed-- we suspected Aeroplane had that in them-- it's that they are charmlessly so.  ""I Don't Feel"" will fit most people's definitions of Bad Music, but more troubling  is the existence of a giant, wailing barnburner that acts dressy and prim.    Aeroplane aren't big personalities or great wits, so when they jostle and play it always feels like the joke's on us.</p>
<p>Aeroplane seem to know a bit about artifice-- the serrated hook of ""Without Lies"" imagines a boring world without artists-- but <i>We Can't Fly</i> doesn't see them inhabiting unexpected personas or adopting new voices.  It feels like fucking around, like a definitively non-definitive remnant of a partnership. <i>We Can't Fly</i>'s stylistic knuckleballs lack just about everything we'd grown to love about Aeroplane: namely luxurious grooves and effortless cool.</p></div>"|14614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14614-we-cant-fly/|4.4|Andrew Gaerig

The plane was delayed while they looked for his bag without any luck. The flight left without him, and once he got his passport back they weren't able to get him to Luanda for another few weeks. They did, however offer him some alternatives: would he like to go to Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, or Ghana? He chose a flight to Accra, Ghana-- he had friends there who'd told him of a big stash of records he might be interested in. And that's how this compilation came about.</p>
<p>Analog Africa was already in the process of digging heavily into the music scenes of Ghana's smaller neighbors, Benin and Togo, for a series of great comps. A meeting with Dick Essilfie-Bonzie, the owner of the long-defunct Essiebons Records, led Redjeb to a trove of old master tapes from the 1970s. The music on those tapes, most of which was originally recorded for PolyGram, comprises the bulk of this set, the latest in Redjeb's incredible run of Afro-funk retrospectives. Anyone who enjoyed Soundway's <i>Ghana Soundz</i> compilations from several years ago will love this as well, as it's filled with the distinctive funk sound of Ghana-- heavy on the bright Vox organ, colored by highlife guitars, and anchored by grooves that are heavier than just about anything else. The few tracks by Togolese artists included here fit right into the sound (the artists all absorbed the Ghana sound during stints there).</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to organize archival compilations. You can go the Numero route and try to tell the story of a label or a tight-knit group of friends through music; you can focus on a particular style, year, or scene; you can cherry-pick and make what amounts to a mixtape; or try to provide an overview for beginners. Analog Africa is really the only label I can think of that uses the travelogue as an organizing principle for these kinds of sets. Redjeb's adventure isn't just the catalyst for the compilation-- it's the backbone as well. Listening to it and checking the extensive book of notes that comes with it, you follow an arc of discovery that parallels Redjeb's own listening experience in Ghana. There's excitement in the way it's put together, and everyone he interviews for the booklet is happy to be talking about this music again.</p>
<p>If you're already collecting Afro-funk comps, you'll probably know names like K. Frimpong, Ebo Taylor, and African Brothers Band. They and others here have all featured on other compilations, but this disc digs deep to bring us stuff we've never heard before. And if you're just getting into this music, pretty much everything will be revelatory. Taylor's two tracks under his own name here both have his signature big sound, underpinned by the knocking Afrobeat rhythm that he built into a trademark. It wasn't easy to have a massive sound like Taylor's in 70s Ghana. Successive military governments in the 60s had imposed curfews that made life difficult for musicians, breaking up a lot of bands and sending their members abroad-- the large horn sections of the big old-style highlife bands were the hardest-hit, and as a result highlife in Ghana became more focused on the guitar. Taylor's big, pummeling horn fanfares are a thread tying his funked-up 70s output back to the society bands he got his start in.</p>
<p>The ultimate Ghanaian guitar highlife band was undoubtedly the African Brothers, led by guitarist Nana Ampadu. Their ""Ngyegye No So"" borrows an Afrobeat backbeat (it's the insistent syncopated tick-tock-a-tick pattern played on the non-trap percussion) and tugs on it with a fractured bass line. After the psychedelic organ solo, Ampadu delivers an English monologue that goes like this: ""It is me they call Nana Ampadu, the music king. I be composer, I be singer, I be arranger, I be master guitarist""-- the joke being that the song's title means ""Don't Brag"". Orchestre Abass, a Togolese band that relocated to Accra and later had a residency at Fela Kuti's Shrine in Lagos, Nigeria, picked up the choppy rhythms and immense organ sound of their adopted country, and they flash it brilliantly on ""Awula Bo Fee Ene"".</p>
<p>One of the reasons these songs all sound so unified is that Ghana's music scene was small enough that many musicians knew each other, played with each other, and developed alongside one another or in competition. If there are more than a couple degrees of separation between any two musicians, I'd be shocked. They also shared a constant scramble for scarce resources, and it seems to have forged a rock-solid professionalism in the players that you can hear in the recordings. Dick Essilfie-Bonzie had established a few labels and the country's first vinyl pressing plant, and he brought in an engineer called E.B. Brown to run his studio-- Brown's depth of knowledge and skill gives these recordings an amazing presence and clarity that modern mastering has only made bolder. Here's hoping Samy Ben-Redjeb winds up on a few more flights he didn't intend to take.</p></div>"|14601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14601-afro-beat-airways-west-african-shock-waves-ghana-togo-1972-1978/|8.2|Joe Tangari

But since then, he's played Clark Kent, mild-mannered, hiding in plain sight. A brief rundown of how he's stayed on our radar by doing everything <i>except </i>releasing a proper follow-up to <i>Illinois</i>: there was a collection of B-sides and alternate takes from <i>Illinois </i>that was damn near as long (<i>The Avalanche</i>), a boxed set containing five EPs of holiday music (<i>Songs For Christmas</i>), a multimedia celebration of a Brooklyn thoroughfare (<i>The BQE</i>), a 10-minute recording for <i>Dark Was the Night</i>, appearances on the last two National records among other one-offs and guest spots.</p>
<p>So while it wasn't surprising for him to drop the <i>All Delighted People EP </i>out of nowhere, the more people initially learned about it, the more it gained a worrisome quality. Stevens had gone on record bemoaning the strictures of the traditional album cycle, and a guy as unconventially prolific as he could certainly be expected to make <a href=""http://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/album/all-delighted-people-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his latest work available on Bandcamp</a> the very day the public heard of its existence. But, the ""EP"" qualifier: It's over an hour long. About 95% of bands will never make an <i>album </i>longer than 50 minutes. It was easy to jump to the conclusion that all of this low-impact, hedge-betting was meant to lower the expectations for the ""long-awaited follow-up to <i>Illinois</i>"" by presenting it as an idea dump. A lot of people felt understandably let down: Why was the guy who won us over with his staggering ambition seemingly now afraid of failure?</p>
<p>Of course, we all know now that what Stevens considers his new album, <i>The Age of Adz</i>, awaits us in October, which oddly supports the notion that this EP is a clearinghouse of older ideas. Weighty and stuffed full of them, the record doesn't reveal all of its charms immediately, yet unlike his previous work it doesn't ask for total immersion. <i>All Delighted People </i>allows you to choose your own adventure: the sheer length of <i>Illinois</i> or <i>Michigan</i> could tempt you to shear off some of the instrumentals for a more streamlined listen, but that would sort of be missing the point. In contrast, if you think the ""classic rock version"" of ""All Delighted People"" is totally redundant (and you probably will), on this grab bag of a record it does nothing to upset its surroundings.</p>
<p>That approach does favors to the original version of ""All Delighted People"" and ""Djohariah"", self-contained song islands that would have been nearly impossible to include on Sufjan's cohesive albums. ""All Delighted People"" is a definitive Sufjan song, encompassing all his guises over the span of 11 deceptively brisk minutes: joyous overseer of big-top orchestration and intimate balladeer, preacher and confessor. ""All Delighted People"" feels capable of peaking at any given moment, which makes it a consistently gripping listen up to its pulled-taut outro of tremolo strings. Oddly, the much shorter re-edit is the one that feels like a chore to get through, largely because the second half enables Stevens' weakness for prickly and aimless short-circuited guitar soloing.</p>
<p>Though it employs the same choir cooing and brass fanfare typical of his past work, the supine ""Djohariah"" still comes off as a work borne of artistic freedom for Stevens, its simmering build, improvisatory soloing, and enormous runtime suggesting that he got a copy of <i>Hot Buttered Soul </i>and liked what he heard. Does it really need every single second to get its point across? Maybe not, but though ""Djohariah"" is allowed to expand to an impossibly billowy 17 minutes, it's still classic Sufjan at its core, an endearing love letter to his sister (named in the title), as she suffers through the indignity of an abusive relationship.</p>
<p>Between those massive bookends are the sort of humble short stories that represent what listeners have been missing in the midst of his prodigious post-<i>Illinois </i>experimentation. ""Heirloom"" and ""Arnika"" in particular have a comforting, early Sunday feel to them, not just in topicality, but in how you can practically hear the morning dew on the acoustics and delicate vocals. Throughout, Stevens is concerned about how you can connect with another individual without imposing yourself on them. ""Arnika"" is the most straightforward expression of this confusion, Stevens sighing, ""I'm tired of life/ I'm tired of waiting for someone/ I'm tired of prices/ I'm tired of waiting for something,"" quiet and devastating desperation seeping out like from a deflating balloon.  But framing them as a ""return to form"" sells them short; as affecting as his prior work in this range may have been, there was a certain compositional similarity to them, just four chords and a mellifluous melody. Here, you get Stevens taking more chances with structure and cadence, whether the stripped-down bluesy phrasing of ""Enchanting Ghost"" or the synth-spiked ""From the Mouth of Gabriel"" taking ""Seven Swans"" one step further by portraying God and possibly himself as a possessive, vengeful lover instead of just a devoted caretaker.</p>
<p>It isn't the mere existence of <i>Age of Adz </i>that puts this EP in perspective, though-- the electronic sonics of first taste ""I Walked"" are a blatant sign that we may ultimately have to retire the idea of Sufjan Stevens as a banjo-toting cartographer of the heart and the continental United States going forward. The scrapbook-like cover of <i>All Delighted People </i>makes sense then, as its contents serve as a humble and friendly keepsake, songs that deserve to be heard, but belonging to a chapter in Stevens' artistic livelihood that he needed to close to maintain his vitality.</p></div>"|14618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14618-all-delighted-people-ep/|7.6|Ian Cohen

Her alto is naturally bright and sassy, but she can contort it into soulful low tones, coquettishly thin coos, or an earthy twang. She's an engaging narrator with crisp, conversational elocution-- she bites into consonants with relish and is comfortable indulging in ooey-gooey vibrato if the mood is right. Though she's taken a more dominant role in her music-making, edging Blake Sennett out of the Rilo Kiley spotlight and delivering two solo records, she works best when bolstered by a collaborator.</p>
<p>Luckily, then, Lewis has returned to collaboration on <i>I'm Having Fun Now</i>, an album made with her boyfriend and folk troubadour Jonathan Rice, and she seems determined to do exactly what its title suggests. She sounds loose and carefree singing in googly-eyed harmony with Rice on nearly every track, as the two play almost every instrument themselves. The up-tempo numbers are sunny and exuberant despite their often-dark subject matter. (""Big Wave"", for example, deals explicitly with the current economic crisis, but it bounces along effervescently.) Part of the credit can go to Bright Eyes' Mike Mogis for his vivid, glossy production, but most of it belongs to Lewis and Rice, who simply sound happy to be singing together. On the album's best songs (the breezy ""Scissor Runner"", mellow gold sing-along ""Just Like Zeus""), they keep the instrumental arrangements simple and the rhythms gentle-but-energized to make room for their huge, candy-coated harmonies.</p>
<p>Though he is a crack sideman (playing with Lewis on her solo albums as well as recently backing Elvis Costello), Rice often bores in his solo work, mistaking dull, lumbering rhythms and smooth-vanilla vocals for the laid-back vibe of Laurel Canyon folk-rock. So <i>I'm Having Fun Now</i> is a triumph of symbiosis: She brings him to life, adding buoyancy and playfulness to his self-serious aesthetic, while he adds a welcome counterpoint to her vocals, matching her tart tones with his masculine ones. That said, Lewis is still the star here. ""Animal"", a leaden track that features Rice on lead vocals (and, presumably, his muddled, English-grad-student lyrics about how man without god is just an animal), is the biggest clunker.</p>
<p>Many will want to draw parallels between Jenny and Johnny and She &amp; Him (especially given Lewis' previous inclination toward the kind of vintage 1960s girl-group pop that She &amp; Him traffic in), but the songs on <i>I'm Having Fun Now</i> are rougher, tougher, and more rock'n'roll. The album is also a much more modern-sounding pop project, though it similarly owes its success to the chemistry of its creators.</p></div>"|14598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14598-im-having-fun-now/|6.7|Rebecca Raber

Sure, BJM main-man Anton Newcombe is the one seen starting onstage fistfights, getting arrested, and strung out in various stages of junkiedom-- but then everyone loves a good tortured-artist narrative. The Dandys, on the other hand, exemplified less valorous ideals: a combination of calculated careerism and-- when their 1995 signing to Capitol initially lead to creative clashes with the label-- naïveté about how the music industry really works.</p>
<p>However, as American Anglophiles emerging in the echo of the post-grunge alt-rock boom, the Dandys were always more spiritually in tune with the star-making machinations of major-label/mass-media culture than the Pacific Northwest indie scene that birthed them. Not only were they musically indebted to UK rock icons ranging from the Rolling Stones to Spiritualized, the Dandys also strove to emulate the sort of pop-star mythology cultivated in British music weeklies. With their haughtily named frontman (Courtney Taylor-Taylor), nose-ringed guitarist (Peter Holström), and frequently topless keyboardist (Zia McCabe), the Dandys projected an air of glamor, decadence, and aloofness that was anathema in a 1990s American indie culture that favored an everyman ideology.</p>
<p>And, despite some embarrassing missteps along the way, the Dandy Warhols performed about as well as one could hope for a kaleidoscope-eyed American rock outfit operating in an era of nu-metal mooks and Creedleback grunters. That the Dandys and Capitol eventually parted ways (2008's <i>Earth to the Dandy Warhols</i> was issued independently) could be seen as less a sign of the band's flagging commercial fortunes and more an indicator of a mission accomplished-- they arguably whetted the Stateside appetite for the gritty-but-stylized likes of the Strokes and the Hives, and their dalliances with David LaChapelle prefigured the symbiotic relationship between hipster rock bands and fashion media that's so prevalent today.</p>
<p>As a chronological overview of the band's major-label tenure, <i>Capitol Years</i> is naturally frontloaded with tracks from their two strongest albums, 1997's <i>...The Dandy Warhols Come Down</i> and 2000's <i>13 Tales From Urban Bohemia</i>. Removed from its heroin-chic context, <i>Come Down</i>'s brow-raising single ""Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth"" now sounds passé; the glam-slammed ""Boys Better"" and ""Every Day Should Be a Holiday"" stand as superior showcases of the Dandys' hedonistic allure. Alternately, where the band's 2000 Vodafone-assisted breakthrough ""Bohemian Like You"" plays right into the hands of detractors who claim the Dandys overvalue style over substance, the galloping ""Get Off"" reveals the less glamourous flipside to the up-all-night revelry-- when Taylor-Taylor sings, ""All I want to do is get off,"" it sounds less like an invite to intoxication than a sobering admission of addiction.</p>
<p>The Dandys' later years are marked by ideas that were either woefully misguided (the irritating-as-ever falsetto-funk stomp ""We Used to Be Friends""), recycled (""Holding Me Up"", from 2005, follows <i>Bohemia</i>'s ""Godless"" strum for strum) or just plain empty (the hook-less, strobe-lit rave-up ""This Is the Tide"", the lone previously unreleased track here). But the Dandys' most maligned album (2003's Nick Rhodes-produced <i>Welcome to the Monkeyhouse</i>) also yielded their most genuinely moving song: the Evan Dando collaboration ""The Last High"", a rewrite of the Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" whose synth-pop austerity effectively renders the loveless, lonely life of the world-touring, hotel-bound rocker. And, sometimes, you can't help being fascinated by their galling smarminess-- only a band as self-aware as the Dandys would attempt a self-satisfied celebration of cashing in like ""All the Money or the Simple Life Honey"". In that sense, <i>The Capitol Years</i> is less interesting as a compilation of one sporadically successful band's stint on a major label than a road map through an evolving underground rock culture, one in which the label of ""sell out"" has transformed from scarlet letter to badge of honor.</p></div>"|14587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14587-the-capitol-years-1995-2007/|5.0|Stuart Berman

In the 1990s, Markus Popp used the Oval name to make contemporary art that took sound as its form and the relationship between music and technology as its subject, which is to say music scrubbed (partially) clean of the bourgeois idea of the ""musician."" It was interesting to hear, sometimes even pleasant or dreamy or emotionally affecting, but that always seemed like a side effect rather than a goal. The records he made in that era supposedly made use of generative sound; the idea was that he set up the software and let it rip, and at some point the pieces that ended up on the albums came out of the machine like so many punch-cards.</p>
<p>Popp's role, of course, also included selecting, editing, and sequencing the material the software generated, which of course raised various questions. And the recordings themselves prominently featured the sounds of technology hitting its limits: digital distortion, glitchy microsecond-long tones and, more than anything else, skipping-CD noise. (For years, the standard joke when any CD skipped was ""I didn't know Oval had done a remix of this!"")</p>
<p>Popp took the better part of the past decade off from recording, and now he's returned with a deluge of new material. Oval's various 2010 releases-- the <i>Oh</i> EP, the two ""Ringtone"" EPs that have turned up as free downloads, and now <i>O</i>-- are built around digitally manipulated sounds that sound very much like they were originally made with human hands and metal strings. Possibly even bits of a guitar, if such an archaic device existed here in the future. The even-numbered tracks on the new album's first disc go one step further: they've got drumming on them, created by Popp using computer software.</p>
<p>However he's making it, Oval's new music is functionally much closer to his older music than to anything else, if a bit more skeletal-- nicely harmonized blips and smears of abstracted noise (with some relationship to plucked-string timbres a lot of the time), rhythms that sometimes splatter freely and sometimes snap to a regular pulse. It's lovely, it's pleasantly unsettling, and there's a hell of a lot of it. The ""songs""-with-drumming on the first disc alternate with briefer sketches, and the second disc is 50 ""ringtones"" that are just a minute or so long and explore a single texture or cluster of notes. So ""abundance"" is a concept in play too, along with ""acoustic sound,"" ""modern listening span,"" and ""hope you like our new direction!""</p>
<p>Popp has noted that ""riff"" is another one of the ideas he's engaging these days, although he apparently has an unusual definition of ""riff""; most of the tone patterns here could easily pass for an automatic sewing machine with a corrupted programming chip let loose on a hammer dulcimer. (About the only riff here that inspires ""oh, this one!"" reactions on a third or fourth listen belongs to the singsongy second-disc ringtone ""Jank""). But the <i>O/Oh/Ringtone</i> cluster of releases genuinely is a stretch from an artist who'd previously seemed like he'd worked himself into a corner. It takes a very different route from his earlier work. If it ends up in a very similar place, that just suggests his musical sensibilities have been asserting themselves all along.</p></div>"|14592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14592-o/|6.8|Douglas Wolk

Sure, a lot of people remember the 1980s as a golden age, and nobody's gone broke trying to reinforce that impression to the under-30s. But those of us who remember a different version of the 80s we're often sold, or who weren't there in the first place, might be tired of repetitive allusions to well-worn retro-pop memories. Whether or not you harbor any affection for the 80s, you've probably soaked most of it in by osmosis for years.</p>
<p>In that case, Los Angeles producer Dibiase has his work cut out for him. The dude even named himself after Ted DiBiase, an 80s WWF star whose son is now reprising his Million Dollar Man gimmick-- clearly he's not shy when it comes to looking backwards. <i>Machines Hate Me</i>, the full-length debut that follows up a scattered body of singles and remix work, evokes that era, using the tinny, chirping melodies of old Nintendo game soundtracks. The chiptune thing isn't as exotic as it used to be; by the time caffeinated indie-poppers Truckasauras and dubstep twiddler Quarta 330 put their spins on it a few years back, they had to put a lot of compositional uniqueness behind it to transcend the gimmick. Dibiase's own take is a bit simpler: he drizzles his NES burbles over recent-contemporary Project Blowed/[adult swim]-bumper hip-hop breaks that couldn't be more L.A. 2010 if you threw a Clayton Kershaw jersey on 'em. There's been no shortage of that lately, either.</p>
<p>The overall effect is an odd collision of nostalgia and nowness, as though Flying Lotus were called in to create some alternate soundtrack to <i>Excitebike</i> and kind of phoned it in. The off-kilter rhythms are a decent-enough variation of the beat-jostling boom-clap mutations that sprung up across Cali somewhere between Madlib's first Beat Konducta release and FlyLo's <i>Reset</i>. But their workmanlike appeal, solid without being especially propulsive, is undercut by the obviousness of the get-it? moments. Here's the fight music to <i>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! </i>chopped up over a basic neo-g-funk beat (""Clocked Out""), here's that old cliché cartoon creepy-ghost theme all synthesized up (""Phantom Power""), here's a beat that sounds half-built from sound effects from <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> (""Renegade Slap"").</p>
<p>Not every obvious moment leans on the old 8-bit sounds; ""Price Is Righteous"" uses what sounds like a tandem Fender Rhodes and ARP Odyssey to riff off the theme to guess which game show. But the tracks that do feel doubly dated, not just redolent of the 80s from whence they came but the mid 00s where this rearview glance felt less rote. Still, it wouldn't be that big a deal if Dibiase hadn't exhibited moments where he downplays the gimmickry and ambushes you with something completely unanticipated. For all the Tyco nightglow atmosphere, the better tracks-- the billowy, flute-melting sleepwalk ""Three Way Mirrors""; the haunted, crumbling soul of ""Lumberjack""-- reveal a producer who has more on his agenda than just reinterpretive flashbacks. It's easy to sound like the 80s, but the moments where Dibiase sounds like he's of a time not yet fully experienced are what justifies the effort.</p></div>"|14608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14608-machines-hate-me/|5.8|Nate Patrin

Firstly, he's spent 25 years in the ruthlessly self-correcting Radiohead, a band who tend not to go more than three records without ritually wringing themselves inside out and emerging from the studio, eyes bulging and ears ringing, with some newly invented sonic paradigm. Secondly, said band also includes Thom Yorke, whose own noted songwriting abilities and singing voice have by now gifted him with an unreasonably long shadow. Thirdly, Selway's a frigging drummer. In an arena rock band. And when was the last time any drummer in any rock band (much less arguably the world's biggest) put his drumsticks down to write some Nick Drakesian songs about family?</p>
<p>Make no mistake: This is a risk. A risk of exposure, credibility, mystique, whatever you want to call it, and Selway deserves credit for putting his newly elongated name on the line. The good(ish) news is that <i>Familial</i> is hardly an embarrassment. It's a modest, mannered record that prizes directness, simplicity and bittersweet sentiment above all, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. The highlights, such as they are, are front-loaded. With its delicately hooky chorus, lead single ""By Some Miracle"" is probably the most immediate thing here. Elsewhere, a cleverly syncopated vocal loop in ""Beyond Reason"" evokes some of Radiohead's sonic trickery, while ""All Eyes on You"" offers up an oddly naked account of Yorke's stage fright: ""So frail and small/ So scared you're terrified by all/ The eyes on you.""</p>
<p>The bad news is that Selway's material, tasteful and expertly played as it is, never fully transcends the novelty of who it's coming from. That two of the three highlights contain Radiohead callbacks should tell you something about the rest of the record. Even though Selway acquits himself as a capable an
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
d likable enough frontman, a lot of the material, especially on the second side, is ultimately just too bare, too slow, and too earnest to connect. For every one line that hits, there are two that shouldn't have made it out of first revisions. On ""A Simple Life"", the crowds pour out ""on a cold, cold night."" On ""Patron Saint"", Selway's played for a fool by ""a web of lies and compromise."" Such overtly earnest lyrics aren't helped by the unwavering politeness in his delivery, which, in being pretty-sounding but not much else, create a clear path for the clichés to land with a dull thud.</p>
<p>Selway's famous for his restraint as a drummer, so it's not a stretch to suspect that his response to being the frontman for the first time has been to crank up his natural predilection toward politeness. Unfortunately, in this instance, it feels like a counter-productive strategy. Fans of shivery folk music with subtle plateaus will surely find things to like, but the rest of you might find yourselves wishing the ""black dog"" in Selway's basement had a bit more bite. At least he let it outside.</p></div>"|14602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14602-familial/|4.9|Mark Pytlik

With Gucci's focus on nimble rap acrobatics over an almost flat-line production style, the record was a victory for lyrical density at the expense of the colorful songwriting and stylistic affects that characterized his 2007-2009 output. The multi-dimensional pop approach that congealed memorably on 2008's <i>The Movie</i> mixtape had taken a backseat, a possible by-product of his court-enforced sobriety. Maybe he's fallen from the wagon, because <i>Jewelry Selection</i> is a more musically dynamic record than <i>Mr. Zone 6</i>, and its production, much of it from longstanding collaborator Drumma Boi, again pops from the speakers.</p>
<p>This reflects well on both 2010 records and the Gucci project at large, his conceptual range letting fans choose their favorite approach. <i>Jewelry Selection</i> has its own drawbacks; despite competent rapping, ""Gucci Time"" is banal, a rehash of Jay-Z's ""On to the Next One"" with an unnecessarily shrill Justice sample. (Someone at Gucci HQ still hasn't figured out that it was the artist's untainted appeal, cf. ""Wasted"" and ""Lemonade"", that made for his greatest commercial successes.) It's also unclear why anyone thought the rote Rick Ross-style strip club banger ""Makin Love to the Money"" needed to mar two of his 2010 releases. But the bulk of <i>Jewelry Selection</i> works in much more novel terrain. Like so many of his best mixtapes, Gucci operates by zooming in on one strain of his style and blowing it up to LP length with a multitude of variations, adding new dimensions to a massive, shifting body of work.</p>
<p>In this case, he fleshes out the archetype captured by <i>The Burrrprint (2): HD</i>'s ""Coca Coca""-- darker lyrical themes delivered with straight-faced detachment over ominous, gothic production. What makes this vein particularly vibrant is how it balances the more eccentric elements of his persona with street rap's brutal, populist traditionalism. Gucci is a rap version of Heath Ledger's Joker, his exaggerated mania grounded by the violent reality he represents, the more rote gangster formulas given new life by his colorful charisma.</p>
<p>This minor-key noir infects the bulk of the record's best tracks-- from the early street-level drug talk (""Block Party"", ""Trap Talk"") to the whisper-flow menace of ""Cleopatra"" to the record's eerie peak, the one-word concept track ""Gross"". The mixtape warps its own street clichés the further it flows, ultimately draping them in horror film conceits on ""Poltergeist"" and ""Vampires"". In between you have enough variety to keep the record's sonic approach from feeling one-note. The tape is less concerned with technical fluency, and a few of the verses suggest Gucci may be hearkening back to the days of ""no pad, no pencil,"" but his lyrics and personality remain inventive. In the end, <i>Jewelry Selection</i> has stuck to the broad template that has paid such creative dividends for the past three years-- if you didn't like him before, this is unlikely to convert you-- but it does find the rapper once again pushing into new creative terrain.</p></div>"|14594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14594-jewelry-selection/|8.2|David Drake

But at five-plus minute runtimes, what might appear as a simple drum and keyboard loop slowly ingratiates, until the listener is in the same headspace as Dâm-Funk-- where a sketch of an idea can reveal its depth and impact. Repetition across records, however, can be a tough sell. The songs on Dâm-Funk's new EP are all generally very good, but if you're familiar with the L.A. producer's excellent <i>Toeachizown </i>series from last year, you could have guessed that already:<i> </i>Three out of four of them appeared in one form or another there.</p>
<p>In the time since, Dâm-Funk's added guest vocals to the tracks, taking what was repititous dance music and pushing it into the realm of the pop song. The songs in question: the title track, the former instrumental ""Hood Pass Intact"", now featuring average rapping by MC Eiht and a smooth vocal performance by Dâm-Funk; ""4 My Homies"", yet another former instrumental-- in this case, ""Killdat aka Killdatmuthafucka""-- now features George Clinton-esque vocals by Steve Arrington; and an instrumental re-edit of ""Come on Outside"" by Devinwho. All of them work with vocals, but even with those-- and a few minor cosmetic adjustments-- none of them improve on what was featured on <i>Toeachizown.</i> And while the EP possesses the album's warm nonchalance, shortening the length of two of these tracks removes some of their appeal.</p>
<p>The highlight is ""How It Be Between You and Me"", a five-and-a-half minute workout co-produced by JT Donaldson and Tim K. A ""Sexual Healing""-style drum break emerges out of street chatter, bass squiggles murmur through wah-wah guitar, and Dâm-Funk might as well be Usher on this track, doing some of his best singing work when he pleads, ""How will it be between you and me?/ I hope it will be true ecstasy/ OOH BAY-BAY!"" Lothario is a good look for him, particularly because the song exhibits a grasp of how such a posture can be done without coming across as cliché. It's one of many looks Dâm-Funk is trying on right now, and even if a dense discography makes it difficult for some to orient themselves within the producer's world, it also makes it all the more rewarding for those of us already turned into his work.</p></div>"|14589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14589-hood-pass-intact-ep/|7.4|Tal Rosenberg

That bicoastalism reveals itself neatly in the band's music. <i>Modern Rituals</i>, the group's full-length debut, blends NY backbeats and jaded vocals with woolly West Coast harmonies and mellow vibes, and it works in the sense that Chief don't sound explicitly beholden to any single sound or style. But having disparate influences is faint consolation when you're less than the sum of your parts, and Chief fail to be more than an amalgam of other, better bands.</p>
<p>At heart, Chief seem more or less like a bunch of hippies. Almost every song on <i>Modern Rituals</i> evokes a band of longhairs, whether it's the close, CSNY harmonies of ""The Minute I Saw It"" and ""This Land"", the stoned Meat Puppets deadpan that lead singer Evan Koga temporarily adopts on ""Breaking Walls"" (complete with spiraling My Morning Jacket-styled guitar figure), or the album's largely dippy lyrics, which hit their nadir on ""Summer's Day"" with Koga opining, ""I believe when I go/ You will cry tears of gold."" Chief's one good trick is occasionally tethering these free-floating vibes to something moodier and more metropolitan. This is most often accomplished by Koga, who, when he's not channeling Meat Puppets' Curt Kirkwood, prefers to deliver a deep, half-slurred croon that's a polite approximation of the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser. The hollow, lonely guitar lines and metronomic drumbeats of ""Nothing's Wrong"", ""In the Valley"", and ""Night and Day"" all balance out Chief's rootsy, Left-Coast somnolence with insistent NYC precision.</p>
<p>Yet what appears to be Chief's greatest asset might actually be their Achilles heel. The transcontinental breadth of the band's influences keeps Chief from coming across as pallid piggybackers of any one scene, but for a group that hasn't yet demonstrated an ability to nail down a particular sound, keeping so many balls in the air could be stretching its talents too thin. Perhaps that explains why Chief are rarely better than competent at anything they try to do here.</p></div>"|14576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14576-modern-rituals/|5.2|Joshua Love

The hazy, headswimming sound popularized by Flying Lotus' <i>Los Angeles</i> has been done to death (to the point that FlyLo himself seems to have moved on), both in the L.A. beat scene and in bedrooms all over the world. Lorn's debut on FlyLo's Brainfeeder label, <i>Nothing Else</i>, doesn't carry a trace of that saturated signifier, and whether intentionally or not, its exclusion seems like a statement. Here's 30 minutes of beat-driven bangers with very few zeitgeist-capturing gimmicks to be found-- in other words, nothing else but the basics.</p>
<p>Taking that title too literally would be to sell the album short, though, since there's quite a bit going on underneath the hood here. In particular, there's Lorn's beat-programming style, which is elegant in design but brutal and harsh in practice. Thanks to pristine mastering by Warp tech-head Clark, the tracks' rhythmic foundations hit with defined clarity and disorienting force-- even the puddle-droplet beat on ""Bretagne"" smacks like hail on sheet metal. All this could sound antagonistic and alienating were it not for the melodic color that fills out the leftover negative space.</p>
<p>Melody is ultimately what defines <i>Nothing Else</i>. While a good deal of his peers are focused simply on getting heads nodding and necks cracking, Lorn hones his ability toward making actual songs. The melodies are clean and linear, shot through with the bright, major-key sound of across-the-pond Purple practitioners like Joker and Guido. The ear-catchers flow like butter: the spiraling arpeggios of the ""Void"" cuts that act as the album's centerpiece, or the cybernetic sighs of ""Cherry Moon"". The simple touch of Rhodes-ish organ on the ironically titled ""Greatest Silence"" spells it out: This guy's having a lot of fun making this stuff, and you're supposed to have fun listening to it.</p>
<p>Here's the catch, though: <i>Nothing Else</i> carries an undercurrent of unease, one that's apparent from the martial, lockstep beat of ""Army of Fear"". Lorn teases drama out of these tracks, richening the overall atmosphere; even the wheezing, rocket-ship synth line in ""Automaton"" sounds like some sort of nuclear warning call. With every listen, <i>Nothing Else</i> becomes many things, including a crowd-pleasingly auspicious debut in a scene that could use more of exactly that.</p></div>"|14583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14583-nothing-else/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Back home in the UK, Klaxons won the 2007 Mercury Prize with that album, gave bombastic interviews that namedropped Pynchon and the KLF, and had four hit singles plus a handful of other songs that could have been. But in the U.S., <i>Myths </i>seemed victimized by the same distrust of UK next-big-things that also hamstrung Arctic Monkeys and Foals and ended up being a strange combination of overhyped <i>and </i>underrated.</p>
<p>More than anything, it was the nu-rave tag that hurt: For one thing, pretty much of all the rest of that stuff has aged poorly to date. But Klaxons aren't really nu-rave, they're a genre unto themselves; <i>Surfing the Void </i>confirms that. Through a range of imperious vocal stylings, Jamie Reynolds' lyrics convey the sort of proggy mumbo-jumbo borne of both arcane literature and psychedelic drugs, but couched within punishingly dense half-punk, half-arena freakouts that probably sound terrible if you're high. What is ""The Flashover"" and what will a ""myriad of silver disks"" have to do with it? Beats me, but that hardly matters-- what <i>does </i>matter is how the chorus bumrushes your ears like a wave of blitzing linebackers.</p>
<p>Klaxons' real roots in rave are that they play to the madness of crowds-- ""Echoes"" and ""Twin Flames"" are marked with undeniable, hands-in-the-air choruses that are nonsense out of context but gain power as shared experiences. By and large, Klaxons are less pop and more rock on <i>Surfing the Void</i>, and it's undoubtedly tied with having nu-metal's house producer Ross Robinson behind the boards after a number of rejected producers and aborted recording sessions. It was a risky decision from an artistic standpoint-- Robinson is a four-star general on the wrong side of respectability, and he rarely does anything out of the red.</p>
<p>But the partnership is mostly inspired here, as few are better at catching sheer physical impact on tape and the end-to-end intensity of Klaxons' trades out the brittle treble of <i>Myths </i>for a thickness that justifies them as a fully formed <i>rock band.</i> Yet, though <i>Surfing </i>can match <i>Myths </i>on a song-by-song basis, the Hulked-out sound occasionally comes at the expense of their frantic artiness. <i>Surfing </i>intentionally doesn't give you a whole lot of space to yourself, and ""Echoes"" is pretty much the only entry point. If it doesn't draw you in from the word go, I imagine it'd be a tough task to take the spastic title track or the nerdier, all-loud Pixies style of ""Venusia"" on a case-by-case basis. But while <i>Surfing </i>occasionally fails and does so loudly, but there's something thrillingly unfashionable about how Klaxons take aim at their grayer peers with a tommy gun full of glowsticks-- they don't always hit their target, but it's a gloriously fun mess all the same.</p></div>"|14597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14597-surfing-the-void/|7.2|Ian Cohen

It crossed over from the ""extreme"" ghetto because it was so versatile. You could drift out on it, as if it was a gorgeous ambient record with really heavy downbeats, or you could bang your head.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Broadrick has busied himself with side projects and a string of Jesu EPs, each of which has tweaked the <i>Conqueror </i>template in small ways: A little poppier here or a little heavier there, cranking up the guitars or ditching them in favor of keyboards. Some of these EPs have hidden a few of Jesu's most gorgeous songs, but they can also feel like Broadrick experimenting in public, slowly purging and refining and reshaping his music until he happens on the innovation that will anchor his next big-canvas album.</p>
<p><i>Jesu: Pale Sketches Demixed</i> both is and isn't one of these EPs. The source material comes from Jesu's 2007 odds-and-ends compilation <i>Pale Sketches</i>. You can certainly hear Jesu's most prominent element, Broadrick's Sabbath-slow variation on Kevin Shields' ""glide guitar"" sound, on several tracks. But by adopting the Pale Sketcher alias, Broadrick is also serving notice that fans should not come to this record expecting a new Jesu release. Play a techno fan <i>Demixed</i>'s closing track, ""Plans That Fade (Faded Dub)"", and they're more likely to guess it's something off Kompakt's most recent <i>Pop Ambient</i> compilation.</p>
<p>This is familiar ground for Broadrick, who's been part-timing as an electronic musician since Techno Animal's <i>Ghosts</i> in 1991. Hell, the perverse boom-bap of Godflesh's <i>Streetcleaner</i> might even count if we define things broadly enough. The point is: Broadrick knows his beats and synths. Given the source material, though, it's not surprising that his Pale Sketcher tunes are less oppressive, than his previous forays into industrial drum'n'bass (as Krackhead/JK Flesh) and murky drones (as Final). The mid-tempo drift of <i>Pale Sketches Demixed</i> evokes the fluffy electronic post-rock of Seefeel, and the ""electronic listening music"" of other early Warp acts, more than anything from the world of metal.</p>
<p>Despite its debts to ambient music, <i>Demixed</i> isn't quite background listening, but it definitely favors melody over momentum. This is important to note, considering that Jesu's idea of ""momentum"" was already about 50 BPM slower than your average pop band's. Leaving Broadrick's voice more or less intact, ""The Playgrounds Are Empty (Slumber Mix)"" and ""Supple Hope"" could be <i>Conqueror</i> B-sides, but most of <i>Demixed</i>'s fun comes from seeing how far Broadrick can stretch the original <i>Pale Sketches </i>material before the results no longer resemble Jesu at all.</p>
<p>""Don't Dream It (Mirage Mix)"" offers a predictably huge riff, with a distorted techno synth standing in for the guitar. But more striking are total rewrites like ""Dummy (Banhoff Version)"", where Broadrick drops the kind of digitized reggae bassline you'd never expect to hear on a Jesu record. It's unlikely that any of <i>Demixed</i>'s one-off experiments will make their way onto the next Jesu full-length, but this is a nice way to tide yourself over until Broadrick unveils the band's next evolutionary step.</p></div>"|14588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14588-jesu-pale-sketches-demixed/|6.5|Jess Harvell

The fun to pronounce doom-drone duo of UK guitarist/tape manipulator Alexander Tucker and New Zealandic cohort Daniel Beban deal in the kind of creaky spookhouse disquiet that whistles and thumps like a dark cabin on a stormy night; bilgey, sylvan drones overlaid with the occasional maniac-behind-the-door moan. <i>The Metallic Year</i> does get mighty eerie, but it only ever verges on startling.</p>
<p>Imbogodom begun when Beban, himself a guitarist and tape artist, was working as an engineer at the BBC World Service. Using a host of cast-off equipment dug up at the BBC's Bush House, he and Tucker crafted what would become <i>The Metallic Year</i>. Though his recent solo work's tended towards acoustic fingerpicking, Tucker's worked with Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley on a number of projects, an influence that shines through the cloudy <i>Metallic Year</i>; Imbogodom's rough-hewn, murky drones and Tucker and Beban's baritone vocal clamor recalls Sunn O)))'s recent work with Mayhem growler Atilla Csihar. Imbogodom's music is more diffuse, more acoustic-based, less tectonically threatening than Sunn O)))'s, yet similarly dank and foreboding; even the sparser, more windchimey stuff like ""Indosoap"" has neck hairs at attention.</p>
<p>After a blustery opening, Tucker and Beban move into the chiming ""Unseen Ticket"", a haunting, echoey gothic somewhere in the neighborhood of Califone or Matmos. ""By ""Of the Cloth"", with its tightening cyclone of strings and joyless bellowing, <i>Metallic Year</i> is down to unnerve. The record's second half continues in this fashion, alternating between spacious, suggestive mood pieces and the deeper, more physical drones, but the balance gradually shifts closer to the latter as the record goes on, evoking some looming dread that's finally ready to strike.</p>
<p>And <i>Metallic Year</i> could really be a thrill, were its compositions up to snuff with its thick atmosphere. These songs-- the results of a sort of collective improvisation that found the duo trading off between making the noises and messing with the tapes-- are, by design, fairly simplistic, clearly the work of two guys and a bunch of sooty reel-to-reels. And the tattered, collagist feel to these drones is alluring, certainly Imbogodom's greatest strength as a musical unit. But too often the pieces themselves seem content to buzz, groan, climax, and move on; one wishes, under all that rust and char, amidst these piles of frayed instruments, there were room for few more daring dynamic shifts. Things do get grislier near the end as the drones get growlier, but<i> The Metallic Year</i> has an odd reserve about it, and the climactic shit-he's-got-a-knife moment you find yourself waiting for never comes.

Since I didn't have a good idea of what Finnish folk would sound like and knew nothing about the Fonal label, I came to Kemialliset Ystävät expecting to hear acoustic guitars and maybe some vocal harmonies with perhaps the addition of a few stringed instruments native to the region. What I got instead was a dense tapestry of electro-acoustic sound, any individual aspect of which was difficult to source. There were samples and whirring electronics and weirdly tuned guitars and synthesizers and clomping percussion and processed vocals, all kind of swirled together into this woozy, colorful, undifferentiated jumble. But as impenetrable as the music was, it wasn't completely abstract, and there were melodies and careful arrangements popping out of the din that became more apparent the more closely I listened. After a while, the word ""folk"" began to seem just right: This had the feel of a music handed down through generations and re-created with the materials on hand. It's just that the materials on hand included things with circuit boards that you plugged into the wall.</p>
<p><i>Ullakkopalo</i> is the first Kemialliset Ystävät full-length in three years, and the project essentially picks up where 2007's self-titled album left off.  Which is to say that if someone casually interested in this band put the two albums on shuffle (maybe with some earlier Kemialliset Ystävät records thrown in), it would be tough to tell which track belonged to which release. Once again, there are voices, bleeps, acoustic strums, electric guitar leads, bits of chanting, some proper singing-- all put together just so, but arranged a way that stops well short of what most would define as a ""song."" But while the surface-level similarity of Kemialliset Ystävät albums is a consideration for someone with a number of releases by the project who might want to spend money on one more (and the gorgeous packaging of Fonal releases is a good argument for owning a physical copy), it doesn't diminish the force of the music as a whole. The essential character of Kemialliset Ystävät is that it feels like it grew out of something-- that there were certain rules in place and parameters for how the music would be constructed, and what emerged was an album with its own bent logic. In this particular environment, it feels natural for differences to be subtle.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that individual moments don't make themselves known upon repeated listens, to the point where you look forward to them. There are the haunted voices in ""Kivikasan Rauhassa"", which sound like a twisted version of a working song sung by cartoon dwarves marching into the mines. There's the toy keyboard melody of the swaying ""Ystävälliset Miekat"", which has the essence of both an early-1990s video game and a ceremonial middle ages dirge. There's the wonderfully compact guitar lead that opens ""Älä Koske Lintuja"", which sounds familiarly late-60s psych and alien simultaneously, a disorienting combo heightened by the sproingy percussion that follows.</p>
<p>Ultimately this music seems deeply <i>organic</i>, using a specific dictionary definition of the word: ""having an organization similar in its complexity to that of living things."" And because it sounds so connected to nature, it can be initially hard to absorb in its specifics. You could be standing in a field somewhere looking around and everything looks the same-- it's a field, like any other field. Or you could get down on your hands and knees and dig into the grass and notice the tiny things living there and how this blade is dead and that blade is half-eaten by something and so on. That's how Kemialliset Ystävät feels-- like something ready to be explored on whatever level feels right.</p></div>"|14593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14593-ullakkopalo/|7.6|Mark Richardson

A few weeks ago, with zero advance notice or context, Built to Spill's Brett Nelson released seven of his band's songs re-imagined as synth-pop tunes, scrambled their names into anagrams (""Goin' Against Your Mind"" = ""I Dim Our Angst In Agony"") and gave the project the dry, Alan-Lomax-sounding title, <i>The Electronic Anthology Project</i>. Why did he do this? Well, after spending some time with the results, it's still hard to say: it's either an extension of the goofy enthusiasm that made him think reggae Built to Spill might be a really awesome idea or a product of his rarely displayed jokey side, the one that made the fake ""preview"" of his upcoming album at the end of <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i> (""Look for the record with ME on the cover!!"") Either way, it makes for pretty inessential listening.</p>
<p>Passing this judgment feels odd, as the project was clearly meant as a goof. The studiously blank yellow cover, the idiosyncratic song selection, and the low profile all warn against taking <i>The Electronic Anthology Project</i> seriously.  And yet, the <i>idea</i> of synth-pop Built to Spill is exciting enough to be a little let down by this result.  Both sides of the band's sound-- the <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i> lo-fi phase and the liquid, majestic haze of their later years-- are rich with sonic possibilities. BtS leader Doug Martsch joined Nelson on the project, re-recorded some vocals, and helped mix the album; Martsch's guitar tone has always blended nicely with keyboards and synthesizers, and his shy, frail tenor is ideally suited, at least in theory, to synth-pop. However,  very little of any of these opportunities made it onto <i>The Electronic Anthology Project</i>. As you might say of a half-baked high-concept summer blockbuster, this one never really got past the pitch stage.</p>
<p>The synths throughout are generally stuck on a single preset, and it appears to be the same used for the Flash Man stage of <i>Mega Man II</i>. This tinny, chip-tune approach suits some BTS songs better than others.  On ""I Dim Our Angst in Agony"", ""Goin' Against Your Mind""'s gorgeous tangle of guitars is cruelly reduced to a pair of wormy, dueling sine waves. ""Get a Life"", a deep cut off of BTS debut, <i>Ultimate Alternative Wavers</i>, meanwhile, sounds improbably great reinvented as a piece of cheesy synth-rock, its guitar line suddenly a dead ringer for Europe's ""The Final Countdown"". The good moments almost make you wish Nelson and Martsch had taken this concept more seriously.  ""What If Your Dull"" turns ""I Would Hurt a Fly"" into drowsy, menacing trip-hop, while ""At the Where"" takes the disarming little love song ""The Weather"" and makes it sound like a moonlit distant cousin to Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"". If this were a side project and not a throwaway joke, it could be a great little album.</p></div>"|14584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14584-the-electronic-anthology-project/|6.4|Jayson Greene

For connoisseurs of rap beef, that's an intriguing one. Jeezy and Ross are really the only two relevant, popular Southern rappers who haven't had to do any jail time over the past few years, and they both work in an extremely similar style. They're evenly matched. On ""Death B4 Dishonor"", the first song on <i>1,000 Grams</i>, Jeezy hijacks the Ross track ""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)"", probably the summer's biggest straight-up banger, to throw a few thinly veiled barbs Ross' way.</p>
<p>Jeezy's issue: Ross has reappropriated the initials of the drug gang Black Mafia Family and the name of Big Meech, their imprisoned leader, someone who Jeezy knows. So: ""How you blowin' money fast? You don't know the crew/ Are you part of the fam? Shit, I never knew."" Ross has already responded in song, obliquely accusing Jeezy of, among other things, being from Cleveland-- some inside baseball shit that I don't even understand. Suffice to say: Potentially the biggest rap battle of 2010 is a squabble over who has more right to use the name of an incarcerated drug dealer. That's some deep silliness.</p>
<p>It also means the main takeaway of <i>1,000 Grams</i>, the second Jeezy mixtape this year, is <i>not</i> the music contained therein. The tracks here all feel like afterthoughts. That wasn't the case on the tape's predecessor, <i>Trap or Die II</i>. On that one, Jeezy exhibited some seriously canny beat selection, picking some of the most chaotically sinister synth-blares of his entire career and showcasing his absolutely nuts new single ""Lose My Mind"". But on <i>1,000 Grams</i>, Jeezy exclusively uses other people's beats, an old-school mixtape technique that not too many people mess with anymore. The tape finds Jeezy rapping over most of the bigger tracks of the last year or so. Sometimes those tracks work well with his voice, and sometimes they don't. Lex Luger's beats for ""B.M.F."" and Wacka Flocka Flame's ""Hard in the Paint"" sound like the synth-Sabbath stompers that Drumma Boy regularly makes for Jeezy, so he sounds right at home on them. But he's a mess on something like Timbaland and Drake's ""Say Something"", trying out an AutoTuned croon that the world really never needs to hear again.</p>
<p>Worse, Jeezy is basically playing Weird Al on the tape, adapting those tracks' original cadences and changing just enough words that the songs are now about dealing drugs. Diddy's ""Hello Good Morning"", for instance, now has this chorus: ""Yayo! Good morning!"" Kanye West's ""Power"", obviously, becomes ""Powder"". Five or six years into his career, Jeezy is still talking the same drug-talk he always has, and there's very little charge left in it when he's not on one of those superhuman beats that he just inhabits like nobody else. On 2008's great album <i>The Recession</i>, he widened his scope enough to talk about the world around him with the same force and passion that he'd always brought to the drug stuff, and he came away with his best album. But how he's back to zero-perspective rants about moving kis like he's in the drive-thru and Mickey D's or lovingly describing the way cocaine and baking soda harden up together. And artlessly jamming this stuff into other people's songs is not really working for him. It's just stupid.</p>
<p>Of course, the forthcoming Jeezy album could still be great. Jeezy thrives on a very specific kind of track, one where the grain of his voice can sink in deep and he has enough room to deliver his trademark ad-libs. And even this tape has some fun moments; I especially like how he pronounces ""monster"" like ""Munster"" so it'll rhyme with ""dumpster."" But as haphazardly curated as this thing is, the whole thing seems to exist to support his opening salvo against Ross. And judging by the respective quality of both this tape and Ross' great new <i>Teflon Don</i>, Jeezy is heading for a big L here.</p></div>"|14571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14571-1000-grams-vol-1/|4.2|Tom Breihan

They often felt as much like albums as compilations. Changes were natural; Kompakt grew in esteem and minimal techno progressed from upstart to establishment. The <i>Total</i> series morphed from essential to... a consistently lukewarm and increasingly lengthy collection of label tracks. For years, this has been acceptable.</p>
<p><i>Total 11</i> doesn't reverse this trend-- it's too long and offers less in the way of keepers than its immediate two or three predecessors-- but it does seem to signal a small but meaningful shift in the label's makeup. For the first time in the <i>Total</i> series, the Kompakt label seems explicitly in tune with the heritage of German electronic music, rather than obliquely so. To put it another way, Kompakt artists have always owed debts to Kraftwerk and Cluster-- how could they not?-- but they buried those affectations in a unique style. <i>Total 11</i> is backward-looking and variant in ways not often associated with the Cologne label.</p>
<p>As recently as <i>Total 9</i>, Tim Finney said Kompakt's ""apparently endless stream of glistening tech-house chugathons shows no sign of flagging."" <i>Total 11</i> flags: DJ Koze (leading off for the second straight year; probably time to drop the ""underrated"" label) dives further into his own Wonka-inspired hole; Mugwump all but ditch techno, favoring instead a looped slide guitar and loping back-porch beat; It's a Fine Line's ""Eins Fine Grind"" set a rockabilly riff to... Hammond organs? There's very few-frills pop music available too, in Popnoname's years-too-late Postal Service impersonation and GusGus' Ada-aided tropical lounge.</p>
<p>It's not all good, but, at the risk of sounding condescending, it's really encouraging. Kompakt will always keep certain torches lit-- see tracks here by the Field, Jürgen Paape, and Michael Mayer-- but even some older acts seem like they're starting to realize the diminishing returns of pumping out minimal bangers. Superpitcher turns in the weirdest-ever Superpitcher track, ""Lapdance"", in which a croaking singer pines openly for a lap dance. During other tracks you could draw straight lines to Manuel Göttsching, Cluster, <i>Tapes</i>-era Faust. The results feel less like a movement than a roster of artists who simultaneously but individually began tunneling inward.</p>
<p>This doesn't make <i>Total 11</i> a fantastic listen, necessarily; it is disjointed and wayward and 150 minutes long. It is perhaps the first entry in the <i>Total</i> series that doesn't even attempt to feel cohesive or representative of a larger scene, and the first truly lacking a standout track (though, if I must, I'll submit anything Ada is involved in for consideration). But collaboration and exploration seem more prevalent than they've been in years. At the beginning of its second decade, the <i>Total</i> series casts aside any notion of a return to form in favor of something more exciting but-- at least temporarily-- less fulfilling.</p></div>"|14582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14582-total-11/|6.2|Andrew Gaerig

<p class=""MsoNormal"">That sort of self-knowledge and eagerness to please permeates their third album <i>Barbara</i>: You get the idea that they <i>were </i>scientists on their first two albums, tinkering with the DNA of bands who managed commercial radio play between the Strokes and the Killers and distilling it down to a formula.<span> </span>Now they're simply machines, cranking it out with an efficiency and anonymity that borders on eerie.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""We're only after one thing,"" moans singer Keith Murray over the strangely hollowed-out arena rock of ""Pittsburgh"", and of course, that ""one thing"" Murray is talking about is a physical connection with another person; if an emotional one can be achieved, all the better.<span> </span>But it also serves as an unintentional metaphor for Murray's songwriting process, since even more than <i>Brain Thrust Mastery </i>or <i>With Love and Squalor </i>before it, <i>Barbara </i>is almost entirely about one thing and written almost entirely the same way.<span> </span>People in We Are Scientists songs get drunk, try to get laid, and know that the former can preclude the latter and serve as a remedy when these two goals don't align.<span> </span>And it's all so self-effacing that they never come off as skeevy or misanthropic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This in and of itself isn't a bad thing, and often bands who can expertly work in this particularly unbrainy realm are often unfairly overlooked.<span> </span>The problem is that Murray's point of view wants for detail and definition: You hope he gets his rocks off, but you never really root for him because you don't really get to know him.<span> </span>The trajectory of every story is basically preordained, and it

would be tiresome even if Lit's ""My Own Worst Enemy"" wasn't hovering over <i>Barbara </i>as an example of how this shit's supposed to work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's a serviceably bopping rave-up called ""Foreign Kicks"", which could be viewed as a nod to the French Kicks even if it had a completely different title.<span> </span>But for the most part, you basically get a milder Hot Hot Heat. In the end, <i>Barbara c</i>ould've been made by a computer with a specific coding procedure: bass riffs align themselves into right angles, sharp synth lines blare, hi-hats sizzle, hooks dissolve on contact, and 2004 never ends.</p>

His album covers for Rune Grammofon and Smalltown Supersound are dynamic, striking, and original. But only that last quality really pertains to his streamlined folktronica, which blends snippets of live instrumentation and field recordings with hip-hop breakbeats. There's a thin line between elegantly simple and undercooked, and Hiorthøy often seems more like a loop-maker than a songwriter. His albums contain lots of neat ideas, but a repetitive guitar twang, a few atmospheric scribbles, and a boom-bap beat don't necessarily add up to a satisfying composition.</p>
<p>From his 2000 debut, <i>Hei</i>, to his most recent LP, 2007's <i>My Last Day</i>, Hiorthøy has resolutely pursued this formula, so it's great to see him trying something new. Drivan is a multinational collaborative project featuring Hiorthøy, Louise Peterhoff, Lisa Östberg (Sweden), and Kristiina Viiala (Finland). They all met while working together on a dance piece called <i>The Potato Country </i>by Gunilla Heiborn, for which Hiorthøy composed the music, and then decided to continue their collaboration as Drivan. Unfortunately, this new configuration doesn't seem to have inspired many fresh ideas. Dominated by Hiorthøy's signature loops, <i>Disko </i>is distinguished from his prior work only by Swedish vocals and a slightly more ramshackle feel.</p>
<p>With its brief and often repetitive tracks, <i>Disko</i> suffers from the same sense of incompletion that has dogged Hiorthøy's solo albums. The songs seem to run in place, often ending almost exactly where they began. Once you've heard the first 12 seconds of ""Som en läderlapp"", you've pretty much heard it all, other than a few flashes of something horn-like and an inevitable, blocky snare pattern near the end. This wouldn't be a problem if the guitar phrase that pinions the song were livelier, but it's dryly recorded and melodically flat. ""Campingvagn"" follows a nearly identical formula, though its melody is happily spiced up with syncopated breaks and handclaps.</p>
<p>But the vocals! Surely the vocals add something to the music, right? Unfortunately, not often: They seemed mismatched. The singing is all airy, drifting melody, with little texture or dynamic rhythm. Meanwhile, the music is melodically lax but full of texture and rhythm. Neither gives the other much to work with, and you'll be hard pressed to remember a single tune. The frustrating part is that there are flashes of excellence throughout, like when Hiorthøy seamlessly blends a limber guitar part into coiling trip-hop drums on ""Inget mer sen"". Even better is ""Det gör ingenting"", a techno-inspired track for piano and drums with a forceful developmental arc. It makes the rest of the album sound thinner and more shapeless by comparison. Hiorthøy is evidently capable of doing more with a good idea than documenting it, drawing out viable compositions that progress and grow. We're left wondering why he doesn't do so more often.</p></div>"|14590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14590-disko/|5.3|Brian Howe

These tend to be pretty tall orders. He wants someone to take care of him... after he dies. He wants for your dreams (all your dreams) to come true. He wants to carve a face into the back of the sun. His new EP is another fount of longing, but it's driven by simpler, less metaphysical desires. Now he just wants to thank you for your love, and let you know that ""you are the treasure."" This directness is mirrored by the instrumentation, which seldom rises above a low-key saunter; by Antony's fluttering but rarely soaring delivery; and by the album cover: something uncomplicated and humble laid bare.</p>
<p>Antony is one of those singers with whom you build an intensely personal relationship. His invitation to indulge in the most immoderate emotions encourages it. As such, this EP is likely to invoke one of two responses from fans: Exaggerated disappointment over the smaller scale, or exaggerated gratitude simply to hear his voice again. The truth is somewhere in between: It's often good, but also quite slight. Between the title track (which will appear on the <i>Swanlights </i>LP), <i>The Crying Light </i><i></i>bonus track ""My Lord My Love"", and two surprising covers, there's just one original song that doesn't appear elsewhere: ""You Are the Treasure"", a brief dirge where a distant flock of Antonys warbles over stumbling piano keys.</p>
<p>Despite its slightness, <i>Thank You</i><i> </i>is a coherent and unique entry in Antony's catalog. It's a rare dispatch from the centered, undivided self. On <i>The Crying Light</i>, Antony seemed stuck in ""the middle place/ between light and nowhere"" that he feared so acutely on ""Hope There's Someone"". His restless crossing of borders imbued the music with urgency. But now, for once, he doesn't need another world: He's there.</p>
<p>The two covers demonstrate Antony's ability to make literally <i>anything </i>into a personal statement. In a different context, retraces of Bob Dylan and John Lennon would stick out like sore thumbs-- especially since the Dylan song is ""Pressing On"", a gospel barnburner from his reviled evangelical period, and the Lennon entry is the hopelessly overexposed ""Imagine"". But Antony's singular voice and deep rearrangements fully transform them. His ""Pressing On"" lilts playfully through a gentle rain of guitar arpeggios, chimes, and what sounds like thumb-piano. His ""Imagine"" is slow and gusty, though he wisely keeps the iconic dashes of falsetto so he can draw them out with shivery poise.</p>
<p>Not many singers could mess with these covers without making them eye-rolling, and not many could make them work conceptually with their own music. But among Antony's many gifts, his greatest might be the ability to unleash what is transcendent from the maudlin and the over-familiar. Switching ""Imagine"" to the first-person actually does a lot for it. Lennon presumptuously spoke for ""us,"" all the dreamers, as if there were any such monolithic entity with consistent desires. Antony deigns to speak only for himself, and it feels just right. It's also completely in line with the rest of the EP, stressing equanimity, generosity, and intimate scale. There are no grand, collective statements or demands, no extravagant gestures; only personal wishes for the well-being of others and a few quiet prayers from a singer who, for the rare moment, seems to have everything he needs for himself.</p></div>"|14579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14579-thank-you-for-your-love-ep/|7.5|Brian Howe

Plenty of this genre's practitioners have attended ritzy private schools, but these two bands <i>sounded </i>like it: melodically nimble and compact songs bedecked with chamber-pop sweetener and nods to 1980s art-rock. Of course, Ra Ra Riot never faced the same accusations of cultural appropriation or privilege (maybe because Syracuse isn't in the Ivy League?), but oddly enough, their detractors denounced them as even <i>less </i>edgy and more buttoned-up. Perhaps <i>The Orchard </i>is a reaction to that criticism; it pushes their stylistic range at the cost of hooks.</p>
<p>The record's up-tempo singles rehash the band's previous sound to slighter effect. The intentionally offbeat bass on ""Boy"" distracts, while ""Too Dramatic"" is anything but, its awkward rhymes sounding like parts of a melodic chain that's missing a couple of links. <i>The Orchard </i>is best when Ra Ra Riot integrate plusher production into more natural arrangements. While the rangy, chugging motorik of ""Massachusetts"" and ""You and I Know""'s dusky balladry (sung by cellist Alexandra Lawn) meander, they at least try something new, hinting that <i>The Orchard </i>might be something of a grower. But as soon as they build momentum with <i>The Orchard</i>'s most typically triumphant hook (""Shadowcasting""), the ironically titled ""Do You Remember"" kicks off a final third that fails to leave any impression.</p>
<p>Any band with a successful debut is tempted to make its next album reactionary, but if Ra Ra Riot were set on doing so, they could've learned something from VW's <i>Contra</i>, a sonically rich and fearless comeback that sounded like the work of a band who, as our Mike Powell said, had ""fallen in love with what they started and are hugging it tight without shame or apology."" Instead, Ra Ra Riot sound overly self-conscious, the rural environs of their recording space failing to provide the warmth, empathy, or exuberance of <i>The Rhumb Line</i>. They've survived worse things than a bum album (between their self-titled EP and <i>The Rhumb Line, </i>drummer John Pike passed away), so it would be foolish to write them off, but <i>The Orchard </i>at the very least can prove that making something as effortlessly amiable as <i>The Rhumb Line </i>isn't as easy at it seems.</p></div>"|14574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14574-the-orchard/|5.7|Ian Cohen

But I'm not hearing a whole lot of <i>chaos</i>-- the sense of apocalyptic noise-riffs exploding, of producers layering as many weird elements as they could manage on top of each other. That's what used to keep me up listening to the one weekly techno radio show on my crappy clock radio, ear up to the speaker, getting my mind blown by stuff like the Prodigy's ""Charly"" or L.A. Style's ""James Brown Is Dead"". These days, nobody really gives me that feeling like the Brooklyn producer Kingdom.</p>
<p>Kingdom made his first real dent earlier this year with ""Mind Reader"", a gleefully frantic pileup of house-diva wails and euphoric bass-farts. Next to that, the new EP <i>That Mystic </i>feels restrained to the point of austerity. But there's still a ton of shit happening here. Kingdom maintains the same sort of head-rush intensity of early-90s rave producers-- so many different percussive synth riffs beeping their way onto the track and than bouncing all around the interior like ping-pong balls. But as many new elements as Kingdom introduces, he keeps everything working in service of the basic, central pulse at the heart of every song.</p>
<p>That's especially true on the opening title track, which sets the blueprint while the other tracks just get busy within that foundation. But even as one track, ""Pang"", almost works as an experiment in straight-up dubstep, there's still a cluttered sort of simplicity at work here. All those bleeps and dings and whirs are there for a reason, and they all serve the tracks' central propulsion. This is <i>fun </i>music, and it doesn't have any big aim beyond that.</p>
<p>One neat wrinkle on this EP: Kingdom has a habit of sampling kinda-big R&amp;B hits like Cassie's ""Me &amp; U"" and Beyoncé's ""Sweet Dreams"", taking ghostly snatches of those familiar vocals and letting them flit around in the background, dodging in and out of the beats. Those songs are new enough that they still exist somewhere within memory, but old enough that it takes a second to dredge up where that little slice of vocal comes from. They sound like just-out-of-reach memories. But Kingdom never builds his tracks around those samples, and he rarely introduces them in the first half of the track. They're just one more weapon in the arsenal-- and that arsenal's getting bigger all the time.</p></div>"|14585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14585-that-mystic-ep/|7.9|Tom Breihan

All of the songs are focused on love and relationships; the arrangements are wistful, melodramatic, and lovelorn. Her voice, elegant and disarming in its directness, conveys a gentle heartbreak even when she's singing about being in love. The sound is sweeping and slick, but also springy and sharp, a contrast similar to early-90s recordings by Morrissey and the Sundays. Even the darkest moments of the album sound like a girly fantasy.</p>
<p>Dougall has come a long way since her tenure as a singer in what can now be considered the classic line-up of the Pipettes. She had a few songwriting credits while in that band-- most notably the singles ""Judy"" and ""Dirty Mind""-- but here she's developed into a mature talent with a knack for melancholy balladry. Though she has entirely abandoned the girl-group conceit of her previous group, there's a thematic and stylistic continuity between those old songs and the music with her new backing band, the Distractions, on <i>Without Why</i>. Basically, it sounds like she's grown up a bit.</p>
<p>Dougall has moved away from the playful, sassy tone of the Pipettes, and embraced a deeper, more earnest approach to thinking about relationships, appropriate for someone entering her mid-twenties. Whereas she previously sang songs mainly about infatuation and the politics of casual dating, she's dealing with stronger, more complicated feelings now. Even the most assured songs, like the joyful ""Fallen Over"", grapple with some degree of ambivalence and insecurity. In ""Find Me Out"", she's desperately afraid that her partner will discover she's not good enough; ""Another Version of Pop Song"" has her warning a suitor, ""Please don't say that it's forever, or that we belong together/ It's all I really know for now."" As much as the songs evoke the butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling of cinematic romance, there's a stubborn insistence on dealing with love as realistically as possible. It's like young adult fiction with the anxious soul of droll British comedy.</p>
<p>Aside from the gorgeous finale ""May Holiday"", the best tracks on<i> Without Why</i> have already been released as singles over the past two years. ""Stop Start Synchro"" opens the record with sparkling glamor; ""Another Version of Pop Song"" is a dizzying, effervescent swirl of keyboards and strings. ""Fallen Over"" is propelled by an assertive beat and bold guitars, while ""Find Me Out"" goes to the opposite extreme with its serene sadness. There are some fine album tracks here-- ""Carry On"" and ""Come Away With Me"" are especially good and single-worthy-- but as much as the record is consistent in quality and tone, it's hard to avoid concentrating on its obvious peaks. Her slowest songs are her weakest, though they add a necessary dynamic to the album's sequencing. ""Watching"" and ""Third Attempt"" start off with an appealing stillness, but they grow stagnant and static before reaching their conclusion. It's not that those songs are bad-- they both have fine melodies and good ideas-- but that they drag on a bit too long. It's a minor problem, though. As a whole, <i>Without Why</i> is an unusually confident and expertly crafted debut.</p></div>"|14581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14581-without-why/|7.6|Matthew Perpetua

The most common mistake cartoonists make is to oversell their fictional rockers' coolness, or to go heavy on ""hip"" references in the hope of either impressing or flattering their readers. Bryan Lee O'Malley's <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> series succeeds mainly because he was never overtly striving for coolness, and he clearly understood the lives of young indie rock musicians. Rock'n'roll was mainly just something his characters did for fun, and so that's what came through on his pages: Characters, fun. O'Malley's title character is the bassist in Sex Bob-omb, a garage band that is not especially good, but could believably get by on charm and a well-circulated mp3. The other bands in the series are familiar indie rock archetypes bent into fanciful, humorous abstractions-- The Clash at Demonhead are so arty and glamorous that they seem to exist primarily to make their audience feel insecure; Crash and the Boys are a noise-punk band blessed with inexplicable super powers.</p>
<p>Getting this music right was one of the top challenges facing Edgar Wright in his film adaptation of O'Malley's comics. Putting comic book characters on the big screen is no big deal in the age of CGI, but making music that matched the imaginary sounds in reader's heads is a tall order. For the most part, Wright and his collaborators nailed it. Beck, who wrote all of the material for Sex Bob-omb, captures the ramshackle energy implied in the comics. Sure, his songs may be slightly better than Sex Bob-omb ought to be, but does anyone want to sit through inept music in a movie theater, much less at home while listening to a soundtrack? No way. Beck-sung versions of the Sex Bob-omb tracks appear along with the movie band recordings, and the latter are much more enjoyable. These songs are meant to be scrappy, and though Beck loosens up a bit, he still sounds like a pro. Also, while ""Garbage Truck"" and ""Threshold"" may be great tunes for a fictional garage band, they're mediocre at best by Beck standards.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the music from the comics, Metric turn out to be a very good stand-in for the Clash at Demonhead, capturing their icy, synth-heavy bombast simply by being exactly who they are. Members of Broken Social Scene provide the music for Crash and the Boys, and though they hit their mark in terms of conveying the humor of frantic under-one-minute numbers like ""I'm So Sad, So Very, Very Sad"" and ""We Hate You Please Die"", the results are a bit too straight-forward for a group that ought to be far more weird and unreal. Nevertheless, Brendan Canning and his bandmates are forgiven for not actually possessing musical super powers. Frustratingly, not all of the music written for O'Malley's characters is included on this soundtrack-- compositions by Cornelius, Dan the Automator, and Nigel Godrich are all featured on the original score album. This isn't a huge inconvenience in the era of à la carte album tracks, but Dan the Automator's faux-Bollywood number and the track featuring a musical duel between Beck's Sex Bob-omb and Cornelius' Katayanagi Twins are amusing, and worthwhile for hardcore fans.</p>
<p>The rest of the soundtrack is padded out with pre-existing songs. The best of this lot is Plumtree's ""Scott Pilgrim"", the mid-90s indie-pop gem that gave O'Malley's hero his name. It's easy to understand why this song inspired O'Malley to create his ditzy, rocking, kung fu fighting protagonist-- it's deliriously catchy and wonderfully surreal. Other inclusions are memorable musical cues: Frank Black's ""I Heard Ramona Sing"" from when Scott meets his love interest, Ramona Flowers; the Rolling Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" from the part where it looks like Scott has been made totally irrelevant by his archnemesis. T. Rex's heart-melting ""Teenage Dream"" has roughly the same utility in the movie as Gary Wright's ""Dream Weaver"" does in <i>Wayne's World</i>. Previously released selections by the Bluetones, the Black Lips, Blood Red Shoes, Broken Social Scene, and Beachwood Sparks-- did Wright raid only the B section of his record collection?-- carry the general vibe of the movie and make for decent mix CD fodder, but aren't particularly essential.</p>
<p>Even with some unnecessary and redundant inclusions, the soundtrack comes together very well as a whole. Whereas many modern film soundtracks are glorified compilation discs with a seemingly random track selection, the <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World </i>soundtrack is very thoughtful in its curation and stands as a very accurate interpretation of O'Malley's fictional world.</p></div>"|14577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14577-scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-ost/|6.7|Matthew Perpetua

Mogwai's first live package-- a concert recording, <i>Special Moves</i>, and a DVD companion, <i>Burning</i>, with a different tracklist-- does not adhere to any of the above criteria. On the surface, it's simply a document of a band in their 14th year, touring behind their least remarkable album to date-- and as far as mythic locations go, the Music Hall of Williamsburg ain't exactly Pompeii. Judging by the wide array of physical/digital purchasing options available on the band's website, the real purpose of this release is to test out new e-commerce possibilities for the band.</p>
<p>However, as <i>Special Moves</i> handily attests, Mogwai don't require additional context to create a sense of an Event-- for the veteran Scottish post-rock quintet, even an ordinary night on the job is full of extraordinary moments. And with 2006's <i>Mr. Beast</i> and 2008's <i>The Hawk Is Howling</i> being greeted with a more mixed reception compared to the band's earth-quaking early releases, <i>Special Moves</i>-- which pulls at least one track from all six Mogwai albums, but no more than two-- strategically positions the band's latter-day material among the old warhorses to build a set list that gradually intensifies and explodes like the band's best instrumental epics. As such, <i>Special Moves</i> represents more than a recording of a specific 2009 concert series in Brooklyn-- it also functions as a compact but thorough career retrospective, and a convenient entry point for newcomers into the band's formidable discography.</p>
<p>The stark, high-contrast black-and-white images presented by directors Vincent Moon and Nathanaël Le Scouarnec in <i>Burning</i> may have been intended as a visual analogue for the extremes Mogwai often favor in their music, but the song selection here provides the band with ample opportunity to explore the space between serenity and cacophony. What's especially impressive about <i>Special Moves</i> is how Mogwai deploy their few vocal tracks to alternately heighten and diffuse tension. Following the ominous scene setters of <i>Hawk</i>'s ""I'm Jim Morrison, I'm Dead"" and <i>Mr. Beast</i>'s ""Friend of the Night"", the show-- and, particularly, the audience-- really come to life with <i>Happy Songs for Happy People</i>'s ""Hunted By a Freak"", whose eerily obscured vocal melody is crucial to the song's gilded, mountainous majesty; by contrast, the band respectively positions two of their most affecting ballads (""Cody"", ""2 Rights Make 1 Wrong"") next to two of their most sadistically savage (""Mogwai Fear Satan"", ""Like Herod""), as if to counter the band's reputation as devious, smart-assed noisemakers. Mogwai also seem eager to challenge the notion that their best work is 10 years behind them: They close out <i>Special Moves</i> with a rampaging version of Mr. Beast's ""Glasgow Mega-Snake"" that makes the preceding, suitably apocalyptic reading of ""Like Herod"" seem like a mere warm-up exercise.</p></div>"|14573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14573-special-moves/|8.2|Stuart Berman

Two years later, when the band jumped ship to Matador, they asked for the 9xCD <i>Stax-Volt Complete Singles 1959-1968</i>. As band lore has it, Caroline never sprang for the set, and the Blues Explosion's tenure there was short-lived and acrimonious. Matador, on the other hand, made good with Stax, and the band enjoyed a decade-long partnership with the label. Business relations aside, these two signing requests neatly signal the musical differences between the band's first few releases as well as between the latest installments in this ongoing reissue series. <i>Year One</i>, which collects on one disc the band's first three releases-- all from 1991 and '92, hence the title-- is the Blues Explosion at their most explosive, thundering through nearly 40 tracks with the devil-may-care insouciance of the Killer in his prime. They even cover Lewis' ""Lovin' Up a Storm"" and roll in a few measures of ""Great Balls of Fire"".</p>
<p><i>Year One</i> is the noisiest, most abrasive, and most alienating collection the Blues Explosion has released, for better or for worse. The energy is there. So are the smarts. So is the general concept. But the band is still in its infancy, so its still figuring out how to translate those three primary qualities into music. Spencer hollers and howls like a Tex Avery cartoon, while Russell Simins bludgeons his drums and Judah Bauer punishes his guitar, and together they generate a volatility that's recognizably JSBX. Yet, songs like ""Comeback"" and ""Maynard Ave."" fidget uncomfortably and never really get moving. In general, they sound unfocused and undisciplined, which means that at 38 tracks, <i>Year One</i> can be a long, hard album to take in.</p>
<p>Still, there are so many moments when everything falls into place, when the band sounds all the more boisterous and uncontrollable-- all the more revelatory 19 years later-- for being so ragged and rough. Especially as <i>Year One</i> moves into the material the band recorded with Steve Albini, the music gets messier, more aggressive, more reckless: They light up ""History of Sex"" like Lewis setting fire to a piano, while ""40 Lb Block of Cheese"" shows the band at its most genially wacky. Best of all may be ""Mo' Chicken-Let's Get Funky"", which lives up to its title as soon as Simins comes in at double time. They speed through the Hound Dog Taylor cover just a little more rapidly than necessary, as if they can barely keep the song under control.</p>
<p>To say that <i>Extra Width</i> and its partner <i>Mo' Width</i> sound sleeker and more sophisticated is actually to say very little with that point of comparison. Still, considering it was recorded less than a year after the releases that comprise <i>Year One</i>, these two long-players show just how far the band had come in a short time, thanks to a triumphant tour opening for the Jesus Lizard (""Fuck yeah, that was a hard act to follow,"" David Yow testifies in the liner notes). But they haven't lost that excitability: If the Blues Explosion thrives on viscera and hyperbole, <i>Extra Width</i> may be the most visceral and hyperbolic they've ever sounded. It is, in other words, quintessential JSBX.</p>
<p>About that signing bonus: The band recorded both <i>Extra</i> and <i>Mo' Width</i> at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, home not only to Sun Studio but also to Stax Records. But Sun was a tourist trap; Stax was still just a legend, the building having been demolished a decade prior. These songs are slightly less punk and slightly more funk-- a bit more refined but still jagged around the edges. They've obviously learned a lot from Booker T. &amp; the MGs, and that's not just the organ on ""Soul Typecast"". Bauer's guitar possesses a newfound compactness and eloquence reminiscent of Steve Cropper, and Simins lays down beats that nod rhythmically to one of the greatest soul drummers, Al Jackson, Jr. Like Stax and the best soul, the band focus less on songs than on moments within songs-- the stop-start intensity of ""Inside the World of the Blues Explosion"", Spencer's indecipherable delivery on ""Afro"", the back-and-forth with Bauer on ""History of Lies"".</p>
<p>What these two reissues demonstrate, perhaps more than any other pair in this excellent series, is just how wide a net the Blues Explosion cast. Name aside, they weren't fascinated by the blues solely, but were equally enamored with and even moved by soul, funk, early rock, rockabilly, even jazz, all of which they filtered through a late-80s indie aesthetic. Nowhere is that diversity more apparent than the 24-track bonus disc that accompanies <i>Extra</i> and <i>Mo' Width</i>. It begins with what sounds like a rewrite of the ""Peter Gunn Theme"" and ends 23 tracks later with Spencer doing his best coked-up Elvis on a live version of ""The World of Sex"". In between Spencer unleashes his gutter falsetto and of course that sci-fi theremin, and the band plow through salty surf rock, Texas boogie rock, tongue-in-cheek schmaltz, some moldering holiday chestnuts, and what sounds like the most mutant strain of hardcore imaginable. Compiled by Spencer himself, this expertly curated set reveals the band's great affection for these sounds and styles, not to mention for their purveyors. The great misunderstanding in the early 90s-- one that survives today-- is that somehow the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion were making fun of their influences, but really they were trying to rescue them from being whitewashed by too many reverent critics and too many museum-worthy box sets.</p></div>"|14575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14575-year-one-extra-widthmo-width-deluxe/|7.1|Stephen M.

Clayton's earliest mixes (<i>Gold Teeth Thief</i>, <i>Minesweeper Suite</i>) were purposefully cluttered and frenetic; recent mixes such as <i>Uproot</i> and <i>Solar Life Raft</i> can be characterized by spatial openness, loping beats, and ethereal instrumentation. Some of Clayton's abrasive elements still exist, but they've been downscaled to reveal increasing levels of beauty, as unsettling as that beauty may be. If there's a perceptible trope of this Clayton-mixed and -curated selection of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, rap group CIAfrica's music, it's that it recalls his earlier disposition towards high-pressure, discordant sounds.</p>
<p>While there's still openness in these beats (produced by Amadou aka Greendog), the elements that do exist are usually loud and atonal. Bass drums sound compressed, hitting the speakers at splintering frequency levels; the few non-percussive components are sonar pings and bass buzzes and melting horns and car crashes and jet plane landings. A sonic connection is the digital grime of Dizzee Rascal's <i>Boy in da Corner</i>, with video game sound effects turned up to high volume and then reassembled into a composition of bleepy rhythms. But even then, there was more variation in the sound and tone of the music, whereas here the beats are less distinguishable. Manusa and Nasty, male and female respectively, are the star rappers of CIAfrica. But aside from that, the male MCs are difficult to parse from one another, and there isn't much to distinguish the voices themselves, which are often delivered in a shouty rapping that's closer to the spitting of an MC's crew than the voice of a distinctive MC. And the mixing of the voices is seemingly recorded at the same volume as the music itself and smeared into a big, bulbous blur.</p>
<p>In an interview with this site from last summer, Clayton professed what he loved about CIAfrica's music: ""its [sic] great because people think like the Very Best, 'Oh African music, it's dancey, it's happy, nice melodies, very uplifting' and these guys are abrasive, synthetic, angular, non-dancey lyric-driven music. It's fantastic."" This is both CIAfrica's appeal as well as its misgiving. The turbulent minimalism of the music is indeed striking and a welcome alternative to most African music that comes stateside, which tends to be sunnier and breezier. But because of the Puritanism of the music's structure and sounds, there isn't much that separates individual songs from the mix's unified aesthetic, even though the aesthetic is one worth building on and paying attention to in the future.</p></div>"|14580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14580-dj-rupture-presents-ciafrica/|6.4|Tal Rosenberg

The band's crunchy sound and ready-for-airplay hooks recall FM glory days when bands like Veruca Salt and Letters to Cleo were rattling around the buzz bin.</p>
<p>What could be merely a retro exercise actually turns out to be a pretty fun rock record. Borrowing from the 1990s isn't exactly novel at this point, but indie bands of late have been more likely to pilfer from noisy independent labels like Slumberland and Siltbreeze. The kind of guitar rock Magneta Lane favor doesn't have these signifiers, but is instead slick, methodical, and, if done right, crazy catchy. And <i>Gambling With God</i> is that sound ""done right,"" almost to a fault. Even fans of the band's previous two releases, 2004's debut EP <i>The Constant Lover</i> and 2006's <i>Dancing With Daggers </i>LP, might have some trouble with the production here. Magneta Lane's songwriting has always been straightforward, but their sound used to have an edge of punky danger, supplied mainly by guitarist Lexi Valentine's rough-around-the-edges riffs. Any elements of tension have been sanded down on <i>Gambling With God</i> until they're smooth as marble.</p>
<p>The bright sheen on the tracks is an adjustment. And when paired with the heard-it-before opening chords on first track ""Lady Bones"", it definitely causes the record to get off on the wrong foot. But stick with it, and you'll find that Magneta Lane have hooks to spare. The first three tracks, particularly ""Lady Bones"" and ""Castles"", are instantly earworm-y, and even more pleasantly so if you can manage to tune out the lyrics. Other elements are engaging throwbacks to earlier styles, like the chugging rhythm and fluid melody on the title track, which are reminiscent of the Pretenders' ""Back on the Chain Gang"".</p>
<p>It's fun stuff, but also best enjoyed in small doses, as a front-to-back listen of <i>Gambling With God</i> comes off as a little samey. The fact that the lone ""slow jam"" here is a momentum killer (the acoustic album centerpiece ""September Came"") is another hurdle. But clear it and you'll reach album standout, ""Bloody French"", which does away with a conventional verse-chorus-verse structure for a constantly shifting melody and rolling drums. The effect here is akin to someone changing the radio station without asking first-- it's unexpectedly pleasant, but what you were listening to before wasn't too bad either.</p></div>"|14563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14563-gambling-with-god/|6.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

But if you had imagined a more exotic origin for the Norse psych-folk singer-- a stretch of old growth forest, a long-forgotten Eastern Bloc hermitage, or maybe Middle Earth-- you could be forgiven. When Islaja's first album, <i>Meritie</i>, landed on U.S. record store shelves in 2004, it sounded otherworldly-- a strange brew of toy piano plinks, discordant guitar strums, and Kokkonen's haunting, child-like vocals. Even back then, in the heyday of freak-folk and New Weird America, it was peculiar and unique music. These days it's a little easier to pin down where she's hanging out, though: behind a laptop.</p>
<p><i>Keraaminen Pää</i>, Islaja's fourth record, was recorded on the run-- produced and conceived by Kokkonen while she hopped between Berlin, Helsinki, Grand Popo, and Hong Kong. The acoustic guitars, pump organs, pianos, and field recordings-- key elements of Islaja's earlier work-- are mostly absent here, possibly out of design, possibly out of necessity. After all, it's easier to travel light. Instead, <i>Keraaminen Pää</i> leans heavily on electronics-- icy synth tones, crunchy samples, and abstract gurgles. The music moves at a glacial pace; it grunts and buzzes. Kokkonen's voice, long shrouded in a haze of analog tape hiss, gets a digital facelift here. For the first time, her vocals are clearly and cleanly recorded.</p>
<p>For a record conceived mid-walkabout, it's a moody affair. Imagine a surrealist take on Marianne Faithfull's bleaker work. Feelings of emptiness and obsession are portrayed from strange sidelong angles. ""I was at your mercy and mercy was all I lived on/ I was a ceramic head on wooden shoulders,"" sings Kokkonen on album opener ""Joku Toi Radion (Someone Brought a Radio)"". On ""Dadahuulet (Dada Lips)"" necking is reframed as a series of tough Twister moves. ""Put hand in their hand, your tongue on their hand, lips on their nape and nose on their neck,"" she whispers.</p>
<p>Islaja is not the first folkie to embrace electronics-- samplers gave Animal Collective a second wind and Richard Youngs has been ringing squawks and warbles out of his computer for years. But Kokkonen's shift in execution comes with a cost. Where her music once seemed alien-- untethered from time and place-- the cold clicks and hums of <i>Keraaminen Pää</i> come off sounding modern, mechanical, and familiar.</p></div>"|14578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14578-keraaminen-paa/|6.6|Aaron Leitko

That frigid, dripping coating comes to define the record's sound as well, as the grooves here are chilly. Synth lines shiver and vibrate on top of dry, crackling drum hits. Frontman Nic Offer's vocals have sounded increasingly refined from<i> Myth Takes</i> on, and as such they're duskier here, as Offer takes on a window-fogging low register when he's not singing the straightforward hooks located on the record.</p>
<p>Those hooks are few and far between, as <i>Strange Weather </i>features a greater focus on texture and mood than conventional melody. Which isn't to say the band isn't capable of indelible earworms; the front half of the record is loaded (frontloaded, perhaps) with exactly those, like the sing-songy chorus on ""The Most Certain Sure"", the shades-drawn invocations of this album's Best Titled !!! Song award recipient, ""Jamie, My Intentions Are Bass"", and the disco drops of ""Steady as the Sidewalk Cracks"". Otherwise, !!! are content to follow whatever extended-mix indulgence that comes to them on this record, and it's not always a good look. Sure, this is their shortest release on Warp yet, and there aren't any side-long cuts here like <i>Myth Takes</i>' eight-minute-plus ""Bend Over Beethoven"" or the still-titanic <i>Louden Up Now</i> back-ender ""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)"", but <i>Strange Weather, Isn't It?</i> feels like it has its share of filler regardless.</p>
<p>Some of the shorter tracks here act as interstitials, ostensibly to keep the transition between the heavy jams as seamless as any DJ mix, but instead they bring any rising action to a halt. Despite a shouty diva vocal, ""Wannagain Wannagain"" lacks any sort of visceral smack to make things more compelling; the one-two punch of ""Hollow"" and ""Jump Back"", on the other hand, feel more like a double dose of Ambien, with the former especially sounding drained of kinetic energy. When the band heads down the rhythmic rabbit hole here, the results are mixed as well. While the streaked, strung-out midsection of ""The Most Certain Sure"" is ample material for glassy-eyed dance enthusiasts, it's obvious almost from the beginning of the record's Second Best Titled !!! Song also-ran, ""Even Judas Gave Jesus a Kiss"", that the song's not going to head past the midtempo melody that kicks it off.</p>
<p>As such, the album's more engaging moments stand out even more (the oscillating breakdown of ""The Hammer"", the sax line that takes out ""Steady as the Sidewalk Cracks"", each and every second of ""The Most Certain Sure""), but the general disparity of these few-and-far-between moments amidst the record's more driftless filler sadly cements the fate of <i>Strange Weather, Isn't It?</i>: you'll enjoy it plenty while it's on, but once it's over you might forget it ever existed.</p></div>"|14570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14570-strange-weather-isnt-it/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

His set feels something like indulging a friend in a strange late night discussion where weed-induced analytical precision is applied to goofy but commonplace ideas: Unlocking the mixological mysteries of the Flaming Dr. Pepper, contemplating the purpose of the fire SUV, exploring the ridiculousness of fly-related idioms.</p>
<p>No, this isn't high-minded stuff, and it's almost completely lacking in anything you could call ""commentary."" And given how well his conclusions and quotable, whip-smart punchlines complement these musings, you could see where Buress might want to delve deeper, to try and unearth something really thought-provoking. But he's too busy making you laugh. His relaxed approach (""People always think I'm high all the time. 'Hannibal, you look high, you sound high, you high?' No, I'm not high... I'm just way cooler than you."") draws attention to the fact that he's doing a bit and somehow managing to make it feel chatty and off-the-cuff. So it makes sense that Buress has been called ""the black Mitch Hedberg"" (a tag he's brushed off), but you can also hear Steven Wright's fondness for classic joke structures, Patton Oswalt's pop-culture insight, and Louis C.K.'s self-awareness.</p>
<p>Buress takes on overly familiar topics-- rap videos, <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, airline travel-- and makes something fresh out of them by simply writing better jokes. To compare <i>My Name Is Hannibal</i> to another big comedy record from this year, Aziz Ansari's <i>Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening</i>, Buress gets over by sticking to the script and executing flawlessly, earning his laughs thanks to his material and not his persona. Which isn't to say that Buress doesn't have personality, just that he tends to exist on the ""comic's comic"" end of the spectrum. And there's something gratifying about seeing a young comic making his way on those terms, especially when it results in one of the more laugh-filled hours you're likely to spend this year.</p></div>"|14560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14560-my-name-is-hannibal/|8.0|Zach Kelly

After approaching Vernon at a show and briefly jamming together, Carey was hired more or less on the spot. That's not the most exciting chapter of the Bon Iver story, but it says a great deal about Carey and his first solo album, the shimmery, contemplative <i>All We Grow</i>. With a degree in classical percussion from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Carey approaches songwriting and recording as a student: obsessive and detail oriented, able to absorb a great deal of information and restate it not rotely, but artfully. He has obviously spent a great deal of time absorbing the works of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Mark Hollis, and Bill Evans, and on his solo songs he renders those sounds and influences into music that lies somewhere between folk and composition.</p>
<p>That approach places Carey among a loose group of musicians who are currently bucking folk's traditional emphasis on spontaneous performance in favor of a much more composerly tack-- musicians who give Glass and Reich the same esteem Dylan or Fred Neil usually enjoy. Carey doesn't build minimalist arrangements around vernacular tunes like Sam Amidon, deconstruct Appalachian traditions like Megafaun, or emphasize atmosphere to quite the degree that Vernon does. Instead, the distinguishing characteristic of <i>All We Grow</i> is its elemental quality: Using only a piano, guitar, and drums, Carey creates a sound that is simultaneously austere and lush, pitting each instrument against the others. On ""We Fell"", the drums and guitar create the suggestion of a self-sustaining groove, but the song really comes alive when Carey's piano flutters through the middle of it like a contrail, the theme becoming lovelier and more poignant with each repetition. Following the unraveling of the mournful ""Mothers"", ""Action"" lives up to its title as its jarring intro establishes an insistent percussion rhythm that punctuates the nettle-sharp guitar licks. Every element reinforces the sense of bittersweet nostalgia implied by that found-image album cover.</p>
<p>Of all the instruments on <i>All We Grow</i>, the least compelling may be Carey's voice. He possesses a sleepy whisper that has relatively limited vocal or dramatic range, but he compensates by mic'ing it very closely to capture its grain and texture. That technique-- used to good effect on opener ""Move"" and the mostly wordless ""Mothers""-- emphasizes the sound of his voice over any lyrical meaning it might convey. For all practical purposes, <i>All We Grow</i> might as well be an instrumental album, so much so that it sounds best when Carey eschews vocals altogether. The title track opens with a prismatic intro anchored to perhaps the album's most structured melodies, but it's only after the music departs from the lyrics that the song really opens up. Carey unstitches it carefully, allowing each instrument to break away from the others gradually, even as the music threatens to dissipate into the air.</p>
<p>Not every song achieves such effortless drama. At times, Carey comes across as more a student than a master. He has obviously consumed a tremendous amount of music, but he hasn't fully digested some of his influences. ""In the Dirt"" employs fluttering woodwinds recognizable from the last few Sufjan Stevens albums, and several songs favor an almost mechanized piano theme that's practically quoted from Philip Glass. Yet these familiar elements ultimately inform rather than dispel the album's pervasive melancholy, making <i>All We Grow</i> a nice complement to, rather than a distraction from, his day job.</p></div>"|14569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14569-all-we-grow/|7.5|Stephen M.

Indeed, after the group translated some of the raw energy of its breakout EP <i>Applause Cheer Boo Hiss</i> into the more graceful, delicately arranged pieces found on <i>Lakes</i>, it seemed as if Land of Talk were destined to slip into the recesses of comfortable, regal indie rock. But with their follow-up <i>Cloak and Cipher</i>-- a fevered, grandiose record that's both denser and more technically proficient than its predecessor-- the Montreal trio take every opportunity to make their former tourmates proud with this batch of swoon-worthy, anthemic songs.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the band does right on <i>Cloak and Cipher</i>, it's nail these big, star-bursted choruses. Powell, who acts as both the voice and chief songwriter of Land of Talk, has clearly allowed some of her time working with BSS to rub off on the material found here. While it might be a little dangerous to nick ideas from your new employer, the songs on <i>Cloak and Cipher </i>that sound the most like BSS tunes are the best ones here. Riff-slathered single ""Swift Coin"" sounds a lot like ""7/4 (Shoreline)"", while standout ""Quarry Hymns"" marries some familiar balladry with salted air and sunset-warmed guitars lifted from some late-70s FM station. It's a high-water mark, and one that best captures the band's intent to never allow the emotive moments to get the best of the blustery ones, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Throughout, Powell remains a transfixing voice, and Land of Talk gives her the space she needs to try a variety of approaches. On an otherwise sad but endearing sounding little ballad, ""Color Me Badd"" (yep, like the ""I Wanna Sex You Up"" guys) finds Powell's softly spun vocal boiling-over with a controlled kind of lovesick frustration that locates a complex hurt. But most of the time, she doesn't need to rely on anything as dramatic, channelling a humbler, late-era Stevie Nicks on ""Playita"" or doing a less-precious Feist on ""Hamburg, Noon"".</p>
<p><i>Cloak and Cipher</i> wisely enlists and array of heavy-hitters, with guests from Arcade Fire and Stars pitching in where needed. While these helping hands provide added oomph, their reputations for drawn-out tracks and LPs has also seemingly rubbed off on Land of Talk. Those great choruses? Still great, but not when songs are dragged out this long and the payoff arrives right on schedule, about four times a song. It's indulgent, but it's hard to make songs sound this big. Fortunately, it won't be enough to wring-out the magic found in a great many of these songs, and surely won't be able to stall Land of Talk who, with <i>Cloak and Cipher</i>, are progressing quite nicely.</p></div>"|14555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14555-cloak-and-cipher/|6.9|Zach Kelly

With the help of dozens of famous movie clips, it depicts how the city of Los Angeles-- even the places that define its real-world identity-- wound up reduced through the lens of Hollywood to the shorthand of ""L.A.,"" a locale turned unreal through geographically impossible car chases, architecturally incongruent houses, and fake-urban setpieces built in the middle of the desert. The farther east you are, the likelier it is you've been more familiarized with a silver-screen abstract idea of L.A. than the whole, and it's not even necessarily the same abstract idea that other people might have. In subtitling itself <i>Narrative of a City</i>, Proximal Records aims to pull the same abstraction that the movies do, reshaping not a neighborhood or a landmark but a corner of the city's music scene in its own image.</p>
<p>The catch is that they don't quite <i>have </i>their own image yet-- in fact, this isn't so much a label overview as it is a scene overview, and a far-reaching one at that. This is an aesthetic that's emerged out of satellites that spin around Los Angeles' resonant <i>Low End Theory</i> diaspora, a base of instrumental hip-hop that splits the difference between Oxnard weed breaks and London dubstep, then simmers it in a base of electro-inflected g-funk. But that's already become an entrenched sound in the last couple of years, something people are starting to build off and mutate in their own disparate directions. And <i>Proximity One </i>pulls from such a wide array that it's hard to take away anything especially unified from it, which is a good sign if you're interested in a city's sonic diversity but a bit of a problem if you want an album you'll probably like more than half of.</p>
<p>Still, it isn't a bad start. The narrative conceit helps corral what could have been a chaotic mess, dividing everything into four ""chapters"" with distinct focuses. <i>Chapter One</i> is the shortest, funkiest, and most accessible, a mini-movement of breezy, borderline psychedelic lowrider bounce that peaks early with an unusually short but joyous Dâm-Funk track (""A Day at the Carnival""). Subsequent chapters dive further into successively wonkier, more abstract corners, filled with off-beat breaks and crackling surface noise and bursts of transplanted melodic fragments. It's wide-ranging, running the gamut from ambient post-dubstep (Suzuki 8-Ball's ""Nine-Wing"") to bleary-eyed Madlib homages (Juj's ""Creep"") to feints at Flying Lotus' transcendent meditations (Shlohmo's ""Glue Stick""). But it feels like there isn't enough <i>there</i> there-- it mostly comes across like comfort-food reiterations of sounds that felt a bit more bracing in 2007. When scene vet Daedelus breaks through in the last chapter with the gorgeous, soul-warping dubstep cut ""Off Angles Edges"", it becomes that much more obvious how far some of these other artists' styles have to go.</p>
<p>Not that they won't get there eventually. In fact, Proximal co-founder Sahy Uhns has already honed his technique to the point where he can take a simple-enough electro-funk rhythm, like he does in ""Fire Music"", and create something arresting just by piling on some crumbling wobble and decaying, stammering strings. There's also an appealing unpredictability to some of the other core label members' contributions, like BearClaw's icy, synaptic ""Robotrimpin"" and Lawrence Grey's Morse-code shuffle-beat concoction ""Peaches for the Baby"". And it already sounds miles ahead of the entry-level electro featured on their online-only <i>Beat Stew </i>collections that came out over the past year. Soon enough, Proximal's artists are going to depict L.A.'s sound in new, strange ways that wind up fabricating their own distinct version of reality. And if it won't be as complete a picture of the city as <i>Proximity One</i> is, it'll hopefully wind up building a narrative that's even more unique.</p></div>"|14538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14538-proximity-one-narrative-of-a-city/|6.5|Nate Patrin

""It's completely undiluted and free from any self-expectations which we later developed,"" was the reason he gave, and this makes sense when you're thinking about albums from the standpoint of a creator. Listening back is like finding yourself in a snapshot from when you were younger and the complications hadn't added up in your life yet. For a listener, of course, it's a bit different-- those same self-expectations that make Middleton uneasy when listening to his later work can nonetheless help a band create something greater, and I think age actually helped Arab Strap. Their final two albums, <i>Monday At the Hug &amp; Pint</i> and <i>Last Romance</i>, are really fine records. The complications had piled up for sure, but the band's outlook changed as well, and their more nuanced way of looking at the world made for their best music.</p>
<p>It's still interesting, though, to go back and revisit the band's debut and follow-up, especially with the bigger picture of their subsequent career in mind. Chemikal Underground's deluxe reissues bulk up the sound a little bit (but not too much) and each add a bonus disc with a Peel Session and a live performance that offer a more complete look at the band's early career than the albums alone would have. <i>The Week Never Starts Round Here</i> is in fact a pretty unpretentious, honest sounding record. Middleton, who did the instrumentals, and Aidan Moffat, who handled the vocals and lyrics, were a unique, fearless band right out of the gate, and Moffat's approach to sex and the exquisite misery of sleeping around and staying drunk immediately set them apart.</p>
<p>You can hear what Middleton was talking about in that interview, too. The record rambles quite a bit, to the point where it feels a fair amount longer than its 45-minute running time. There are a couple tracks that end with demo-sounding recordings of Moffat singing by himself, ""General Plea to a Girlfriend"" is abrasively lo-fi, and a few of the songs are a bit shapeless, but the duo's basic sound is well-established, with Middleton's guitar and drum machines laying out rough, urban landscapes for Moffat to wander through. Moffat's vocals were often aggressively amelodic, a speak-sing whose shape was heavily governed by his thick Scottish accent and Scots dialect, so he gets by more on detailed storytelling than a big chorus.

<p>And of course, there's the band's debut single, ""The First Big Weekend"", which epitomizes everything great about Arab Strap and points the way toward their later work with its taut dance rhythm, snapping guitar and brilliant weekend-in-the-life lyrics. Moffat and his friends drink all night and crash all day, but there's so much more to it: they sleep through the indignity of Scotland's loss to England at Euro 1996, fail to win the canteen quiz night, get misty-eyed watching ""The Simpsons"", invade a playground, give each other questionable advice (i.e., giving up cheese to avoid nightmares) and take the train. It builds up to the big sing-along refrain: ""Went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it's officially summer."" The real key to why it all works, though, is that Moffat stuffs the whole range of emotions into lyrics-- it's a good time, but there's frustration and sadness in it all too. He sees women he still loves but also hates for the indignities they've visited upon him (and he on them), and he gets bruised jumping a fence. It feels real.</p>
<p><i>Philophobia</i> opens with a hell of a couplet: ""It was the biggest cock you'd ever seen/ But you've no idea where that cock has been."" In some sense, this is the band responding to that self-expectation Middleton referred to later. They put the sex and disturbance right up front, almost caricaturing themselves before getting down to the business of placing all that imagery in the context of stories. They may have had self-expectations on <i>Philophobia</i>, but the pair had also acquired discipline and made a better album, one that works almost as a song cycle-- the consistency of Moffat's storytelling and subject matter turns the album into a full-fleshed character study with each song acting as a sort of chapter in the story of some boozing bloke's wrecked and often wretched life. Middleton grew as an arranger as well, incorporating occasional strings, more sophisticated drum programming and more keyboards, and he joins Moffat in injecting a bit of humor as well, especially on ""Not Quite a Yes"", where his beat is hilariously stadium-ready. The songs have more shape to them and consequently so does the album.</p>
<p>The albums stand well on their own, but the bonus discs are very welcome, not least because the live recordings actually offer superior versions of quite a few of these songs. The two Peel Sessions are especially lively and illuminating. On the first, the band is backed by members of Belle &amp; Sebastian, sounding distinctly unlike their other band as they mash the distortion pedals and hammer the drums, and Moffat delivers the non-album track ""I Saw You"" in a straight deadpan as he talks about going to see a Belle &amp; Sebastian show, remarking that the girl he had a crush on at the time was friends with ""the girl who plays the cello."" <i>The Week Never Starts Round Here</i> also includes a full recording of the band's first live performance, a  ragged but energetic set at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, while <i>Philophobia</i> gives you the band's full set at the T In The Park festival from 1998.</p>
<p>The live material hints at the fuller sound the band would later explore on its best albums-- certainly, there'd be no cause to complain if the rest of the band's output got a similar treatment. What's most fascinating about these two LPs, though, is hearing Moffat and Middleton sort out how to make these mumbly barstool rants and gutter stories into compelling songs. They didn't always succeed, but their best early songs were outstanding and set them apart from virtually everyone else on the Scottish and larger UK music scene.</p></div>"|14566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14566-the-week-never-starts-round-here-deluxe-edition-philophobia-deluxe-edition/|6.8|Joe Tangari

""It's completely undiluted and free from any self-expectations which we later developed,"" was the reason he gave, and this makes sense when you're thinking about albums from the standpoint of a creator. Listening back is like finding yourself in a snapshot from when you were younger and the complications hadn't added up in your life yet. For a listener, of course, it's a bit different-- those same self-expectations that make Middleton uneasy when listening to his later work can nonetheless help a band create something greater, and I think age actually helped Arab Strap. Their final two albums, <i>Monday At the Hug &amp; Pint</i> and <i>Last Romance</i>, are really fine records. The complications had piled up for sure, but the band's outlook changed as well, and their more nuanced way of looking at the world made for their best music.</p>
<p>It's still interesting, though, to go back and revisit the band's debut and follow-up, especially with the bigger picture of their subsequent career in mind. Chemikal Underground's deluxe reissues bulk up the sound a little bit (but not too much) and each add a bonus disc with a Peel Session and a live performance that offer a more complete look at the band's early career than the albums alone would have. <i>The Week Never Starts Round Here</i> is in fact a pretty unpretentious, honest sounding record. Middleton, who did the instrumentals, and Aidan Moffat, who handled the vocals and lyrics, were a unique, fearless band right out of the gate, and Moffat's approach to sex and the exquisite misery of sleeping around and staying drunk immediately set them apart.</p>
<p>You can hear what Middleton was talking about in that interview, too. The record rambles quite a bit, to the point where it feels a fair amount longer than its 45-minute running time. There are a couple tracks that end with demo-sounding recordings of Moffat singing by himself, ""General Plea to a Girlfriend"" is abrasively lo-fi, and a few of the songs are a bit shapeless, but the duo's basic sound is well-established, with Middleton's guitar and drum machines laying out rough, urban landscapes for Moffat to wander through.

Since Fennesz's music itself is defined by weight and density-- he likes noisy climaxes, thickly textured electronic drones, and pieces that work on an orchestral scale-- it's understandable that these Big Solo Statements have come to define him as an artist. But those who follow his career more closely know that he's a steadily working musician, with a dependable stream of low-key collaborative releases coming out every year. <i>Knoxville</i>, an improvised live set recorded in early 2009 with guitarist David Daniell and drummer Tony Buck, is a good example of how he keeps busy between solo albums.</p>
<p>There are three names on this release, and maybe I'm putting undue focus on the first one. Daniell is an experimentally minded guitarist with a long career that includes solo albums on labels like Table of the Elements and work with fellow travelers like Loren Connors and Greg Davis. Here, his playing alternately lends the music a touch of psychedelia or a welcome earthiness. Buck's main gig is as a drummer for the Australian jazz trio the Necks, and in this setting his percussion is more about timbre than rhythm. While it's possible to listen to <i>Knoxville</i> and pick out the contributions of each (Fennesz is credited with guitar and electronics), this <i>feels</i> like a Fennesz gig, and the music has a romantic character that I tend to associate with his style. Not to mention that the overall sound palette, a mix of textures from shoegaze, industrial, and dark ambient sprinkled with shimmery layers that suggest refracted light, have Fennesz's fingerprints all over them.</p>
<p>The tracks here range between six and just under 10 minutes, but they flow into each other, so <i>Knoxville</i> feels more like a continuous suite in four movements. Each section tends to begin in a quieter place and then takes its time building to crushing peaks. The sound, a mix of metallic scrapes, bits of feedback, strummed or soloing guitar, cymbal washes, and bass-heavy drone, is always on the move, either ramping up or tumbling down the cathartic high point that exists somewhere along the way. Live improv can sometimes seem like a careful probing of musical ideas that gives a sense of players patiently offering up directions to each other and developing them collectively according to a logic not always apparent to the listener. But these pieces are about stirring feelings in a very direct and tangible way.</p>
<p>The particulars of the feelings evoked here will vary from one set of ears to another, but above all, <i>Knoxville</i> offers an opportunity to lose yourself in a rush of highly detailed and overpowering sound. And the spaces it builds come across as beautiful and celebratory, no matter how crazy things get. So even when the tracks reach the intensity of ""Heat From Light"" about seven minutes in, where the feedback seems to swallow everything in the room and the crashing percussion tries vainly to match its visceral thrust, there's something life affirming and joyous about the noise. Since it's a 31-minute live set from a trio with only one familiar name, <i>Knoxville</i> may well be slotted as an ""experimental"" release and filed away accordingly. But this is generous and emotionally charged music ready to meet you halfway.</p></div>"|14568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14568-knoxville/|8.0|Mark Richardson

<p class=""Writing"">Athens, Ga., chamber-pop dreamers Venice Is Sinking have always been more notable for their ideas than their execution-- well, until now. <i>Azar</i>, the band's intriguing 2009 LP, included four instrumentals that suggested an almost-there guess of what Christian Fennesz might sound like collaborating with Sigur Rós. Those themes came wound around a half-dozen ornate rock songs. Thick with strings, horns, and keys and resting on beats that pushed just beyond mild-mannered, those numbers were barely but consistently off. Maybe they were a tad aggressive here or loaded with a few too many parts there, or perhaps some were just strangely mixed, but the most brazen thoughts on <i>Azar</i> seemed lost in transit.</p>
<p>The concept of Venice Is Sinking's latest, <i>Sand &amp; Lines</i>, gives immediate pause: A 10-song edit culled from five days of live 2008 recordings at the venerable Georgia Theatre. It's the sort of idea that suggests this band will try to do too much, to push decent songs beyond their carrying capacity. And <i>Sand &amp; Lines</i> is naturally loaded with auxiliary horns, strings, singers, and percussionists. The organ-and-footstomp march ""Bardstown Road"" is played by 16 people, for instance, with drummer Lucas Jensen left only to conduct the big band. Despite the numbers and the presumptions, though, <i>Sand &amp; Lines</i> is marked by thoughtful reserve at every turn. Both carefully arranged and edited, its 10 tracks comprise only 38 minutes. Just as it doesn't overstay its welcome, it doesn't tax these tunes, either. <i>Sand &amp; Lines</i> treats its 10 songs as canvases for moods, where the focus is feeling and essence, not ornamentation or precision.</p>
<p>""I think we're liking it pretty well up here,"" someone says off microphone at album's start, just before the band eases into the drifting ""Sidelights"". The recording is warm and tender, with reverb and gently scattered vocals enhancing the sense that the band really is in the next room. The no-overdubs policy suits Venice Is Sinking well, allowing both the songs and the well-considered parts-- the vocal glissandi of opener ""Sidelights""; the neon keyboard and guitar flashes of ""Falls City""; the soaring string drama that bisects the terrific ""Bound by Violets""-- appropriate spotlights. The flourishes feel just right, too: Despite its crowd, the sleigh bell click of ""Bardstown Road"" feels perfectly understated beneath a chanting choir. ""Lucky Lady"" gets loud, sure. Captured in the mostly empty and cavernous room, though, it's a gentle if insistent sort of rock'n'roll. Think the Clientele, daydreaming.</p>
<p><i>Sand &amp; Lines</i> is simply a case of good songs receiving their proper treatments: ""The Grey Line"" is an illusory, lonely travelogue captured perfectly by Karolyn Troupe's fragile voice and the band's steady rises and falls. Frontman Daniel Lawson nails the nervy romanticism of Galaxie 500's ""Tugboat"", his voice drifting with sweet unease. When the band finally launches into the closing solo, they nuzzle the edge of anxieity perfectly. Similarly, Venice Is Sinking handle ""Jolene"" with thematic care. The slinking, sexy bassline sashays around a violin that sighs and sobs, the song's darkness pushed to the threshold of a murder ballad. Its slow burn is enough to conjure the flickers of a candle.</p>
<p>Despite its elegance, <i>Sand &amp; Lines</i> likely won't turn Venice Is Sinking's national indie profile into a skyrocket. It's a comfortable, subtle suite of one-take songs, captured live in an empty room. If you're looking for a quick fix or an MP3 to share,<i> Sands &amp; Lines</i> will vex with patience. In today's instant buzz cycle, maybe this sort of a record is a fool's errand for a band that did generate a modicum of attention with its last LP. But that last record was fussy and overworked, anyway, and this feels-- firmly, fortunately-- like new and assured footing.</p>

Ingram's <i>Consolamentum </i>sounds like a nightmare. Hopefully you appreciate these grim environs, because <i>Consolamentum </i>seldom leaves them. Electro-acoustic terror is not what you'd expect from the solo debut of the guitarist for Oceansize, a band who formed in the 1990s and pretty much stayed there. But Ingram cracks his skull open and finds a lot more than post-rock noodles and grunge riffs crawling around inside.</p>
<p><span>The sound will be familiar to anyone who's swept out the darker corners of metal-influenced drone: broken-backed dirges for guitar, piano, and mutilated tape that skulk between ambient, noise, and pure sound art. The melodic elements are strong but always imperiled in corrosive atmospheres. The emphasis is on texture and weight, with big sounds that are full of air and small ones that sink like lead, woven into coarse yet involved patterns. One of the best tracks, ""De Montfort"", works drones and Satie-inspired piano into an uneven pile of looped scratches and clatters. There is a uniform sense of coiled menace, but the compositions are diverse.</span></p>
<p><span>You don't need the titular reference to an archaic religious sect to clue you in that this is an esoteric album. In fact, the title adds an unnecessary extra layer of opacity that threatens to obscure what you really listen for in music like this: the spark of a unique personality. Luckily, Ingram has that. Like his many of his peers, the emotional center of his music is arrested dread. But he breaks the mold by allowing for small, vital moments of catharsis-- unbroken chains of guitar notes welling up from the benighted margins. This is</span> a productive change of pace for a style that often stops at ""something terrible is coming."" Ingram's monsters, on occasion, actually arrive-- and they're beautiful.</p></div>"|14546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14546-consolamentum/|7.2|Brian Howe

For instance, I could call the Claudia Quintet ""post-jazz"" or something similar, but without getting into the details of the music, you wouldn't know what that means. ""Jazz"" itself is a term that doesn't mean a whole lot anymore without modifying it-- the tent pitched by the word is huge. Here, when I say that the Claudia Quintet combine elements of jazz and modern chamber music, the jazz I'm referring to is mostly the post-bop stuff that's been swirling around in various permutations since the early 1960s, small ensemble music that doesn't necessarily lean on swung rhythms, is built on modal composition, and doesn't fear dipping into the avant-garde.</p>
<p>On <i>Royal Toast</i>, the Quintet, led by drummer John Hollenbeck and here augmented to a sextet by pianist Gary Versace, moves easily between improvisation and intricately arranged composition. For instance, ""Sphinx"" spends most of its first minute charging through a series of seemingly disconnected phrases that make more sense as they're repeated and combined, then pulls back for an almost funky midsection in which Chris Speed gets a chance to wail a bit on his clarinet. Bassist Drew Gress gets a little spotlight, too, almost as a reward for holding down the hyperactive low-end that gives everyone else their exploratory foundation on the rest of the song.</p>
<p>This is the group's fifth album, and they're clearly good at reading each other and knowing when to shift the rhythm to help a soloist escape a cul de sac. The band's unorthodox instrumentation-- bass, drums, reeds, accordion, and vibraphone-- gives it a distinct sonic signature. Ted Reichman's accordion is used in every conceivable way, playing leads, soloing, harmonizing with the clarinet, and in some of the album's slowest and most rewarding passages, hypnotically vamping in a static dance with Matt Moran's vibraphone. Though they can clang along with the best of them, they do quiet and meditative well. These more placid moments balance out the record's stormier passages and offer respite from fussy sections where the shifts in rhythm and time signature are a bit too much.</p>
<p>It's fitting they'd land on the Cuneiform label. The overall effect the band gives off is that of a more well-adjusted cousin to doom-obsessed labelmates Univers Zero, offering the sturm without so much of the drang. I wouldn't mind hearing Hollenbeck use the group to explore his softer side, because the pulsing comedowns on this record are some of its most arresting moments, even though the in-betweenness makes it unique and enjoyable on its own merits.</p></div>"|14561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14561-royal-toast/|7.1|Joe Tangari

Nothing in that last sentence seems like it should work. But former Belle and Sebastian singer/cellist Isobel Campbell and former Screaming Trees frontman Lanegan have the sort of chemistry that nobody can fully explain. Their voices hang suspended in the air together, Campbell's feathery light and Lanegan's thick and downtrodden.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison, and the one that critics have made over and over again with these two, is Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, and the parallels certainly work. Like Nancy and Lee, Campbell and Lanegan's world-weary sprite/cowboy act lends a nice angelic/demonic dichotomy to everything they do. Every time they sing together, the two sound like they've just gotten done with a particularly satisfying fuck. But on <i>Hawk</i>, they remind me just as much of Mazzy Star in the way they boil roots-rock down to narcotic shuffle and swoony desert atmosphere. And if they haven't quite come up with their own ""Fade Into You"" yet, give them time.</p>
<p>All sorts of quintessentially American genres go into the stew here: country, folk, blues, rockabilly, 50s torch-song elegance. ""Come Undone"", with its weepy drawn-out strings, is a pretty great stab at old-school Memphis soul. Scraggly-voiced singer-songwriter Willy Mason stands in for Lanegan on a spare, unrushed cover of Townes Van Zandt's ""No Place to Fall"". The acoustic-blues stomper ""Snake Song"" would make a way better theme to the ridiculously entertaining Elmore Leonard-derived TV show ""Justified"" than that Everlast-sounding piece of crap the show currently has. And all throughout, Campbell sings without a trace of her thick Scottish accent. It's tough to believe this is the same girl who sang ""Is It Wicked Not to Care?"".</p>
<p>When I interviewed her a few weeks back, Campbell talked about how hard it was to find drummers that knew how to play this material right. Most drummers, naturally, want to play fills and show off, but the way Campbell approaches this Americana demands a certain spacey restraint. And thank god she put in the effort to find the right players. Plenty of these songs would sound a bit hacky if they weren't done the airy, humid way they are here; this is definitely an album that depends more on <i>vibe </i>than on songs. More than on previous Campbell/Lanegan albums, things get a bit raucous here from time to time; chugging guitars and galloping drums turn up with surprising frequency. But even the more riff-heavy songs give Campbell and Lanegan enough room to develop the sandpaper/chiffon chemistry they need. The only glaring misstep on the album, actually, is the instrumental title track, a squealy and chaotic fusion of free jazz and rockabilly that punctures the mood way too much.</p>
<p><i>Hawk</i> is very much Campbell's album. She made all the big artistic decisions, her face is front and center on the cover, and Lanegan shows up on only eight of the album's 13 tracks. But whenever she shares a track with Lanegan (or, a couple of times here, with Willy Mason), her sylph of a voice fades into the background. That really just means that Campbell knows how to make her songs work. Lanegan's craggy mutter is almost a natural wonder, and in Campbell's luxurious beds of reverbed-out country, it's found a pretty perfect resting spot. No reason this odd pair can't keep on cranking out slabs of low-key bliss like this one.</p></div>"|14539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14539-hawk/|7.5|Tom Breihan

Wale is coming off of a high-profile bust-- his debut LP, <i>Attention: Deficit</i>, is probably the last time a major label will put serious money behind him-- so it's reasonable that he wanted to recapture his mixtape fire. But while <i>101 Miles And Still Running</i>, <i>Further Back to the Feature</i>,<i> </i>or even <i>Attention: Surplus</i> would've been more promising titles for Wale's comeback, <i>More About Nothing </i>gives the impression that what he feels the public wants isn't the inspired rapping that marked 2008's stellar <i>The Mixtape About Nothing</i>, but rather simply more hot fire from Elaine Benes.</p>
<p>For better or worse, <i>More About Nothing </i>is a very different tape from its predecessor: For one thing, the Seinfeld quotes act more like interstitial skits than a load-bearing conceptual framework. But more pointedly, while <i>The Mixtape About Nothing </i>wasn't afraid to get a little weighty, what shone through was the exuberant tone. Wale sounded like someone who simply loved to rap, whatever the topic, and he served as a unifier, finding room for Lil Wayne, Clipse, Bun B, and the Roots, acts upon which battle lines are often drawn in hip-hop. The tone is considerably more deflated here, and the centerpiece fittingly isn't about Kramer or Jerry, but rather, rapped from the perspective of Tiger Woods, a flashpoint where the two dominant themes of this tape meet up: struggling with fidelity and very public humiliation.</p>
<p>The latter defines intro ""The Problem""; here Wale's not bitter so much as racked with a confusion that unfortunately borders on denial. Rap fans can be forgiving of commercial disappointment (have you seen Big Boi's sales?), but the problem with <i>Attention: Deficit </i>was that Wale didn't even achieve it on his own terms, and it's disheartening to hear him shift the blame. ""Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch,"" he spits and from there, you get to hear him call out his distributor, label, and those who didn't see ""his vision."" He comforts himself with weed (""The Breeze"", ""The Cloud""), pills, random sex, and repping D.C. over Sam Sparro's ""Black and Gold"" but more often than not, it's a stark contrast to hear such a gifted collaborator working on his own.</p>
<p>When he stops fretting about SoundScan and lets his guard down, <i>More About Nothing </i>hits a stride, in large part because Wale focuses on relationships, as good a topic as any for someone so prone to internal dialogue and self-doubt. It's funny that he's never employed the ""hand"" speech from ""Seinfeld"" since so much of <i>More </i>focuses on how one can reconcile their careers, friendships, and love lives with man's pervasive competitive nature.</p>
<p>I'd love to say that <i>More About Nothing </i>is a triumphant comeback, Wale reinvigorated after licking his wounds, but it's not. If anything, it just proves that his gift and curse is that he simply cares too much-- not just about craft, but unfortunately, about his perception, and he can't stop acting like his public evaluation isn't ongoing. It's tough to say where he goes next, but the path two similar rappers have taken in 2010 provides us with hindsight: Curren$y is someone who's also had a strange career path and is prone to rapping about video games, basketball, shoes, and weed, and <i>Pilot Talk </i>may have not done boffo at the box office, but it was a triumph in large part because it felt comfortable in its own skin. B.o.B. on the other hand, amplified the message of <i>Attention: Deficit</i>, that in the current economic landscape, even a successful bet on a heavily A&amp;R'd ""blockbuster"" is hardly worth alienating your core fanbase. That <i>More About Nothing </i>is so self-referential suggests that Wale knows where <i>his </i>core fanbase lies, but it'll be interesting to see if he feels like it's one worth keeping if he gets another crack at stardom.</p></div>"|14565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14565-more-about-nothing/|6.5|Ian Cohen

Just about every band we love eventually undergoes a transformation-- sometimes it excites us, sometimes it pisses us off. And when a band covers the same ground repeatedly on their first few albums, sometimes that's a blessing, especially if what they were doing on their debut was invigorating right out the gate. The Budos Band are one of those groups. Their 2005 debut plied a particularly up-front take on retro funk, one that compacted Afrobeat, Latin soul, and James Brown into brief but highly danceable instrumentals. So did their second album. And so does their third. You could throw <i>The Budos Band III</i> in with the band's previous two LPs-- titled, with a convenient uniformity, <i>The Budos Band</i> and <i>The Budos Band II</i>-- and come up with 32 songs that all sound like they could have been cut in the same session.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that theoretical session makes up one of the more ferocious bodies of old-school funk revivalism in the last few years. Maybe it's the stark imagery of their album artwork at play here-- this is their second sleeve in a row featuring a creature name-checked in <i>Five Deadly Venoms</i>-- but the Budos' music often has this undercurrent of cinematic martial artistry to it. They keep everything tight, showing brutal knockout efficiency that thrives on limber call-and-response riffs and unceasing percussive motion. If you're out walking and you throw on a cut like ""Unbroken, Unshaven"" or ""Golden Dunes"" you'll find yourself stepping up your pace to meet it. And then you might find yourself wanting to do something with your hands-- attempting to punch through marble, for instance, or carrying 50-pound jugs of water up six flights of stairs. This is a band so tight and in tune that they've basically become this telepathically-communicating instrumental hydra that ambushes you into moving your body on its terms.</p>
<p>It's a fine balance between playing to your strengths and recklessly charging ahead on familiar instinct. A couple of tracks wind up sounding like vague rewrites; ""Nature's Wrath"" in particular has a marked melodic similarity to <i>The Budos Band II</i> highlight ""Origin of Man"". But other times, they come up with something even more interesting when they go back to their idea well. There was an inside-out twist of the Temptations' ""My Girl"" on <i>II</i> that turned a breezy love song into a minor-chord skulk that rode on tension, moodiness, and implicit jealously (hence the new title-- ""His Girl""). Here, they pull the same stunt with ""Reppirt Yad"" (read it backwards), though turning circa-1965 Beatles into weaselly, blade-flashing kingpin theme music makes for a tweak that's both kind of funny and completely badass.</p>
<p>Besides, what would you change in a sound like this? Sure, it'd be interesting to hear the Budos push their terse jams further toward the eight-minute mark. And saxophonist Jared Tankel's admission that the band's initial intent was to make a ""psychedelic, doom-rock record"" hints at something stealthily metallic lurking under the surface; imagine these guys adapting their approach to something in the vein of King Crimson's ""Red"" or Hawkwind's ""7 By 7"". (""Black Venom"" is a hell of a hint; once you find out it was partially inspired by and named after Black Sabbath and Venom-- their trumpeter's idea!-- it's almost impossible not to hear the metal in it.) Still, this is one of those cases where you'll like this album if you liked the last one, and for all the same reasons, so long as you're willing to forgive the occasional bout of déjà vu. This album's predictability isn't the same thing as complacency, and if this music catches you unawares, it'll strike you right where you're vulnerable.</p></div>"|14535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14535-the-budos-band-iii/|7.6|Nate Patrin

On Elk City's fourth LP, <i>House of Tongues</i>, she projects Debbie Harry's sultry cool one minute, 70s easy-listening mellow the next, and a track later, the chutzpah of an alt-rock diva. LoBue's bandmates, including former Luna guitarist Sean Eden, share her keenness for rock history, as well as enviable chops and range. And when offered the opportunity to prove it-- to bust out guitar solos, frilly piano runs, busy drum patterns, even the occasional glockenspiel-- they rarely demur.</p>
<p>Technical skill and versatility can be huge assets, obviously. But they can also be liabilities when a band's artistic vision reads closer to ""cataract"" than 20/20. Over their decade-plus run, Elk City have laced their otherwise unremarkable pop-rock oeuvre with folk, jazz, soul, blues, country, cabaret, and whatever else they happened to be listening to at the time. It's actually easier to say what the New York band isn't trying to do or reference-- say, hip-hop or anything particularly 2010-sounding (not even in the song titled ""2010"")-- than what they are. So <i>Tongues</i> is swollen with disparate sounds packed tight and awkward as a large extended family vacationing in a tiny beach cottage. Without air conditioning.</p>
<p>The fact that they're game for almost anything makes for some WTF juxtapositions-- for example, when the guitar heroics mucking up the middle of art-rock hodge-podge ""Wire Goats"" are interrupted by a <i>bongo drum </i>solo. Or when the band tacks several instrumental false endings to ""The Onion""'s grim organ-drone millieu. ""For the Uninitiated"" is such a compost heap it's hard to isolate any single offense, though I suspect the problem is that band members are all playing different songs.</p>
<p>Wild eclecticism doesn't necessarily equal bad record, as Janelle Monáe most recently argued with her taxonomy breaching and brilliant <i>The ArchAndroid</i>. But to make a record that won't wear out its welcome by the end of track one takes a certain amount of taste and self-restraint. Not surprisingly, <i>Tongue</i>'s more effective tracks, such as ""Real Low Riders"", are its relatively discerning ones. Propelled by a powerful little drum riff and a catchy pop melody that LoBue interprets with mournful understatement, ""Nine O'Clock in France"" is the best song here-- even if the progressive instrumental pileup makes its ending less satisfying than its beginning. But I guess we were warned: True to its title, <span><i>House of Tongues</i></span> is a tower of Babel.</p></div>"|14557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14557-house-of-tongues/|4.8|Amy Granzin

After years of playing around Los Angeles and performing guest vocalist duties for house artist Morgan Page, Lissie was gaining ground as a recording artist, introducing herself online with acoustic video performances of understated folk songs, including a cover of Hank Williams' ""Wedding Bells"". Her voice stood out more than the actual songs: at times raspy and at others full and precise, like Grace Slick or Neko Case. After the EP's release, Maurus switched to the electric guitar and gathered a backing band.</p>
<p><i>Catching a Tiger</i>, her debut LP, is dominated by an odd mix of producer-writers including Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Modest Mouse), Band of Horses bassist Billy Reynolds, and British session guitarist and producer Julian Emery. There are numerous other composers involved in the album, including singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt (for the leaden piano ballad ""Oh Mississippi""), but Maurus wrote or co-wrote every track. Her collaborators seem to have led Maurus down the garden path, transforming some promising unreleased tracks into bland songs sapped of atmosphere and personality. The narratives follow suit: The clear singles feature jilted-teenager juvenilia and cheesy tales of rebellion, while the tracks with Lissie's stamp firmly on them feature mature, creative lyrical twists on familiar ideas, deeply rooted in folk.</p>
<p>In other words, the standouts on <i>Tiger</i> were either written entirely by Maurus or co-written with more synergistic contributors like Craig Dodds (Sugababes, Amy Winehouse) and Angelo Petraglia (the so-called fifth member of Kings of Leon). These songs capture a physical environment as well as an emotional one; geography and psychology feel inseparable. ""Record Collector"", co-written by Dodds, uses unobvious words (""hue"" instead of ""color""); wry, poetic narration grounded in nature (""Everywhere I went/ There I was/ With a choir of bees/ They were all abuzz/ Oh my, how amusing""); and rhyming that isn't forced or bland. In the process, Lissie whoops and darts all over the scale, showing off considerable vocal range and expressiveness.</p>
<p>But Lissie's conversion to the electric guitar starts to seem calculated once you hear King and Emery's contributions. A couple of them-- ""Cuckoo"", ""Loosen the Knot""-- are fun enough, and the stories feel authentically Lissie's, but they pale in comparison to her own compositions. Wanting to avoid the woman-and-acoustic-guitar cliché is understandable, but the work has veered too far in the other direction, best exemplified on ""When I'm Alone"". When it debuted as a live performance video earlier this year, it seemed like Lissie's strongest song to date. On the album, it's thin and unmemorable. The guitars, previously bold and howling, are now pushed down into the mix as part of the rhythm section. Lissie's voice is haunting as always, but the band doesn't match this tone, and as a result it no longer sounds like Lissie's song. Hopefully these missteps aren't enough to put people off, because Lissie is still a significant new voice. Let's hope she listens to it more in the future.</p></div>"|14547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14547-catching-a-tiger/|5.4|Liz Colville

Sometimes songs that are fast, technically speaking, don't sound fast in effect. Maybe they don't move, or don't prove fleet in any way. Whereas sometimes a slow song, with the right lean, can seem to take off, to zoom toward some distant horizon. But however the finer points play out, speed in music can be misleading-- and wondrously disorienting. Case in point is the compilation <i>Shangaan Electro--</i> pretty much every track on it is ruthlessly, breathlessly, ridiculously fast. Yet the effect of so much speed is to make everything, paradoxically and more than a little psychedelically, <i>slow down</i>.<br><br>Opening track ""Ngunyuta Dance"", by an act called BBC, makes for a good primer. After beginning with a weightless drop of chintzy-sounding keyboard tones and spritzy digital drums, it eventually has like 10 different patterns running through it, each at a manic pace. And something in the ceaselessness of them all makes the rhythm seem to just keep getting faster and faster as it transpires-- until a disembodying sense of overload washes over and starts, kind of magically, to pull everything apart.<br><br>There's <i>a lot</i> to pull apart. Shangaan Electro collects 12 extremely dense and startling tracks of contemporary Shangaan dance music from Africa, specifically a few southern parts near Johannesburg and Mozambique. Evidently, the scene grew out of the mind of one man, named Nozinja, who works as a producer and sells music on his own, on DVDs and cassettes that fan out for use at insane dance parties. Footage from these village parties has gotten around via <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXE6_j1N7o8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">popular</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgbLkayfTE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6ILv0JF6U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clips</a> full of sick dance moves, which feature lots of heavily torqued wiggling and actions that look like something a man might do after just discovering a leech on his balls. (Another way to describe them, this a choice quote from the liner notes: ""When you see them dance you feel like they have got no bones."")<br><br>But part of what makes<i> Shangaan Electro</i> so interesting is the way it seems to laugh away the notion of context altogether, or at least rush right past it. Tracks in the Shangaan style tend to run around 180 beats-per-minute, which is very fast, and the seizing effect of that is amplified by a focus on cheap high-end sounds and a near-total absence of bass, which there simply doesn't seem to be room for. Dance music in general is typically weighted and time-stamped by bass. Shangaan electro floats in ethereal space instead, with lots of speed and no friction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>In the most comprehensive terms, <i>Shangaan</i> electro is extremely weird. The sound sources enlisted in the mosaic tracks here range from what sounds like children's-movie traffic noise to solar flares from a plastic sun. There's beautiful human soul in the choral singing in ""Nwa Pfundla"" by Tshetsha Boys, but there's as much beautiful <i>post</i>-human soul in the highly processed chipmunk vocals of their ""Uya Kwihi Ka Rose"". And pretty much throughout, there's a startling range of inventiveness with electronic sounds that are constantly clipped, looped, and folded in on themselves-- like in Mancingelani's ""Vana Vasesi"", which sounds like someone's spotty memory of Kraftwerk's ""Pocket Calculator"" run at triple speed.</p>
<p>The liner notes, revealing but also helpfully incomplete, describe the previously very isolated Shangaan electro sound as ""hyper-local music, all of it still considered traditional."" But little here scans as ""traditional"" once you tumble in and fall under its swirling parts' spell. All the tracks compiled trace back to Nozinja's studio, where they were born between 2006 and 2009. But they've started to thrive in a zone of no context, which is where we are now. None of <i>Shangaan Electro</i> sounds quite like anything else we have at our disposal. Which, come to think of it, places it within a rich tradition indeed.</p></div>"|14532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14532-shangaan-electro-new-wave-dance-music-from-south-africa/|8.3|Andy Battaglia

Of course this record was announced well before Isis called it quits in June; chances are the band didn't <i>plan</i> for this to be their final statement. Nonetheless, it's a bit of a dull <i>adieu</i>. Fans have undoubtedly pledged vital organs to snag a vinyl copy of this split. But for those who've never fully understood the slavering devotion Isis has enjoyed since 2002's <i>Oceanic</i>, these two songs won't convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>I've never quite understood the acclaim myself. <i>Oceanic</i> was a nice breather at the time, a genuinely new hybrid (celestial sludge? ambient grunge?) after a few years of mathcore's complexity overload. Then Isis... kept going. (Admittedly with a few stylistic changeups along the way.) Their music has always felt too static to achieve any sort of real grandeur; you rarely hear the kind of dynamics they supposedly took from post-rock.</p>
<p>The same problem plagues ""Way Through Woven Branches"" and ""The Pliable Foe"" here. Isis <i>seem</i> to be building to something on these songs, but the climaxes are so restrained you can almost miss them if you're not paying close enough attention. The solo, the brief burst of black metal-ish drumming, <i>and</i> the growly vocals on ""Way Through"" all feel way too timid. ""Pliable Foe"" goes for the throat with a little more gusto, but as usual, I kept hoping Isis would finally <i>let loose</i>, offer a little chaos. After all, the best part of Mogwai's ""Like Herod"" isn't the clockwork precision; it's the freak out.</p>
<p>As for the Melvins side of the split, it's also more of the same, but here I don't mean that in a disparaging way at all. One of the highlights of the 21st century has been seeing the band power its way out of its intermittently brilliant/sometimes embarrassing late-90s wilderness period. (Bulldozer covers of Wipers' songs? Yes! Lame joke covers of Nirvana songs with Leif Garrett on vocals? Uh.) In the last half-decade, Osborne and Crover Inc. have become a great, epic, near-traditionalist hard rock band. Remember those EPs that parodied the Kiss solo-album sleeves? You always knew this was coming if the Melvins lasted long enough.</p>
<p>Their two songs on this split, ""Pig House (Alt Version)"" and ""I'll Finish You Off (Alt Version)"", keep to the path carved out by their last three albums, especially 2008's pop-tight but heavy <i>Nude With Boots</i>, which revealed what a surprisingly <i>nimble</i> band Melvins can be-- no small feat in a two-drummer set-up. The solos, especially on ""Pig House"", are anthemic, and the grooves, especially on ""I'll Finish You Off"", have the same punchy dynamics the Isis tunes lack.</p>
<p>Their sound has been through so many shifts that ""unpredictable"" is kind of what they do now, but Melvins have hit a sweet spot in the last few years. (It's also kinda sorta just a little bit  funny that the addition of young blood in 2006-- in the form of Big Business' Jared Warren and Coady Willis-- has pushed Melvins even further into the realm of classic rock.) You can only hope they'll explore it for a little longer before the next, inevitable change.</p></div>"|14562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14562-melvinsisis/|6.0|Jess Harvell

Often they're forced upon groups for litigious reasons, sometimes they're slight changes that make sense for the newly named, say, Santigold, but not to anyone else. PVT's particular name change, however, seems functional in application. The band's two albums as Pivot, 2005's <i>Make Me Love You</i> and 2008's Warp debut, <i>O Soundtrack My Heart</i>, were slabs of drifting post-rock (the latter with minor electronic touches added because, hey, they're on Warp now) that fell short on energy throughout.</p>
<p>For the Australian outfit's third full-length, <i>Church With No Magic</i>, they've removed the vowels from their name and, almost as if as a result, chucked the bullshit ""atmospherics"" that have marred their discography thus far. There's a more frequent vocal presence now (supplied by multi-instrumentalist Richard Pike), and any traces of meandering instrumental passages have been ditched in favor of harsh drum programming and queasy synthesizers. You might call this brand of music ""electronic rock,"" but that misnomer brings to mind bands like Foals, who are comparatively just a gussied up, glitch-heavy version of Coldplay when all's said and done.</p>
<p>Instead, PVT take a much darker route, evoking the more rhythmic elements of modern art-rock evoked by acts like These New Puritans and Liars. The video for album track ""Window"" allowed a window (sorry) into these guys' creative process-- samplers, computers, more samplers-- conveying in just three minutes that, yes, this is thought-intensive music. Every element exists as a piece to a larger puzzle, like Pike's nervous utterances that open the title track or the disconnected noise that jarringly emerges midway through ""Crimson Swan"". Remove even one snare pattern from any song here, and you'll likely be yelling ""Jenga!"" as the whole thing collapses from within.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the notion that this is brainy music would be ignoring the fact that PVT frequently achieve melodic catharsis on <i>Church With No Magic</i>. A lot of this is due to Pike's considerable vocal register, which can convey low resonance and high-frequency wailing alike. There's pop elements on <i>Church With No Magic</i>, but their integration into the band's jittery, electronically damaged sound it what makes them succeed. The aforementioned ""Window"" is the sole truly straightforward ""pop"" cut here, and although it is by no means a bad song, the simplicity of its construction can't help but make it sound slight compared to the album's more involved moments, like the oscillating tones in ""Waves and Radiation""  or ""Timeless""' perpetually building arpeggiation. They've run out of letters to remove from their name, but PVT are just getting started when it comes to good ideas.</p></div>"|14551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14551-church-with-no-magic/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

But for all their apparent Yankophilia, the Brits have seemed less eager to make stars out of domestic acts with a pronounced American indie-rock influence. Whether it's the Pixies-schooled punch of Future of the Left or the Pavement-inspired polemics of Los Campesinos!, recent history suggests that the adoption of American college-rock tropes will relegate you to cult status in the UK.</p>
<p>This discouraging evidence seems to have inspired Leeds trio Sky Larkin to fly the proverbial flannel all the more fervently. They've even going so far as to travel to Seattle to record with producer John Goodmanson, whose two most famous clients-- Sleater-Kinney and Death Cab For Cutie-- serve as handy goalposts for the terrain covered on second release <i>Kaleide</i>. And in frontwoman Katie Harkin, Sky Larkin possess a mouthpiece with enough personality and vigor to potentially break them above-ground. <i>Kaleide</i>'s excellent opening track, ""Still Windmills"", is her star-making showcase, a song so anxious it starts right with the chorus, on which Harkin ardently declares, ""I know there's potential!"" Whether ""Still Windmills"" is an appeal to her audience to make the most out of their lives or simply an advert for alternative sources of energy, Harkin's performance-- trading off between droll sing-speak and impassioned pleading-- sells you on the need to make it happen now. And the way she suddenly drops her voice for the last line of each verse before the chorus comes crashing back in manages to make the familiar, grunge-standby soft-to-loud trick seem novel again.</p>
<p>It's no great discredit to the album to say that <i>Kaleide</i> peaks with its first song. The remaining material rarely pushes Harkin to the dramatic heights of ""Still Windmills"", and the singer is guilty of leaning too heavily on vague metaphors. (The keyboard-smoothed ""Anjelica Huston"" is not so much a tribute to the actress as a random invocation of her femme-fatale archetype.) But Goodmanson's unfussy production is the ideal complement to this young band's fidgety energy-- the live-in-the-room quality works to chisel rather than obscure the hooks on the herky-jerky title track and the joyously berserker ""Spooktacular"". Appropriately enough, <i>Kaleide</i> translates from Greek as ""beautiful form"" while phonetically suggesting the act of crashing-- in their most inspired turns, Sky Larkin place equal emphasis on the melody and the mêlée.</p></div>"|14541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14541-kaleide/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Something about <i>Sad Sour Future</i>, their slack-but-sturdy double LP, is bound to set off a lightbulb or two in the head of anybody who's ever made it through a few Superchunk records. Their rangy, restless guitar tangles harken back to the brainy, punchy work of the Chunk, Archers of Loaf, Pavement and the like. Primary singer Patrick Fleming's got one of those classic indie dude voices, insistent and a little pinched, and the other guys fall in nicely. (Devin Frank does a mean David Berman.) Even <i>Sad Sour Future</i>'s analog production lends the proceedings a loose-fitting, era-appropriate warmth. But whereas most throwback acts are content to take a loan out on every last thing, personality included, Poison Control Center are far too sharp and self-assured to need a lender on anything that vital; lax and charming, these tunes feel fresh even when the music veers a tad out of time.</p>
<p>PCC are dabblers; their past work ran a weirdly effective gamut from Les Savy spaz to the more ornate Elephant 6 stuff, and while they're certainly pounding the Pavement a lot harder on <i>Sad Sour Future</i>, touches of Beulah-style horn flare ups and Tullycraft twee run ideal interference on all the goldbricking. Songs circle back on themselves, winding melodies into countermelodies into even more melodies; what seems at first limber and casual reveals itself as carefully considered and pretty crafty, with hooks duking it out among the myriad guitar interjections. The hour-and-change runtime means nobody's checking their watch, and these songs feel wonderfully unhurried-- guitar solos seem to bleed out of the tracks, horns tumble into the frame, tempos stroll, and Fleming occasionally lets his singing fall just behind the beat, all to fine effect. Theirs is an agile sound, neither overeager or overblown, and even when things get to feeling a little familiar, the knotty melodies and judicious instrumental touches carry the songs over.</p>
<p>Lyrically, PCC opt for sweet slices of life occasionally cut through with a little abstraction; their tales of hanging out downtown with elegant gals and riding golf carts around their grandfathers' farm are richly detailed, chatty, and full of left turns. Their verses saunter, but their choruses soar, and you don't walk away from these tunes wondering what's meant by them. I wouldn't consider Poison Control Center a to-the-point kind of band-- at 71 minutes, <i>Sad Sour Future</i> certainly wanders-- but these tunes know precisely when to throw a hook in your path; you could, for example, slice ""Calling Card"" into maybe three parts and have three perfectly good choruses to build a tune around. You might say that's overgenerous; you could say the same about<i> Sad Sour Future</i> as a whole. But if a not-unhealthy respect for its elders and maybe one too many catchy numbers all in a row are the worst things one can level at Poison Control Center, clearly this is a band worth getting familiar with.</p></div>"|14564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14564-sad-sour-future/|7.4|Paul Thompson

There's no denying, however, that the innocently energetic indie kids who banded together four years ago at the University of Cardiff, in Wales, are no more. Oh, they're still hilarious, still capable of thrilling a packed room, but this year's glorious, enigmatic <i>Romance Is Boring</i>-- like don't-call-it-an-album <i>We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed</i> two years ago-- isn't so much twee as grotesque. The group members still perform under the Campesinos! surname, but in recent months two have left: singer/keyboardist Aleksandra, in a long-planned move, and drummer Ollie, under somewhat mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, in the form of a stopgap EP, comes another about-face. Los Campesinos! lyricist/shouter Gareth has let it be known that he hates acoustic performances. But <i>All's Well That Ends</i>-- available digitally or as a hard-to-find 10""-- is made up of pretty much those, pulling together acoustic versions of four <i>Romance Is Boring</i> tracks in roughly the style of the band's NPR ""Tiny Desk Concerts"" appearance early last month. By its nature, the release is for fans only, particularly in its expensive physical edition. That said, Los Campesinos! are hardly trying to fool anybody here, and devotees have plenty of reasons to be pleased. Like the most contemplative moments from the last two records, <i>All's Well That Ends</i> points a potential way forward for this constantly evolving band. It offers an early glimpse of the new lineup and sheds clearer light on some of the group's most bewilderingly complex songs, without sacrificing intricacy or exposing too many shortcomings.</p>
<p>I say ""too many,"" of course, because exposing shortcomings is sort of Gareth's forte. If <i>Romance Is Boring</i> is in some ways the most cerebral Los Campesinos! record, it's also their most physical. Gareth is obsessed with bodies, and these new arrangements make it easier to notice the beautifully overwrought Roald Dahl vividness with which he describes them. There's a Hypercolor bruise, kept ""like a pet, a private joke/ They told no others."" There's a comparison of flabby bellies, an ""ear to the door/ Listening to the landing floorboards"" to figure out when the coast is clear to scamper from bed to bathroom. There's also a wonderfully, morbidly evocative image of a corpse dropped from a plane, so that it leaves a chalk outline capable, like something out of a children's game, of determining ""the initial of who you'll marry""-- and here's a crucial difference from the kids' stuff-- ""...now I'm not around."" It's worth letting yourself get past the sublime, Andrew Bujalski-level awkwardness of Gareth's sexual declarations about ""phallic cake"" or post-rock to get to these gorgeously expressive details.</p>
<p><i>All's Well That Ends</i> helps by showing there's more to these songs musically than the messy maximalism of their album renditions. The stripped-down arrangements suggest that violinist Harriet is probably the most underrated Campesinos!; her prickly pizzicato or melancholy bowing repeatedly add emotional heft to Gareth's conversational vocals. Tom, the guitarist, writes the bulk of the compositions, and he often keeps himself busy this time with more than the standard acoustic strums; there's even some slide guitar on lust-not-love advance mp3 ""Romance Is Boring (Princess Version)"" (all the songs here are subtly retitled from their album versions). Other mildly revelatory change-ups include a deep, Nico-ish lead vocal to start the most dramatically different track, ""Letters From Me to Charlotte (RSVP)""-- presumably by new keyboardist Kim-- and a deeper, Silver Jews-ish backing vocal by another new member, Rob, right when Gareth is enunciating the most embarrassing lyrics on wryly hooky break-up anthem ""Straight in at 101/ It's Never Enough"". Two guys singing about not getting any play might be funnier than one.</p>
<p>There's a moment on the album version of ""In Medias Res"" where the lyrics become completely incomprehensible, hidden behind electronic cacophony. That's important, because it shows a band whose appeal has largely relied on Gareth's way with words really making a case for themselves as noise-makers, too. On the EP's ""(All's Well That Ends) In Medias Res"", however, we hear some new lines, over rickety piano and Harriet's violin: ""You know I'd sooner go down in a ball of flames/ Than I would lay here and be bored to death/ All's well that ends."" Surely Los Campesinos! don't believe that, but they know what it's like to feel it, and it's fun when they can make you feel it, too. It's a way to get the emotional release of mythologized self-destruction without the atavistic dumbness.</p>
<p>A new report this month from Nielsen says MySpace now accounts for only 5.6% of people's online social-networking time. Meanwhile, Los Campesinos!-- who made their name through and originally sounded like products of that Web 2.0 site-- have gone from the little hobby of some UK college students to a seasoned band playing mid-size U.S. venues and late-night network TV. If they've succeeded where Rupert Murdoch couldn't, it's because they've grown and adapted without losing sight of what made them Internet sensations in the first place. The <i>All's Well That Ends</i> EP may not be the end for Los Campesinos!, but it's definitely the end of the beginning.</p></div>"|14522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14522-alls-well-that-ends-ep/|7.6|Marc Hogan

It's safe to say that Ramona Gonzalez, an L.A.-based musician who records ephemeral, homemade dreambeat music as Nite Jewel, has probably had some experience with the feeling. Unfortunately for Gonzalez, it's not entirely her fault-- despite possessing a somewhat indistinct but chimerically lithe voice, the fact remains that she is still one of many artists today making ephemeral, homemade dreambeat music. What sets most Nite Jewel recordings apart is their refusal to rely too heavily on lazy ambience, often nurturing a variety of sounds rooted in retro funk and future pop. On <i>Am I Real?</i>, a new EP that Gonzalez casually claims to be a chronicle of Nite Jewel's development since the hushed, lo-fi bedroom feel of her debut full-length, <i>Good Evening</i>, she appears to make a concerted effort to reupholster her sound and abandon some of her once too-delicate reflexes.</p>
<p>The two offerings that best frame this development are the best and worst songs on <i>Am I Real?</i>, one indicative of the now stalled aesthetic that aided early Nite Jewel recordings and the other her best track yet. ""Falling Far"", which appeared on a 7"" released last summer, is the former: Sounding like an outtake from <i>Good Evening</i> (which I'm guessing it was), it's proof that the the hazy, minimalist vibe had been stretched just to the breaking point. You could argue that Nite Jewel's reluctance to ever step out of the shadows has been part of the project's charm, and while ""Falling Far"" is pleasant, there's not much room for expansion with so little to grab onto. Wafting through the room largely unnoticed, its detail-deprived, hook-deficicent existence conveys little else other than a grinning, narcotized plainness. In essence, it simply sounds worn.</p>
<p>But it doesn't go without serving some sort of purpose, showing how far one would have to come to create something as fresh and immediately pleasing as ""Am I Real?"". Like some long lost, couples-skate jam, the title track is about as far from the lounged-out sounds that once defined Nite Jewel, spotlighting the murky patches of slow-motion disco that murmured below the surface of<i> Good Evening </i>standouts like ""What Did He Say"". And it isn't only the music that sounds uninhibited, though you'll find it easy to relish in its patient, sexy retro-slink. Gonzalez sounds perfectly comfortable singing directly and weightlessly, opting neither to coo aimlessly (like on opener ""Another Horizon"") or uncomfortably force her voice into a lower register (doing a bad Nico on ""We Want Our Things""). ""Am I Real?"" instead exudes confidence, deriving its cool from intelligent song craft that requires more than retro artifice to sell itself.</p>
<p>So it's unfortunate that the four tracks that make up the rest of the EP are both bland and weirdly cluttered. Gonzalez has made an effort to eradicate the tape hiss she used to feel so comfortable bathing her songs in, but we can also see why she might have needed it in the first place. ""White Lies"" and ""Another Horizon"" both suffer from sounding blocky and truncated, shocking the senses with out-of-place blasts of synth noise, quirky percussion, and cheesy sci-fi embellishments. The party responsible is likely Cole M. Greif-Neill (Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, the Samps), whose taste for erratic arrangements feels out of sync with Gonzalez's approach. Without nurturing the lush interconnectedness of the sounds that older Nite Jewel recordings managed to synthesize almost effortlessly, the skeletal structures on <i>Am I Real?</i> feel unappealingly simplistic and muddied with noises and rhythms that fit together awkwardly. So <i>Am I Real?</i> is another stop-gap in a could-be successful career.</p></div>"|14525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14525-am-i-real-ep/|6.2|Zach Kelly

It goes back to the early 1980s, when he was a teenager playing in bands around L.A. He played in Savage Republic, a highly influential group that anticipated a lot of ideas later explored in post-rock, his early 90s band Medicine was about as close as the U.S. got to answering My Bloody Valentine with its mix of surging noise and soft vocals, and he's done tons of other stuff, with a recorded output that amounts to appearances on around 300 albums. So he's already accomplished a lot, and that may be why, in 2007, when he finally issued his first album under his own name, it was such a casually assured-sounding work. He's earned his way to a place where he can make whatever music he wants at whatever pace he wishes.</p>
<p>The same holds true on <i>Natural Selections</i>, which Laner himself has described as ""a simulacrum of what the band of my dreams sounds like."" He took his time making it, laying down tracks in between his responsibilities as a father and laboring over the details-- the work shows in the album's many intricately layered songs. Two central threads of Laner's long career have been juxtaposition and electronic exploration, and both are prominent compositional tools here. Laner loves to layer his voice over and over, creating big, pillowy textures out of it, which he then sets against all manner of contrasting and complementary sounds, from sharply buzzing synthesizer and crackling drums to  fuzzed-out psychedelic riffs and loopy dabs of keyboard.</p>
<p>In fact, the ""band of Laner's dreams"" sounds less like a band than a walking tour of a guy's head. Sometimes, pastoral songs stay soft and gentle; other times, he'll detour sharply, such as when he rips open the mellow piano groove of ""Little Death"" with an overdrive-saturated guitar solo. There's a little room in there for the occasional hard-charger too, which Laner offers on ""Brain"", when guitars, synths, and vocals smear together in one big wash that's propelled forward by drums and a quirky, counterintuitive bass line. You could call it shoegaze or something, but that wouldn't quite capture its eccentric buzz. ""Lancaster"" has a bit of everything, with a wailing lead guitar clearing the way for tight self-harmonizing that sounds like Yes with Hendrix on guitar instead of Steve Howe. Its straightforward refrain of ""people buy drugs in Lancaster"" is among the album's most startlingly lucid moments, and the way it contrasts with its dreamier surroundings makes it an arresting little hook.</p>
<p>The album's least arresting moment is undoubtedly the wallet photo of his young son that Laner slots in on track nine. I can see how fatherly pride and a desire to stamp the album with something that would firmly place it at a particular point in the artist's life might have led Laner to include a track of his six-year old banging on both a guitar and a kick drum while singing, but it's definitely distracting. While it's not much to listen to, though, it is mercifully brief and easy to forgive in light of everything else here.</p></div>"|14550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14550-natural-selections/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Onstage, a handful of performers huddle over tables of gadgets, pushing buttons, twisting knobs, and adjusting sliders. They concentrate only on their corner, often not acknowledging the audience. Tempos are rare; melodies, perhaps more so. Not even a collaborative improvisation between Jim O'Rourke, Keiji Haino, and Oren Ambarchi-- three of the best sound artists in the world-- is likely to win many cynics. <i>Tima Formosa </i><span>is </span>composed of three pieces that methodically step through webs of static, screams, feedback, percussion, and piano. One nondescript hum sometimes becomes the shared focus of each musician for several minutes. But with its generous strata of textures and its impeccably timed shifts, <i>Tima Formosa</i> highlights some of the best qualities of this form and, in doing so, rewards attention generously.</p>
<p>Anything less would be a disappointment. These three improvisers boast discographies and résumés deeper and more diverse than most of their peers. On <i>Tima Formosa</i>, the personalities of each musician meld, creating an improvisation that's faithful to the group ideal. It's important to understand the players: Aside from his pop-rock forays and production work with Wilco, Sonic Youth, and Joanna Newsom, American expatriate and Tokyo resident O'Rourke has collaborated with what sometimes feels like everyone-- Christian Fennesz, KK Null, Carlos Giffoni, and Tony Conrad, to sample blindly. His solo electronic album, 2002's<i> I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1,2,3,4</i>, is a strangely human laptop essential.</p>
<p>Haino is a psychedelic Japanese demigod with an assortment of releases more intense and exhausting than Kate Gosselin's grocery list. He's worked in jazz, noise, metal, improv, and rock and with guitar, voice, drums, drum machines, and theremins. His best records are radiant, limitless explorations of a unifying idea. Ambarchi, meanwhile, has recorded extensively with electroacoustic kingpins Günter Müller and Keith Rowe, and he's in two trios with Mayhem's Attila Csihar and members of Sunn O))). More important here, though, are his gorgeous solo albums. Like <i>Tima Formosa</i>, Ambarchi's overlooked solo works spot an interesting tone or timbre and explore its every surface. Such obsession is the anchor here.</p>
<p>But this is neither a tidal drone record, where one sound consumes a side, nor a glitch record, where every sound serves simply as an introduction for the next. Rather, it's something in between, where the players cycle through themes at just the right pace, neither restless nor lazy. For its first dozen minutes, the opening take-- simply entitled ""Tima Formasa 1""-- is a glow of anxiety, with bulbous bass tones, cyclical amplifier hum, and slicing cymbal passes folding nervously against one another. Haino finally turns it into hyperbole, routing his emasculated shriek through delay as the circuits click behind him.</p>
<p>Between the 25-minute opener and the 31-minute closer, the trio offers the perfect mid-album respite. For four minutes, O'Rourke builds atonal piano clouds beneath Haino's meditative croon and above Ambarchi's monotonous squall. It distracts without absorbing, a stopgap that doesn't disrupt from the action so much as prepare for the next phase. That phase-- full of lacerated, metal-like vocals, intoxicating tribal drumming, and long, lashing tones-- again builds, burns, and bleeds into silence. It rarely sags and never suggests that these players were as isolated as they might have appeared during the recording of this album, on stage in Japan in January 2009.</p></div>"|14559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14559-tima-formosa/|7.3|Grayson Currin

Many are deservedly ignored. I can't speak for Colin Caulfield's intents, but his niche focus resulted in a humble, but honest-to-god success story. He came to our attention due to a video of his covering Deerhunter's ""Rainwater Cassette Exchange"", a song written by a guy curious enough to find it and gregarious enough to post it on his blog, calling the version superior to his own. Caulfield's YouTube page also had videos covering Beach House, Bon Iver, and most recently, Ariel Pink, but it was presumably the originals that got the attention of the esteemed Frenchkiss label, who are now releasing his <i>Boy EP </i>under the name Young Man.</p>
<p>While this style of come-up happens all the time in hip-hop, Caulfield's rise can easily cause skepticism in his realm: the indie listenership still puts a lot of credence in ""you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent,"" and is always uneasy with its tendency toward metacommentary. But even if you find no need for it to make some larger point about indie eating its own tail, the backstory is important because<i> </i>it gives you an extremely precise idea of what <i>Boy EP </i>sounds like-- acoustic guitars that give off the whiff of sunscreen, sunbaked loops, easygoing percussion, vocals blanched in reverb, and lyrics that take an ""aw shucks"" wistfulness to growing up-- in other words, singer-songwriter circa 2010, the type that has no problem forgoing codified Proper Influences like Bowie and Eno or Elliott and Drake in favor of Panda and Bradford.</p>
<p>We've endured quite a few bedroom acts in recent years that ape recent sonic palettes without adding any personal twist, and unfortunately, <i>Boy </i>doesn't go too far beyond ""hey, it's that indie YouTube guy."" ""Five"" rolls off a pleasantly tropical chord progression with the EP's strongest melody, and the bric-a-brac percussion of ""Just a Growin'"" is fortunately miles away from the ever-present Dilla gravedigging. But the reverence to Young Man's source material can be stifling-- check the dubby whooping that punctuates ""Five"", the Panda Bear-like erratic voice-and-guitar undulation of ""Home Alone"" (doesn't anyone want to sound like Avey Tare?), or the twinkling noise piece ""Bedtime"" that seems to exist on <i>Boy</i> because, well, you gotta have one of those.</p>
<p>Let's be real: This is basically a demo tape. I understand the negative connotations behind that term, but it's actually in Caulfield's favor to view these as sketches rather than finished product. We've become inured to lo-fi recording, but unlike the methods used by Washed Out or Real Estate, the humble sound of <i>Boy </i>doesn't add a dimension that takes you further than Caulfield's own bedroom. The compositional U-turns of ""Home Alone"" and ""Just a Growin'"" could've worked in longer, more patient pieces, but in their compact dimensions, they simply sound contrived. Sadly, <i>Boy </i>is the first of a planned clutch of EPs from Young Man, so it's doubtful we'll ever hear these songs given the fleshed-out sound they deserve. It's a good reminder that too often the Internet's insatiable need to discover new acts can be harmful to artists, but <i>Boy </i>proves the listener loses out just as often.</p></div>"|14553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14553-boy-ep/|5.2|Ian Cohen

Even as a primarily electronic artist in the early 2000s, Dear hopped from label to label, switched aliases often, and made everything from steely microhouse to harder Detroit techno. But his biggest departure was 2007's <i>Asa Breed</i>, the record where he stepped out from behind the decks and reached for the mic. Singing on tracks and leaning more heavily on song structure, he built strange hybrid music that had one foot in techno and the other in pop.</p>
<p>Dear's latest album, <i>Black City</i>, follows this path but pulls a pretty drastic shift in tone. Where <i>Asa Breed</i> was bubbly and squeaky and ultimately dancefloor-bound, this record is dark as night. The music brings to mind blown-out warehouses, desolate alleys, and seedy basement nightclubs; it's some real threatening, grimy shit. The production is as inventive and immersive as ever, but what separates this album from the last is that Dear mostly sticks with one theme all the way through. <i>Asa Breed</i> was all over the place at times, but this album has a cohesive thread to follow and smaller vignettes within it.</p>
<p>It's worth noting on a general level that <i>Black City</i> isn't always an easy listen-- there's a lot of detail that can take a couple of spins to get comfortable with. Part of this is structural. Dear doesn't really do clean electro-pop; his approach is more about pushing contrasting sounds together and leaving the edges jagged. The other part is his vocals. Dear is not a classically strong singer and can often sound pretty flat; importantly he knows how to make up for it. He uses technology to stretch his natural range, wrapping choruses around beats in creative ways and sometimes layering multiple vocals together to create depth.</p>
<p>So the album has a lot of contrast and textural nuance. There's also a good amount of sex. In the first half, Dear explores this really nocturnal, salacious sound. Songs in this section are either slow-paced come-ons or faster club tracks, but they all ooze attitude and lust. Opener ""Honey"" is a good example of the former, kind of a sauntering R&amp;B number with a gritty noise instrumental at its core. But one song stands out: ""You Put a Smell on Me"" is just total industrial-dance smut, with Dear soliciting an indecent ride ""in [his] big black car."" Mechanical synths grind, beats scrape against the wall, and Dear offers up double entendre: ""You decide if you want to come."" It might just be the raunchiest-sounding track since NIN's ""Closer"".</p>
<p>Dear gets that there's no point in going any dirtier after this, and he uses the rest of the album to divert the vibe towards something brighter. It's a move that threatens the overall theme, but it ultimately works in maintaining the idea of deep contrast and dark vs. light. So the back-end is more pastoral sounding-- beats don't grind as hard and vocals open up, feel more skyward. Rather than the dark disco earlier on, songs in this portion hew closer toward Eno/Talking Heads ambient pop, and there's some really beautiful stuff here. ""Gem"", the closer, is one of the album's best. A big, opulent track about loss and regret, it's both deeply sad and optimistic at the same time. And the album needs a big emotional anchor like this, otherwise you might feel a little filthy for enjoying it so much.</p></div>"|14533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14533-black-city/|8.4|Joe Colly

It's tempting to think of him as a guitarist, mostly because he has such amazing command of that instrument, but he really is more than that. It's not quite as simple as saying he's also a pianist, though, because while he plays that instrument I tend not to think of him as a pianist so much as a composer who plays piano to achieve his goals.</p>
<p>It sets up a weird dichotomy in me when I listen to his music. I like it all, but I find I really prefer him when the acoustic guitar is in the lead. I think it boils down to this: When he builds around his guitar, it feels like I'm listening to his thoughts, the little bits of information and images floating around in his brain that he might not be able to set words to or otherwise organize. When the compositions are centered on the piano, I feel like I'm listening to his <i>ideas</i>, which is different. They are, it must be said, good ideas, and Blackshaw is getting better at realizing them-- last year's <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> used the piano to build towering drones that sometimes did little more than drone, but on <i>All Is Falling</i>, Blackshaw seems more in control and more fleet on the keys.</p>
<p>This much is very clear from the very first moments of the record, where Blackshaw tumbles in on the piano with a simple, repeated phrase that's joined by others that interlock with and embellish it. It progresses into a churning, dramatic sequence topped by little cascades that move in and out like weather systems-- it's compact and perhaps the sharpest thing he's done on the piano. When we finally hear him on the guitar on ""Part 2"", it's not his characteristic acoustic 12-string, but rather a clean-toned, six-string electric. For a time, he rather purposefully avoids density and the type of shifting movement he's known for, letting a couple of strings feel their way around what he's doing. It's only on the subsequent piece that he takes off and starts in on those wild runs and slowly morphing progressions. The whole thing flows together and culminates in the 12-minute ""Part 7"", which opens with a guitar part that could very well be a rock riff until it persists in repeating over and over, almost like a loop. The strings dance over the top of it, and the way they harmonize with it makes it feel as though the static part is changing with them.</p>
<p>Eventually, the guitar lets go, percussion comes in, and the piece becomes something far more urgent and even sinister. It's a surprising and powerful change-up, and one that might make for an easy entry point for rock fans looking to explore Blackshaw's work. It's also a moment that marks a transition between the phase where Blackshaw began exploring other timbres as a way of broadening his sound and a new phase where all these other tools he's given himself really seem close to achieving that same kind of stream-of-consciousness effect his guitar playing has.</p></div>"|14534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14534-all-is-falling/|7.8|Joe Tangari

More <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14249-false-flag/"">recently</a>, he's worked with Richard Bishop and Ben Chasny in Rangda. But for his solo ventures, Corsano has been a bit more stealth, releasing two on handmade CD-R's via his own Hot Cars Warp label, and a third in a small edition on the Belgian imprint Ultra Eczema. He's even more surreptitious on <i>High and Dry</i>, claiming the album was made with a guitarist and bassist who have ""requested anonymity for personal and professional reasons."" Don't be fooled-- Corsano played everything here, overdubbing himself into a freewheeling garage-rock trio.</p>
<p>The results are as energetic and raucous as any Corsano fan would imagine, though not as thoroughly successful as <i>False Flag</i>, Rangda's exceptional debut. At its best, when thick bass lines and gristly guitar distortion wrap around drums in wavy patterns, <i>High and Dry</i> sounds like a free-jazz take on math-tinted groups like Breadwinner or Shellac. For those accustomed to pristine studio creations, the music's slanted synchronicity might not sound like three people playing together in one room. But the songs' lopsided tilt feels real, avoiding the sterility of an exercise or the artificiality of precise editing. It's most convincing on opener ""Junior/Rattus"", a roller coaster of stop/start chops, and closer ""The Royalty Check Is in the Mail (Live at St. Joseph's Abbey)"", in which Corsano's loose-limbed, storm-brewing drum style is unleashed on Sun City Girls' classic ""Esoterica of Abyssnia"".</p>
<p>Both of those songs pack a lot of activity into their three-minute packages, and <i>High and Dry</i> falters only when Corsano lets his whirling mix grind on too long. The 13-minute ""Lights Are on, Nobody's Home, House Is on Fire"" smolders in places, but mostly drifts aimlessly, stuck between narrow variety and noncommittal repetition. But that's followed by a string of surprises, including the rattling feedback of ""Doctor!"", the looping bleed of ""Susquehanna Hat Company"", and the metallic crunch of ""I Feel Like I Fell in a Hole/We Don't Need No Music, We Got Soul"". Such kaleidoscopic moves recall the wild diversity of Corsano's first solo album, 2006's <i>The Young Cricketer</i>, a mini-masterpiece of tones and textures created primarily with percussion. <i>High and Dry</i> doesn't catch that album's spark, but you can hear the seeds of something special here-- seeds that will likely flower should Corsano ever revisit this army-of-one format.</p></div>"|14552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14552-high-and-dry/|6.9|Marc Masters

Nothing dramatic happens in his music, and there aren't too many people who listen to it to begin with. The stories he tells are about Americans who don't cry out to have their stories told. Sometimes they're homeless or old. Sometimes they work at the bank. (They are, of course, heart-swellingly remarkable, but that's only because Ashley has a gift-- and a mission, maybe-- to make the uneventful feel mysterious and even transcendent.)</p>
<p>In 40 years, he's rarely raised his voice on record, and though the equipment he uses to compose the music behind his stories has changed, the actual music hasn't: It's pretty, quiet, and consistent. The people in his performances, which usually include him, don't even sing, they speak in rhythmic, exaggerated voices. Actual singing would be too dramatic. Last time he performed in New York, I was inappropriately excited-- it was like tailgating for meditation. My girlfriend fell asleep 20 minutes into it and later said, ""I liked it.""</p>
<p>In my fan's mind, I can't figure out why he isn't as famous-- or at least endlessly name-dropped-- as other dressed-down 20th-century composers like Terry Riley and Steve Reich. One of the reasons might be that there's nothing conventionally sexy or cool about his music. Despite living in New York for more than half his life, Ashley's diction and style have always made him seem grandfatherly and safe, even when he's talking about life's vast gray areas.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the liner notes for his new album, a companion disc to his large work <i>Atalanta</i>, reads, ""Without the music (and even with the music) people drop out now and then."" He knows people will fall asleep. This is Robert Ashley joking about Robert Ashley. Despite its beauty, there is nothing self-serious about his music; his sense of humor, though as quiet as everything else he does, probably blows away the expectations a typical Pitchfork reader has for 80-year-old Midwestern men or art-music composers, let alone both.</p>
<p>But this idea of hearing music piecemeal is also a thesis about how his music works, and an expression of how radically it has affected how I listen to it-- though even saying ""I listen to it"" feels too active. When I get an album of his I haven't heard, I don't sit down and make a trip out of it. I loop it and start doing chores. A few days later, I recognize something. Then, maybe, a piece of the story dawns on me.</p>
<p><i>Atalanta (Acts of God): Volume II</i> is, again, part of a larger work whose whole pretense would take a long time to explain and actually turns me off a little, but the basic setup is Robert Ashley, Jacqueline Humbert (one of his long-time collaborators), and some synthesizers. It is two discs long, and for what it's worth, I think it's the best thing he's released in five years (and it's the sixth piece of relatively new Ashley music issued on CD this decade).</p>
<p>My least favorite section, ""The Etchings"", lasts for 30 minutes, but I don't skip it. ""You, my dear, are the cutest little police officer I've ever seen. If you could take time from your route and step into that doorway with me for a while,"" Ashley says, before Humbert finishes his thought-- ""We could transcend the limitations of the flesh."" This is one way he writes: the vernacular against the abstract. The soda-counter philosopher.</p>
<p>Later, he tells an allegory about corporate America, but posits it as a story about tomato ketchup. This is another way he writes: a threatening current under something that seems harmless. The last, multi-part section involves Humbert talking about a series of au pairs. At one point, a mother comes home to an open door, with the sitter-- Simone, a hot, 19-year-old French-Swiss girl ""who dressed in a decidedly New Wave direction, with gently pointed black ankle boots""-- drugged-up and post-coital. The next day the parent is filling the tub and trying to forget the still-unexplainable confusion, when the kid pushes his favorite stuffed animal into his crotch and says, ""Monkey's gonna suck my penis!"" I laughed out loud the first time I heard this, and the second. On the third, I felt worried: This is a story about the subtle nightmare of letting a stranger into your family, or of knowing your child has been exposed to something you weren't there for and can't counteract. A kid forcing his stuffed monkey to fellate him.</p>
<p>About three years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Robert Ashley for an interview. He gave me a small glass of potato vodka and told me a story about how the most beautiful building he had ever seen was across the street from where he lived. He still lives there, I think, off to the side.</p></div>"|14558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14558-atalanta-acts-of-god-volume-ii/|7.9|Mike Powell

His music-- best described as a techno/house hybrid-- sounds like it's entered the world only after roiling around inside himself; just not his head so much as his torso and legs.  <i>One</i><span>, his debut album, sounded well-trained, </span><i>competitive</i><span>.</span> Klock's first commercial mix-- <i>Berghain 04</i><span>, composed for the Berlin nightclub at which he is a resident-- retains </span><i>One</i><span>'s sense of physicality and restlessness.</span></p>
<p><span>DJ mixes are made for dancing, or at least extended listening; by definition they should contain some sense of community. </span><i>Berghain</i><span> still feels claustrophobic and anxious.  It's easy to hear Klock's clacking, percussive sounds and flat tones as impersonal or robotic, but Klock's efforts seem more nuanced.  It's like he wants to rock bodies so long as those bodies remain somewhat leery of one another.  That he has again achieved this effect with a host of his peers' tracks-- instead of his own compositions-- should confirm both his skill and his intentions.</span></p>
<p><i>Berghain</i><span> doesn't offer any discernible narratives or movements.  Instead it is uniformly complex and machinated.  Understanding its many small parts is daunting, but it functions seamlessly.  Three tracks in, when Klock spins a Marcel Dettmann remix of the Junior Boys' ""Work"" (easily the most recognizable source material here), the lonely, echoing voice doesn't sound like it's calling to the dancelfoor but to Klock: ""So work it baby, work it,"" as Klock adds a small snare to the mix.  Later, during Kevin Gorman's ""7am Stepper"", a voice repeats the names of two of Klock's touchstone city centers: ""Detroit/ Chicago/ Detroit/ Chicago.""  The content and placement of these phrases makes their purpose clear: Klock is psyching himself up.</span></p>
<p><span>The breadth of sounds Klock weaves into his mix is sneakily diverse.  Almost all of the selections fall on the tech-house/minimal axis (the big names here-- Levon Vincent, STL, Martyn-- are probably recognizable only to beat-heads) but Klock wrings a surprising variety from them.  Organ-heavy patches from Vincent and DVS1 echo actual rock'n'roll; Klock mixes his own ""Elfin Flight"" into Rolando's ""Junie"" to close the album with a touch of trip-hop.  Points in between move from serene to industrial to funky.</span></p>
<p><i>Berghain 04</i><span> falls short of being truly attractive.  It's exclusive to a fault, both in Klock's walled-in demeanor and in Berghain's reserved output.  (Klock is the most famous of the Berghain series' four mixers; compare this to fellow nightclub Fabric's ongoing </span><i>Fabric</i><span> and </span><i>FabricLive</i><span> series, released so frequently that they may actually run out of DJs.) </span><i>Berghain 04 </i><span>is far more impressive than it is enjoyable, but it </span><span>does confirm Klock as a committed visionary and probably the most palatable ambassador of the Berghain sound.  It's a fine document for those of us who can't be there to leer in person.</span></p></div>"|14556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14556-berghain-04/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

While the band is known for working up a sweat-drenched crowd chaos, though, their career trajectory has been one of a band focused on truly honing their hard-charging craft. LSF's last full-length, 2007's <i>Let's Stay Friends</i>, represented the full realization of their sound, with exacting, catchy-as-hell songs that possessed the neck-snapping kinetic energy that was found in rougher form on previous records. A polished ""crossover"" effort, yeah, but also fun and rollicking in all the right places.</p>
<p><i>Root For Ruin</i>, the band's fifth proper LP, re-asserts that sound rather than expanding upon or altering it. There's not many surprising moments on this record; if anything, it feels like the first Les Savy Fav album that sounds more comfortable in its own clothes than twitching to tear apart its own skin. This isn't necessarily a bad thing: LSF still excel at constructing miniature explosions of songs, even if they sound a bit tidier now.</p>
<p>Guitarists Seth Jabour and Andrew Reuland prove to be aces in the hole for this record, continuing to prove their worth as two of modern indie rock's smarter, more bruising axe-wielders. They layer colorful lines over each other like it's a competition, bringing the hook-laden pain on the smashing, bashing opener ""Appetites"" and ""Lips n' Stuff"". Elsewhere, they create nervewracking warning calls on ""Excess Energies"" that dovetail in and out of Tim Harrington's metronomic shouts. On the whole, there are still very few bands that do this arty, shitkicking stuff as well as Les Savy Fav do.</p>
<p>And yet <i>Root For Ruin</i> feels slightly sluggish, more so than any of the band's previous records. The distinct lack of new ideas plays a small part in this letdown-- ""Dear Crutches""' dripping guitar line sounds a <i>little</i> too close to ""The Sweat Descends"", a standout on 2004's kickass singles collection <i>Inches</i>-- but mostly it's the presence of a few lukewarm cuts that make the record one of LSF's more minor efforts. ""Sleepless in Silverlake"" and ""Let's Get Out of Here"", notably, bring the album to a near-flatlining halt. The latter is a midtempo would-be rager that never takes off the ground, while the former is the life-in-Los-Angeles snoozer that you hoped Tim Harrington would never write. The slow jams aren't the only duds here, as the speed-addled ""Calm Down""'s monochromatic chorus squarely locates the song on the wrong side of the ""post-hardcore"" tag.</p>
<p>Dull tempos, disengaging moments, recycled ideas-- all egregious offenses, yes. Luckily, Les Savy Fav have earned a decade's worth of goodwill to cushion a just-OK album or two landing in their discography, which makes <i>Root For Ruin</i> a well-deserved victory lap, if nothing else.  The lone pair of surprising songs on <i>Root For Ruin</i>, the dissonant howler ""Poltergeist"" and menacing closer ""Clear Spirits"", serve as a gentle nudge as well that this band surely has some creative juice left in them. Let's hope they utilize it well in the future, because Les Savy Fav simply being Les Savy Fav can't retain its charm forever.</p></div>"|14537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14537-root-for-ruin/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Faster genres like drum'n'bass can go upwards of 180, and slower stuff like downtempo clocks in around 96 and 112. Tracks on Balam Acab's <i>See Birds</i> EP have a bpm of about 65. Put simply, this is sloooow music. Super-sluggish pacing is one of a few reasons Balam Acab is associated with witch house, the gloom-pop genre pioneered by the band Salem. (Distorted hip-hop, nods to drone and lo-fi, and eerie sonics are other common elements.) Even though he's tied to this scene, there are plenty of things that set Balam apart.</p>
<p>Balam Acab is Alec Koone, a 19-year-old college kid studying music education in upstate New York. Unlike some of his peers, he doesn't sing or play instruments on tracks, but builds them instead with samples collected from the Internet. He isolates and distorts bits of source material (say, vocal loops or beat fragments) and smears them together in new arrangements. The results are remarkably seamless. Take opener ""See Birds (Moon)"", where a scratchy drone meets heavy, blown-out beats and a chorus of layered vocals. The way he puts them together, a new natural rhythm for these sounds emerges and it becomes hard to imagine them in any other order.</p>
<p>Sturdy as these songs are, what's really impressive about Koone's music is how he's able to play with contrast and draw out emotion. Tension seems to be the key. On the eastern-tinged ""Regret Mistakes"", some very light, angelic verses pull the song upward, but when the beat comes in, all gritty and mangled, it yanks you right back to earth. And for digital music, it can be especially evocative. In ""Big Boy"", which incorporates 80s synths and watery Animal Collective textures, he makes a sampled kids' chorus feel weirdly somber. Next to big, threatening beats, the children sound too young to be at this adult party, and it gives a sense of innocence lost.</p>
<p>The EP is only five tracks long, and around the fourth, Koone starts to nudge the sounds in a brighter direction. ""Dream Out"" and the closer, an alternate mix of the title track, are the two most optimistic-sounding things here. Though they lack some of the earlier cuts' weight, they support the idea that Koone has more to him than spooky. Sparkly sounds populate these tracks, and the overall feeling is more dream-pop than ""witch house."" There's also a heavy dub influence that runs through the album (hear it in the sub-aquatic bass of ""Big Boy""), and combined with his penchant for loops and samples, Koone reminds me at times of a young Noah Lennox. Can't say for now whether he has that kind of ability, but this is a heck of an impressive first step.</p></div>"|14548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14548-see-birds-ep/|8.0|Joe Colly

It makes sense that, despite a band name that begged for attention, they kept their heads low: Their straightforward brand of retro (ca. 1995 or 1979) power-pop may never be trendy, but it never goes out of style, and when done with passion and monster hooks, it can still make inroads even with more outré styles becoming mainstream (see: Surfer Blood).</p>
<p>On first listen to their new album, <i>Let It Sway</i>, SSLYBY sound like they're done fucking around in the minor leagues, newly invigorated after the 2008's innocuous <i>Pershing</i>. ""Back in the Saddle"" backs up the mission-statement intent of its title, a sturdy foundation of anthemic guitars both folky and power chord-driven, support a carousel of alternate-reality radio melodies. The song actually demands to be heard, as does the the effortless ""Sink/Let It Sway"" and the infectious, huge ""na na na"" chorus on ""Banned (By the Man)"".</p>
<p>That opening trio is enough to make <i>Let It Sway </i>worth your time, but it actually manages to create an internal letdown once the momentum inevitably gets stunted. <i>Let It Sway</i>'s pleasant but lightweight midsection of pro forma power-pop could pass for enjoyably minor Fountains of Wayne songs for better (we're talking about the early stuff) or worse (the lack of lyrical specificity makes them somewhat anonymous). It's tough to say whether it's due to the handiwork of producer Chris Walla, who lends everything a crisp sound and a tasteful smattering of studio trickery. But as is the case with recent Death Cab albums, it's too hermetic and prim to truly rock out, leaving the relatively aggressive ""All Hail Dracula!"" to sound all too similar to the acoustic ballad (""Stuart Gets Lost Dans Le Metro"") and the flanged head-bopper (""Animalkind"").</p>
<p>And on ""Critical Drain"", the restraint clearly shows its deleterious effects. The glass ceiling of Walla's production doesn't allow the double-time cowpunk arrangement to do a proper amount of shitkicking, but what's even more strange are the lyrics. I'm not against this thing because it's a broadside against music critics who ask them stupid questions about their name and so forth (um...). The problem is that it's too damn <i>polite </i>about it. ""I don't mean to be an asshole,"" sings Cardwell, but in this context, maybe he'd be better off being a little less charitable-- ""we're just circling around the critical drain."" SSLYBY have every right to feel like they have a chip on their shoulder, and if they can somehow manage to inject some grit next time out, they could be looking at a success that's an even greater revenge than ""Critical Drain"".</p></div>"|14554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14554-let-it-sway/|6.8|Ian Cohen

Early indie and art-rockers took plenty from hardcore in the late 1980s and early 90s, especially bands on labels like Touch and Go and Dischord. Coliseum's third album, <i>House With a Curse</i>, nods to that not-so-distant past. Since its last LP, 2007's <i>No Salvation</i>, the band has recruited a new drummer and found a new label, moving from metal-mongers Relapse to the post-rocking Temporary Residence. They use every opportunity on <i>House With a Curse</i> to give tribute to the turn-of-the-90s bands that helped to shape their sound, often by inviting the members of those bands to perform on the album.</p>
<p>J. Robbins (Jawbox, Burning Airlines) mixed the album and even adds backing vocals on ""Blind in One Eye""-- and a hell of a track it is, surging in ways you rarely hear in indie while still toying with quiet-loud dynamics and unpredictable rhythms. The guitars throughout the album crackle with distortion, yet the melodies are always straightforward and clear, and Patterson's lyrics are discernible no matter how he sputters and yowls. He does go for nuance in his singing on ""Cloaked in Red"" and ""Perimeter Man"", but subtlety isn't what's remarkable about his voice. Instead, it's his guttural, gravel-gargling roar that would make John Brannon (Negative Approach, Laughing Hyenas) proud. The power of his voice makes a pretty decent nod to some underappreciated bands into something more forceful and emotionally resonant. Some more instrumental variety would have been nice, though-- after the high of the first few tracks wears off and the formula grows more apparent, change-ups like the long, tense intro on ""Man Was Never Meant to Fly"" turn out to be the bright spots of the album's second side.</p>
<p>Trying to bridge the gap between modern and more aggressive early indie doesn't always work. The more earnest nods to indie and art rock, for example, seem like window dressing compared to the force of songs like ""Blind in One Eye"" and ""Crime and the City"". While Will Oldham is a man beholden to no genre or label, his contribution to the bridge of ""Skeleton Smile"" struggles to be heard over the jagged guitar leads and double-time rhythm of the bass and drums, and spotting guests like Jason Noble (Rodan, Shipping News) or Peter Searcy (Squirrel Bait) is a Where's-Waldo hunt without the aid of the liner notes. <i>House With a Curse</i> seems like a conspicuous move from metal to indie, but whether Coliseum reach new fans or not, indie rock at large benefits from the band's injection of energy.</p></div>"|14530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14530-house-with-a-curse/|6.7|Jason Crock

The remaining musicians, Jesse Coppenbarger and Sean Kirkpatrick, recruited a new group and recorded <i>The Cradle</i>, so titled to suggest a new beginning. Coppenbarger recounts the whole ordeal on opener ""8 Years"", in which he sends dispatches from low-level indie touring: sharing stages with Q and Not U, watching lesbians make out on the mechanical bull, endless treks between shows, and pointless nights of drinking, playing, and puking. This cautionary tale is by turns anguished and ridiculous, insightful and unbelievable, and the band makes it sound like a violent venting of disappointments, regrets, and recriminations. Avoiding the easy romance of the road, Coppenbarger refuses to glorify the Colour Revolt self-destruction, instead wondering why the hell they even bothered. What did those eight years bring them, except the opportunity to do it all again?</p>
<p>With its ballsy cynicism and Coppenbarger's disgruntled performance, ""8 Years"" not only represents the Colour Revolt at their absolute best, but it introduces a band that would appear to have risen stronger and more strident from its own ashes. Sadly, that appearance is deceiving, and <i>The Cradle</i> never lives up to that first impression. Instead, Revolt 2.0 settle back down to being a workmanlike blog-rock band. The guitars reach for indie-rock transcendence but never grasp it, and Coppenbarger's self-questioning rants become self-absorbed groans. As a songwriter, he ignores the rigors of band life and assays the type of vague lyrics that signify import without ever delivering. His pseudo-profundities might make Interpol scratch their heads: ""If love is blind, where's your harness?"" he poses on the molasses ballad ""Everything Is the Same"", ""If love is seen, where's your illness?""</p>
<p>Rather than a confident album by a road-tested band, <i>The Cradle</i> sounds like the debut of a group that doesn't really know itself yet. Perhaps it's a transitional album, and the Colour Revolt's follow-up will find them developing their own sound. ""8 Years"" is about making sure all the effort, all the disappointment, and all the hell a band can put itself through in search of an excited audience is worth it. But here it sounds like they went through all that just to make one memorable song and nine forgettable ones.</p></div>"|14543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14543-the-cradle/|4.4|Stephen M.

As half of the great Texas rap duo UGK, Bun found his ideal complement in partner Pimp C. Bun brought the gravity and the technical prowess, and Pimp, besides being an incredible producer, had both the snarling fuck-the-world charisma and the expansive sense of vision that Bun always lacked. As a duo, they counterbalanced each other perfectly, Bun playing the sage big brother to Pimp's guttural loose cannon. And every time Bun has released a solo album, it's been at a time when Pimp was unavailable. (Pimp was in prison when Bun released 2005's <i>Trill</i>, and he died before the release of 2008's <i>II Trill</i>.) It's increasingly becoming obvious that Bun is somewhat adrift without his old partner.</p>
<p><i>Trill</i> and <i>II Trill</i> both had great moments, but they didn't work as unified albums. Instead, Bun adapted his style to his guests and producers, turning each LP into a patchwork of whatever was popular in rap that particular month. <i>Trill O.G.</i> works in much the same way-- except this time, Bun is all out of great moments, and it's less attuned to the styles he adapts. Throughout, he works in the same weary and vaguely clumsy cadence, never bringing the ebulliently eloquent verve he brought to his best UGK verses. Instead he merely seems to dutifully plug away every time he touches a mic.</p>
<p>It's tough to imagine how a rapper as great as Bun has managed to turn out an album as consistently turgid and leaden as this. After all, it's not like he's <i>forgotten</i> how to rap-- so far this year he's put in impressive guest appearances for guys like Gucci Mane and Yelawolf. But on <i>Trill O.G.</i>, that eternal baritone-rumble feels tired and beaten-down. He's no longer packing his verses with tricky internal rhymes, and everything he says feels like something he's said better before. Worse, he's developed a new tendency toward forehead-slap dumb punchlines: ""Go ask the white boys; they'll say you he's totally tubular/ Fuckin' bad bitches rub my dick against they uvula.""</p>
<p>It's not a <i>bad</i> album, exactly. Bun's voice, even at its clumsiest, carries weight. It's fun to hear him on a DJ Premier beat on ""Let 'Em Know"", even if it's not the landmark event a 1996 collab between these two might've been. The many guests all seem to realize they're working with a legend, so everyone works hard. And it's a guest roster packed with stars. Very few rappers, after all, carry the same goodwill as Bun does within rap, and almost no others could wrangle two Drake guest spots in summer 2010. But the best songs here don't feel like they belong to Bun. Rather, ""Just Like That"" and ""Countin' Money"" feel like they belong, respectively, to Young Jeezy and to the Gucci Mane/Yo Gotti tandem, and Bun feels like a guest on his own songs.</p>
<p>Besides that, there's a weird outdated feel to the album; too many of the songs feel like attempts to cross over to a rap mainstream that barely exists anymore. There's a reason that not too many people are recruiting T-Pain for choruses in 2010. And too many of the tracks come from the relatively unknown Texas producer Steve Below, whose beats feel like shallow parodies of the Houston rap that was popular five years ago. Bun doesn't have to make music this safe and leaden these days. In recent months, we've heard veterans like Big Boi and DJ Quik come with some of the most admirably weird records of their careers. But Bun is content to plug away at the same model, with diminishing returns. It's a shame.</p></div>"|14542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14542-trill-og/|5.0|Tom Breihan

That is especially true of <i>Are You My Mother?</i>, on which Calder's soft, sugary voice is rarely bolstered by more than a few tinkling piano keys or some understated guitar figures with only an unobtrusive tambourine or a shaker to keep time. Her delicate, chirpy tones (reinforced on two tracks by Case's sassier voice) are placed far out front in the mix, which not only points the spotlight squarely at her singing but can also make the instrumental arrangements seem out-of-focus and indistinct in the background. Luckily, though, her voice is interesting-- ceaselessly cute at times, washed-out and wispy at others, but always intriguing.</p>
<p>On New Pornographers songs like ""Sweet Talk, Sweet Talk"" and ""Failsafe"", Calder always plays the part of the dreamy ingénue, and though her voice will never be mistaken for ""smoky"" or ""knowing,"" she certainly takes a different role on these solo songs. There is still levity in her voice-- a crisp, bright alto that's reminiscent of Jenny Lewis'-- but it has far less bounce and naivety here. Without Carl Newman's big, juicy hooks to buoy her, you can hear the sadness in her darker colored tones (appropriate, since the album was made during Calder's time caring for her terminally ill mother) and the emotional quiver of her more whispery takes. Which is all well and good, except that the best pop songs thrive on hooks, and while Newman is a heavyweight champion, Calder is still only in training. Most tracks (except the scene-stealing ""If You Only Knew"", which is bolstered by unfussy hand-claps and a ramshackle Celtic folk song melody) lack the contagious crackle and power-pop snap of her work with the New Pornographers.</p>
<p>Colin Stewart's production, however, almost makes up for a lack of memorable melodies. The album was made in an improvised studio that Calder and her producer created in her childhood home, and its setting adds an intimacy and an off-the-cuff quality to many of the songs. The anything-goes percussion (including sounds made from banging on tissue boxes and plucking piano strings) on ""Slip Away"" or the comparably lush male backing vocals and earthy mandolin on ""Follow Me Into the Hills"" sound as if they were made on the spot.</p>
<p>Despite lots of lovely touches-- namely the haunting singing saw on ""Arrow"" and the goosebump-inducing harmonies on the painfully intimate ""So Easily""-- the album feels slight. Perhaps this is due to the sparseness of the arrangements or melodies that slip away before you can grasp them. As a member of a group, Calder is clearly used to having help fleshing out her compositions, and <i>Are You My Mother?</i> makes it clear that, when it comes to songwriting, she could still benefit from the aid of a larger collective.</p></div>"|14510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14510-are-you-my-mother/|6.2|Rebecca Raber

For Craig and Connie Minowa, the 2002 death of two-year-old son Kaidin was enough to force a year-long separation. This bereavement also fueled the most cathartic moments of the Cloud Cult albums Craig would later record, in a geothermal-powered studio, at the couple's small, northern Minnesota organic farm. Happily, the Minowas are now celebrating a new addition to the growing Cloud Cult family-- baby boy Nova-- and their band is experiencing something of a rebirth, too.</p>
<p>Cloud Cult's eighth proper album follows the <i>No One Said It Would Be Easy</i> band-doc DVD last year and three recent reissues of this self-released collective's early-2000s output, including 2004's staggeringly expansive <i>Aurora Borealis</i>. Any fan who knows those releases won't be surprised by <i>Light Chasers</i>, which stretches Cloud Cult's hippie-Arcade-Fire sprawl into ""a concept album that interweaves stories focused on the exploration of the mysteries of the universe, life and death."" Many of you will probably stop reading at this point; the rest of you should know that <i>Light Chasers</i> improves on 2008's <i>Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes)</i> by focusing on what Cloud Cult do best, though it lacks the colorful songwriting and hooky inventiveness of the band's most endearing songs. It'll still probably be fun live.</p>
<p>Cloud Cult's usual combination of wiry guitars, earnest yawps, swaying orchestration, bustling drums, and occasional keyboards or electronics returns on<i> Light Chasers</i>, with the addition of ex-Tapes 'n Tapes-er Shawn Neary on bass. Unfortunately, all this overwroughtness-- overwroughtitude?-- has come to feel slightly rote: Note extended song titles like ""The Contact (Journey to the Light p. 5)"" (the exact track listing varies between the back of the CD case, liner notes, and CDDB online data). Still, this combination of the building blocks for epic, millennial indie rock remains fairly potent in Cloud Cult's hands, particularly on multiple-personality piano stomper ""Room Full of People in Your Head"". Unplugging it a little, ""The Baby (You Were Born)"" is a wide-eyed acoustic ballad that, like John Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" before it, can seem moving or saccharine depending on your frame of mind. With no breaks between songs, you have to wade through various interludes and self-help asides to find this stuff, but that's part of the fun of a Cloud Cult record. These guys have always been a little different.</p>
<p>In fact, like jam bands or certain dance music, Cloud Cult's music is ultimately almost <i>ceremonial</i> in nature. Note subtitles like ""The Invocation p. 1 (You'll Be Bright)"" or ""The Lessons (Exploding People)"", for crissakes, or the Rapture-ous (and not even the band!) cover art. So if the howls and panting that open advance mp3 ""Running With the Wolves"" strike you as a little too on the nose, the judgment-day prophecy of ""The Acceptance (Responsible)"" as too preachy, or the (unfortunately) robot-voiced aphorisms of ""The Surrender (Guessing Game)"" as too, um, robotically aphoristic, then try to imagine the fervor of the live experience. There, the swirl of ecstatic sound-- and the presence of two live painters-- can be powerful, a sort of live secular devotional music that is ambitiously off in its own world. Anybody who releases an Earth Day EP or pays extra to have their CD packaging made out of recycled material probably isn't in it only for the money, but they're not exactly pure aesthetes, either. Give them your 10 bucks, you won't feel bad about it, just buy their back catalog first.</p></div>"|14454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14454-light-chasers/|5.4|Marc Hogan

After releasing their debut in 2008, the Athens group did a stint opening for Dinosaur Jr. and the Meat Puppets, an apprenticeship that, for better or for worse, is evident on their sophomore album, <i>Sugar. </i>The guitars sound both sharper and muddier, the rhythm section condensed into a thunderous union, the vocals of Hardy Morris and Brantley Senn more prominent. In general, they sound more purposeful than ever, thanks to producer John Agnello, who has worked with Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth, and the Hold Steady.</p>
<p>With Agnello at the helm, Dead Confederate come across as more capable, more professional-- in other words, not very exciting. Their music sounds calculated, at times lifeless. Senn is more of a presence here, trading vocal and songwriting duties with Morris, and the push and pull between them creates intriguing transitions and expands their range. Opener ""In the Dark"" recalls fellow Athenians the Whigs in its relatively upbeat cadence, and its swirling organ leads seamlessly into ""Run From the Gun"", which contains the album's strongest hook and Morris' best vocal performance. His strangely textured, androgynous voice is one of the band's most distinctive sounds, especially now that he's not straining for maximum angst. He shows some restraint on ""Father Figure"", an otherwise aimless track that channels <i>Gish</i>-era Smashing Pumpkins, and attempts some high-flying acrobatics on ""By Design"", soaring into his falsetto on the chorus.</p>
<p><i>Sugar</i> is notable as much for what's missing as for what's been honed and emphasized. Morris no longer howls like Kurt Cobain, nor does he drawl so studiously. There are no 12- or seven-minute stoner epics either; instead, the songs are shorter, more compact, punchier. Almost missing: personality. Part of the appeal of the band's self-released EP and, to a lesser extent, its debut was their ragged energy, the naïve excitement of young southerners messing around with non-native music, even if they were reaching beyond their grasp. Where once they got by on enthusiasm and sheer force of will, <i>Sugar</i> just sounds professional and deliberate. The songs no longer sound like Georgia, nor anywhere at all, and robbed of those roots and context, their music has no grounding, no subversive charm. <i>Sugar</i> is neither exciting nor egregious, neither good nor bad. It's just another rock record.</p></div>"|14526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14526-sugar/|4.9|Stephen M. Deusner

In this sense, light is actually a sort of gatekeeper, hiding some parts of the world as it reveals others. Mike Connelly's music has a similar effect, which is why Failing Lights is the perfect name for his solo project. His sounds live in shadows, intermittently illuminated by flickering volume, then swept back into the dim recesses of his eerie atmospheres. In the process, Connelly is also a kind of gatekeeper, doling out glimpses of an elusive sonic whole.</p>
<p>It's a method Connelly has honed in his two main groups, Wolf Eyes and Hair Police. Both are known for brutal noise, yet are also adept at using restraint to create tension. With <i>Failing Lights</i>, Connelly is more focused on the latter. Parts of <i>Failing Lights</i> (his first widely-available release after numerous low-run tapes and CD-R's) sound like the negative image of his bands, with noise flipped into quiet and echoes reversed into jolts. Bells chime and decay; rumbles evoke underwater transmissions; electronic slashes crackle like bugs hitting zappers. There are some stretches of dense cacophony, but even those feel shrouded and blurry.</p>
<p>Yet Connelly isn't hiding his creative intentions-- in fact, they're right there in his song titles. He opens with ""Moon on the First Hunt"", spinning out slow strands of sonic debris-- the kind you could imagine hearing in your helmet as you walk from a spaceship onto the lunar surface. He raises a sonic curtain on ""Revealing Scene"", as cavernous sounds gradually approach the camera until they fill the screen with static. And the sparsest track-- where restraint finally wrestles Connelly's sounds into submission-- is called simply ""Serve in Silence"".</p>
<p>If Connelly does mean these titles as descriptions, then his most interesting choice is calling the closer ""The Comfort Zone"". At over 18 minutes, it's by far the longest cut, and the most striking. It opens with big waves of growling feedback, slides into heavy bass tones, then spends 11 minutes on a big, bold drone. It's probably not what most people would call comforting, but it's definitely a zone. Maybe Connelly means that anything can be comfortable once you fully enter it-- he told <i>The Wire</i> recently that his work is ""like this abstract world that I can take a walk in."" The evocative aural environments of <i>Failing Lights</i> suggest that he acccomplished this goal.</p></div>"|14544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14544-failing-lights/|7.2|Marc Masters

In press photos, they brandish automatic weapons, some of which are triumphantly splayed on the table that stretches across the gatefold package of their second album, <i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i>. Buford and King cite Jim Jones, Shoko Asahara, and Charles Manson as influences, and, in 2005, they turned Body Count's ""Copkiller"" and M.D.C.'s ""Dead Cops"" into sludgy voids on a 7"" single. They've appeared on stage wearing potato sacks and nooses, and the cover of <i>All the Waters</i> showcases the pair dressed like ancient hooded Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>This is probably where you roll your eyes and check out, figuring that these would-be metal/ hardcore/ noise/ whatever tough guys will never sound as bothered on tape as they might appear on paper. Well, you're wrong: Like the best of Eyehategod or Bastard Noise, <i>All the Waters</i> is the rare album that feels truly dangerous. As it crushes and collides doom metal, harsh noise, industrial rock, and gospel singing into one mean mess, it seems to obey no rules but its own. The result is a singular, explosive masterpiece and one of the year's essential heavy exploits-- even if, at turns, it sends you cowering.</p>
<p><i>All the Waters</i> is an album of detours and surprises. You'll see the Body mostly referred to as a doom metal duo, but don't hang too many notions on that reductive nail. Rather, <i>All the Waters</i> is played by 32 people, including the 13-member Assembly of Light Choir and a score of folks who earn credit not only for keyboards, drums, and viola for but also for noise, sousaphone, and drum programming. Two of these seven tracks begin with slow, controlled, Earth-like riffs-- that is, quintessential, doom metal. Both evolve quickly. ""Even Saints Knew Their Hour of Failure and Loss"" corrodes its repetitive riff with a piercing din; the choir's gorgeous chant tugs upward against the low-hanging load. Everything disappears except for Buford's drums, a circle of snares and cymbals wrapping the distant chime of a church bell. King's lacerating squeal cuts in, quoting Yeats: ""And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches toward Bethlehem, waiting to be born?"" It's music that has more to do with Current 93 than Earth, more with provocation than perfection.</p>
<p>Indeed, after a few dozen listens, the Body's risks and adventures still shock me. Almost uniformly, they deliver songs into chaos. The album begins, after all, with four minutes of beautiful choral singing. The Assembly of Light Choir offers a wordless hymn, harmonies rising and falling, melodies wrapping around one another like the cotton strands of some imagined heaven. Eventually, a voice slips from the flock, her line dropping into a mournful gospel quaver. The rest of the choir follows, their voices dragging and slinking, as if covered with the shadow of an unnamed malice on the horizon. When that beast arrives-- noise swells, shattering drums, monolithic slabs of guitar-- it's the sound of something beautiful being obliterated. Similarly, ""A Curse"" starts as a ruptured dance number that, a few minutes later, is an arrhythmic, atonal wasteland. ""Empty Hearth"" begins with a sample of a church group (taken from the strange <i>Sounds of American Doomsday Cults</i> album) offering a prayer; by track's end, their recitation has been chopped and screwed until it sounds like strangles and gasps.</p>
<p>On paper, <i>All the Waters</i> is a grim record, as lyrics outline the failure of science, nature, man, gods, and prophets in pithy bursts. But unless you're reading along, you'll never know any of this. King's strained, unintelligible voice seems constantly at the brink of being swallowed by the sounds around him. Those sounds are troubling enough, recorded and mixed so that the guitars and drums always feel like they're too loud for the equipment and room meant to contain them. The record itself is a smartly designed simulacrum for the lyrics, recreating the sense of impending darkness by creating a sound that swallows itself. The young indie rock bands now using cheap microphones and analog hiss to shape their songs are often criticized for obscuring shabby songs with shabby sounds. The best of those bands, however, use production to reinforce their ideas and give them an extra bit of depth. The Body does just that here, letting rough-and-tumble production add even more anxiety and trouble to seven songs that were bothered as is. Smart choice: <i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i> is the seldom collapse-of-the-world record that's actually as disturbing as it wants to be.</p></div>"|14512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/|8.5|Grayson Currin

Two of its members served in Failure and Ednaswap-- respectively, some dudes who had a cup of coffee in the Buzz Bin with ""Stuck on You"" after the post-<i>Nevermind </i>boom and the band who wrote and first recorded Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"". Drummer Carla Azar had what was feared to be a career-ending elbow injury in 2002 but a risky surgery and eight screws allowed her to get back on the skins. And despite having vocal cheerleaders ranging from Trent Reznor to Thom Yorke to T-Bone Burnett to the Coen Brothers, their sophomore bow <i>Transit Transit </i>follows up an album that came out six years ago. For some perspective, when <i>Future Perfect </i>was released in 2004, Silversun Pickups was best known in L.A. as a liquor store.</p>
<p>Problem is, they ask the same patience of the listener on <i>Transit Transit</i>, without being really explicit about where the payoff lies. They occasionally dip into a bag of digital trickery-- in particular, the title track is a gripping introduction of unpredictable drum machine rattle with longing trumpet and vocal sighs akin to Radiohead's ""Videotape"".  For the most part, though, Autolux hone in on the same iterations of shoegaze as the Pickups. Yet despite the MBV worship, they also haven't forgotten about Swervedriver or Ride. Guitarist Greg Edwards forgoes fuzz tones almost completely, preferring gnarled, forceful chords that, combined with Azar's metallic clatter, can give Autolux some brawn.  And yet, they're too hesitant to step on the gas and <i>Transit Transit </i>maintains a puzzling lack of urgency for an album so long in the works.</p>
<p>You can get an occasional jolt from the steel-girder riffs of ""Census"" or ""Audience No. 2"", yet the tempo never gets past a slow boil.  Hushed electro ballads like ""Highchair"" and ""The Bouncing Wall"" could conceivably work on a subliminal level, or they can just as easily be tuned out. The sparse self-production does them no favors either, stripped down and dry as a bone but lacking the warmth and intimacy of a live performance.</p>
<p>It's a shame because you hate to use the term ""professional"" to describe a record's best asset. In a festival setting, I imagine Autolux's technical proficiency is vice tight and visceral, odd because a record like <i>Transit Transit </i>that (intentionally?) lacks strong hooks is usually considered one that benefits from close listens. But ultimately, it all comes back to the idea of patience in the face of a lack of memorable songs-- at some point, you have to demand to be heard and <i>Transit Transit </i>is the sound of three skilled musicians being all too careful not to step on each other's toes.</p></div>"|14540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14540-transit-transit/|5.4|Ian Cohen

Maybe you drop a free mixtape or two (like his <i>Freeizm</i> releases) that stick to the formula that made you a dubstep champion, with the side effect that if the Big Album flops the longtime diehards will still have something to retreat to. Maybe you look back to a previous breakthrough-- something like 2005's definitive ""Midnight Request Line""-- and extrapolate just how far out an idea like that should sound five years later. And maybe you take a shot at building off the momentum of your last and possibly biggest pop turn, the slow-burn magnificence of last year's remix of La Roux's ""In for the Kill"", and try to figure out how much of that there is to spread across an hour's worth of new music.</p>
<p>What you don't do is crank everything up to desperate look-at-me extremes, and remembering that is what makes <i>Outside the Box</i> smarter than your typical underground-goes-pop set. From the outset, Skream's best music worked in a modular, easily graspable way that helped it click with both neophytes and early adopters. And he did it by creating unlikely hybrids of mood: late-night gloom and enthusiastic cheer, sweat-soaked dread and childlike giddiness, snarling aggression and light fragility. By balancing these tones, Skream could stretch in two different emotional directions without going overboard, and he continues that trend admirably on this album.</p>
<p>The more pop-friendly moments nail this split-personality approach, where tracks like ""Where You Should Be"" and ""How Real"" simultaneously bring heavy, frame-rattling basslines for the steppers and wistful pop-R&amp;B vocals for the lover's-rock crowd. The former track filters vocalist Sam Frank through a phalanx of overdubs, Auto-Tuning, and reverb, while the latter chops Freckles' voice up into a hiccupy, almost Todd Edwards-style Macintalk splice job. But the singers are manipulated into digital unreality in stirring ways that bristle with the same energy as rest of the production. And when La Roux reprises her famous remix team-up on ""Finally"", the thin shakiness of her voice is integrated into the beat in a way that makes it sound like an advantage, creating an atmosphere of delicate strength as it's engulfed by the rest of the melody.</p>
<p>A jaded eye might look at all the ""feat."" parentheticals and cringe a bit; in the case of ""8 Bit Baby"", a plinky showcase for Murs' corniest tendencies, they'd be right to. But there's still smart production beneath all the guest vocals. Skream knows what pleases crowds, which accounts for some tracks' idea of heaviness being a wobble bass that sounds like the turbines of an obese helicopter (""Wibbler"") or a hissing, spitting Atari gone rogue (""CPU""). But he also goes for carefully layered component building instead of just constantly cranking up one prominent element of his sound. That's how he gets the same expressive resonance out of instrumental tracks like ""Fields of Emotion"" and ""Perferated"" as he does out of the vocal showcases, leaning on subtle but evocative melodic keyboard progressions and basslines so sturdy you could bounce to them without drums.</p>
<p>And if you had any other doubts as to what kind of pop move this is, keep in mind that Skream's efforts to please all sorts of crowds also skews toward the ones who remember and/or revere the sounds of the early-to-mid 1990s. ""I Love the Way"" features prominent rave-diva vocals via a Jocelyn Brown sample, floating over a shuddering dubstep throb that waits until the last 90 seconds to shatter into breakbeat. ""Metamorphosis"" strips the droning ambience of prime Photek and Dillinja for parts, tearing out the frenetic drums and refitting it with a restrained pulse punctuated by the occasional massive snare hit. And the drums from the infamous jungle-birthing ""Amen"" break actually show up twice, underpinning the trilling dial tone melodies of ""Listenin' to the Records on My Wall"" and rattling through the euphoric drum'n'bass revivalism of ""The Epic Last Song"". Of all the contradictions Skream has somehow managed to reconcile, a crossover bid that doubles as a back-to-the-roots move might be the most audacious.</p></div>"|14519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14519-outside-the-box/|7.9|Nate Patrin

Cohen's main band, the Fresh &amp; Onlys, has been on a tear for the last two years-- releasing two full-length records, an EP, a limited edition cassette, and countless 7"" singles worth of fuzz-laden psych-rock earworms. He still found time to go solo, too.</p>
<p><i>Laugh Tracks</i>, Cohen's second solo LP, is a mellow, summer record-- full of acoustic guitars, woozy brass, and faded vocal harmonies. It opens, rather appropriately, with the sound of ice cubes clinking in a glass. But other than the laid back vibe it's business as usual. The songs are simple and stripped down-- crafted fast and perfected later on, if perfected at all. Cohen's lyrics are sometimes simple stream-of-consciousness nursery rhymes, likely rattled off at the moment of inspiration. ""Mother day/ Father night/ Just come together over me/ So that you would seem to be the same/ You should marry/ Be together forever,"" he sings on the opening track, ""Oh Oh Oh"".</p>
<p>As the title implies, there are a few chuckles. Cohen has a good sense of how to make use of humor in music without descending into straight-up wackiness. The slow and swaggering ""That's My Baby"" somehow straddles the line between clumsy midnight Stones put-on and an earnest love song. It's goofy, but weirdly moving. Album closer ""Small Things Matter""-- with its warbled vocals and earnestly inspirational message-- is a little more obviously a joke. ""How do you say to a child with clear eyes that lakes are no longer for swimming?/ How do you teach a tender young mind that TV is often misleading?"" sings guest vocalist Robert Cohen, only barely in key and a mile off of the beat.</p>
<p>It's the ability to drift between parody and poignancy that gives Cohen a small edge on his peers-- bands like Blank Dogs, Thee Oh Sees, and King Khan. Sometimes, for a moment, the rock-dude mask comes off. ""I Lifted My Arms"", a dream-logic truck-stop jam, has him at his best. ""I lifted my arms up to heaven and God then took me by the hand/ He tore my arms right off my body/ And placed upon me two golden wings/ Somebody teach me how to fly/ No one wants to know more than I,"" Cohen sings. It's a weird tune-- haunting but tender. It's nice to know that he can crank these out on the regular.</p></div>"|14536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14536-laugh-tracks/|7.3|Aaron Leitko

The album, clocking in well over an hour, was fitfully satisfying but felt unfocused and exhausting over the course of an LP. Their latest, <i>Full House Head</i>, spreads eight chugging fretboard excursions over an equally copious 76 minutes, roving past everything from the Marshall Tucker Band to the Meat Puppets along the way. The boogie's still not bad; it's that other thing they've gotta knock off.</p>
<p>After a brief intro lick, ""Empty Eye"" starts chooglin' and, for the better part of 10 minutes, doesn't stop. Guitarists Paul Major and Jesper Eklow duke it out on the fretboards, with Major getting in a few gutturals just to keep things interesting. Trouble is, they lock right down into it and never let up, rarely varying tempo or toying with dynamics, locking in the bass and drums and weaving solos in, out and around until even they can't take it anymore. Then ""Tarmac City"" starts, and we're at it again. Tracks are loosely arranged into songs but they mostly feel like just excuses for Major and Eklow to go off. Which they do. Repeatedly. Endlessly.<br/><br/>And it works; for a while, anyway. Their playing's loose and economical, and the period-appropriate, bombed-in-the-backseat vibe admirably regressive. Major's singing seems to suit these songs a bit better than it did on the sometimes goofy Focus Level, although he's still a little light on hooks. The proceedings seem livelier overall, if even more protracted. The Southern smoke, San Fran psych and hard rock snarl that makes up these tracks doesn't feel overly reverent in their hands, just a little Bar Band 101. And, as with <i>Focus Level</i>, repeat spins don't do <i>Full House Head</i> many favors; Eklow and Major are fine guitarists, rugged and never gar

ish, but a little more flash might do them some good, as many of these tracks feel samey even after you've spent 10 minutes with them.</p>
<p>After a while these rangy solos seem to content to just traipse along side by side, occasionally veering into each other messily, never reaching for any kind of precipice. Which means pretty much every song that passes the five-minute mark-- which is pretty much every song-- outstays its welcome. Leaner, fierier takes on these same wayfaring tunes would've surely resulted in a punchier, more replayable set. But the patchy, drawn-out <i>Full House Head</i> once again finds the band with way more boogie than they know what to do with.</p></div>"|14545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14545-full-house-head/|4.6|Paul Thompson

Sure, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs/Scarlett Johansson producer is pulling all the strings (as he seems to do on many albums he produces), but the debut from this project is less a chance for him to take centerstage as it is an opportunity to color outside the lines required by his day jobs. So, despite Sitek showing off his pipes on a cover of the Troggs' ""With a Girl Like You"" on last year's <i>Dark Was the Night</i></span><span style=""font-family: ""> compilation, his own deep, dusky vocals are largely absent from these Maximum Balloon songs. Instead, he has called up old friends (like his TVOTR bandmates Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe) and new (singer Holly Miranda) to jam on tracks that are meant for the dancefloor, but will, most likely, never have to be played live. The songs are, therefore, liberated from the shackles of needing to be recreated in real time, so Sitek can spackle on as many layers of noisy synthesizers as he likes, and he can gather an enviable group of singers to act as his mouthpiece, regardless of the fact that, logistically, they could never all be corralled for one big tour. The result is a dense, sultry collection that revels in the dissonance between its thick, synthesized arrangements and its emotive, earthy vocal performances.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: "">Despite being the work of a star producer, the rotating vocalists make the album feel relaxed and loose, with each guest shading the record in subtle new ways. Soulful Brooklyn rapper Theophilus London brings sex appeal to his neon-disco opener. Swedish synth-poppers Little Dragon bring flirty fun, as Yukimi Nagano's coquettish coos and her bandmates' effervescent videogame synth figures sand over the hard edges of ""If You Return"".

It was the absolute mellowness of Jorge's voice that stood out: a thick, baritone murmur, robust and sleepy at the same time. His non-Brazilian audience is still most familiar with that record, despite the subsequent release of a fine album of originals, <i>América Brasil O Disco</i>, and earlier releases like <i>Carolina</i><i> </i>(aka <i>Samba Esporte Fino</i>) and <i>Cru</i>, which gave him a samba-funk backdrop to let the dynamics of that voice get a bit livelier.</p>
<p><i>Seu Jorge &amp; Almaz </i>arose out of a different filmic scenario: It started as a one-off collaboration for a soundtrack, and Jorge figured the band was worth sticking with for an entire album's worth of cover songs. It has a radically different dynamic than the Bowie record, with a heavier backing band-- film score composer Antonio Pinto on bass; Nação Zumbi's Lucio Maia and Pupillo on guitar and drums respectively-- that operates with dubby reverb and burbly, sleepwalking funk rhythms derived from the <i>mangue beat </i>movement. But its emphasis on slow tempos and subtle percussion gives it a woozier, gloomier atmosphere than his pre-<i>Zissou </i>work.</p>
<p>This ethereal mood cuts both ways. When it works, it's appealingly laid-back, and covers of Brazilian classics-- Noriel Vilela's ""Saudosa Bahia"" and Jorge Ben's ""Errare Humanum Est""-- are captured with a warm affection. Maia's guitar tone is the most prominent sound on the album after Jorge's voice, and its delicate but resonant timbre sounds particularly rich bouncing off the vocals; the lead on their version of Baden Powell's ""Tempo de Amor"" has an especially liquid sway. But this style seems weirdly lackluster when they head
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
north of the equator. It's an odd, malfunctioning gimmick to hear Jorge's usually nuanced voice try to take on the deadpan lead of Kraftwerk's ""The Model"", and he sounds especially distracted and lethargic on sluggish versions of Roy Ayers' ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"" and Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"". On the latter, he doesn't even bother to sing the entire chorus, omitting the crucial phrasing of ""sunlight"" and dancing the listener into nowhere.</p>
<p>After some of the album's more leisurely moments, it's a welcome jolt when Jorge and Almaz actually bring some energy to the table. The one English-language cover that works, a fiery runthrough of ""Girl You Move Me"" by L.A. funk obscurities Cane &amp; Able, lets Jorge rise above a heavy-headed murmur into a smooth, often passionate classic-soul lead. And in a couple of the MPB covers-- namely Tim Maia's ""Cristina"" and Tribo Massáhi's ""Pai Joao""-- things really come alive, Isley-esque guitars and bottom-heavy backbeats pairing up with performances where Jorge flat-out <i>belts</i>. This is the Seu Jorge that's a joy to listen to, a singer whose voice can swoop as well as it floats. People can focus all they want on the one-dimensional novelty of a well-known pop hit drowsily rendered into molasses, but stopping where the unfamiliarity begins means you miss what Jorge really has to offer.</p></div>"|14514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14514-seu-jorge-almaz/|7.0|Nate Patrin

Whether intentionally or unwittingly, though, Darker My Love are taking plenty of cues from them. Just as BRMC put out a decent debut (2001's <i>B.R.M.C.</i>) and a samey, not-so-decent follow-up (2003's <i>Take Them On, On Your Own</i>), Darker My Love's 2006 self-titled debut was a just-okay neo-shoegaze affair, while 2008's holy-shit-is-that-really-the-title <i>2</i> was a tepid sophomore effort that felt monochrome and dulled-over.</p>
<p>If the timeline holds true, Darker My Love's third album would be a stripped-down reinvention á la BRMC's own game-changer, 2005's <i>Howl</i>. Lo and behold, <i>Alive As You Are</i>, ditches the delay pedals, obscured vocals, and squalls of noise for acoustic guitars, sweetly sung harmonies, and open-road clarity. Just as their previous two efforts pilfered repeatedly from long-in-the-tooth veteran bands the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols, <i>Alive As You Are</i> mines the 1960's folk-rock canon with a near-dopey lack of shame. If the Dylan-esque vocal aping on opening track ""Backseat"" doesn't make you blush for these guys' sake, try the following cut, ""Split Minute"", which is basically the Byrds' ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" sans any trace of the original's euphoric payoff.</p>
<p>After a supreme early demonstration of pastiche, <i>Alive As You Are</i>'s back half reveals a capable pop band writing capable pop songs. Ignore the slow-drawled intro of ""Trail The Line"" and you'll find the best Lemonheads jangler that band never wrote within. ""Dear Author""'s psych-out breakdowns are satisfying in a would-be Top 40 way, while ""A Lovely Game"" benefits from the record's clear-headed sound via its swooning vocal interplay.</p>
<p>Co-singers Tim Presley and Rob Barbato are capable vocalists, and the album's best moments, like the shifting ballad ""June Bloom"" and the spring breeze arrangements of ""New America"", rely on wordless expressions and nimble harmonizing to get the job done. They're far from good lyricists, though. ""Split Minute"" hammers home false truisms (""You are not you""-- dude, that's deep) while the mind is boggled when ""New America"" moves its lyrical concerns from shipbuilding(!) to, uh, this: ""Spilt milk levee breaks on you"". On second thought, maybe all that guitar noise was there before for a reason.</p></div>"|14521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14521-alive-as-you-are/|5.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

He's got a track called ""Shine on You Crazy White Cap"" and another called ""Gone for the Summer"". There's a band Tumblr with a picture of a lake as its background. They are called Teen Daze. But unlike a lot of these bedroom blurmongers, Teen Daze seems in total control; his synths bleed into more brilliant colors, his languid pace more purposeful, his memory bank FDIC-insured, his vagueness earned by the quality of his output.</p>
<p>Daze's debut EP, <i>Four More Years</i>, whirls right into its title track, its big spluttery drums and many moving parts not far from Ernest Greene's work as Washed Out-- until a giant synth, part ELP, part Black Moth Super Rainbow, splits the song open down the middle. It feels brash, towering over the relatively lax backing track, but with so much so-called chillwave finds a gentle groove and sticks with it, but throughout <i>Four More Years</i>, Teen Daze find ways to slip these daringly germane little asides into the tunes, rescuing them from complacency. In the twinkly ""Gone For the Summer"", it's an electric piano line underpinning the tracks' inherent wooziness; in ""Around"", it's an unusually kinetic bit of synth programming that Delorean oughta consider stealing; in ""Saviour"", it's a somewhat ill-fitting vocal sample that repeats throughout the track, creating its own odd logic. <i>Four More Years</i> gleans its color from these bold choices, and Daze's tone palette appears about as rich as anybody's working in the genre.</p>
<p>For as much slack memoryfuzz as he conjures, Teen Daze has an eye on the dancefloor, and quite a few of these tracks sound a bit like Erasure numbers left to melt in the sun. Teen Daze 's dance tracks are solid enough, if a bit interchangeable on their own; his tempos tend to knock similarly, with only the terse ""Around"" approaching something a sober person might move to. Still, this kinetic backbone proves a fine backdrop for Teen Daze 's immersive sonic explorations, and his dance tracks are every bit as intricately layered and inventively odd as the stuff at more patient tempos. Vocally, there's not a ton to grab hold of-- Teen Daze sings like the Tough Alliance guys but tends to bury his voice under a pile of synths. His hooks tend to be instrumental, not vocal. And there's a certain sameyness to the tempos here that wears a bit even in the record's half-hour runtime. But this is chillwave, and Teen Daze's version of same holds up to more scrutiny than most. In piling on the layers, sidestepping the narcotic lethargy that  and making sure to keep things in motion, Teen Daze is making last summer seem like more than just a memory.</p></div>"|14531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14531-four-more-years-ep/|7.1|Paul Thompson

To ""zorb"" is to go rolling through open fields harnessed inside of a huge, transparent plastic ball. Zorbing was dreamed up by two New Zealand capitalists in 1994 and received extreme-sport classification in 1998.  The Zorbing Appreciation Society Facebook group currently boasts 195 members. As far as love metaphors go, this is one of the least universal comparisons imaginable.</p>
<p>Stornoway have a weakness for this type of cleverness, which probably can be partly explained by their background. The members bonded during their freshman year at Oxford University over a mutual love of Teenage Fanclub, and two of them-- singer/guitarist Brian Briggs and fellow guitarist/keyboard player Jon Ouin-- boast PhDs (in ornithology and Russian translation, respectively). The songs on <i>Beachcomber's Windowsill</i> are delicately arranged and mostly acoustic, and their pastoral lilt is unmistakable. The four core members sing in a bracingly pure round-robin style that suggests formative years spent in youth choirs and glee clubs. In other words, Stornoway are exquisitely, even painfully, British. Even when they are South African, as is the case with the brothers Rob and Ollie Steadman, who provide drums and bass.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Briggs proves a sharp study of the best of his acutely British forebears. ""Fuel Up"", a lovely meditation on the passage of time viewed through the lens of a series of road trips, is like Briggs' doctoral thesis on Ray Davies Melancholy. ""Zorbing"" and ""I Saw You Blink"" breeze by with the insouciance of <i>Boy With the Arab Strap</i>-era Belle and Sebastian. Briggs' schoolboy tenor is reedy but powerful, and his lyrics are sweet about simple pleasures-- first girlfriends, drinking in a pub with high school friends, late-night phone calls to loved ones.</p>
<p>Musically, they are a remarkably deft bunch, folding in a conservatory's worth of instruments-- barrelhouse piano, jazzy horncharts, banjo plonking, chamber strings and Celtic fiddles, spidery celesta-- into their fleet, coursing songs without bogging down the melodic line or sounding burdened by fussiness. Ollie Steadman plays his bass like a melody instrument, and Ouin's organ lines dance in and out of the periphery like a particularly animated supporting character you keep wishing would return. Rob Steadman's careful, sensitive drumming on ""On the Rocks"" helps anchor an otherwise formless tune from drifting into oblivion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their acute Britishness cuts both ways, and <i>Beachcomber's Windowsill</i> grows wearying in prolonged doses. Their weightlessness is refreshing in three-minute bursts, but feels thin after forty. Briggs' love of clever rhetorical devices also grates over the course of the album; he spends nearly every song establishing a lyrical conceit in the opening lines and then enthusiastically unpacking it, until each song resembles an earnestly labored little creative-writing exercise. It would help if Briggs' emotions were as sophisticated as his vocabulary, but he mostly has a schoolboy's view of things: ""We've got to learn to love our neighbors before our neighbors scare the love out of us,"" he admonishes on ""Here Comes the Blackout..!"" Maybe a few years of touring will put some dirt and shadows on Briggs' frame; it would probably deepen his songs. But on <i>Beachcomber's Windowsill</i>, the boys in Stornoway come off as more clever than smart.</p></div>"|14528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14528-beachcombers-windowsill/|6.8|Jayson Greene

For Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri, and the rotating cast of Queens of the Stone Age, it was short, catchy, debauched: ""Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol."" And for good measure: ""C-c-c-c-c-cocaine."" Over and over again. Sixteen times. For the first song on their second album it was a rallying cry, the perfect chorus, a clever verse, and a sort of philosophical exposition. But it was also a misnomer.</p>
<p><i>Rated R</i> was tagged as stoner rock almost immediately upon release in 2000, in part because of those seven substances, but mostly because the band rose from the ashes of early-1990s Palm Desert sun gods Kyuss. Homme, a plangent, riff-obsessed guitarist, and Oliveri, a manic golem of a man and a mighty bass player, formed the backbone of that band with a mechanized sense of bang-and-smash structure. Studied repetition and precision are unlikely virtues for weedheads, but then these are unlikely musicians. When Homme formed the Queens after Kyuss disbanded, he carried that sense of exacting musculature with him but also brought a surprisingly seductive croon-- able to burrow low and also swing high into falsetto. After a modest, chugging self-titled debut, his frantic pal Oliveri joined the band.</p>
<p>What they forged was familiar but also wildly different from that stoner rock-- a term Homme has always rejected. In turn, they made one of the last great modern hard rock records and something deceptively tuneful, groove-bitten, and even melancholic. As soon as the mantra is laid bare, QOTSA begin to dance away, with things like ""The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret"", which amounts to a really great Blue Öyster Cult song, and the funk stroll of ""Leg of Lamb"". Suddenly a pattern, from mellow grace notes to head-smash riffs, sometimes colliding into each other, begins to set in.</p>
<p>Homme has never been much of a lyricist, preferring to weave in fragments of thought and word puzzles. <i>Rated R</i> is rarely about things, more often about feelings-- a chest-beating energy, a confusing head trip, or a dissipating sadness. Former Screaming Trees frontman and longtime Homme buddy Mark Lanegan began his relationship with the band on ""In the Fade"", an intoxicating and solemn song that has gone a bit unnoticed as the years have passed. Lanegan eventually became a full-time member of the band, but he was never better than the first time. When the song concludes, a reprise of the mantra kicks back in, a fitful reminder to shake the melodrama and remember the cocaine.</p>
<p>Ten years later, <i>Rated R</i> sounds vital, if a bit unusual. Credible hard rock is a tough sell these days. It's been three years since Queens released their last album, <i>Era Vulgaris</i>, and six years since Homme fired his old friend Oliveri-- a notorious party monster who consumed with vigor and often performed in the nude, his bass strapped across his crotch like a phallic totem. They grew bigger, recruiting Dave Grohl to play drummer and writing more riff beasts, but they've never been as fearless. To celebrate the decade since, the band has included the perfunctory bonus disc, with seven B-sides, including a goofy cover the Kinks' ""Who'll Be the Next in Line"", an even sillier Carly Simon parody called ""You're So Vague"", and a surprisingly sly take on Romeo Void's new wave classic, ""Never Say Never"". They've also tacked on a nine-song live set from the 2000 Reading Festival that features Homme hilariously saying, ""This is a song for you,"" to the audience before four consecutive songs. Stoners.</p>
<p>But it's the unlikely things about <i>Rated R</i> that stick with you: The bongos that open ""Better Living Through Chemistry""; Lanegan's existential wail on ""In the Fade""; Rob Halford's backing vocals on ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"". The gentle, acoustic interlude ""Lightning Song"" feels like a cold splash of sea water after Oliveri's scorched-earth demon screech on ""Tension Head"". There are no down or off moments here. ""I Think I Lost My Headache"" closes things with a squealing three-minute brass outro; it's a typically unexpected move from a band making a surprising leap. <i>Rated R</i> didn't defy convention because it didn't seem to have a working text. Only a mantra.</p></div>"|14515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14515-rated-r-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Sean Fennessey

It was a quote from Conor Oberst, who at the time was just beginning to shed his skin as an emo pin-up and make indie rock inroads: ""It was hearing David Dondero's voice,"" he said ""that made me comfortable with my own."" At the time, Dondero and Oberst were making very different music, the former churning out road-worn folk blues, the latter making pop with the last bit of somewhat awkward, teenaged angst Omaha could supply him. But the similarity between their ragged vibratos was striking, and as their songbooks have both continued to thicken over the years-- one to great commercial and critical success and the other not so much-- it's become all the easier to hear what it was about Dondero's poesy that hit Oberst where it counted. He has a terrific ear and eye for simple detail, for spinning songs out of the mundane just as deftly as standards like love and loss. But <i>#Zero With A Bullet</i>, Dondero's third record on you-know-who's Team Love imprint, seems at times as though it could be his last altogether. He sounds like a guy ready to hang up his spurs.</p>
<p>That rings clearly within the first licks of opener ""Jesus From 12 to 6"", when Dondero whispers ""I've got a feeling there's no more left/ Feeling now that it's holding on like the death/ I need to get away, I don't trust a goddamned thing that I say/ I really need to get away from me."" Sonically, he's running the same classic rock lane Oberst has drifted into. But Dondero's in another world altogether. He uses the title track to self-flagellate for a while, quaking extensively about how commercial failures have left him in a bad way. ""Got lost on the road,"" he sings. ""No records got sold/ Number Zero with a bullet, think you already know it/ I sure hope I don't blow it."" But it's not sour grapes as much as a four-minute sigh. If you spend any amount of time going to shows or reading tour announcements on this site, taking a look at Dondero's schedule reads much differently. Seventeen years in and there aren't any nights off, playing what look to be dives (see also: taverns, saloons) more than rock clubs, most likely sleeping in his car after the show. Every lonesome minute of ""It's So Peaceful Here"" suggests quietly, though, that he's totally content right there. Alongside some gorgeous pedal steel, Dondero cycles through Rocky Mountain road scenes with an ease and peace that befits its title.</p>
<p>The song itself is a point for transition as well as resolution: No longer beating on himself or worrying his well might dry, the second half of the album hits a stride that comes by way of thoughtful sequencing and even better songcraft. In fact, he writes the shit out of every song that follows. ""Wherever You Go"" comes alive to the sound of wind chimes before a gust jars the mic and Dondero hits rodeos and coastlines, chaining together some truly fantastic guitar and banjo melodies as he goes, no shortage of energy to be heard. On ""Job Boss"" he paints a portrait of a dickhead in charge that could make you dread going to work, and best of all, within the ornery shuffle of ""Don't Be Eyeballin' My Po'Boy, Boy"", he gives you the lowdown on where to find a number of good Po'Boys in New Orleans. It sounds sharp and it'll leave you hungry. That's the mark of a gifted songwriter.</p></div>"|14529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14529-zero-with-a-bullet/|6.8|David Bevan

Their debut LP, <i>Gold on Gold</i>, is instantly charming, and at a time when so much middling synth-pop is floating around, that's worth a lot. It also seems to pale, at first, in comparison to a holy trinity of very pronounced influences. It's not quite as debonair as Junior Boys, not quite as soulful as Hot Chip, and not quite as epic as fellow Melburnians Cut Copy. But all that ""not quite"" somehow adds up to quite a bit. <i>Gold on Gold</i> is as satisfying a take on indie-dance as you're likely to hear until one of the aforementioned pacesetters drops a new album.</p>
<p>Clubfeet compensate for their derivativeness with strong fundamentals: sugar-sticky hooks, accomplished singing, and most importantly, sheer enthusiasm. (This is a band whose liner-note credits include not just ""guitar"" and ""synthesizer"" but also ""fervour"" and ""teen spirit."") Conceptually, <i>Gold on Gold</i> is a well-rounded package, balancing stylized adult aspirations with nostalgic teenage candor. On the cover, an airliner sails above what looks like the French Riviera, or somewhere just as tony and sublime. Inside, the jet-setting gives way to <i>Heathers </i>homages (""Teenage Suicide [Don't Do It]"") and a cover of 90s modern rock radio staples James (""Say Something""). Delicately entwined synths and vocal refrains are discreetly underpinned by live bass and guitar. As a result, their ""Say Something"" reconciles the best parts of dance-pop and alterna-rock, as all the moving parts lock in with the guitar and lift as one at the chorus.</p>
<p>Like Hot Chip, Clubfeet have two primary singers: One has a winsomely high, mobile voice and handles a lot of the leads. His vocals are a little sultry, a little disco-noir on tracks like ""Last Words"", and very sweet all the time. The other has a lower, plainer voice that's good for dim harmonies and atmospheric coloring, occasionally taking the lead on quiet storms like the deeply affecting ""Fall From Up Here"". That sliding scale of chipper and weary, anthemic and intimate, keeps the album from settling into a rote emotional register, even though it's split pretty cleanly between two song types: effervescent dance-pop and candle-lit ballads.</p>
<p>In either mode, the melodies get under your skin. The only dud is ""Six Days"", and it's not bad, just forgettable. What's missing is the crisp, feather-light dynamics that characterize most of the album. Elsewhere, you can hardly get away from penetrating hooks and smooth caroms from neat little part to neat little part. Clubfeet's two most original and infectious songs, ""Teenage Suicide"" and ""D.I.E. Yuppie Scum"", both feature maniacal rollerskating chants and heavenly prom-synths that... well, that actually sound a lot like Junior Senior and M83, respectively. So scratch the ""original"" thing. But don't let that deter you from this highly appealing surprise.</p></div>"|14497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14497-gold-on-gold/|7.7|Brian Howe

Formerly singer for the mid-1990s Michigan band Marzuki (which also included Sufjan Stevens), Stephens struck out on her own at the end of that decade, only to become disillusioned by the machinations of record distribution and promotion. She subsequently went on a lengthy hiatus, and it wasn't until last year that she finally put out her second full-length, <i>The Breadwinner</i>. It was exactly the kind of record a person makes when she's taken several years to concentrate on things like starting a family and finding stability, things that aren't usually in the offing for people who make their way as touring musicians. <i>The Breadwinner</i> was resolutely an album about hearth and home and the economic and emotional toil of family life, but it was also about the simple sustaining pleasures these things provide.</p>
<p>In that light, this reissue of Stephens' debut lends it the feel of a prequel, and that's where bravery enters into the equation. Given what a different place Shannon Stephens is in today compared to when she made her solo bow, and especially considering the deeply personal nature of her work, it would have been understandable if she'd felt these decade-old confessionals were best left on the shelf. Fortunately, Stephens has the wisdom to grasp the value of songs written in relative immaturity, because her debut is a true-to-life snapshot of a sensitive young person navigating the travails of falling in and out of love.</p>
<p>Emphasis in that last sentence on ""out."" There are a couple of moments here where Stephens seems achingly close to bliss, making pancakes for a lover on ""I Want to Be Your Friend"" or recognizing love's powers of redemption on ""Deliverance"". But even on the initially benign opener ""So Gentle Your Arms"", with its imagery of cream sodas and heads on shoulders, there's the suggestion of unhealthy temptation, leading Stephens to admit, ""I am a fruitless tree."" It mostly gets more dysfunctional from there, and if Stephens' heartache sometimes gets dulled by overused metaphors (trains, arrows), she makes up for it with frequent bouts of refreshing frankness, admitting she's ""weirded out"" (""Panic"") and ""talking aloud in the city park"" (""Months""), outing a troubled boyfriend who ""told Helen Keller jokes"" (""Catch the Morning Line"") and then outing herself for a Morrissey-approved compulsion to drive into a tree while her lover's asleep in the passenger seat (""The Way Relationships End Up"").</p>
<p>Musically the album is mostly very spare while occasionally displaying a countryish bent, particularly on the pedal steel-augmented ""Panic"" as well as on ""I Want to Be Your Friend"" and ""Catch the Morning Line"". There's also a tantalizing gospel-tinged red herring in the form of ""I'll Be Glad"", which was covered by Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy on his 2008 album, <i>Lie Down in the Light</i>. Jauntier efforts like the banjo- and accordion-blessed ""Air So Thick"" stick out probably more than they ought to, which means there's entirely too much sonically inert coffeehouse fare here. So maybe Shannon Stephens' debut is something less than revelatory, but pairing it with <i>The Breadwinner</i> still creates an interesting set of bookends to the past decade and provides an intriguing glimpse at the emotional maturation of one earnest, perceptive woman.</p></div>"|14501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14501-shannon-stephens/|6.0|Joshua Love

Willits is, in fact, a painter, as well as a multimedia artist. (His biography also attributes such titles to him as ""teacher"" and ""meditator."") Much of Willits' music is created through self-designed software, which means that he manipulates the conduit that manipulates his guitar-- he paints with his guitar. In a way, Willits is more of a grand manipulator than a musician, since what is paramount on <i>Tiger Flower Circle Sun</i> is how the guitar sounds, not so much the notes being played.</p>
<p><i>Tiger Flower Circle Sun</i> is an ode to guitar sounds. Especially heavily processed guitar sounds. On ""Light Into Branches"" alone, there are the clean fingerpicks of an acoustic guitar; the warped, rubbery windings of mid-90s John McEntire-produced post-rock; creaky stoner rock soloing; and lasery, searing mid-70s paeans to Robert Fripp. The album more or less functions in this fashion: Willits takes guitar sounds-- some familiar, some not-- and rearranges them in such a way that they become a collage (there are also occasional vocals and drums, neither of which sound as belabored as the guitar does). But since Willits constructs his own software, he cannily edits the material so that it doesn't sound disjunctive or incongruous. In that respect, the album is seamless.</p>
<p>Yet underneath the impressive imitations and impressionistic imagery is... well, that's the rub. Though the sound design of both the individual elements and the album as a whole is often superb, there isn't much more than prettiness. Maybe it's that so many of the guitar sounds here feel so familiar to anyone with some knowledge of textural guitar music (and the audience for which this album seems to be targeted in all likelihood possesses said knowledge). But mostly, it's just that <i>Tiger Flower Circle Sun</i> doesn't seem to have much of a purpose beyond being aesthetically pleasing-- and that lack of depth is not immediately noticeable, but it's a nagging concern that is exacerbated over time.</p>
<p>The title reminds me of one of my all-time favorite albums: Boredoms' <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>. That title perfectly imparts the aesthetic and purpose of what Boredoms sound like they were trying to achieve, showing how both primitive and contemporary styles of music could be united in their cosmic search for catharsis. Whereas here tigers, flowers, circles, and the sun all seem to have correlations to the sound of the album, but no deeper meaning. <i>Tiger Flower Circle Sun</i> is a pleasant mishmash of pleasant sounds, executed with noteworthy skill. The question for Willits is, knowing that he has the ability to create these sounds with such accomplishment: What else is there?</p></div>"|14503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14503-tiger-flower-circle-sun/|6.9|Tal Rosenberg

But it's tough to imagine who he's talking about, or what a Freddie Gibbs style bite would even sound like. Gibbs isn't a stylistic trailblazer; he's a synthesist. He sounds like a lab-created hybrid of every person who was making gangsta rap in about 1995. In his nimble baritone, I hear trace elements of Krayzie Bone's astoundingly fluid singsong double-time, MC Eiht's bloody-minded exuberance, Scarface's conflicted gravitas, Buckshot's hardnosed weed-talk, and about a hundred other traits from a hundred other guys. If you love these rappers, Gibbs' music works as a sort of expertly delivered, deeply felt comfort-food-- sort of like how Band of Horses works for Neil Young fans. We're probably not going to hear any new ideas from Gibbs, but we are going to hear old ideas rendered very, very well.</p>
<p>At this point, Gibbs' story is a familiar one: A major-label castoff who picked up the pieces of his career by attacking the mixtape circuit and building up a grassroots buzz that no label could manufacture. <i>The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs</i> and <i>Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik</i>, the two great mixtapes Gibbs released in 2009, were furious, urgent pieces of work-- and they came with the added bonuses of tracks from brand-name producers, unreleased gems left over from Gibbs' Interscope tenure. On the<i> Str8 Killa</i> EP-- incredibly, Gibbs' first-ever commercially available release-- Gibbs doesn't have to work with the possibility of the world forgetting about him, and he also doesn't have old Just Blaze tracks working in his favor.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Gibbs is now a creature of the Internet, and the EP reflects that. Several tracks come from the buzzed-about Alabama production duo Block Beataz, and DJ Burn One, who writes the great BLVD St. blog, co-produces another. Up-and-coming rappers like Jay Rock and Chip Tha Ripper guest, as does perpetual underdog champion Bun B. But none of these collabs have the ferocious chemistry of Gibbs' past team-ups with the Atlanta newcomer Pill, and indeed the whole EP sounds more <i>comfortable</i> than the two mixtapes that preceded it. And it makes sense. Gibbs is mostly done proving himself. Now he's free to just rap.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>Str8 Killa</i> are less confessional than some of the heaviest tracks on his mixtapes; we don't hear anything more about how he slept in a drawer as a baby, or how he's afraid to bring a kid of his own into the world. Instead, he stays on familiar ground-- his impossibly tough hometown, the struggles he's had in the music business, fake rappers. And the most revealing moments come almost as asides: ""Paper ain't never promised, so product, I pushed that/ I just pray my baby brother don't follow my footsteps.""</p>
<p>But even without the heavy emotional resonance of those mixtapes, <i>Str8 Killa</i> works as a showcase for a ridiculously solid rapper. Gibbs knows his craft inside and out. Like T.I., Gibbs is best understood as a master of cadence, of throwing his voice into all sorts of twisty, tricky rhyme patterns without ever drawing attention to his own technical strengths. Sometimes on <i>Str8 Killa</i>, the beat will switch up just slightly, and some new musical element will send Gibbs into an explosively fractured new flow. Or he'll snap in and out of frantic double-times without giving himself enough time to breathe. It's tough to talk about Gibbs' rapping without lapsing into the sort of breathless technical praise that guitar magazines use when they talk about Eddie Van Halen or something, but not too many people can rap the way Gibbs can.<i><br/></i></p></div>"|14499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14499-str8-killa-ep/|8.0|Tom Breihan

That only partially explains what Candy Claws were up against when they decided to compose their second album, <i>Hidden Lands</i>, on keyboards of which they had no prior knowledge. They're not the first act to trade in their guitars for synths, but often it's a choice of a band looking to make a reinvention of their sound. For Candy Claws, <i>Hidden Lands</i> is likely to be a lot of people's introduction to the Fort Collins, Colo., group.</p>
<p>The lyrics of <i>Hidden Lands</i> were composed by running Richard M. Ketchum's <i>The Secret Life of the Forest</i> back and forth into a translation program, and Candy Claws took notice of how the slightest changes could lead you to think differently about otherwise prosaic phrases. Those whispered words bleed into the sonic fabric of clippity-clop percussion, Theremin-like swoops, and aqueous keyboard textures, but it's almost like the music itself has undergone some transformation that makes it sound distinctly alien and out-of-time.</p>
<p>In terms of precedent, Candy Claws occupy a realm similar to Mercury Rev's <i>Deserter's Songs</i> or the back half of Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i> and <i>Feels</i>. These sounds seemed to exist in an eternal alternate reality. There's a lightfooted bossa nova going beneath the dubbed-out studio tricks during ""On the Bridge"", and each melodic turn ends up being just a step away from what you'd expect. Chords don't really progress so much as melt down and morph into interesting new shapes on ""Warm Forest Floor"" and ""Hiding"", while ""Sun Arrow"" gives Black Moth Super Rainbow's caricatured synth blurts an herbal bath.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that Candy Claws lack edge-- they just use it judiciously. <i>Hidden Lands</i> starts out with its most amorphous track (imagine if <i>Sung Tongs</i> led off with ""The Softest Voice"" instead of ""Leaf House""), nearly seven minutes of gentle prodding and exploratory chords taking a long bridge to nowhere in particular. But as it draws to its calming close, the fanfare of ""Sunbeam Show"" blares like an alarm clock, signaling a magisterial procession before evolving into a sleigh-bell led waltz on the chorus. Meanwhile, the tropical vibe of the two songs that precede it seem to have given the alternately wobbling and playful ""The Breathing Fire"" sunstroke. It's all so strange that the most shocking sound of all is a militaristic bass riff on ""Silent Time of Earth"".</p>
<p>For an album composed almost entirely on synthesizers, the textures are remarkably downy, perhaps too much so for listeners accustomed to having some sort of abrasive counterpoint. I'm not sure there's a single kick drum or hi-hat on the record. It's an immersive experience, but one that must be consumed in a specific manner. Like the Microphones' <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>, <i>Hidden Lands </i>demands to be heard on headphones. In the wild, the album drifts off as a cumulous cloud, even though close listens reveal how the vocals are almost the only thing that exists in the center space. Thanks to intricate stereo panning, the instruments sound like they're conversing with one another from across the room, dodging in and out of the mix as percussion fills in spaces in the left channel that synths leave on the right. It's no wonder that they need eight musicians to tour this thing. And it's true that it's tougher to find a way in here than it is with more explicitly escapist sounds. But if you're intent on total engagement, it's also tougher to find a way out.</p></div>"|14518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14518-hidden-lands/|7.9|Ian Cohen

While most DJs in the disco era were known for their flamboyance and attitude, Gibbons was the opposite: He was diminutive and shy, with his hair parted conservatively, and he sported a mustache that looked fake. He didn't look like a superstar of New York City's gay dance culture-- he looked like Lee Hazlewood's ugly doppelganger.</p>
<p>Likewise, Galaxy 21, the nightclub that acted as Gibbons' primary residency in the mid-1970s, was not like most other disco nightclubs-- it was more like a mini mall for libertines. It was located in two adjoining brownstones on 23rd Street, right near the Chelsea Hotel; the dance floor ran the length of both buildings, with Gibbons imparting his soulful, quirky music from a cramped booth in the back. There was also a restaurant above Gibbons' sweaty church, as well as a lounge, a cabaret in the penthouse, and an X-rated movie theater. You could eat dinner, take in a show, go dancing, get worked up to porn, and fuck-- all in one building.</p>
<p>Gibbons' DJ style was noteworthy for its innovation and skill. He would put two copies of a record on the turntables and cut back and forth between them to extend the song live. He also had unusual musical taste, spinning fragments from something like <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> soundtrack alongside songs by Jermaine Jackson. He would often highlight the weird percussive breaks in these records and spin them over and over again before dropping back into the chorus, using remarkable precision to create tension and drama in a record where it was otherwise lacking (around the same time, Kool Herc was using the same techniques uptown in the Bronx to usher in hip-hop).</p>
<p>The first half of <i>Jungle Music</i>, Strut's double-disc overview of the DJ/producer's remix work, mostly covers the period either during or directly following his tenure at Galaxy 21. Musically, the majority of disc one comprises straightforward disco music, from an early edit of Jakki's ""Sun...Sun...Sun..."" (a favorite of Larry Levan's at the Paradise Garage) to the touching, elegant ""It's a Better Than Good Time"" by Gladys Knight. But it's Gibbons' 1978 remix of Bettye LaVette's ""Doin' the Best That I Can"", which closes out the first disc, that gives the best indication of his talents and the more experimental direction he would take in the 80s. On this 11-minute exploration of space and percussion, Gibbons adds echo to LaVette's voice, swaps hand drums in place of the original's drum kit, and highlights a glockenspiel part that shrouds the song in a shiny dew. It's an early introduction of dub to disco that conceals the song's center while allowing different sections to appear and disappear seemingly at random.</p>
<p>Gibbons detested the rampant drug use and casual sex of the disco scene; by the 1980s, he had rediscovered Christianity. His sets took a turn for the pious, mixing gospel records with the disco and house songs of the day. At the same time, his remix work was becoming increasingly strange, venturing into the avant-garde. Much of this occurred as he struck up a friendship with Arthur Russell, who shared Gibbons' reticence, awkward physical appearance, and penchant for off-kilter music.</p>
<p>The second disc of this set is mostly an overview of Gibbons' screwiest remixing, opening with two magnificent unreleased Arthur Russell songs. The first is a version of ""See Through"", a squishy treatment of digital percussion and cello that's not too far from Russell's work on <i>Calling Out of Context</i> (Gibbons, in fact, collaborated with Russell on that album's ""Calling All Kids""). Following that is a wild, wobbly examination of Dinosaur L's landmark ""Go Bang"", cutting in and out of the record the way Gibbons would in one of his sets. At certain times, it strips the song to just drums and a funk guitar; elsewhere it places the focus on the shakers. There are also unusual takes on electro (Strafe's ""Set It Off"") and hip-hop (Stetsasonic's ""4 Ever My Beat"", which the group detested) before closing out with what is basically an update of the previous ""Set It Off"", showing where house's minimalism took a cue from aspects of Gibbons' remixes.</p>
<p>This set includes superb liner notes by <i>Love Saves the Day</i> author Tim Lawrence, pared down from a longer article he wrote in 2003 for the <i>Journal of Popular Music Studies</i>. As Lawrence writes, Gibbons contracted HIV in the late 1980s, eventually succumbing to his disease in 1994. While most experts remember Gibbons' innovations, he was also frowned on by some dancers for his frequent playing of gospel music during the second half of his career. But Gibbons picked up on something that other disco mainstays might have missed, a quality that you can hear in the best tracks here: Disco at its best is about a community of people brought together in love and brotherhood, dancing and singing in an attempt to attain a higher sense of being in the form of salvation.</p></div>"|14513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14513-jungle-music-mixed-with-love-essential-unreleased-remixes-1976-1986/|8.5|Tal Rosenberg

Even after the release of his debut LP, <i>Continent</i>, there are more remix credits (he's recently treated noteworthy tracks from Kingdom and Taken By Trees) to the CFCF name than original pieces, which is kind of a shame: Despite being both skillful and prolific with other people's music, Silver's own creations are usually much more interesting. So it's nice to have <i>Drifts</i>, a digital-only EP of re-workings from <i>Continent</i>, all helmed by fellow Canadians.</p>
<p>The most notable contributors are Junior Boys, who kick off the EP with a groove-magnified take on ""Big Love"". The changes are few and purely cosmetic: Though very little of the duo's personality comes through here (save for that deep, hooky bassline), their sparse, movement-minded approach hits some funk-swollen sweet spots that go largely overlooked on the remainder of the EP. It easily trumps Mathemagic's take on the same track, which, to its credit, makes the hazier approach look almost equally sensible. The only problem is that, on a record that clearly favors space over movement, the Junior Boys' effort not only sticks out but feels defiantly boisterous amidst the more pointedly patient exercises.</p>
<p>The only other real contender in this respect comes from the rising house duo Azari &amp; III, whose excellent ""Reckless (With Your Love)"" has recently turned heads. And despite the fact that German producer Tensnake's remix of ""Reckless"" might be lapping up all the attention these days, the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
pair show that they too know how this remix thing should be done. Simple, clean, and boasting a high replay value, Azari &amp; III locate the sensuality in ""Come Closer"". The original version of ""Come Closer"" went against that grain-- most of the track's sleekness was obscured by a clunky chop-and-paste rhythm. Here, Azari &amp; III wring every last drop of sweat from the original;it's a welcome burst of hedonism on an EP that mostly favors headier pursuits.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the majority of <i>Drifts</i> is notably club-unfriendly, with most of the focus being applied to atmosphere. Nu-gazers Memoryhouse's ""Letters Home"" is reliably blissful, a pastel-bathed new-age concoction that recalls ""In Your Eyes""-era Peter Gabriel. Unfortunately the remaining remixes sort of fog together, as the careful pacing and attention to detail begin to feel directionless and a little boring, especially when propped up against the fun, big stuff.<i> Drifts</i> could've used a little more of that-- or, you know, a new CFCF jam.</p></div>"|14492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14492-drifts/|6.8|Zach Kelly

I know more about Architecture in Helsinki than architecture in Helsinki, and the most modern Finnish book I've read is the <i>Kalevala</i>. So it was exciting to discover Regina's excellent U.S. debut,<i> </i><i>Puutarhatrilogia</i><i>,</i> a high-concept suite about the gardens of the human psyche that sounds to un-Finnish ears like a batch of really swell love songs, charted ambitiously for guitars, miscellaneous synths, piano, percussion, and smooth yet sultry vocals.</p>
<p>Regina's dance-pop is larded with musical traditions from many different times and nations. On occasion the band might evoke Sally Shapiro, Stereolab, or Lykke Li, but it seems mostly circumstantial: They keep the song square in their sights as they shift freely from mode to mode. Their sound is cosmopolitan, multifarious, and given to sly pastiche-- in other words, thoroughly global. It benefits from expert and erudite playing without making a big deal about it. Singer Iisa Pykäri's Finnish-language vocals are all light and mist, but never drift aimlessly. She pushes syllables deep into the nooks and crannies of the thumping grooves.</p>
<p>Her voice is as adaptable as the band backing her up, which makes dime-tight turns through music history. The blurting synthesizers and breezy harmonies of ""Vapaus"" convey the droll impression of French yé-yé; ""Tango Merellä"" is a dreamily unwinding take on tango; ""Sinun Tässä Salissa"" has the plucks and serpentine bends of Chinese folk music. But all of this diversity unfolds subtly on a backdrop of muted disco, in crisp yet marvelously fluid pivots. Suturing together sections of lobby-jazz, gospel, and light funk with chromatic piano scales is not something one would think advisable or even possible, until hearing ""Tapaa Minut Aamulla"".</p>
<p>Regina stash all kinds of oblique references to techno in organic, jazzy bass-and-keys odysseys. There are synth arpeggios mimicking flutes mimicking synth arpeggios, and detuned rock licks leaning against modernist piano patterns, and vocal loops pittering out urgent rhythms. All these neat tricks give you stuff to geek out over on headphones, but they never get in the way of the songs' emotional connections or melodic pep. It suggests a band a band that has deeply absorbed the tenets of modern dance, ancient folk, and high-art styles alike, affording them all the same creative and emotional weight.</p></div>"|14527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14527-puutarhatrilogia/|7.6|Brian Howe

Moi Non Plus"". It translates to ""I Love You... Neither Do I"". Confusing and ambiguous, it may simply have been an acknowledgement that their love couldn't last (she was still married to Gunter Sachs), but in any event, Bardot asked that he not release it, and it stayed hidden until it was finally compiled in 1986. In 1968, the 40-year-old Gainsbourg met 22-year-old English actress and model Jane Birkin on the set of the film <i>Slogan</i>. On their first night alone together, he took her on a tour of Paris clubs, including a transvestite bar, and fell asleep drunk. They were married within a year.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg was a complicated guy, outwardly arrogant and lecherous, but also introverted and wildly intelligent. He understood pop music on a very basic, almost instinctual level, what worked and what didn't, and what could cause a sensation. He was an inveterate experimenter, exploring ways to marry the French chanson to jazz, African music, exotica, reggae, electronic music, funk, and British art-rock (check his <i>Cannabis</i> soundtrack). And he must have known he had something sensational on his hands with ""Je T'aime"". He asked Birkin to record a new version with him, and she agreed, as she admits in the liner notes to Light in the Attic's new reissue of the Birkin/Gainsbourg album, only to keep him from singing it with someone else.</p>
<p>That a little bit of jealousy motivated it makes the final recording just that much more delicious. Where the Bardot version was pillowy, her vocal almost too humid, Birkin brings to it a playfulness that balances Gainsbourg's debauched deadpan. If you haven't heard it, it goes basically like this: She says she loves him, he enigmatically responds ""neither do I,"" they matter-of-factly describe the rhythm of sex, and she very convincingly simulates a climax. It's a stunning song in every respect, from the dreamy organ to the strings that simulate billowing bedsheets to Birkin's goose-bumpy falsetto, and it caused quite a sensation indeed. Country after country lined up to ban it from the radio, but none could hold it back, and it sold like crazy all over Europe. In the UK it occupied two spots on the chart simultaneously after Fontana got cold feet and withdrew it, allowing another label to get in on the action.</p>
<p>Thing is, we like to think of the 60s as a liberated time, when hippies convinced people that sex was okay, but it's not true. For most of the people still running things, this song was too much. Hell, I wonder what would happen if it came out today. Of course, ""Je T'aime"" was just one song from the album, and it gets the most ink for a reason, but there's plenty of other amazing stuff here, not least of which is ""69 Année Érotique"" (""69 Erotic Year""). Yeah, the title is a cheap pun, which is a classic Gainsbourg move, but the shuddering piano and snapping bass provide deep atmosphere for his sing-speak, and while we're at it, Arthur Greenslade deserves major credit for the opulent and moody arrangements on this record. The combination of Gainsbourg and Greenslade is nearly as sharp as Gainsbourg's collaboration with Jean-Claude Vannier two years later on his masterpiece, <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i>.</p>
<p>Outside its two most iconic tracks, the record swerves all over the place, much like Gainsbourg's output on the whole, careening through old-fashioned orchestral chanson on ""Elisa"", blasting through a wild tack piano-led can-can that carries echoes of Gainsbourg's childhood as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France in its morbid lyrics, and brooding hatefully under an oppressive orchestra on ""Manon"". Gainsbourg's love of controversy finds him singing his own version of ""Les Sucettes"", a song he'd written for a teenaged France Gall a few years earlier-- the double entendre centered around the pleasure of sucking a lollipop derailed Gall's career for a few years, but here's Gainsbourg, switching the song from first to third person and piling on the sleaze by blanketing the whole thing with wah-wah guitar.</p>
<p>For some listeners-- certainly for many who bought ""Je T'aime"" on 45 back in 1969-- Gainsbourg's  filthiness is a source of novelty, but that seems to miss the point, albeit rather harmlessly. To my mind, there are a few reasons his dirty-minded music has aged so well. The sound of it and the eclecticism of it certainly count, but more important is the casual authority with which he approached his subject matter, refusing to treat any of it, from sex to death, as taboo. ""Je T'aime"" is so convincing that rumors spread that the couple had actually recorded it <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, which naturally only made it more popular. Plenty of people had no doubt considered making such a song for mass consumption; Gainsbourg went ahead and did it. He and Birkin remained together, through a fair amount of tumult, until 1980-- the one album that bore both their names on the spine still sounds fresh and surprising today.</p></div>"|14524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14524-jane-birkin-et-serge-gainsbourg/|8.8|Joe Tangari

When he hit, he hit hard enough to shatter bone: this volume in Hip-O's mail-order series includes three consecutive #1 R&amp;B hits (the murderously heavy, slow funk grooves of ""The Payback"", ""My Thang"", and ""Papa Don't Take No Mess""), and a few other spectacular jams. But when Brown missed, he flailed just as hard.</p>
<p>Sometimes he realized it in time. <i>Volume Nine</i> begins with three scheduled-and-canceled singles, including several awkward duets with Lyn Collins (one of them a bizarre Latin version of ""Let It Be Me""). ""I Got a Good Thing (And I Ain't Gonna Let It Go)"" is a <i>pro forma</i> jam with Brown double-tracked-- playing his own Bobby Byrd, effectively, since Byrd had left his revue. The canceled single was replaced by a new recording less than two weeks later: ""Stoned to the Bone"", more casual but distinctly superior, and a solid hit.</p>
<p>This period also saw Brown developing a bizarre weakness for scattering his records with overdubbed sound effects and drop-ins. Adding bits of Jesse Jackson's ""I am somebody"" speech to the Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.'s single ""Same Beat Pt. 1"" was a great idea. Adding a disc jockey announcing ""This is for Atlanta!"" and ""This record is too much!"" all over ""The Payback"" was not-- the familiar mix, without Hank Spann's interjections, was actually a promotional version demanded by radio. Lyn Collins' smoking ""Rock Me Again &amp; Again &amp; Again &amp; Again &amp; Again &amp; Again"" is not so much a duet with Brown as the boss staring over her shoulder and butting in on almost every line, then dumping in some extra sound effects and grafting the first minute of the track on again at the end. It's pretty amazing anyway. Brown was an aging, eccentric king, but he was still the king: ""Funky President (People It's Bad)"" was easily the hottest pop response to the American politics of the 1970s.</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden, disco was king. For the first time in years, R&amp;B was dominated by rhythms way outside Brown's own idiom, and the last four singles here are the sound of Brown hitting the wall. First, there's a sloppy remake of his 1970 breakthrough ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"". That's followed by a halfway-there J.B.'s instrumental that Brown decided to grace with the title (and chant) ""Thank You For Lettin' Me Be Myself, and You Be Yours""-- was he claiming that Sly Stone had ripped him off, or just ripping off Sly Stone?</p>
<p>""Dead On It"" is one of the strangest records Brown ever released: it opens with two beatless minutes of belching synth noises and occasional sour guitar chords, over which the Godfather rambles about how he's not as good as he used to be but demands respect anyway, before finally breaking into a cautious combination of some riffs he'd been flogging for years. Brown almost immediately withdrew it and replaced it with the similar-only-in-name ""Hustle!!! (Dead On It)""-- a carbon copy of Cameroonian musician André-Marie Tala's 1973 record ""Hot Koki"", and a bald-faced attempt to cash in on the success of Van McCoy's ""The Hustle"". It's not a bad piece of music, but it was a thoroughly embarrassing gesture. Over the course of 1975, drummer Jabo Starks, trombonist/arranger Fred Wesley and saxophonist Maceo Parker all quit working with Brown, effectively dissolving his last classic band. He still had dozens of major and minor hits ahead of him, but he'd never again rule R&amp;B the way he had for a decade.</p></div>"|14508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14508-the-singles-vol-9-1973-1975/|7.7|Douglas Wolk

But the part that Versus played in the indie rock underground of the 1990s can't be overlooked.  In some ways, Versus <i>were</i> the quintessential indie rock band. Versus' growth throughout the decade, from mawkish noise-popists beholden to their underground-approved influences (on 1993's <i>The Stars Are Insane</i>) to mature, reliable, genre-bounding songwriters (on 2000's <i>Hurrah</i>) mirrors the growth, for better or worse, of the genre as a whole.  The group's two Caroline Records releases-- 1996's <i>Secret Swingers</i>, and 1998's <i>Two Cents Plus Tax</i>-- sound as close as most any other records to a definitive indie rock sound. That those records are out-of-print says as much about Versus' fortunes as it does the fortunes of hooky, three-to-four-minute indie rock tracks like ""Atomic Kid"" and ""Lose That Dress"".</p>
<p>Now, after a smattering of live dates over the past 10 years, the original Versus (guitarist/vocalist Richard Baluyut, bassist/vocalist Fontaine Toups, and drummer Ed Baluyut) decided to give it another go. They don't pick up where they left off, however: Rather than big hooks, the first songs on the band's first album in a decade, ""Invincible Hero"" and ""Nu Skin"", are decidedly mid-tempo.  And when the somewhat patient listener is rewarded with songs like the meandering ""Cicada"", and the brick-subtle brow-beaten title track, it's easy to overlook the album's stronger tracks-- Baluyut's lovestruck ballad ""Gone to Earth"" and ""Saturday Saints"", or Toups' bittersweet turns on ""Into Blue"" and ""Scientists"".</p>
<p>Longtime Versus fans might be pleasantly surprised at the leaps Toups has made as a both a singer and a songwriter (those who heard her work fronting the Fontaine Toups won't be as shocked). Toups is indeed charmingly world-weary on the first half of ""Erstwhile"", and crafts something deceptively wistful and light on ""Pink Valhalla"". Baluyut's growth as a writer is more evident with multiple spins. Musically, there are nice touches here: the round-robin harmonies that end ""Gone to Earth""; the gradual crescendo that builds throughout ""Saturday Saints""; the way ""Erstwhile"" effortlessly transitions from Toups' whimsical cane-shaking ruminations into Richard Baluyut's more ponderous thoughts, then circles back on itself for the coda.</p>
<p>So even if this album plays hard to get, there's plenty to love for those willing to listen. When a band reconvenes after a long hiatus to release new music, there's always the fear that whatever emerges will be a shadow of past glories, or a regretful nostalgia trip. Thankfully, for an album whose words are often soaked with regret and nostalgia, the music on <i>Ones and Threes</i> is heartening proof that this version of Versus, whatever their future brings, are going to leave their past in the past.</p></div>"|14520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14520-on-the-ones-and-threes/|6.3|David Raposa

St. Helens Vietnam Band"" somehow makes less sense than it did the first time around. In the context of the Seattle quintet's self-titled debut from 2009, you could at least consider it a riff on the overblown monikers preferred by enthusiastic, collective-ish types such as themselves. But on <i>Where the Messengers Meet</i>, they forgo any of the upheaval or explosiveness implied by their namesakes, instead playing squarely within the strictures of indie rock at its most no-frills; five years ago, this would've been called blog-rock.</p>
<p><i>Mt.</i><i> St. Helens Vietnam Band </i>wasn't a good record, but its exuberance and overstuffed arrangements at least helped counter its derivativeness. But <i>Messengers </i>drips with resignation and defeat-- the record actually sounds <i>depressed</i>. Whether half-heartedly bringing the thunder on the blunt breakdown of ""Hurrah"" or aimlessly working through mushy progressions most everywhere else, you envision someone disinterestedly picking at their meal.</p>
<p>It's almost like MSHVB are going out of their way to go unnoticed, as there's just so little to grab onto here, in terms of either hooks or texture. It's a punishingly monochromatic listen because nearly everything is built on the same foundation of flavorless guitar roughage, Benjamin Verdoes' anodyne vocals, leaden drums, and laggard tempos that make each three-minute chunk feel twice as long. Even when they're on the verge of something memorable, they can't help but get in their own way: ""At Night"" and ""Hurrah"" feature swinging verses, but they never pick up steam thanks to an antagonistic relationship with rhythmic stability that makes it all sound like Cold War Kids at their most jazzbo-insufferable.</p>
<p>That said, a willingness to play in prog time signatures is pretty much the only thing that they do to generate friction, and at the very least, the relatively uptempo rock of ""Leaving Trails"" and ""George Clark"" manages to kick up some dust even if MSHVB are mostly running in place. For the most part, though, MSHVB simply slump-- Verdoes' stiff melismatics and waterlogged guitar arpeggios are throwbacks to the early-2000s bands who knew wimpy takes on the ballads from <i>The Bends </i>got you prime real estate in the <i>NME</i>.</p>
<p>And yet their residence on the usually trustworthy Dead Oceans label and opening slots for the likes of Japandroids speak highly of the company they keep, so it leads me to wonder, ""what is everyone else hearing that I'm not?"" But where you'd expect a melody to take an intriguing turn, they simply flatline as if to suggest MSHVB just went with the first one that came to mind. They're much too young (Approved Talking Point: the drummer is 15) to sound this damn old, and even its quick turnaround and barren album cover suggest that they wanted to be done with this album as soon as possible. Guess the feeling's mutual.</p></div>"|14504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14504-where-the-messengers-meet/|3.3|Ian Cohen

The Brooklyn-based foursome spends a lot of time here style-pinching, connecting dots already drawn by contemporary indie acts. And yet Miniature Tigers are often able to pull it off. By incorporating elements outside the realm of the no-frills indie pop they're grounded, they show a genuine interest in exploring avant-garde folk, woozy psych, and abstracted electronic pop. You can still see, however, where these ideas are being plucked from.</p>
<p>Opener ""Mansion of Misery"" (inspired by <i>The Shining</i>) adds smatterings of percussion and noisy, confused electronics before squeezing out a little Liars-like thrash. Neon Indian-assisted single ""Gold Skull"" feels blissful and natural, while the otherwise stoner-ific ""Rock n' Roll Mountain Troll"" channels Vampire Weekend on high alert. What could have been a cheap stab at poaching new listeners becomes a respectful exercise in toying with popular sounds. But songs like ""Bullfighter Jacket"" and ""Lolita"" both exemplify how stylistic appropriation (in these cases, we're talking Animal Collective) can often look like posturing. Neither are unenjoyable songs: ""Bullfighter Jacket"" recalls earlier, 'round-the-campfire AnCo, complete with those otherworldly ""ayayayay""s, while the sparkling gypsy vibe of ""Lolita"" goes so far as to lift a vocal melody from Panda Bear's ""Take Pills"". They break very little new ground, and only the most unfamiliar ears will be able to find something of substance to latch onto here.</p>
<p>Even when the band's fondness for shadow play doesn't pan out, it's still better than the more traditional, <i>Nick &amp; Norah</i> indie fare that really stalls the album. It's encouraging to hear them cherry-pick former tour mates like Spinto Band and, especially on ""Dark Tower"", the Morning Benders (whose vocalist Chris Chu also guests here). Not to mention frontman Charlie Brand's shy, echo-laden voice, which is the real star here. If only he had the better sense to know that sometimes restraint and careful footing can really wash a record out.</p></div>"|14484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14484-fortress/|6.4|Zach Kelly

Not like it was all that tightly restricted in the first place-- his late-90s/early-00s work knocked with dread but included both hardcore hip-hop breaks and glitchy squalls. Still, his work's gotten to the point where it can take a longtime fan about 10 seconds to recognize one of his new beats, and another 10 seconds to hear something fresh in his approach. More than 15 years after Company Flow's first single, El-P's ability to maintain a recognizable style while still staying restless has kept his work interesting. (That, and his tendency to do things like his deranged, spur-of-the-moment Justin Bieber remix.)</p>
<p><i>Weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixxx3</i> subsequently catches El-P doing something that suits his talents in an unexpected way: the mixed beat tape. The previous two volumes of this series were comprised largely of outtakes and unreleased material, heavy on the vocal tracks that showcased his hectic, often unhinged lyricism. But this one's more of an instrumental showcase, something that strings together experimental asides, self-contained pieces, and pre-established material into something resembling a sonic arc. He's had plenty of experience concocting beats meant to stay voiceless-- including CoFlow's unmixed 1999 release <i>Little Johnny From the Hospitul </i>and some of his compositions for the movie <i>Bomb the System </i>a few years later-- so it's not unprecedented.</p>
<p>But it is pretty notable, and skeptics who are traditionally either turned off by El's motormouth flow or take his production for granted have much to learn from this. El's soundtracking sensibility is what keeps much of <i>Megamixxx3</i>'s momentum<i> </i>going, and even the short tracks don't run in place too long before cutting to new ideas. There's some cinematic allusions, like how ""Whores: the Movie"" sweats out hissing waveform faux-brass like his own mutation of David Shire's score for <i>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</i>, or when tracks like ""Time Won't Tell"" and ""He Hit Her So She Left"" slowly build in intensity like they were tailor-made for suspense sequences. And the pieces that go past the three-minute mark-- the horror-funk ""Meanstreak (In 3 Parts)""; the spaghetti Western ""Drunk With a Loaded Pistol""; the electro panic attack ""How to Serve Man (Stripped)""-- have the feel of tonally shifting miniature suites.</p>
<p><i>Megamixxx3</i> originated as a blended amalgam of discarded ideas, so it's to El-P's credit that he was able to wrangle all this into a more-or-less consistent and substantial work. As weird as he gets, there's always a core of hip-hop fundamentals at the center of his music-- hell, there's even a Zapp break tucked away in there somewhere. And in the midst of a long career working his way around monster jeep beats, old-school headknock breaks, and dystopian analog concoctions, he's made fitting it all together sound easy. It helps that he's gotten a lot of mileage out of a few distinctly dense synthesizer tones-- we're a long way from that tinny little three-note ""Vital Nerve"" riff-- that give his tracks a signature buzz. But it's clear here that his real production strength is his drum programming, which builds off complex patterns and then lets them scatter and shift into elastic detours. A scrapyard curiosity of a bonus track, the eight and a half minute ""Eat My Garbage 2"", consists of all the isolated drum breaks from the record; it's not much of a song, but it makes a convincing case that El-P knows how to put a loop together like a motherfucker.</p>
<p>There are a couple of known quantities sewn into the mix-- instrumentals for his remixes of Young Jeezy's ""I Got This"" and Kidz in the Hall's ""Driving Down the Block""-- as well as a memorably bizarre excursion into new wave lounge-R&amp;B, ""Contagious Snippet"", a collaboration with Chin Chin's Wilder Zoby that evokes the neon-noir scores for <i>Thief </i>and <i>Blade Runner</i>. These tracks reinforce that this album is more of a Frankenstein's monster than a preview of El-P's future direction. But while <i>Weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixxx3 </i>had all the indications of starting out as a stopgap project to stave off between-album downtime, it wound up being a solid exhibition of his chops. Even when the man appears to be just dicking around in his parts bin, he can still dredge up great music.</p></div>"|14498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14498-weareallgoingtoburninhellmegamixxx3/|7.6|Nate Patrin

Rappers rarely start with a fully-formed classic right off the bat. And sometimes, a guy who was underrated, underappreciated, or even considered a joke earlier in their career actually generates so much momentum that they eventually become undeniable.</p>
<p>Still, even the most patient and forgiving listener would've had trouble imagining that Rick Ross would ever be taken seriously. His first two Def Jam albums sold well, but his bumbling performances on the mic did little to combat the view of him as merely Jay-Z's get-rich-quick scheme, someone to piggyback on the commercial momentum of dudes from the South rapping about hustling. And when 50 Cent ""outed"" him as a former corrections officer, it could've been a career-killing PR disaster. But instead of filling his 2009 album <i>Deeper Than Rap</i> with a compendium of explanations and <i>mea culpas</i>, Ross did the exact opposite, exaggerating the most outrageous and ostentatious aspects of his music and persona to summer-blockbuster proportions. He threw the burden of believability out so fast that you could just sit back and cheer as shit blew up.</p>
<p>Ross knows his lane and stays in it on <i>Teflon Don</i>. If this album initially lacks the wallop of <i>Deeper Than Rap</i>, it's only because there's no longer the shock value in realizing that Rick Ross is making one of the better rap records of the year. But <i>Teflon Don</i> also lacks the concessions to sensitive thuggery that bogged down <i>Deeper</i>, and it's also remarkably lean at just 11 tracks. Ross defiantly announces on opener ""I'm Not A Star"", ""If I die today remember me like John Lennon/ Buried in Louis I'm talkin' all brown linen/ Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty/ Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city,"" and things really don't get any more modest from there.</p>
<p>Ross' greatest gift is the ability to conjure a fully-formed Planet Boss, a refuge from the dwindling fortunes of gansta rap and the general economic downturn, where rappers can and do film videos with as many speedboats as possible. It's obviously a place where A-list rappers are in their comfort zone to do whatever the hell they want. Here, Jay-Z can refute possible ties to the Illuminati, Kanye is at his most aw-shucks disarming since 2007, and the third iteration of ""Maybach Music"" features none other than Erykah Badu on the hook. The only times <i>Teflon</i> stumbles is when interlopers can't figure the lay of the land. Diddy would've catered more to the spirit of this record if he went in character as Sergio Roma instead of hyping up the overamped, ill-fitting rock moves of ""No. 1"", and while Drake proved every bit as capable of having rappers meet him on his own terms, his redux of ""The Resistance"" on ""Aston Martin Music"" is the awkward sound of two worlds colliding.</p>
<p>While <i>Teflon Don</i> is fun to talk about conceptually, it would be a shame if Ross' growth as an artist went overlooked. Just because Ross and his producers rarely work in nuance doesn't mean they're not craftsmen. It's fitting that his franchise is called ""Maybach Music"": J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, No I.D., and Kanye West create beats that really do sound like they're fantastically out of reach to anyone but the financial elite, and you can hear every dollar that went into the record. There are still plenty of villainous synth vamps that cater to Ross' halting, self-satisfied delivery. But the real fun is hearing <i>Teflon</i> at its most indulgent. Just listen to how the Disney strings modulate to a new key to herald the arrival of Ross on ""Maybach Music III"", the way a Bobby Seale speech adds high drama on ""Tears of Joy"", or how ""Live Fast, Die Young"" takes a Kid Dynamite sample back from ""Nuthin' But a G Thang"" for six minutes of bottle-popping. Even the drum rolls on ""MC Hammer"" suspiciously conjure an ATM dispensing cash.</p>
<p>Ross won't ever be confused for a Scribble Jam participant, but compare his incongruously meek rapping on 2006 single ""Push It"" to anything on <i>Teflon Don</i>, and you hear someone who's come into his own. Lyrics that might look clumsy on paper turn into grand pronouncements through pure self-belief. And like a great action hero, Ross never lets cleverness get in the way of saying something memorable. Understandably, money is about the only tie Planet Boss has to reality, and nearly every interaction can be broken down as a financial transaction. He uses luxury autos as a pricing scale for his donations to Haiti, his fatalism is manifested in having his jewelry go uninsured, he reps Emmett Till and Rolexes in the span of two lines, and the only way he can express his grief over his dead father is by turning down ""All the Money in the World"".</p>
<p>So, yeah-- the tide's pretty much turned for Ross, but if <i>Deeper Than Rap</i> didn't change your mind, I'm not sure <i>Teflon Don</i> will either. At this point, you can find a piece bemoaning the likes of Lil Wayne, Cam'ron, or Gucci Mane becoming critical favorites and fill in Ross' name, since it's a common theme that hip-hop heads would rather miss out on new royalty than admit they might've been wrong about a rapper. And yet, those who are stuck on New York in the late 90s as might actually be most likely to appreciate <i>Teflon Don</i>. It's every bit the throwback, embracing an aura of dominance in a landscape where vulnerability has become a rapper's greatest asset. But more importantly, Ross has proven to be among the last of dying breed. His studio albums feel like events that demand the ears and opinions of rap fans.</p></div>"|14482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14482-teflon-don/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Now Drag City's latest excavation project reminds us there were another thousand bands who never even got to enjoy <i>those</i> measly 15 minutes of fame. Little is known about Spur beyond this: They initially formed in Belleville, Illinois circa 1965 as a folk-rock outfit called the Unknowns, before changing their name, opening up their sound, and releasing just one album, 1968's <i>Spur of the Moment</i>, in a limited local run. This similarly titled 11-song collection-- select tracks from the original LP, plus previously unreleased material-- doesn't make a wholly convincing case that Spur were unjustly overlooked visionaries. Rather, <i>Spur of the Moments</i> works best as an intriguing snapshot of a late-60s era when rock was evolving out of its garage-band base and splintering into myriad sub-genres-- roots-rock, prog-jazz, power-pop--  and fledgling bands were scrambling to anticipate which way the tide was going to turn.</p>
<p>Like more famous peers such as the Byrds, Spur were situated at the crossroads where studio-abetted psychedelic exploration intersected with a reactionary desire for a simpler, earthier mode of songwriting, and, as the acid-country opener ""Mind Odyssey"" suggests, Spur were neck-and-neck with Roger McGuinn and co. in the race to the rodeo (a notion reinforced by a sweet, bluegrassed cover of The Beatles' ""Eight Days a Week""). But <i>Spur of the Moments</i> presents so many stylistic 180s-- sometimes within the same song-- that the band seems more emblematic of a rapidly changing musical culture than a driving force within it. In its most jarring juxtaposition, the ace two-minute freakbeater ""Mr. Creep"" butts into the veritable Fillmore-audition-tape jam ""Tribal Gathering/We Don't Want to Know"", which over the course of its 14-minute run, veers between free-form Doors-style noodling, Grand Funk-ian proto-metal, drum solos, and a cheery, Southern-rockin' denouement, like an FM dial spun out of control.</p>
<p>But there's no denying vocalists Rick Willard and Stan Bratzke were ardent, attentive students of both the UK and San Francisco schools of 60s pop, and the CSN-worthy ""Time Is Now"" and the Badfingered ballad ""Help Me I'm Falling"" are more than sturdy enough to stand alongside those classic-rock warhorses on golden-oldies radio. But even if rigid FM-station playlists still deem that fate unlikely today, at the very least, <i>Spur of the Moments</i> makes you wonder-- nearly 40 years after the first issue of <i>Nuggets</i>-- how many more quality 60s curios are still out there waiting to be unearthed.</p></div>"|14517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14517-spur-of-the-moments/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Sometimes Chabot's synth-heavy electro-pop project has a full band, sometimes it's just him alone. His latest, <i>Mind Altar</i>, was originally an eight-song cassette offered for download on Deastro's blog; here on this digital-only release, it's been fortified with three bonus tracks from another one of Chabot's blog-only EPs, <i>Orange Swimmer Red Summer</i>. Though Chabot insists that <i>Mind Altar</i> isn't ""the new face of Deastro,"" something has changed since <i>Moondagger</i>, last year's full-band LP. Where <i>Moondagger</i> was a no-apologies effort to draw Deastro's aesthetic out of the bedroom, Deastro now seems intent on working in the smaller, more intimate space occupied by an ever-expanding crop of chillwave acts.</p>
<p><i>Mind Altar</i> is covered in a dank lo-fi buzz, a familiar production technique that adds a pinch of mystery to an otherwise tuneful batch of electro-pop songs. By throwing heavy delay on his vocals and employing a number of dreamy, nostalgic touches, Chabot finds himself in the company of acts like Toro Y Moi. But as potentially derivative as this might sound, the clever beats and wind-swept lushness help save Deastro from looking like the next guy to tumble down some trendy rabbit hole.</p>
<p>The songs vary in slight but interesting ways, indulging in spaced-out, ambient collisions one moment (""The Concept of Land Ownership"") and laying down propulsive, hallucinogenic hook-driven material the next (""Mind Altar"", ""Get Frostied""). Held over from <i>Moondagger</i> is Chabot's growing affinity for the sound of live instrumentation, like the maddening Motor City bass line on ""Pastor Kid Redux Edition"" or the percussion on ""Get Frostied"". Sometimes, Chabot does get a bit carried away with it all, overstuffing these songs with too many sounds and ideas that it's hard to not feel a little confused. But maybe confusion is the idea, like on the cassette-closing ""World of Shadow"", where everything from hyperactive acoustic guitar strums, circling electronic plinks, and seagull squawks all collide with a dizzy satisfaction. When the ideas are flowing, Chabot's maximalist compulsions are justified.</p></div>"|14507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14507-mind-altar-ep/|6.9|Zach Kelly

In going solo, she's carving out her own niche while proving that she can anchor a full album on her own. Perhaps because she has taken the step of recording under her own name, or perhaps because like all new solo artists she has something to prove, the slow-burn <i>Obadiah </i>sounds more ambitious than her work with the Tanyas. She gingerly stretches and reshapes her band's sound to include new styles and genres and to place the weight squarely on her own carefully observed songwriting.</p>
<p>And yet, even as Ford tiptoes between soft jazz, smoky soul, and austere country, <i>Obadiah </i>is defined as much by what she doesn't do as by what she actually does. Without the powerhouse voice of Neko Case or Kelly Hogan, she never belts or hollers, never raises her voice or grasps for high drama. Picking her words apart by the vowels, she keeps her vocals relatively low, slows her tempos, and soft-sells these songs. Her dried cornhusk of a voice sounds like she's channeling her interior monologue, even if she's singing from other points of view-- such as the seen-it-all rogue featured in ""Firecracker"" or the regretful parent remembering better days on ""Lost Together"". Even without her harmonizing Tanyas, Ford proves a sure presence through <i>Obadiah</i>, inhabiting these songs comfortably and conveying smirking sass as naturally as simmering lust or downhearted regret. ""I can't think, I can't use my brain,"" she sings on ""I Like You Better"", ""I can't think no more."" It's the album's catchiest hook and a telling moment not only because she exudes such romantic abandon, but because Ford actually sounds like she singing without thinking.</p>
<p>Producer John Raham calibrates the music to complement but never intrude on Ford's vocals, giving extra weight to his own drums, which gently nudge along the dusky ""Lay Down with You"" and her cover of Bob Dylan's ""One More Cup of Coffee"". Stax brass builds gently through ""If You Gonna Go"", gently punctuating her anguished farewell, and fellow Tanya Trish Klein casually interjects spidery guitar licks to bolster the bluesy come-ons of ""Blue Streak Mama"". Ford is studiously avoiding alt-country caricature-- no galloping hoedowns here-- and setting and sustaining a grave mood throughout album the album. Consequently, the tempos remain rigorously uniform across these 13 tracks, as though quickening the pace might change the genre or break the spell. It makes for a warmly moody, albeit strangely static album.</p></div>"|14445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14445-obadiah/|7.1|Stephen M. Deusner

That quality has played a huge role in making them very, very popular; it's also their greatest weakness. <i>Funeral </i>was wracked with agony and grief, but what made it one of the transcendent records of the 2000s was that it avoided easy answers. It proposed that the fight of our lives is just that, a fight, but a winnable one. But when they turned that same all-or-nothing intensity outward on <i>Neon Bible</i>, otherwise propulsive and elegant songs were sometimes bogged down by overblown arrangements or pedantic political statements. You'd figure an album bluntly called <i>The Suburbs </i>that focuses on The Way We Live might repeat some of <i>Neon Bible</i>'s worst tendencies. Instead, it's a satisfying return to form-- proof that Arcade Fire can still make grand statements without sounding like they're carrying the weight of the world.</p>
<p>The metrics of <i>The Suburbs </i>are misleading: At 16 tracks, including interludes and multi-part songs, it might seem like Arcade Fire are shooting for their <i>Sandinista!</i>, <i>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</i>, or <i>Sign O' The Times</i>-- a band at the peak of their powers reacting against the walls closing in by blowing everything up and trying anything. But the album actually plays out more like Bruce Springsteen's <i>The River, </i>a generously paced collection of meditations on familial responsibility, private disappointments, and fleeting youth, much of which takes place in moving vehicles<i>. </i>It also reintroduces much-needed levity to an act that can be overbearingly self-serious. On the deceptively chipper chamber pop of ""Rococo"", Win Butler borders on patronizing, evoking Nirvana's ""In Bloom"" and using the title word as a sword to skewer an easy target: the hipster more concerned with following trends than locating a genuine understanding in the world around him. But the point is that Butler values directness and truth, and throughout <i>The Suburbs</i>, what he lacks in poetry, he makes up for with honesty.</p>
<p>There's a tension between the uneasily resolving chords and lightfooted piano shuffle on the title track, as Butler sings in a restrained falsetto: ""Sometimes I can't believe it/ I'm moving past the feeling."" As <i>The Suburbs </i>plays out, that ""feeling"" is one that lived on <i>Funeral </i>and is dying here. The initial fantasy of <i>Funeral </i>was escaping the neighborhood, dancing beneath the police lights, and living on misbehavior. <i>The Suburbs </i>can be seen as the update decades later, with those same kids having kids of their own, and moving back to and struggling in the same neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The heavy-handedness that marred some of <i>Neon Bible </i>mostly resulted from Butler's warning us of destruction caused by the lies of authority figures-- shady cultural impresarios, corrupt church leaders, politicians all too eager to push the button. But what makes <i>The Suburbs </i>a more humane and empathetic record is that Butler and Régine Chassagne have come to terms with how the pain of our day-to-day lives more often results from the lies we tell ourselves. At the outset of ""We Used to Wait"", staccato, minor-key piano chords evoke anxiety. The song is a simple lament about the exhaustion from a relentless pace of life that demands everything immediately. But as Jeremy Gara's steady drums lift the piece into cathedral drama, it's obvious that there's a deeper concern than the antiquation of letter-writing. By the time the narrator finds himself with ""the lights cut out... left standing in the wilderness downtown,"" it's a sad reminder that giving up your dreams for a reliable job that pays your way and corrodes your soul isn't even a reliable option anymore. Soul-sucking work was at least once a dependably secure and profitable enterprise. Now what do we do?</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>The Suburbs </i>focuses on this quiet desperation borne of compounding the pain of wasting your time as an adult by romanticizing the wasted time of your youth. As bleak as the lyrics are, though, they're buoyed by the band's leanest, loosest songwriting yet. These songs are busy, but never overly complicated, subtly nudging at their boundaries while allowing wide lanes for Butler's perfectly memorable melodic turns. The framework is familiar: Arcade Fire's trademark of decorating AOR with orchestral fringe (""Ready to Start"", ""Empty Room""), sun-baked <i>Harvest </i>gold (""Wasted Hours"", ""Suburban War""), and in the record's highlights, pulsating electro (""Half Light II [No Celebration]"", ""Sprawl II [Mountains Beyond Mountains]"").</p>
<p>But <i>The Suburbs </i>is a record that seeks to build, and it reaches a monumental peak at its closure. Both parts of ""Sprawl"" act like a conversation between lovers and a treatise on what makes Arcade Fire tick: Butler's despondence on ""Sprawl I (Flatland)"" matches the desolate atmosphere that surrounds him-- returning to a mall-spackled hometown is an admission of defeat. But as with their first two albums, the penultimate song towers over what came before: ""Sprawl II"" is an Arcade Fire song through and through, balancing a sort of defiance in the midst of crushing circumstance (""These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose/ But late at night the feelings swim to the surface""). It's a rare and thrilling example of the group stepping out of their musical comfort zone, an airy disco bounce evoking ""Heart of Glass"" that serves as further evidence of just how crucial the often underappreciated Chassagne is in tempering Butler's grimmer outlook.</p>
<p>That said, the relative concision of <i>Funeral </i>and <i>Neon Bible </i>didn't allow for a whole lot of wiggle room. And while it's somewhat heartening to hear something allowed to be a ""minor"" Arcade Fire song, they're still, well, minor. ""Month of May"" strains too much for a ragged punk glory while the folky, Neil Young-ish strummer ""Deep Blue"" doesn't develop its Kasparov vs. IBM metaphor into more than an afterthought.  And as <i>The Suburbs</i> reaches its second half, there's certainly some thematic redundancy-- surely, there's already a drinking game revolving around Butler's use of ""the kids.""</p>
<p>There's also the possibility that <i>The Suburbs </i>can be seen as a lesser Arcade Fire album if you mostly value rock music for its escapism. This is another 2010 example of a Boss-indebted band (see also: the National and Titus Andronicus) making epic outpourings of modern disillusionment and disappointment for people who can commiserate and return to fretting about their jobs and bank accounts once the house lights go up. But just because the concerns of <i>The Suburbs </i>are at times mundane, that makes them no less real. And that Arcade Fire can make such powerful art out of recognizing these moments makes our own existences feel worthy of documentation. By dropping <i>Neon Bible</i>'s accusatory standpoint, <i>The Suburbs </i>delivers a life-affirming message similar to <i>Funeral</i>'s: We're all in this together.</p></div>"|14516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14516-the-suburbs/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Unlike some bands with multiple vocalists, Thompson-Hannant and Seydel's voices do not complement each other well, and they often sound like they just belong in different bands. This issue has been mitigated somewhat on the group's third album, <i>Candle to Your Eyes</i>, in which Thompson-Hannant has taken on a more dominant presence, singing lead on seven of the record's nine tracks. Seydel still doesn't quite work as her foil, but his vocal performance has improved greatly, or at least enough that his shortcomings are no longer a distraction.</p>
<p>With Thompson-Hannant serving as an anchor, <i>Candle to Your Eyes</i> is far more consistent and distinct than the two albums that proceeded it. The group still sounds restless and adventurous, but they've reined in their expansive tendencies to focus on a sort of oddball variation on funk. It's a surprising move-- their older songs were never especially groovy or sexy-- but it suits Thompson-Hannant well, allowing her commanding, Corin Tucker-ish voice to take on a soulful, seductive quality. ""Too Late For Dancing"" and ""Time Has Practically Stopped"", the album's two best tracks, synthesize art-rock and R&amp;B in a way that sounds fresh and distinct. They're exploring an aesthetic zone not too far off from where Dirty Projectors went with ""Stillness Is the Move"", but their guitar style is heavier on texture and atmosphere, and the vibe is more overtly sexual.</p>
<p>As can be expected from this bunch, they don't linger for too long on the their grooves, but they do maintain an airy, sensual tone throughout the album. It's easily their most cohesive effort, and they've never sounded more confident. They play as a thoughtful ensemble, emphasizing negative space and avoiding clutter even when they rock out. The group has a way of getting the most out of an interesting sound-- the atonal, no-wave guitar chimes on ""Time Has Practically Stopped"", the brittle piano notes on ""Tell Your Mum"", the uneasy keyboard drone on ""The Hit Parade""-- but those details can be more memorable than the overall composition. There is still plenty of room for this band to grow in terms of song craft, but they've certainly found an interesting niche for themselves that they would be wise to further explore and refine in the future.</p></div>"|14511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14511-candle-to-your-eyes/|7.1|Matthew Perpetua

The Finnish sorta-trio comes with good bona fides: two drummers, Anssi Nykänen and Tomi Leppanen plus Annie producer/co-songwriter Timo Kaukolampi, and all are good friends with the inimitable DJ duo Optimo, who invited them to perform at one of their last Sunday club nights at Glasgow's Sub Club earlier this year.</p>
<p>To an extent, you can understand K-X-P's appeal to dance floor-friendly artists; their music is incredibly rhythmic, their grooves-- paranoid dark disco and motorik-- deep. The pulsing beat that kicks off ""Mehu Moments"", for example, is so nerve-wracking that you can practically see a red-flashing siren while you're listening to it. And yet this record manages to sound loose and off-the-cuff, positively alive and experimental. New elements within these eight compositions seem to arise out of thin air, like the ripples of melody that erupt throughout ""Mehu Moments"" or the streaks of weeping keyboard sounds stretching out ""Aibal Dub"". Sometimes it all sounds delightfully improvisational.</p>
<p>Thing is, though, these songs are way too self-contained to be the result of compiled-together jam sessions. While <i>K-X-P</i> can get a little rote and samey-sounding at times, every song feels compact despite their running time (only the brightly-humming ""Epilogue"" makes it under the four-minute mark). That structural conciseness could ostensibly be attributed to Kaukolampi's pop pedigree; thing is, though, it's pretty much the only discernible trace that any member of K-X-P's worked with more conventional forms of music.</p>
<p>The two most conceivably ""straightforward"" cuts here, ""18 Hours (of Love)"" and ""Pockets"", are also the two most menacing. The former uses Gary Glitter drums and low-bellowed vocals to create what sounds like a Satanic romantic ballad, while the latter's spangled disco touches are offset by maniacal post-punk howls. Take a listen to Kaukolampi's rework of ""Pockets"" featuring redone vocals from Annie herself, then, and you'll wonder whether or not there's a big beating pop heartbeat (not ""Heartbeat"") lying under each and every song on this album, which is a shape-shifting puzzle that is as fun to pick apart as it is to simply take in and enjoy.</p></div>"|14500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14500-k-x-p/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

They weren't good, necessarily-- the sort of spit-shined radio rock and dance-pop expected from an actress-cum-singer-- but cute enough in their own way. The albums sold well, but at this point she was still a valuable Hollywood commodity and people still bought records. Not long after, as we all know, shit started to go bad for Lohan. Substance abuse, an exploitative family, freaking <i>Herbie: Fully Loaded</i>-- they all took their toll on her, and now homegirl's in jail.</p>
<p>This all-too-common Hollywood tale is the subject matter for <i>Let Me Shine for You</i>, a strange little mixtape from the ascendant outré-dance imprint Tri Angle. The basic idea is that Tri Angle artists and friends of the label, who share a dark and twisted take on pop music, deconstruct Lohan's tracks and build new, eerie songs out of their pieces. Sounds like a potential disaster, but it actually works. These producers-- like the sample-minded oOoOO and beat-smearing Stalker-- thrive in a cut-and-paste style, and thematically the notion of a fallen starlet, tragic yet trashy, pretty much fits their aesthetic perfectly.</p>
<p>For the most part, these tracks sound nothing like Lohan's. Sometimes an artist will hang her vocals in the background as a kind of ghostly presence, but usually the originals are mutilated beyond recognition. Screwed, chopped, sped up or slowed to a crawl, and often fleshed out with new instrumentation. Warp's Babe Rainbow turns ""Stuck"", a pretty basic dance-pop number, into lurching trip-hop; newcomer Autre Ne Veut runs with the club feel of ""Bossy"" but makes it sound like something fit for a bondage party. The tracks all share a threatening and somber vibe, but there's a lot of stylistic diversity: Laurel Halo's contribution skews dubstep, while Oneohtrix Point Never plays with noise and drone.</p>
<p>This variety is one of the nice things about the album and part of what makes Tri Angle such a promising label. These are all ostensibly ""witch-house"" tracks, but that they each sound so different makes a strong case against the idea of the label as a one-trick pony. But as an individual release, <i>Let Me Shine for You</i> is simply a really cool experiment in how leftfield musicians interpret relatively bland radio music. That it's Lindsay Lohan's music just provides another level of intrigue. The revamps are so foreboding and so much about decay that they <i>do</i> on some level feel like a suitable soundtrack for her decline. You just wouldn't expect celebrity downfall to sound so good.</p></div>"|14506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14506-let-me-shine-for-you/|7.6|Joe Colly

""We want to create music that will make you want to dance, cry, sing, laugh, music that elevates, depresses, and declaims,"" he wrote. ""Not just some form of aural wallpaper or something to try and impress your friends, but something you understand and that understands you."" Setting aside any questions about a record's powers of comprehension, that modest manifesto sounds a lot like the goals of plenty of indie pop today, too.</p>
<p>Cats on Fire cover White Town's fluke 1997 hit, ""Your Woman"", to open the 20-track odds-and-sods compilation <i>Dealing in Antiques</i>. By the time White Town released the track, Mishra was working solo, and his bedroom-produced gender-bender was recognizable in part by a horn sample that some people used to guess (wrongly) came from the <i>Star Wars</i> theme. These four Finns do it the way Mishra &amp; co. might have a few years earlier, stripping the dancefloor-friendly arrangement down to sun-splashed post-C86 guitars, bass, and drums. Dapper Cats on Fire frontman Mattias Björkas' drowsy, eternally Mozzy warble barely resembles Mishra's field-mouse hush, and it's a deftly executed cover, but beyond that, it can't really do better than the original at making people dance, cry, sing, or laugh, at elevating, depressing, or declaiming. And that's the point, isn't it?</p>
<p><i>Dealing in Antiques</i> is rewarding and disappointing in much the same ways as its first track. Coming after 2007 debut <i>The Province Complains</i> and 2009 follow-up <i>Our Temperance Movement</i>, each warmly received in indie-pop circles, the current collection reaches as far back as a 2002 demo, bringing together out-of-print B-sides and EP cuts as well as unreleased material from the intervening years. The tracks show that Cats on Fire's jangling style has been in place since early on, that the intimacy of a home recording suits their bedsit songwriting, and that they perform their songs with precision. If you like Felt, Orange Juice, or the Orchids, you'll probably like the sound of this. In that sense, it's a shame New York City Popfest had its <i>The New York Times </i>moment in 2010 rather than last year or the year before, when Cats on Fire were there.</p>
<p>On <i>Dealing in Antiques</i>, however, no matter how tasteful or well-played, the songs eventually start to blur together-- it'd make exquisite aural wallpaper, no kidding, but as indie pop, the compilation leaves some room for improvement. Björkas is prone to cramming ill-fitting syllables into his verses to make awkward rhymes work (see ""Crooked Paper Clip"", especially, or ""Stars""). And the occasional jaunty uptempo number, piano part, or female backing vocal amid all the minor-key strums does little to separate the bookish-pop wheat from its chaff here. Then again, as with American contemporaries Pants Yell!, Cats on Fire are all about subtle understatement, and devotees will surely lose themselves in the ambiguities of like-not-love song ""Never Land Here"", the ironic twists of snob send-ups ""On His Right Side"" and ""The Smell of an Artist"", the shy neurosis of ""Something Happened"", the nuanced doublespeak of ""Solid Work"", the funny romantic near-miss of ""Your Treasure"".</p>
<p>Besides ""Your Woman"", the only other new recording here is ""The Hague"", and even that one originally appeared earlier this year on <i>The Matinée Grand Prix</i> label comp. ""These are my ideals,"" Björkas croons, over a delicately pretty acoustic guitar with walking bass lines. ""If you don't like them, I might have to change them."" If Cats on Fire's ideals are at all like White Town's 20 years ago, <i>Dealing in Antiques</i> shows the group is well on its way to achieving them, but they'll have to move further beyond nostalgia-- and, dare I say, bring their charms higher up out of the 1980s-scented decor-- in order to get all the way there.</p></div>"|14485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14485-dealing-in-antiques/|6.5|Marc Hogan

Not too many rappers could get away with bragging about sitting in their apartments all day playing <i>NBA Live</i> and eating Doritos, and even fewer would try. But Curren$y has hit a certain level of mixtape-level cult stardom in part because he's perfected his amiable everydude stoner persona, and that comes across vividly in that line even though he never mentions weed. He doesn't have to; it's implied. The other thing about that line is its specificity. Curren$y's not just a guy who plays <i>NBA Live</i> all day; he's also one who makes sure he does it right, getting the updated roster. It might harsh his buzz if new Bull Carlos Boozer suddenly turned up in his old Utah Jazz uniform. He appreciates the smaller things.</p>
<p>Curren$y's also had a weird, bounced-around career. The New Orleans rapper got his start in Master P's then-waning No Limit empire, then jumped to Cash Money, playing foil and second banana to Lil Wayne during Wayne's historic mixtape run a few years back. But he left the label just as Wayne was becoming the most popular rapper in the world. And he presumably did it so he could clear his own path, rapping about the stuff he actually cared about. Over a few years' worth of heavy mixtape-circuit work, he's become a great rapper with his own aesthetic-- he's a nimble, affectless drawler who favors airy, spaced-out beats. Like friend and frequent collaborator Wiz Khalifa, he's become one of the dominant voices in the rap underground by making a form of unassuming stoner-rap that owes virtually nothing to J Dilla. And with<i> Pilot Talk</i>, he gets his moment.</p>
<p><i>Pilot Talk</i> finds Curren$y working almost exclusively with 90s New York producer Ski Beatz-- an unexpected but inspired collaborative pairing. Ski, best known for the beats he contributed to Jay-Z's <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>, is even more beloved for <i>Uptown Saturday Night</i>, the album from the linguistically forward NYC duo Camp Lo that he helmed. And in a way, <i>Pilot Talk</i> strikes some of the same chords as <i>Uptown</i>-- smart kids bullshitting with each other, using rap to play around with language and talk as much fly shit as possible.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Pilot Talk</i> is a warm, low-key affair. Ski's tracks can be breathtakingly gorgeous without ever getting in Curren$y's way. There's a lush, languid, almost psych-rock feel to the album. It's so goddamn pretty throughout, all those guitars and pianos and organs and horns layered on top of each other. And Curren$y just inhabits this sonic wonderland, letting his voice sink deep into every track. Even though his delivery and persona couldn't be more different, he's got almost the same accent as B.G., another former Cash Money guy. And that's a great rap voice, just perfect for these wry little observations that he's so good at.</p>
<p>There's a lot of talk about money and girls on <i>Pilot Talk</i>-- and a whole lot of talk about weed-- but my favorite moments come when Curren$y takes delight in some random nonsense. On ""Skybourne"", he brags about how well-trained his dogs are. On ""Roasted"", he offers an enthusiastic endorsement of the lemonade at the Tribeca restaurant Bubby's (""not that Minute Maid crap, they squeeze these lemons theyself""). And on ""King Kong"", he offers this: ""Upstate New York, Woodstock, Saugerties/ The view from my rocking chair you would not believe.""</p>
<p>A few famous guests turn up on the album (Snoop Dogg, Mos Def), but most of those sitting in are friends like Trademark or underground peers like Big K.R.I.T. and an on-fire Jay Electronica, who offers the album's most energetic moment. About half the songs drift by without choruses, and the other half only barely have anything you could call a chorus. The whole thing is over in about 45 minutes. It all adds up to a woozy waft of a record-- a perfect listen for mid-summer, when breathing in the humid air is almost enough to get you high.</p></div>"|14474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14474-pilot-talk/|8.4|Tom Breihan

Tickets to the Chicago date on the classic-era GBV reunion tour, however, were gone in 90 seconds (it's since been relocated to a larger venue, understandably). The recent solo shows are as ever overgenerous, mic-twiling, high-kicking affairs, but I get the difference. That period-- the one that produced <i>Propeller</i>, <i>Bee Thousand</i>, <i>Alien Lanes, </i>and <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>-- saw Pollard's songs go from pretty good R.E.M. knockoffs to messy, madcap affairs, brimming over with daring and varied ideas. Bob's post-GBV solo work, despite a recent hot streak, has also run awfully cold from time to time, with a bleary introspection and far knottier songcraft homing in on some of GBV's straight-up rocking. Then as now, Pollard seemed capable of conjuring almost anything, but back then, his band was better, his foil (the oft-diminshed Tobin Sprout) more suitable, his success rate simply higher. It's no wonder everyone wants back in.</p>
<p>Shame, then, that in the midst of celebrating this storied period in Pollard's history, he'd offer up something as dusky, dour, and samey as his latest, <i>Moses on a Snail</i>, a record as far removed from the classic-era stuff as almost anything he's done. It's the kind of obstinate record only an equally obstinate fan could love, but for anybody looking to raise a glass to ""Glad Girls"", <i>Moses</i> is going to feel drab and far too downtrodden. Not the kind of thing you put on to get yourself pumped for three hours of bombast and beersweat, anyhow.</p>
<p><i>Moses on a Snail</i> lurches to a start with the somber ""The Weekly Crow"", and its mood never quite recovers. It's a mostly terse, torpid affair, lots of gusty ballads and keening prog, the odd riff-rocker coming across especially odd amidst the overarching glower. The melodies tend toward listless, his vocal delivery often muted; most of these tunes resulted from a songwriting binge epic even by Pollard standards, and you can almost hear that particular afternoon's black cloud hanging over most of these tunes, which rarely stray above a lumpy midtempo. Songpiles that most of them are, Pollard records rarely skew this monolithic, and <i>Moses</i> can feel at times like an album-length sulk.</p>
<p>A little time sussing out <i>Moses</i>' subtleties turns up a few bright spots; ""Lie Like a Dog"" starts out a little sluggish before sliding into an oscillating glam strut that should've served as the song's centerpiece. ""Ice Cold War"" is more swagger than song but at least gets the first part right, and the colliding melodies of ""Each Is Good in His Own House"" wouldn't be enough on their own but manage to captivate in tandem. The pure and simple ""Teardrop Paintballs"" has a bit of a ""Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"" thing going for it, and Pollard's voice rings out strong over the mostly unadorned track. And, strange as they seem amidst the drowsy immutability that surrounds them, the scat singing that closes out the positively goofy ""Big Time Wrestling"" and producer Todd Tobias' sinuous fretwork on the title track rescue their respective cuts from total anonymity. But taken as a whole, the glum, inflexible Moses proves a slog, underscoring just why lively and eclectic have done Pollard so well for so long.</p>
<p>In inclimate weather, in the event of a breakup, in case you simply cannot put on <i>Sunfish Holy Breakfast</i> again, <i>Moses on a Snail </i>might do the trick. But it's tough to imagine even the Pollard diehards reaching for this one much, arriving as it does in the midst of a hot streak now a couple of years running. There's just no takeaway hooks, few clever turnarounds, not much but a bad mood transferred from creator to listener. In that, it's effective. But, should Bob and the boys feel compelled to break out anything as indolent as ""How I've Been in Trouble"" when they return to the stage in a couple of months, that beer line's gonna be a nightmare.</p></div>"|14505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14505-moses-on-a-snail/|4.9|Paul Thompson

The Milwaukee band's lead singer, Vincent Kircher, has a distinctive voice that is effortlessly melodic instead of grating. Everyone in the band can play their instruments pretty well, and sometimes they even indulge in solos. At the end of the day, Jaill sound like a bunch of guys who've been practicing in their garage for a while, and are pretty happy to get a chance to put out an album on a relatively high-profile indie label-- and they are, since the band's been toiling in obscurity for the better part of the last decade.</p>
<p>If a few of those points sound a little too average to you, well, that's sort of the problem. Although there are no duds here, a great deal of these songs sound like they're echoing trends already played out by other trad-indie bands. There's a couple of cuts on <i>That's How We Burn</i> that sound enamored with the nü-garage rock obsession that swept the early aughts, most notably on the album's weakest track, the Mooney Suzuki-sounding opener ""The Stroller"". And the gently stabbed guitar chords and vocal phrasing of ""Thank Us Later"", ""Demon"", and ""Baby I"" are reminiscent of <i>Oh, Inverted World</i>-era Shins.</p>
<p><i>That's How We Burn</i>'s sonic normalcy would all but consign the record for the used record bins if this band didn't sound so damn good when they break out of the mold. They have a way with hooks, and when they up the tempo, they sound like a twangier version of the Buzzcocks' punk-pop heyday (""How's the Grave""), or what would happen if the Soft Pack harbored a crush on XTC (""She's My Baby""). Even when Jaill quiet down, as they do on the acoustic ""Summer Mess"", the melody shifts pace to keep things moving.</p>
<p>Jaill exhibit the most promise on early single ""Everyone's Hip"". The song is pure pop overload, with hook after hook stuffed tightly within drummer Austin Dutmer's taut rhythmic fills. Kircher fits syllable after syllable into his own vocal endurance test, rattling off barely discernible lyrics and at one point breaking into what sounds like Spanish. The song is a weird pleasure, but it wouldn't sound out of place on mid-1990s alt-rock radio either. If they stick to that sound more in the future, it'll go a long way to making them sound more distinctive.</p></div>"|14486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14486-thats-how-we-burn/|6.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

If Teasdale's incarnation as either Jamie Vex'd or Kuedo indicates dubstep's present fixation on lush, sparkly textures, then the tracks on <i>Cloud Seed</i> represent the genre's more aggressive and haunting beginnings. One could place Kuedo's cuts in someone's hotboxed car or at the warm-up stage of a DJ set. The compositions on <i>Cloud Seed</i>, on the other hand, are what one would imagine playing when Skynet unleashes its army of Terminators on the unsuspecting masses.</p>
<p>Big-budget, dystopian, futuristic sci-fi films are not an accidental reference. In an interview with Beatportal, Jamie Vex'd acknowledged such films as <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Aliens</i>, and <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> as major influences on his work. The connection is difficult to overlook, as the alternately thunderous and calm scores of those films are recalled through <i>Cloud Seed</i>'s monolithic beats; violent, enormous bass infestations; and echoed, scraped sound effects. On certain pieces, the drums vanish, only to be replaced with elegiac strings or low frequency, rumbling drones. Few, if any, of the songs here are galvanizing, though they can be invigorating. <i>Cloud Seed</i> conjures a distinct atmosphere of dread, more akin to Nine Inch Nails or the mid-1990s work of Autechre than to the melancholic work of Burial or even the turbulent and rudeboy elements of the Bug.</p>
<p>Vex'd's 2005 debut,  <i>Degenerate</i>, contentiously heralded by some as the first proper dubstep album, exhibits the DNA of the genre's influences: grime, 2-step, jungle. The music on <i>Cloud Seed</i> sheds some of its chromosomes: Where <i>Degenerate</i> is often characterized by busy and condensed percussion, increasing the music's tempo and syncopation, <i>Cloud Seed</i> provides more space between beats, demonstrating dub's spaciousness and languor. But <i>Cloud Seed</i> retains <i>Degenerate</i>'s menace, so that the music is a logical progression, though the differences between are evident.</p>
<p>Vex'd had little role in the assemblage of <i>Cloud Seed</i>-- though they were active in selecting which tracks would be included, the sequencing is almost entirely the work of Mike Paradinas, the managing director of Planet μ Records. He deserves a good deal of credit for the album's cohesion, its unity of purpose, and prominent arc. The opening track, ""Take Time Out"", ruggedly sets the stage, Warrior Queen spitting nails through a lurching beat, piercing digital tones and dingy echoes of percussion. The structure of the album is far from typical, as moodier, enigmatic tracks don't always necessarily follow belligerent ones.

Rifkin's belated epiphany was hardly unique, but he does seem to have learned the smartest lesson from it: that no matter how seriously you take it, the Bible remains one heck of a yarn, its tales and metaphors readily applicable to all facets of life.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rifkin was reportedly inspired by a year of bad news, bad vibes, and setbacks to go back to the beginning-- the very beginning, as in, the Book of Genesis-- to make sense of himself and the world. <i>The Low Hanging Fruit</i>, the second album from his Wailing Wall project, is steeped in spirituality both specific and vague. But this is no Old Country kitsch fest. Rather, Rifkin goes deeper and broader, invoking the Bible as an anchor but opening up beyond the standard Judeo-Christian axis. Influences here include Qawwali drones and Hindu chants to go with his folk-rock echoes of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. To quote Rifkin, he's ""in love with the poetry of the Bible.""</p>
<p>There's an undeniable poetry to Rifkin's words as well, which certainly helps convey the personal nature of this particular musical journey. Admittedly, when it comes to pop culture, religion is the ultimate low-hanging fruit. A sprinkle of theology can easily, lazily convey a hint of import or profoundness even where none exists. But for all its time-tested signifiers, Rifkin's struggle to find meaning in life rings honest and compelling.</p>
<p>What's more impressive than Rifkin's introspective voyage, however, is the confident way he flits from tabla and sitar vibes on ""Bones Become Rainbows"" to the austere guy-with-guitar of ""For C.M.R."" (where he manages to out-nasal Dylan), or from the sunny folk-rock of ""Dandelion"" to the harmonium bliss of ""Fear No Apple, Fear No Flood"". These songs flow together with convincing inspiration. If the results themselves are ultimately less inspiring than they are admirable, that likely has less to do with Rifkin's craft and more to do with the album's meditative nature. After all, he's the one on the road to revelation. We're just the spectators, curious to learn where he finally ends up.</p></div>"|14494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14494-the-low-hanging-fruit/|6.2|Joshua Klein

The digital release of ""Angel Echoes"", the latest single from Four Tet's <i>There Is Love in You</i>, includes ""Angel Echoes"" remixes by Caribou and Jon Hopkins and bundles them together with previously released, vinyl-only remixes of ""Love Cry"" and ""Sing"". The contributors include some of the most interesting names in dubstep and bass music -- Joy Orbison, Roska, Floating Points, Mosca, Hardhouse Banton-- but there are still only three tracks of source material here. Even the sequencing simply bundles the material in batches, although album flow becomes less important in the rip-and-burn era. Commissioned to reflect Four Tet's interests as a club DJ, the tracks are perfect playlist fodder, but the collection isn't something you're likely to listen to front to back.</p>
<p>That said, it's high time that many of these reworks became widely available. Joy Orbison's remix of ""Love Cry"" is nearly as good as his own ""Hyph Mngo"" and possibly even better than his other singles. Somehow, he's managed to convert the rickety disco of the original into something fleet and flickering. Giving Orbison those vocals to work with must have been like offering catnip to a kitten, and he does exactly what you'd expect, looping them into short, insistent bursts. Rearranging the track's core elements according to his own signature, he turns the track into an example of dubstep at its lushest, its lunging, half-time cadence and whipcrack syncopations sounding more urgent than the original.</p>
<p>Three mixes come from the fertile, hard-to-define terrain of the UK funky scene. Roska makes his muscular, sidewinding bass line the star of his ""Love Cry"" remix, using tuned percussion and a DJ Mujava-like synth lead to sketch out the harmonic outlines of the track. Only scraps of the original vocal remain, and they're so abstracted that you might not even recognize them if you heard the record out of context. The track's clean lines and percussive clarity make for an exciting contrast to Four Tet's deliberately swampy aesthetic. Hardhouse Banton, another UK funky producer, offers something more like an edit: His remix of ""Sing"" preserves the structure of the original, content to strengthen the groove with rolling, shuffling percussion (including funky's telltale loping toms, echoes of reggaeton). It's a subtle update, but listen back to the original, also included here, and you'll realize how much force he's given it. Mosca, affiliated with the UK's Night Slugs crew, clearly had a similar idea for his take on ""Sing"", which thrums with grinding, swinging percussion; what's interesting here is to see how Mosca translates Four Tet's swirled and swollen aesthetic to more forceful dance-floor standards, with white-hot hi-hats and syncopated chord stabs lending lean muscle.</p>
<p>""Angel Echoes"", reprised from the album, is all harps and chimes and swooping vocals, quintessentially Four Tet. Caribou, Four Tet's friend and musical peer, adds techno intensity (including triplet pulses inspired by James Holden, a peer of both musicians), but the soaring vocals feel slightly out of place-- too obvious a way of gaining lift, when the chugging momentum beneath would have sufficed. Jon Hopkins, a producer who has worked with Brian Eno and Coldplay, focuses on the music-box intimacy of ""Angel Echoes"", using electric bass and smeary layers of reverb to add depth and heft. It's lovely, but its tempo feels slightly staid in comparison to other tracks on the album.</p>
<p>Four Tet's ""Sing"" also returns from the album, but in an extended version that draws out the seven-minute track to nearly 11. The essential feeling of the track is the same, but it benefits from the added room to move, stretching out the cooing vocals (echoes of Björk) over rattling drum breaks and emphasizing a long, graceful arc. London's Floating Points, one of the most exciting producers to emerge in the past year or so, steps up to the challenge with a 14-minute remix of the track. It begins with a long, lazy intro of sunrise Rhodes and birdsong oscillators before exploding into a great, shuddering mass of synthesizers, voice, and, somewhere in there, a faint glimmer of percussion. It's hard to know what to call it-- house, dubstep, a fusion of the two?-- but ultimately it doesn't matter; like Four Tet, Floating Points obviously knows that some of the most compelling dance music sounds nothing like the standardized formats that inspired it. One of the great things about Four Tet's recent music has been its increasing engagement with house and techno-- while, at the same time, refusing to play by club music's rules. To see Four Tet's idiosyncratic ideas keep filtering into club culture in such unpredictable ways is immensely rewarding.</p></div>"|14509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14509-angel-echoes-remix/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Between 1972 and 1975, the duo of drummer/singer/guitarist Klaus Dinger and guitarist Michael Rother, both of whom had previously played in a short-lived lineup of Kraftwerk, made three albums together. (They were effectively a three-member duo: the contributions of the late producer Conny Plank probably meant as much as Dinger's or Rother's.) They were a new kind of rock band: they stripped away the idea of song and riff, and made texture everything. The first, self-titled Neu! album is as visionary a record as has ever been made. Its opening track ""Hallogallo"" was their manifesto: a single hovering chord, a single beat, rolling forward for 10 minutes that might as well be forever, with tiny variations. Some people called their signature rhythm ""motorik""; Dinger later called it the ""long line.""</p>
<p>Neu! were named after the sort of ""new"" that appeared on grocery-store boxes containing a different version of the same old thing, and 1973's <i>Neu! 2</i> is a visionary stopgap product. ""Für Immer"", which occupies half of the first side, is a souped-up remake of ""Hallogallo""; the second side, generated in a hurry when Dinger and Rother ran out of studio time, is both sides of a single they'd released a bit earlier, plus the same material played at 16 RPM, at 78 RPM, and on a broken tape deck. <i>Neu! 75</i> sounded like the band was on the verge of shaking apart, which it was. (The scalding, Dinger-driven second side, with its two extra drummers, became a touchstone for early punk rock; the floating meditations of the first side weren't too far from the ambient music that Rother's occasional collaborator Brian Eno was devising around the same time.) Rother and Dinger's remarkable musical chemistry was matched by what appears to have been a near-total inability to agree on anything, and after <i>75</i>, they split.</p>
<p>But the break wasn't as clean as it might have been, which is why this vinyl boxed set contains five records instead of three. There's also a Neu! stencil (should you feel like spray-painting their logo on any public buildings), a nice big booklet, and a code that gets you a T-shirt and digital downloads of all the music. The bonus records, though, are the real bait here, and they're not so much missing chapters from the band's history as they are Rother's version of Dinger's cash-ins. In the mid-90s, Dinger released two more albums' worth of his Rother collaborations without Rother's consent. Dinger died in 2008, and now Rother has returned to that material to put his own stamp on it.</p>
<p><i>Neu! '72</i> is a maxi-single with three live-in-the-practice-space jams, edited by Rother from the much longer, murky rehearsal tape that Dinger released as <i>'72 Live</i>. If you've ever wondered if there's any document of the post-first-album lineup that included guitarist Eberhard Kranemann, the answer is ""Yes, there exists such a document."" That's all that can be said for it.</p>
<p>And <i>Neu '86</i>-- that's a tricky one. Rother and Dinger reunited (without Conny Plank) in the mid-80s to see if the old magic was still there, and most of it wasn't. They abandoned the sessions before they finished an album; the digital drums and synth pads they used sound much more dated than anything they'd done a decade-plus earlier. Dinger called his 1995 version of it <i>Neu! 4</i>-- it's been out of print for a good long while and hasn't really been missed. This significantly shorter version has been reworked and ""finished"" by Rother. It sounds like an undercooked, mostly instrumental mid-80s synth-pop album with a mild but pleasant Neu! influence among its Flock of Seagulls-isms.</p>
<p>The booklet that comes with the set is a loose assemblage of photographs, quotations, testimonials, a history of the band, and a bit of critical writing-- a real boon for fans. What it unavoidably presents, though, along with <i>'72</i> and <i>'86</i>, is the Rother perspective on Neu!, in which Dinger was a crucial contributor but alternately an impediment and a loose cannon, and Rother was the one steadfastly working to preserve the glory of their collaboration. As with Dinger's versions of the two discs that deform the band's body of work, this set seems like one side of an argument in which neither side is actually in the right.</p></div>"|14475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14475-neu-box-set/|7.0|Douglas Wolk

Recorded through the internal microphone on a friend's laptop, <i>The Penguin League</i>'s intimacy rendered the youthful exuberance of its overstuffed chamber-pop songs more clearly than radio-ready production ever could've. McKeever &amp; co. sold the CD-R for $6 via their MySpace page and eventually caught the ear of the label arm of London-based club night How Does It Feel to Be Loved?, which gave the album a gently remastered reissue in early 2008.</p>
<p>With a little help from an online fundraising drive, <i>Constellations</i> sees Antarctica Takes It! returning as a comparatively polished indie pop outfit, sharing UK stages this summer alongside the Primitives, Love Is All, Allo Darlin', Shrag, and Tender Trap. This sophomore album adds musical complexity, including the occasional prickle of tropical guitar, while keeping the focus on 1950s-minded ditties built from ukulele, piano, and quirky percussion. Lyrically, the record rejoices in music itself, or else frets over romantic anxieties-- hell, multiple songs compare a romantic interest to music-- although with a rhyming-dictionary plainness that sadly keeps Antarctica Takes It! from matching their peers just yet.</p>
<p>McKeever is an astute student of his genre, and he knows how to put together charming, twee-inclined tracks. That's true whether he's stripping down to the glockenspiel and ukulele of ""Bossa"", which in its esquisitely minimal cutness sharply resembles Japan-based duo Lullatone's avant-twee touchstone ""Bedroom Bossa Band"", or layering his vocals for the endless-summer harmonies of coastal excursion ""Voices"". On the piano-rollicking ""C&amp;F"", McKeever's bookish, lispy voice takes on an enjoyably showy hiccup, the kind of thing descended from Jerry Lee Lewis. More than once, McKeever ends a song with voice-over narration, which works better as a sonic element than it does lyrically; in a few places he's also joined, quite capably, by a pair of similarly understated female vocalists, Maria Schoettler and Rachel Fannan, who bring to mind Stuart Murdoch's God Help the Girl project.</p>
<p>For all of <i>Constellations</i>' homespun craft, it's still a mild disappointment, particularly coming so soon after Allo Darlin' reminded us that there are still great twee-pop songs left unwritten. The dueling strings and crashing sound effects on sock-hop throwback ""Spirit of Love"" are appealingly constructed, but here's a sample lyric: ""I shuddered and shook/ 'Cause into your eyes I could not look."" Sure, the album never gets quite <i>this</i> clumsy again, but nearly every rhyme is as emptily obvious as matching ""birds of a feather"" with ""weather"" (and ""together,"" and ""ever""...). The closest this disc comes to the sharp wit or deep insight of its genre's greats is when McKeever keeps ""thinking everything's a sign/ Misread the stars to make you mine,"" on San Francisco love song ""Straight to Your Heart"". <i>The Penguin League</i> was a promising, good-hearted debut, but it was certainly no <i>Tigermilk</i>; <i>Constellations</i> is a lot closer to recent indie-pop near-misses by Princeton and Lucky Soul than it is to <i>If You're Feeling Sinister.</i></p></div>"|14460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14460-constellations/|5.8|Marc Hogan

Later, she worked as a nanny for Tom Waits' kids. Her songs have been heralded by KCRW's Nic Harcourt and Elbow's Guy Garvey, who took her on tour as an opening act. But recently she moved from California to Manchester, and it is this, perhaps the most mundane aspect of her biography, which turns out to be most crucial, at least in regard to her second album, <i>Hunting My Dress</i>. That transatlantic relocation deeply informs her music, which blends British pastoral folk with earthy American blues and roots traditions. Evoking both the sylvan glen and the swampy delta, Hoop sets lilting melodies against gritty guitar licks, which lope through the songs with dogged repetitions-- as if she's excerpted only a few minutes of an infinite loop. It's a bracing combination of styles, one that underscores the drama of her lyrics and emboldens her idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>There's a disarming personality at work in these songs. How many other musicians would bother to write about hearing a DJ play one of her tunes off her debut? And how many could do so without sounding self-impressed? On ""Angel Mom"", Hoop compares that feeling of professional accomplishment to the joy of her mother coming home: ""I haven't felt that way since I was a child,"" she sings with a measured nostalgia, her voice careening over the syllables softly. Her own past is fodder for these songs, but <i>Dress </i>never sounds beholden to rock history (and certainly not to Manchester's). Rather than simply revive these old British and American styles, Hoop plays around with them, deconstructing and reassembling them in odd ways. She half-raps the verses of ""Four Dreams"" in a child's sing-song melody, then breaks into the kind of carefree chorus Liz Phair has been trying to write for a decade. ""Feast
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of the Heart"" dirties up her vocals to gritty, claustrophobic effect, but she sounds liveliest on the more straightforward songs, especially ""Murder of Birds"", a plaintively acoustic duet with Elbow's Guy Garvey.</p>
<p>Hoop constantly foregrounds her eccentricities on <i>Hunting My Dress</i>, and her plucky precocity can be alienating at times. She begins ""Whispering Light"" with a trill of vocal birdsong-- a strange freak-folk scat-singing that's a questionable introduction and a hurdle to overcome. Her songs veer purposefully into digressions, studiously avoiding verse-chorus-verse structures and twisting themselves into unexpected and not always graceful shapes. The esoteric quality of <i>Hunting My Dress</i> occasionally sounds willful, as if that free-spirited personality were itself a careful construct-- a particularly studious and insistent one. Hoop is an undeniably charismatic musician, but her music will benefit from a more natural and organic absorption of these impulses. In other words, she doesn't need to work so hard to prove anything.</p></div>"|14495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14495-hunting-my-dress/|6.9|Stephen M. Deusner

Scouring average music for hidden value used to be pretty necessary, but those days are gone. When we had to pay for physical albums, we forgave them more and were willing to work to get our money's worth. Now that people often download them for free, they expect deeper and more immediate gratification. The new currency is time, and we're stingier with it than cash.</p>
<p>That <i>Onion</i> headline is tailor-made for the second album by Swedish/American synth-pop band Thieves Like Us. I pretty much hated it at first-- it sounded monotonous and plodding, with track after track of lumbering synth-bass, slurry guitar plinks, watery synths, forgettable vocals, and utilitarian drums. Gradually, some differences and signs of life surfaced and it started to sound... okay. But when there are so many similar, better options available at your fingertips, who's got time for ""okay?""</p>
<p><i>Again and Again</i> alternates between the svelte, moody vibe of breakout single ""Drugs in My Body""-- think of Thieves' namesake, New Order, without all that messy conviction-- and lugubrious dancefloor-clearers. Some of the latter type, like ""Silence"", are inoffensively tuneless; others (""Love Saves"" and ""Mercy"") manage to trudge through some serviceable hooks. It's not a total washout: ""Lover Lover"" has a bounce in its step that's sorely missed elsewhere, and the loping high-contrast groove of ""Shyness"" is a welcome diversion into the Field's territory. The problem is that the songs are written to thrive in deep atmospheres, which the band's stiff and flat sound just doesn't provide.</p>
<p>Be warned that this is one of those records that sounds appalling on iPod earbuds. It's best on speakers, because even on decent headphones, you notice the murkiness of the FX palette more. A light but pervasive dusting of flanger effects and wavy-tuned synths makes the melodies sound cloudy and unfocused. Even the singles don't especially stand out: ""Never Known Love"" just sounds like froggy bass laid over a Boards of Canada track, and ""Forget Me Not"" sparks and sparks without ever reaching the M83-style supernova it hints at. Would one heater have gone amiss, among all these cautious lukewarmers? Thieves Like Us seem out of step with the decadence and hedonism Kitsuné Maison usually favors, often tipping over from depressive to disinterested.</p></div>"|14483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14483-again-and-again/|5.0|Brian Howe

Experimentation in rock music often implies a certain degree of pretentiousness and studiousness, but since their formation 15 years ago, the Super Furries and their offshoots have embraced the anarchic joy in pushing the structural and conceptual parameters of their psychedelic pop songs. So when band leader Gruff Rhys announced that his next extracurricular release would be an album recorded with Brazilian VCR repairman/peace activist Tony Da Gatorra, using his namesake homemade synthesizer/drum-machine contraption, the immediate response wasn't so much ""WTF?"" as ""but of course.""</p>
<p>The byproduct of the South American sojourn captured in Rhys' recent documentary, <i>Separado!--</i> an exploration of his familial roots in Argentina's small Welsh expat community-- <i>The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness</i> diverges sharply from the winsome folk-rock that's defined Rhys' two solo albums to date and the sleek synth-pop of his John Delorean-inspired Neon Neon project, not to mention the Super Furries' grand, progged-out epics. This is lo-fi electro-punk done favela-style, on the cheap and on the fly. (Recording reportedly took all of five hours.) The operative word here is the ""vs."" separating the two principals' names on the album cover: The songs on <i>The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness</i> share the same rudiments-- Rhys' nastily distorted guitar riffs and the skeletal click tracks produced by Tony's Gatorra-- but given that the songwriting is split evenly between two guys from very different backgrounds who don't speak the same language, their respective contributions contrast considerably.</p>
<p>Sonically, the album is of a piece with the earliest home-recording excursions of Ween and Royal Trux, wherein the tinny resonance of the synthetic rhythms and the phased-out fuzz of the guitars bleed into the same cacophonous frequency. But even in these harsh environs, Rhys' melodic graces still shine through: It's not hard to imagine the robot rock of ""In a House With No Mirrors (You'll Never Get Old)"" and the T. Rexy ""Oh Warra Hoo!"" being used as raw demos for future SFA elaboration. Da Gatorra's Portuguese-sung compositions, however, are far more demanding, and not just on account of the language barrier. According to the accompanying press materials, Da Gatorra's message is one of peaceful protest and the inevitable triumph of good over evil, but his delivery is far more caustic than such hippie-centric platitudes would suggest.</p>
<p>Not being a naturally gifted singer or songwriter, Da Gatorra opts for circular sing-speak rants-- positing him as something of a Brazillian Mark E. Smith-- whose repeated refrains provide some semblance of structure but are prone to rambling on arbitrarily past the five-minute mark. There are certainly moments on ""O Que Tu Tem"" and ""Voz Dos Semterra"" where you can hear Rhys' guitar playfully joust with Da Gatorra's stream of verbiage, and you get a genuine sense of two new friends with different tongues devising their own unique mode of communication. But with most of Da Gatorra's tracks locked into minimal, metronomic beats, and precious little in the way of discernible melody or groove to latch onto, there's no compelling reason for non-Portuguese-speaking listeners to revisit them. When Rhys reemerges late in the album for the cool, Suicide-styled Parisian-protest salute ""6868"", you're not so much appreciative of the change in pace as left wondering how exactly these songs are supposed to relate to one another. <i>The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness</i> may attempt to forge a common ground between two trans-Atlantic artists, but even when working from the same instrumental base, the sensibilities at play here are still oddly segregated.</p></div>"|14489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14489-the-terror-of-cosmic-loneliness/|5.6|Stuart Berman

They had an underground classic debut, <i>Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1</i>, that most people outside of Detroit couldn't even hear until nearly 10 years later. Their potential major-label big break, <i>Fantastic Vol. 2</i>, went into two years of stasis after A&amp;M was bought out by Universal. Then came the fanbase-splitting personnel change albums: Producer/MC Jay Dee (aka J Dilla) went to do his Soulquarians thing and was replaced by up-and-coming rapper eLZhi and a scattered collection of beatmakers for 2002's <i>Trinity (Past, Present and Future)</i>; shortly afterwards Baatin left the group for personal health reasons and left T3 as Slum Village's only remaining founding member. And yet they soldiered on long enough to put out a fine album, 2005's <i>Slum Village</i>, that did justice to the original strain of club-compatible underground hip-hop that defined both them and their city.</p>
<p>And because life isn't fair, it was their last album to date. Dilla passed away in 2006 at the peak of his creativity, Baatin died in 2009 in the midst of a planned SV reunion. eLZhi went solo with 2008's <i>The Preface</i>, T3 pulled guest-spot duties here and there, and that was presumably that. Except that late last year, Slum Village released the <i>Villa Manifesto EP</i>-- not just as some collection of outtakes and scraps, but as a precursor for an entirely new album. And unlikely as it might seem after all that the group has gone through, the full-length actually picks up more or less where they left off in 2005. Most tracks incorporate the memory of Dilla and Baatin seamlessly while keeping the current lyrical core of T3 and eLZhi focused.</p>
<p>In this case, the focus is on their typical anthemic forcefulness, less concerned with lyrical dexterity than with letting their voices resonate. Granted, whenever eLZhi's involved, there's never a lack of slick lyricism. But aside from El's expert turns on the mic, the strength comes from how authoritative they sound, how their voices push ordinary-on-paper lyrics into performances that demand and get listener attention. There are moments of brilliance-- Baatin's verbal sparring with his inner demons and T3's relating the frustration of his downtime on ""The Reunion Pt. 2"" chief among them-- but even their less memorable verses benefit from no-bullshit flows that ride beats as naturally as walking. And whether they're laying out lurid storytelling rhymes or for-the-ladies tracks, they're evocative and personable enough to make complaints about lyrical simplicity seem irrelevant. That said, nothing helps you appreciate Dilla's modest mic skills more than hearing Illa J haltingly trying to evoke his brother; dude isn't a charity case or anything, but it feels like he's mostly on this album for closure purposes.</p>
<p>A lot of goodwill for an album like this is going to ride on its beats, since they're traditionally the reason more skeptical listeners checked for Slum Village albums in the first place. Longtime collaborator Young RJ, whose increased role in Slum Village's production style over the last few albums helped define SV's sound in their post-Jay Dee phase, handles most of the production. Of course, there are a couple of quality Dilla beats here, like the twitchy but heavy funk guitar oomph of ""Lock It Down"" and the hot-glue prog synthesizers of ""We'll Show You"". But RJ's pieces stand up admirably next to them, whether they're familiar sounds (neo-Soulquarian homages ""Scheming"" and ""2000 Beyond"") or oddball left turns (the kazoo-driven ""Earl Flinn""). It's such a cohesive production job on RJ's part that when another producer's track goes a bit off the path-- like ""Don't Fight the Feeling/Daylight"" spot-welding Mr. Porter's ""B.B.E. (Big Booty Express)""-esque electro burbles to T3's pseudo-diwali-- it feels strikingly out of place, even if it sounds pretty decent.</p>
<p>T3's gone back and forth on whether this will be the last Slum Village album, presumably depending on whether or not the market and the fanbase will it so. But while it's not the best work of their long, hectic career, it's still its own kind of special-- a fractured crew reunited, even if it's under tragic circumstances. And it might be a reluctant farewell anyways. Instead of sounding like a weary to-hell-and-back statement of scarred perseverance, <i>Villa Manifesto</i> sounds unreservedly alive, a celebration of careers well spent.</p></div>"|14490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14490-villa-manifesto/|7.1|Nate Patrin

Their 2005 self-titled LP had moments of appealing post-twee rock (think PAS/CAL's more Guitar Hero-y moments), even if the back half was clogged with too many plodding tracks. But the band continued with the latter direction on 2007's <i>Those the Brokes</i>, with an increasingly uneven ratio of solid cuts to flat-out bricks. It makes sense, then, that their third album, <i>The Runaway</i>, would try for something completely different. Here, they shuffle through one stylistic experiment after another. The fingerprint on the album's cover art seems a little ironic, since for the first time, the Magic Numbers seem hard to identify.</p>
<p>The best cuts are the ones reminiscent of highlights from their other albums, where they pair light melodies and energetic arrangements with big-hearted sentiments. ""A Start with No Ending"" contains a delicious riff seemingly piped in from Big Star's <i>Radio City</i> days. The deceptively simple ""Sound of Something"" builds and builds, exploding like soft-focus fireworks every time the chorus finishes. And ""The Song That No One Knows"" does well by a slowed-down soft rock motif and AM radio strings, while the rolling space-rock of ""Hurt So Good"" brings to mind the good old days of <i>The Man Who</i>-era Travis.</p>
<p>The highlights are spread out, meaning you have to cut through a lot of chaff like the tepid Fleetwood Mac-isms of ""Why Did You Call?"" or the hollow British folk of ""Restless River"" to get to them. And the genre exercises interspersed throughout feel misguided, suggesting that even if the Magic Numbers have an understanding of the sounds they're attempting to emulate, they lack the songwriting chops to bring them to life. Like on ""The Pulse"", which goes for symphonic schmaltz and ends up uncomfortably discordant and mismatched, with every melodic turn bleating against the song's misplaced string parts. Or the dismal-sounding ""I'm Sorry"", where Romeo Stodart's voice barely breaks a whimper amongst ill-placed elements like snatches of piano, an irregular bass line, wheezing harmonica, and saxophone stabs. The several minutes of orchestral nonsense tacked on as a ""bonus track"" feel unearned. For those of us who have been waiting for this band to realize how good they can truly be, it hasn't happened yet.</p></div>"|14477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14477-the-runaway/|4.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's no wonder that the Midwest harbors a ton of bands shot through with desperation and urgency, but what's instantly notable about Secret Cities' debut, <i>Pink Graffiti</i>, is how it unintentionally mirrors flyover country's pace of life despite never mentioning it by name: it's unhurried, friendly, and welcoming of anyone who chooses to stop by, without being particularly pushy.</p>
<p>That's not to say it's lazy or lacks urgency. But as a whole, Secret Cities' aesthetic harkens to a more relaxed time in indie rock, away from its buzzy and busy synth-heavy present and relentless conveyance of new music. Secret Cities all but send mash notes to the 90s rosters of K, Merge, or Matador throughout this record. As with the earlier work of similarly minded throwbacks like LAKE or the Rosebuds, Secret Cities manage to make chipper co-ed harmonies, acoustic jangle, and toy-like instrumental accents sound damn near subversive in their innocence. On swinging opener ""Pink City"", Charlie Gokey sings, ""we had a lot to say, but it would take all day,"" a pretty accurate mission statement for an album that's got all manner of instrumental bric-a-brac but never really makes a point of stressing its bustle. I suppose that a song called ""Slacker"" is a bit too on-the-nose considering <i>Pink Grafitti</i>'s ambling vibe, but indeed, the best moments aren't usually set to words and often feel effortless: It's hard to imagine the sighing chorus on the skittering ""Color"" or the whistled melody that ties ""Boyfriends"" together coming from an arduous studio session as opposed to a front porch, while rippled piano instrumental ""Wander"" is a spot-on tribute to the Microphones' <i>The Glow, Pt. 2.</i></p>
<p>But as down-to-earth as Secret Cities can be, at points you wish they'd be more direct: ""Vamos a La Playa"" and ""The End"" play so loosely, they border on disintegration, rounding out <i>Pink </i><i>Graffiti</i> in overly cloudy manner, both sonically and lyrically. It's something of a disappointment since they can flex intriguing muscles-- see the fuzzed guitar soloing of ""Aw Rats"" or the insistent thump of ""Pink <span>Graffiti</span> Part 1"". So while <i>Pink </i><i>Graffiti</i> might be the sound of a young group still trying to figure themselves out, you can forgive Secret Cities for not coming on too strongly.  I suppose that's just in accordance with their ol'-fashioned values.</p></div>"|14496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14496-pink-graffiti/|6.6|Ian Cohen

Led by Canadian composer/producer/multi-instrumentalist Greg Jarvis, they draw from the dynamics of My Bloody Valentine (for whom they opened in 2008), the darkness of the Velvet Underground, and the astral expansiveness of Spiritualized. <i>Come Hell or High Water</i>, the group's second LP and first with an official American release, nicely balances the cerebral and the emotional.</p>
<p>Jarvis developed the album as an expression of his own synesthesia, a neurological condition in which sufferers perceive mixed sensations (e.g., can see sounds or hear shapes). In making music that is supposed to express the feeling of actually seeing the notes, Jarvis has meticulously crafted pieces (some of these tracks lack the cohesion to be called ""songs"") that might make you feel like you've have turned on your mp3 software's visualizer. Notes appear out of the ether like mysterious starbursts and then vanish just as quickly; this music, painstakingly created by 30 musicians in over 40 sessions in six cities, bleeds out from a center point, carefully shaping notes from silence.</p>
<p>There is no easy way to describe <i>Come Hell or High Water</i>. This is not sing-along music (there are barely any discernable vocals anyway), nor is it an intellectual exercise to be enjoyed only by other musicians. There is an overall feeling of lightness and geometry to the album, but each track stakes out its own emotional territory and visual landscape. There are deep, belly-rumbling drones that give way to ""Heroin""-like sawed strings and accelerated percussion (""Pipe Dreams"") and languid forays into humble, acoustic folk-rock that end enveloped by noisy squalls of feedback (""Darklands""). There are moments that sound like strange calls to prayer in sandy far-away lands (""The Invocation"") and moments when a bluesy harmonica evolves into a symphonic swell (album opener ""Opus 66 Pt. 1""). There are also tracks that are so minimal and grow so slowly that they feel like whispery manifestations of ephemeral elements like smoke or wind (like the improbably named ""Forest of Noise"").</p>
<p>If there is something perhaps a tad conservative about some of the tracks, if they hew a bit too closely to the tropes of old-fashioned chamber music or linger too long in the realm of traditional arrangements, their use of silence or stinging noise mollifies the predictability. In trying to make his audience understand what his synesthesia feels like, Jarvis becomes something of a magician, granting us the power to hear what music looks like to him, if only for a short time. More often than not, the illusion is convincing.</p></div>"|14479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14479-come-hell-or-high-water/|6.9|Rebecca Raber

Best Coast's full-length debut, <i>Crazy for You</i>, serves only to increase that distance from the outré-music scene; the brief record delivers on the promise of a strong string of singles released over the past year. Just as Pocahaunted loosely capture the basic feel of dub and reggae, <i>Crazy for You</i> is a meditation on the stickier hooks of classic indie pop, with slight detours into surf-rock (""Bratty B"") and countrypolitan balladry (""Our Deal""). While Pocahaunted cover their signifiers under piles of static and delay-triggered noise, Best Coast take the opposite route, slathering honey over every song and letting them drip-dry in the sunshine.</p>
<p>The record's overall gorgeousness has a whole lot to do with Cosentino's voice, which hits every pitch with equal clarity and intention of tone. Good thing, too, since <i>Crazy For You</i> is an especially vocal-heavy record; excluding the bonus track ""When I'm With You"", there are few moments here where Cosentino's voice isn't featured. She backs herself wordlessly, fills in non-verbal gaps (especially in the California-highway chorus of ""When the Sun Don't Shine""), and repeats simple sentiments like mantras (""I wish he was my boyfriend,"" ""I want you so much,"" ""That's not your deal, that's not my deal"").</p>
<p>That last function has become a sticking point for many who complain that, as a lyricist, Cosentino lacks a certain depth and overall intelligence. It's true that she's not exactly the Randy Newman of the beach-pop game-- there's a few too many ""crazy/lazy"" rhyme schemes, and feel free to snicker at the ""I wish my cat could talk"" line from ""Goodbye"". But it's easy to miss that, just as these songs are relatively basic in construction, she's never aimed for any sort of lyrical grandiosity-- just feelings, presented as straightforwardly as possible.</p>
<p>Simply put, she knows what she's doing-- and, lo and behold, there's more lyrical complexity to this record than a fault-seeking light listen would glean. Just when you think you've gotten the point of ""Boyfriend"", Cosentino flips the script and reveals that she isn't just envious-- she feels inadequate, too: ""The other girl is not me/ She's prettier and skinnier/ She has a college degree/ I dropped out when I was 17."" In ""The End"", she verges on nihilistic, admitting in the song's chorus that she'll ruin it all permanently for temporary wish fulfillment: ""You say that/ We're just friends/ But I want this/ Till the end."" She's not being submissive or simple-minded-- she's being honest, and regardless of sweeping appeal, it's endearing that she puts herself out there instead of throwing on some sunglasses and using irony as UV protection.</p>
<p>""Endearing"" is the key word that comes to define <i>Crazy for You</i>; while most of the guitar-based indie pop that's made waves over the past few years has been characterized by scenester antagonism and attempts to fit in (Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, Beach Fossils), this record is carefree and instantly likable-- even if it doesn't seem to care what you think of it. Just as you don't have to be into bong rips and strains of Indo to laugh at Cosentino's 140-character riffs on Katy Perry and <i>True Blood</i>, even the least indie-inclined of listeners can find plenty to love here. It may be a summer album by design (I mean, for Christ's sake-- that <i>cover</i>), but I'll place my bet that <i>Crazy for You</i> will sound pretty great all damn year, and beyond.</p></div>"|14472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14472-crazy-for-you/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

The success of the London duo's <i>A Brief History of Love</i> proved there was still a demand for those bygone qualities-- anthemic choruses, stadium-rattling drums, and a cosmic grandeur-- that made the Verve's <i>Urban Hymns</i> a late-1990s totem. Alas, those qualities were at a premium on the Verve's own unfocused 2008 comeback effort, <i>Forth</i>. Whether or not singer Richard Ashcroft was taking notes on his Big Pink progeny, he's responded to Verve v. 3.0's aborted mission with an album of excitable, populist electro-soul. But if <i>Forth</i> sounded like a half-hearted attempt to recapture the early Verve's free-form spirit, Ashcroft's maiden voyage with his new band, RPA &amp; the United Nations of Sound, is sunk by a grating, calculated over-eagerness to please.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>United Nations of Sound</i>, it becomes increasingly clear that the Verve's recurring cycle of make-ups and break-ups probably has less to do with the notoriously thorny relationship between Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe, and more to do with providing Ashcroft with a rebirth narrative for his subsequent solo ventures. Just as his 2000 solo debut, <i>Alone With Everybody</i>, hinged on the leaf-turning track ""Brave New World"", <i>United Nations of Sound</i> arrives with a Sunday-school sermon's worth of resurrection rhetoric that conflates Ashcroft's return with that of J.C. himself.</p>
<p>Ashcroft's next coming is heralded by dense, busy productions-- courtesy of Kanye West associate No ID-- that draw as much from the slow-jam grind of modern R&amp;B and the six-string squeal of 1980s hair-metal as the lush 70s orchestro-soul that the singer favors. Yet for all of Ashcroft's messianic posturing, these songs are all dressed up with nothing to say. The initially momentous opener ""Are You Ready""-- essentially the Verve's ""Bittersweet Symphony"" cross-wired with Primal Scream's ""Loaded""-- has already played its hand halfway through its six-minute run, leaving Ashcroft to repeat variations on the title ad nauseum before yielding to an inconsequential extended guitar solo. Elsewhere, he sounds like he's expending more energy on investing every ad-libbed ""ooh"" and ""yeah"" with forced profundity than on his songwriting-- on two tracks (""Born Again"", ""This Thing Called Life"") he lazily opts out of completing a four-line stanza to let out a phlegmy ""aaahhhnnn."" And this is to say nothing of the songs that turn out to be every bit as ill-advised as their titles (the chest-pumping tech-rocker ""Beatitudes"", the toothless John Lee Hooker rip ""How Deep Is Your Man"").</p>
<p>Ashcroft's most affecting songs-- from ""The Drugs Don't Work"" to ""On Your Own"" to ""Make It Till Monday""-- were borne of personal but easily relatable experiences. He's still capable of dignified, understated performances (see: the string-swirled ""Good Lovin'""), but on <i>United Nations of Sound</i>, he too often tries to take the fast track to universal appeal, routinely dropping blank-slate slogans-- ""this is the universal language, this is music!""; ""Out of the old/ Into the new""; ""One life! One nation! Music! Dedication!""-- that, in their fervent desire to speak to everyone, speak to no one. ""All together now,"" Ashcroft commands of us during a ""Hey Jude""-style ""na na na na na"" breakdown in ""Born Again""-- but that extra encouragement serves only to remind us of a time when Ashcroft didn't need to prod us to sing along with him.</p></div>"|14488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14488-united-nations-of-sound/|3.2|Stuart Berman

You hear one record, and it leads to your listening to five others because of who's on them. There are entry points and major landmarks that everyone ought to hear. A lot of curious listeners who start out in rock do this-- it's fun and relatively easy. Finding your way into modern jazz is much tougher. For one thing, there are dozens of strains, and a lot of the good stuff in the progressive vein isn't built around familiar, singable tunes like ""Autumn Leaves"" or ""My Favorite Things"". Jazz has had its cerebral qualities since the 1920s, but super-heady composition and playing have become central to forward-looking jazz, partly as a reaction to its becoming less a mainstream music and more of a world populated by enthusiasts. So where do you start? How about right here? <i>Dual Identity</i> is the result of a quintet session led by saxophonists Rudresh Mahanthappa and Steve Lehman, and it embodies a lot of the exciting, bracing playing and ideas coursing through progressive jazz circles.</p>
<p>Mahanthappa and Lehman are, to put it bluntly, two of the finest saxophonists going. They've each built styles from a patchwork of inspirational sources, including each other. Mahanthappa, an American, has blended his Indian heritage into his unique style through his studies with Kadri Gopalnath, a player who managed to adapt the sax into the Carnatic tradition of Indian classical music. Lehman played in Anthony Braxton's band at 22 and studied with Jackie McLean, and his style broadly bridges bop and free-jazz sensibilities. Together on this record, they are a force to be reckoned with, leading a dual attack that's often jaw-dropping, as their rhythm section of guitarist Liberty Ellman, bassist Matt Brewer, and drummer Damion Reid sympathetically bends itself to their will.</p>
<p>The two eschew unison playing and straight harmonizing in favor of a double lead style that lets their distinct voices on the instrument sing at once-- it's amazing that they never clash. ""Circus"" opens with a quiet but jagged groove, and both saxophonists launch in at once, playing an intricate, rhythmically varied counterpoint that gradually unspools into an improvised duet. It's like a conversation in a Woody Allen movie, where everyone has the perfect rejoinder or seems to know the next word out of someone else's mouth. But it's not just a two-way conversation. Reid and Brewer talk their way through beats that alternately swing and flay, while Ellman is an accomplished and idiosyncratic soloist in his own right, and he gets his chances to shine here as well. His solo on ""SMS"" is brilliantly weird, as the rest of the band drops out and he takes a circuitous route through the various tonalities represented in the composition.</p>
<p>So yes, <i>Dual Identity</i> is a great entry into progressive jazz. It's not an easy listen, but its intensity and invention go some distance to open the record up to listeners who aren't up on the genre. Fans of progressive jazz will find a trove of riches to dive into here as well. We won't get a history of contemporary jazz for some time, and the era of jazz stars known outside the jazz world is mostly over, but Mahanthappa and Lehman seem likely to find themselves well-ensconced in that future history, and this record shows why.</p></div>"|14473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14473-dual-identity/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Bob Dylan is the totem example, but everyone from Conor Oberst to Dizzee Rascal has made bold, stirring moves. Even the failures-- usually frequent-- are interesting and fun. Jimmy Edgar was discovered by Warp at 18 in 2001, and he's spent the last decade developing the kind of résumé you might expect from a Detroiter who was playing raves at 15. His work is dotted with hard electro, funk, hip-hop, and raunchy pop. Edgar's <i>XXX</i>, only his second full-length album and first for !K7, is not fun and, more importantly, it's not very interesting.</p>
<p><i>XXX</i> sounds like strip-club music made by someone who, well, <i>really loves</i> strip clubs. This is not a surprise from an artist whose most famous track is ""I Wanna Be Your STD"". To put it another way: <i>XXX</i> sounds like what Lords of Acid album covers look like. <i>XXX</i> has attraction, sex, fucking, some afterglow, but it's uncomfortably entitled and vain. ""Hot, Raw, Sex"" isn't about hot, raw sex, per se, it's about what Edgar considers such an experience to be. The song's mantra: ""We had/ What I call/ Hot, raw sex."" What are Edgar's standards for hot, raw sex? We don't know!</p>
<p>Edgar has often bristled at those who refer to his music as electronic, and he might finally have a point: Though the source instruments remain analog keyboards and computers, <i>XXX</i> is a fairly straight pop-funk album. He's probably taking aim at Prince, and sometimes he gets there: the slow-winding groove of ""Physical Motion"", the pillow keys and spacey funk of ""Midnite Fone Call"". More often he finds Prince's weirdo offspring: David Banner's whisper-porn on ""Push"", the brainy thwump of Mu (minus the heavy psychosis) on ""In My Color"".</p>
<p>In interviews, Edgar is confrontational, declarative, and tactless. Describing his favorite festival moment in an <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?740"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with Resident Advisor</a>, Edgar said, ""I've got video tape of black security guards booty dancing to my set at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival a few years ago. Then it pans to a one-armed break dancer, spinning on his nub."" This kind of reckless confidence-- that of a person who was declared a musical force at such a young age-- bleeds into <i>XXX</i>. The album feels haughty and off-putting even when its influences (frequently) and execution (less so) are on-point. We expect roadbumps with prodigies, but Edgar should be encouraged to fail more charmingly next time.</p></div>"|14491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14491-xxx/|4.4|Andrew Gaerig

Acts such as Emeralds, Black to Comm, Ben Frost, and Oneohtrix Point Never all rely primarily on electronics, but high-level drones can still be made with just guitar, bass, and drums. Exhibit A would be Robedoor, who after years of pedal-pushing have put rock instruments at the center of their noise. Even more trad-leaning is Heavy Winged. The trio's long-form jams recall rock-damaged droners like the Dead C and Bardo Pond, yet they're as forward-looking as any of the acts above.</p>
<p><i><span>Fields Within Fields</span></i><span> continues the big, cavernous din that Heavy Winged have honed via <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Heavy+Winged"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">numerous releases</a> over the past four years. But this is the first time they've made major use of overdubs rather than hammering out one-take improvisations. The result is denser and more detailed than previous work. Tactile sounds and thick noises shift like tectonic plates and hurtle like storm clouds. All the guitar feedback and bass rumble is punctuated by the rolling commas and crashing exclamation points of drummer Jed Bindeman. It's impressive to hear the trio build such density using such simple tools.</span></p>
<p><span>Most of that density comes in ""Among the Maori"", the 16-minute track that occupies side one. Everything Heavy Winged do well--siren-like noise, enveloping ambience, jazzy psych-- is on display. The title's reference to the New Zealand Moari tribe could also be an allusion to that country's greatest primitive drone outfit, the Dead C. You can hear echoes of that group's most expansive forays, like ""Driver UFO"" or ""Helen Said This"", in Heavy Winged's drifting racket. Side two's lone piece, ""The Hum of the Universe"", is more esoteric. Its slow repetitions can be an endurance test, though they do evoke the early drones of Earth and, with the addition of viola by Bob Jones, the minimalist din of Tony Conrad. Think of ""Among the Maori"" as the side for every drone fan, and ""The Hum of the Universe"" as the side for hardcore addicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Said addicts will also be satiated by <i>Infinite in Every Direction, </i>a two-track CD included with early pre-orders of <i>Fields Within Fields. </i>It's a strong piece of work on its own, with ""Forty Fourth Parallel"" (made during the same sessions as the proper LP) retaining the kaleidoscopic feel of ""Among the Maori"". A section of bassy echo and whirring grind at the end is a deft mix of moods-- eerie and blissful, static and kinetic, elegiac and hopeful-- and a reminder that even the simplest drones can contain multitudes.</span></p></div>"|14493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14493-fields-within-fields/|7.2|Marc Masters

When they emerged, they built all their songs using their own software. The approach worked really well, resulting in a wildly creative debut LP, <i>I Am the Fun Blame Monster</i>. But the band refused to let the process become the point, and seven years later, on their third album (not counting <i>Under an Hour</i>), you have to listen carefully to even detect the modular, mix-and-match method the band still employs in the studio. <i>Mines</i>, more than any of their previous work, really sounds like the trio did as much conventional songwriting as jamming, looping, and editing.</p>
<p>It's a direction Menomena hinted at on 2007's <i>Friend and Foe</i>, but here they seem to have evolved into a band much more at ease with itself, and consequently a lot less preoccupied with blowing your head off  every eight bars. Granted, the hyperactive creativity of their first two albums was part of charm and excitement, but the low-key <i>Mines</i> is a welcome change of pace. While it's less immediate, with time it reveals a wealth of details and surprises on par with the band's other albums. Lyrically, the band seems particularly concerned with carrying on in spite of vulnerability, inadequacy, and age, sounding all the more unsettled amid the confident music.</p>
<p>In fact, I've never spent so much time poring over the lyrics to a Menomena record. The album's loudest, most uptempo song, ""Taos"", features a charging chorus built around the line, ""I'm not the most cocksure guy,"" plunked right into a narrative of mutual, drunk seduction-- the narrator keeps voicing his doubts even as his actions are confident and  even aggressive. Elsewhere, they've applied the modular approach they use for their instruments to the voices, finding a multitude of ways to harmonize, combine, and recombine the ""and nothing sounds appealing"" refrain from ""Tithe"". And the instrumental touches are often clever-- there's a little sax figure that pretty much makes the whole rhythm track of ""Bote"", and the chunks of ascending piano that pop up in just the right places on ""Oh Pretty Boy, You're Such a Big Boy"" keep the song moving every time it hits a pause. Brent Knopf's mini synth solo is a welcome surprise, too.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Menomena such a consistently great band on record is that, regardless of how they're arranging their sounds, they know how to balance them in a mix so that the listener can feel the spatial relationships between them. There's a lot of room for your ear to roam on <i>Mines</i>, and it reveals itself over the course of a few listens as a very satisfying album worth exploring and revisiting. I spent one spin just focusing on Danny Seim's drums-- they seem to have picked up their drum recording technique from Led Zeppelin or the Flaming Lips, and the beats on this record consequently sound huge. It works surprisingly well for a relatively modest album that leaves the high-concept art behind in favor of a simple poster and works within the band's already established range rather than stabbing out into new territory.</p></div>"|14463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14463-mines/|8.2|Joe Tangari

Or like minute 45 of ""Dark Star"". Or maybe Fela Kuti slowed down to a crawl, rolled out, and spread into infinity. Cameron Stallones-- also of Magic Lantern-- has been tinkering with his amniotic dub for a few albums now, but nothing he's done yet has quite matched the inward-gazing expanse of <i>On Patrol</i>. Here, Stallones' muggy psych-trance is given space and time-- almost 75 minutes-- to stretch out, simmer, deepen. The results are panoramic, dizzyingly huge.</p>
<p>Most of Stallones' compositions consist of a circular, undulating guitar line, repeated over a sweltering backdrop, with the occasional chanty, muffled vocal rising out of the ether. A Californian himself, Stallones' music is heavily informed by music from warm climes-- dub, desert rock of both the African and SoCal varietals, raga, the aforementioned Afrobeat. As the name Sun Araw suggests, free jazz plays a role too, although Stallones' elastic tunes are more collective consciousness than collective improvisation. These songs, long as they get, never feel less than carefully considered, even as they round the bend on minute 15. And <i>On Patrol</i> is truly psychedelic, an otherwordly, bleary around the edges, unusually transfixing at its core, journey-through-the-self kind of deal. It's never jarring, but it sure does get heavy.</p>
<p><i>On Patrol</i> is better the deeper it gets, its rippling, gurgling landscapes and Stallones' snaky guitar intertwining over as many minutes as it takes: with time it grows more vivid, moving from mesmeric to narcotic. Textures change, but tempos rarely do; you don't so much listen to <i>On Patrol</i> as get ensconced in it, and while it does sit nicely in the background, its chemtrail churn is difficult to ignore for too long. 75 minutes of cascading ambient psych is a commitment, to be sure, but despite its length and leisurely pace, <i>On Patrol</i> manages to keep shapeshifting, from the bleeding synths of ""Deep Cover"" to the k-hole Hendrix of ""Dimension Alley"" and the Godzilla ripple of ""The Stakeout"". Stallones continues to prove himself an unusually gifted sonic architect, and the songs that comprise <i>On Patrol</i> are his most evocative, elaborate structures yet.</p></div>"|14480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14480-on-patrol/|8.1|Paul Thompson

His band combines the kind of no-nonsense bar rock of the Stones and the Replacements with the easygoing left coast blur of Weezer and Pavement. If, over the course of their three LPs, people have been trying to peg Los Angeles' The Henry Clay People as a sort of California Hold Steady, it's understandable. Siara's got a certain way with the pen; his wit can be sly, slightly acerbic, his delivery conversational, his phrasing often clever, his rare joke funny. But, bound together in song, all that can feel like a bit of a jumble; his travelogues and character sketches lack a certain attention to detail and too rarely cohere into much beyond quips and overstatements. It comes off not like Finn's tableau-settlng scene reports, but rather the fake Craig Finn lyrics Twitter: fitfully clever, admirable in their intent, but not quite the real deal.</p>
<p>""We were working part time all the time,"" the leadoff phrase of <i>Golden Coast</i>'s best tune, is a nimble enough turn-of-phrase; ""I was fine; I was broke but still alive, I was fine,"" from the chorus, isn't. And there's no shortage of these gradiose catch-alls that don't stand up to much inspection: ""You can't fake the fireworks / you remember how your fire works,"" or the especially dire ""Dreaming, it was just one part of your rock'n'roll heart."" He's sharp enough to largely avoid cliche-- last few quoted lines notwithstanding-- but he's still quick to pen a scene without providing the requisite details,  to throw in a few characters with giving them much in the way of motivation. A line here or there stands out, but Siara seems to have trouble getting much going at the verse level, and many of <i>Golden Coast</i>'s songs play themselves out without sticking.</p>
<p>It doesn't help matters that the People are a competent but not particularly distinguished musical unit; their garage rock bluster and more straightahead, sunny guitar pop gives Siara's lyrics more than enough room, but it all manages to feel fairly interchangeable (and certainly derivative) over the course of these songs. And Siara's voice, always a tad strained-sounding, simply isn't as expressive as these lyrics could stand; one gets the feeling some of these lines might work out a little better were he a little more dexterous in shouting them out. Really, though, it's the words themselves that don't convey a distinct personality or cohere into their intended portraiture; at best, Siara manages snapshots. <i>Golden Coast</i>'s unimaginative sonics and Siara's spotty penmanship keep the record from reaching the heights of its obvious influences-- an okay listen, but a desultory reminder of better records.</p></div>"|14481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14481-somewhere-on-the-golden-coast/|5.2|Paul Thompson

They began in Brooklyn in 2002 under the name Perfect Salvation Initiation, which became PSI, then pee-ess-eye, and finally their current moniker. Those changes may seem trivial, but they're kind of like the group's music, which constantly changes shape without losing its essence. Noise, jazz, metal, electronica, psych, and folk drift through their work, in combinations that blur such labels. Yet as hard as it is to tag Peeesseye, it's pretty easy to recognize them in every sound they make.</p>
<p>That's probably because, unlike many experimental groups, Peeesseye have never been a rotating collective. Though they've pursued numerous side projects and collaborations, Chris Forsyth, Jaime Fennelly, and Fritz Welch have been the only members from the start. On their seventh full-length, <i>Pestilence &amp; Joy</i>, the instinctive communication the trio has developed is obvious. This might be their most consistent record yet-- chiming guitar chords, subtle drones, and heavy beats pop up in almost every track. There are moments of unruly splatter, but for the most part the album deals in a kind of symphonic minimalism, using repetition to transform simple sounds into tense atmospheres.</p>
<p>This effect is clearest on ""HHH"", whose big crashes and howls land somewhere between an opera and a horror movie. But it also shows up on less dramatic pieces, like the freewheeling ""See, Let Us""-- imagine a basement version of Boredoms' <i>Super æ</i>-- or ""Zoltan Redux"", whose acoustic strums approach the bombast of a Glenn Branca composition. This may all sound a little dogmatic, but Peeesseye never lets their approach get predictable. The trio sounds as open to happy accidents as they were when they first started playing together. It helps that <i>Pestilence &amp; Joy </i>is an amalgam of studio material and live recordings, woven into narrative shapes much the way John Fell Ryan molds Excepter's raw material into loose songs.</p>
<p>Peeesseye have something else in common with Excepter-- a tendency to confound expectations in ways that can confuse even their peers. On <i>Pestilence &amp; Joy</i>, the surprise comes at the end. One band member jokingly berates a Swiss crowd-- ""How come no one in Switzerland knows how to clap?""-- and goads them into rhythmic applause. The band turns that clapping into the beat of the title track, which winds from folky sing-along to surreal samples to ranting sermons. The song is an odd mix of serious drama and arch comedy-- not exactly what you'd expect from an album of improvised experiments. But it does sound like Peeesseye, and at this point that matters a lot more.</p></div>"|14487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14487-pestilence-joy/|7.5|Marc Masters

As Blue Giant, they do pretty much the same thing, except this time they add some rootsy elements: acoustic guitars, pedal steel, harmonica, mandolin, and footstomps on wooden floorboards. It's an intriguing twist, especially coming from the Robinsons, who arrived in the Pacific Northwest from the Deep South, with a short stopover in Nashville. Their new band, which formed out of friends hanging around their new Amore!Phonics Studio, almost sounds like a musical travelogue.</p>
<p>Their roots-pop synthesis hints at the Byrds' <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i> and the Kinks' <i>Muswell Hillbillies</i>, although <i>Blue Giant</i> never strays all that far into country and never treats roots music as more than an accessory to these songs. Their ranks include members of the Golden Bears, Swords, and the Decemberists, and it's certainly a tight group, but they seem reluctant to give themselves over to the full implications of the project. Even during the backwoods stomp of ""Blue Sunshine"" or the rural ramble of ""Run Rabbit Run"", they've always got one eye on the city skyline in the distance. ""Clean the Clock"" ends with a Skynyrd-style jam, but it sounds grafted on, as if they were just checking an item off a list. On ""Target Heart"", Kevin Robinson stretches a romantic metaphor like stale taffy, then borrows the wistful nostalgia of the Kinks' ""Do You Remember Walter?"" for ""Wesley"".</p>
<p>Tellingly, the best songs on <i>Blue Giant</i> are also the simplest, pointing to what this record could and perhaps should have been. Anita Robinson's soft vocals almost get lost on ""Lonely Girl"", but that effect only heightens its cowgirl softness. ""Gone for Good"" is a short, simple country plaint that tries to remain stone-faced while hinting at overwhelming heartache. Of course, it helps that Corin Tucker duets with Kevin Robinson, her sharp vocals pulling emotively at his stoic performance, as if they're pining at opposite ends of a bar. ""The Void Above the Sky"" employs an old country-music staple-- the chugging snare beat-- that typically signifies ""lonesome"" and ""train,"" but here it suggests ""death"" and ""abyss."" It's a clever redeployment of roots tropes, but it's an exception: Right down to the clear blue sky and perfectly rustic barn on the album cover,<i> Blue Giant</i> promises something the band can't or won't or simply don't deliver. Their understanding of indie pop music remains as strong as ever, but their take on roots doesn't get much further than the Cracker Barrel off the interstate.</p></div>"|14471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14471-blue-giant/|5.9|Stephen M.

Their first two EPs, <i>Sketch on Glass</i> and <i>Maybes</i>, came out on the British dubstep label Hotflush, but didn't sound like much like their peers-- and that's one of the reasons they were so good. No pomp, no anxiety, no apocalyptic drops, no airhorns. In a recent video interview, Dom Maker-- one half of the group-- talked about his appreciation for TV on the Radio and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which is probably not the way to impress dance-music purists, but it is a way to prove you're creative enough to ignore genre purity. It's why <i>Crooks &amp; Lovers</i> is highly anticipated by such a small community of listeners-- and also why it has such a good chance of being appreciated by a larger one.<br/><br/>If they have forebears, it's a group like Boards of Canada, who used machines to make music more convincingly pastoral than most folk bands. The funk on <i>Crooks</i> is too intimate to be whored out to clubs. It's beat music for hearth and home. Beat music for your cycling commute, or for gardening. The snare on ""Before I Move Off"" is the cluck of someone's tongue against the roof of their mouth. When ""Carbonated"" climaxes, the sound of rain comes into the mix-- and a sprinkle, not a downpour. Even the titles are humble: ""Mayor"" (and not ""President"" or ""Dictator"" or ""King""); ""Ode to Bear""; ""Field"". And in the rare moment when the music gets agitated-- like on ""Blind Night Errand""-- they still avoid being grandiose. Dubstep's signature bass wobble turns into the burp of plumbing. A big synthesizer sweep sounds like the air conditioner turning on. The surprise-- to me, at least-- is that despite the politeness of the overall sound, it's still detailed enough to sound even better loud than on headphones. <br/><br/>Nothing on <i>Crooks</i> stands out the way ""Maybes"" or ""Sketch on Glass"" did, and though it may be a generous fan's rationalization, I'd just say this just makes it an album rather than a single or an EP. Recording a full-length at all is a rare gesture in a genre where a producer-- like Joy Orbison, for example-- can release 10 or 15 minutes of music and still be considered one of the best of the year. Dubstep-- and dance music in general-- is a musical hemisphere whose ""great albums"" often don't seem to have any self-awareness of how an album can work, but <i>Crooks</i>, for what it's worth, does-- it rises, it falls, it rises again, and it ends. Thirty-five minutes, frequent sparkling, no fuss. <br/><br/>When an interviewer from <i>The Fader</i> said he'd tried to search for Mount Kimbie on Google Maps but couldn't find anything, Kai Campos-- the other half of the group-- explained, ""It's a place inside all of us where buses arrive on time."" Not a cloud-scraping peak where the sunsets burn pink and white for miles, not a metaphor for the grandeur of creation, just a small town with reliable public transportation-- a beautiful, small, and clever answer for a beautiful, small, and clever album.</p></div>"|14412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14412-crooks-lovers/|8.0|Mike Powell

The tiny label, managed by Jeremy Earl of its flagship band, Woods, has carved out an undeniable aesthetic over the years, one its new cassette-and-LP-only compilation seems determined to shake out a bit. <i>Welcome Home/Diggin' the Universe</i> earns its slashmark. Its first half collects seven songs that hold close to the mid-morning Creedence Clearwater comedown mode the label's become known for; the second runs the gamut from run'n'gun pop-punk to prim Sarah Records-style twee. It is, somewhat by design, a fairly uneven collection, but it nevertheless showcases the two sides of Woodsist's vision.<br/> <br/> Woods set the tone of the comp's first half with their sunbleached ambler ""I'm Not Gone"", the set's highlight. It's got a wonderfully casual feel to it, each seam of its recording showing, and while it lacks some of that undercurrent of dread marking their best stuff, it's yet another win for the band. From there all the way <i>Home</i>, it's variations on a theme; Baltimore's Run DMT mostly leave the hypnagogy behind for a crackly, decaying, somewhat unsteady folk-rocker. White Fence slide a bumpy organ under the slack ""The Love Between"". San Fran's the Fresh &amp; Onlys offer another tour of their garage with the blues-soaked lament ""Heel. Toe."". From the Mantles' basher ""Bad Movies"" to Skygreen Leopards' Byrdsian cover of the Cure's ""Catch"", there's certainly some spread between the tunes, but they're tied together by their shambolic production and devil-may-care pacing. The set's got an easy feel to it, and when Real Estate's Alex Bleeker brings it to a close with his impressive country-tinged strummer ""Gettin By"", the label's low-impact, high-yield mission becomes quite self-apparent.</p>
<p><i>Diggin' the Universe</i> proves a far wilder and woollier affair than what precedes it. Moon Duo's ""A Little Way Different"" most certainly is; not only a departure for the comp, it's something of a switch for the band itself, a comparatively clear-eyed mod-spy groover reminiscent of Yo La Tengo at their most playful. It kicks off a second half that feels like a mixtape rather than a label comp, and it's a welcome change of pace. City Center tackle the Grateful Dead's eternal ""Box of Rain"", smothering it in reverb but maintaining the song's easy beauty, turning in one of the more exquisite-- and certainly least jam-bandy-- Dead covers you're likely to hear. CaUSE co-MOTION! knock out fun little piffle ""Over U"" in just short of two minutes, and Skygreen affiliates the Art Museums turn in the graceful but slight ""Darling Are You Out of Your League Again"". NODZZZ pull another catchy pile of whoa-ohs out of nowhere, although they drown ""Old Clothes"" in enough scuzz that the results are a tad drab. Ducktails' beauteous ""Sun Out My Window"" certainly sounds like its title, a rangy little meanderer that feels like sleeping through your alarm and realizing you didn't have much to do anyway.</p>
<p>That lack of urgency, time unspooling rather than continuing apace, is certainly a mark against many of these tracks; the willful amateurishness of much of this stuff, both compositionally and sonically, can feel at times a bit unfinished and, at its worst, unconcerned. The best stuff tends to stick fairly close to verse-chorus-verse, it just plays with said structure with dirt-embedded fingernails; often the other songs feel a bit too formless, too casual. But most of <i>Welcome Home/Diggin' the Universe</i> puts the song out in front of the vibe, in much the same way Woods' recent <i>At Echo Lake</i> shed some of the wayfaring feel of <i>Songs of Shame</i> and just got down to it. Wobbly as the sonics may sometimes get, so long as Woodsist continues to keep the songs surefooted, the label's path seems clear.</p></div>"|14476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14476-welcome-homediggin-the-universe/|7.0|Paul Thompson

Even for the world of downtempo, that's saying something. Because hell, I once owned a copy of <i>The Very Best of Morcheeba</i>, but even that was enlivened for a few seconds by a brief appearance from an elderly Big Daddy Kane. No such luck here. Even hip-hop's senior citizens would be too energetic to fit comfortably on a Zero 7 album.</p>
<p>After all, downtempo's whole point was to facilitate relaxation. You bought a downtempo record because you thought you wanted the trappings of pop (rhythm, melody, voice) but really you just wanted something unobtrusively <i>chill</i>. Portishead albums? Those were full of all that icky human emoting. For downtempo buyers, it didn't much matter what the vocalists were actually <i>singing</i> or that every rhythm was the same stagnant five-minute lounge muzak loop or that the melodies were of the my-first-guitar-lesson sort. They wanted formulaic, nap-inducing gunk that <i>sounded</i> great.</p>
<p>Did Zero 7's music <i>sound</i> great? You betcha. The ""hits"" on <i>Record</i> positively gleam. Even Mutt Lange would nod approvingly (provided you could find him). Lush background ambience? Obsessively polished instrumental textures? Superhumanly slick vocal tracks? Got 'em. But interesting arrangements? Novel rhythms? Memorable voices? An ounce of sweat? A hint of grit? The slightest edge of disquiet? Energy? Bad jokes? Tunes with any sort of staying power? Not so much.</p>
<p>Forget Air-at-their-airiest or even the vaporously vapid loops of Thievery Corporation. Zero 7's real roots are in the VH1 Top 20 Countdown circa the turn of the millennium, when genteel major label singer-songwriters ""went electronic."" Zero 7 take this already zzzz sound and proceed to scrape it clean of individuality, wit, and charm. At the band's least ambitious, which is to say 95% of their material, the results are as numbingly flat as you'd expect. You'll hear music with more personality coming out of North Korea these days.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be needlessly cruel here. The real problem is that the best-of format actually works against Zero 7 by ignoring the non-singles that added, however rarely, some much-needed variety to their albums. Because there <i>have</i> been Zero 7 tracks that I've enjoyed. Like the featherweight fake dubstep number from their last album. Oh, and the one that sounded like an ad agency's take on glitch. Unfortunately those random highlights in the band's catalog have all been one-off, album-only oddities and hence excised from the <i>Record</i>.</p>
<p>At the same time, it's not as if I've enjoyed any of Zero 7's subgenre-bites as much as I've enjoyed <i>actual</i> Burial or Fennesz records, which leads us to the <i>second</i> disc of <i>Record</i>. You may have read that <i>Record</i> comes with a bunch of remixes by first-rank producers/bands from across the spectrum of modern beat-culture. Names like Dilla, Justus Kohncke, and Joker. Perhaps these avant knob-twiddlers might inject some of the scene-specific energy/innovation so lacking in Zero 7's water-weak ""cosmopolitan"" sound?</p>
<p>If only. There are more highlights on Disc Two of <i>Record</i> than Disc One, but a lot fewer than you'd expect given the lineup. Bugz in the Attic evoke the much-missed 2-step garage sound and bring a wild sense of syncopation to Zero 7's music for the first time. (Even moreso on their dub mix of ""Distractions"", which blessedly ditches the original ""song."") Joker and Ginz obliterate the off-the-rack dance-rock of ""Everything Up (Zizou)"" with a now-patented blast of 8-bit distortion, and it's all to the good.</p>
<p>But from Dilla to Fred Falke, most of these remixers run through their own well-known tricks with all the by-the-numbers verve of Zero 7 itself. A dirty, off-kilter breakbeat isn't going to automatically turn a desultory torch song into an Erykah Badu tune, as much as band, producer, and listener alike might hope. Half of these producers sound like they were very hard-pressed to turn Zero 7's third-rate originals into anything worth a second play. The other half sound like they treated the commission as just another check to be cashed. It's hard to argue with the logic, and very easy to ignore the end result.</p></div>"|14478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14478-record-the-best-of-zero-7/|4.0|Jess Harvell

Reminiscent of William Basinski and Stars of the Lid, his patient drones for electric guitar and chamber instruments were full of movement and detail, yet throughout all the tiny changes, an uncanny stillness prevailed. Next, he issued the career retrospective <i>A Young Person's Guide to Kyle Bobby Dunn</i>, which paired <i>Fervency</i> with older material in the same blankly teeming vein. With the title, Dunn lampooned his own premature bid for archival relevance, although it wouldn't be hard to mistake Guide for the unearthed work of some obscure old post-minimalist. His new work, the <i>Rural Route No. 2</i> EP, suggests that he's gotten tired of impeccable stasis, and it's his most approachable music to date.</p>
<p>This is part of a series of limited edition 3"" CDs from the <a href=""http://standardform.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Standard Form</a> imprint. The EP is a great format for Dunn, whose music can be dauntingly austere. With two pieces in 20 minutes, <i>Rural Route No. 2</i> is focused and enveloping, with the perfect amount of content to tell a coherent story. Dunn continues to process electric guitars but his digital intervention is more intense and dynamic than before. As a consequence, he finds new emotional shades in his music.</p>
<p>Dunn created <i>Rural Route No. 2</i> after visiting childhood haunts in Calgary, Alberta, though true to his counterintuitive point of view, he mostly avoids bucolic nostalgia. ""Dissonant Distances"" catches us off-guard with its gloomy timbres and faintly industrial feel. It passes by like a long gray train: a slow roar entwined with hissing steam and shrieking brakes. The main bulk of the sound finally trails off as if into a tunnel, and leaves us flat-footed on empty, whistling track, essentially spending half of the EP getting us to our destination.</p>
<p>On the second half, ""Senium III"", Dunn works in a more open, elegiac space, but he's hardly skipping through the clovers. The overcast melody banks slowly through high shrills and deep brassy moans. It's quietly dejected yet shot through with flickers of optimism. It's not a sentimental reconstruction of childhood wonder, but a shrine to irrevocable loss. Catharsis is continually teased and held at bay. Dunn's nuanced and uncompromising perspective is getting sharper, and increasingly worthy of the close scrutiny he demands.</p></div>"|14427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14427-rural-route-no-2/|7.7|Brian Howe

True to all the musical strands they've been winding, the band skirts no indulgence on its third and apparently final album, aiming for raw and visceral thrills as often as it breaks for lengthy instrumental passages and extended guitar solos. There's both a studiousness and an audible joy in these longer, more complex songs that makes you wonder what the members of Mass Shivers have been hiding in their record collections all this time, and why they've been holding it back-- and what they might have accomplished if they'd pushed themselves a little further.</p>
<p>Mass Shivers pared down to guitar, drums, and bass for this album, though the guitar overdubs are judicious, and rarely does the band stop from stuffing a track with ideas between the three of them. Maybe it's because the music itself has grown more layered and demands more finesse that singer and guitarist Brett Sova attempts a more earnest, less excitable singing voice here. On opener ""More Bumper Than a Body Shop"", his breathy, detached turn makes an effective contrast with the band's bluster. But while the band finds the chops and vision to stretch out, the vocals often sound half-hearted or timid in comparison elsewhere-- it's as if there's a growth spurt here for the band, but some awkwardness still left to get over on otherwise convincingly bruising and psychedelic tracks like ""Languid Liquid"" or ""Anonynominous"".</p>
<p>But despite complex song structures that glide gracefully in the hands of the band and consistently great performances from behind the drum kit, the record falls into a homogenous rut-- in part from the uniformity of guitar sounds, no matter how busy they are. Oddly, some of the instrumental interludes bear the most vivid moments: ""Bilateral Dysfunction"" gets plenty of mileage from just a few notes of clean guitar as counterpoint to a searing lead-- a contrast the rest of the album could have benefited from.</p>
<p>The band has pushed themselves in a few different directions over the years, especially on last years' single for ""Torrid Sex in East Berlin"" (included here), a sinewy groove paired with the B-side ""Tickled on Poppers"", some of the heaviest and most manic music they've ever laid down. But rather than an opportunity to stretch further, <i>Contoured Heat</i> searches for nuance and possibly transcendence in the sounds they've been exploring thus far. Were it not their final record, one could look at it as a promising transitional moment for the band; instead,<i> Contoured Heat</i> is another example of potential not fully realized.</p></div>"|14465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14465-contoured-heat/|5.9|Jason Crock

So why was <i>In Ear Park</i>, the 2008 sophomore effort from Department of Eagles, Rossen's side project with college roommate Fred Nicolaus, so criminally overlooked? Perhaps it was because of the nature of Rossen's songcraft itself. From his winding, unconventional guitar-led melodies to his tendency to prefer lyrical obtuseness, a whole album of material heavy on his participation can come off as overly arch and severe. In short, <i>In Ear Park </i>was rich with texture and detail, but it also demanded a patience that even Grizzly Bear's most baroque moments don't.</p>
<p><i>Archives 2003-2006</i>, a collection of unreleased material taken from various sessions Rossen and Nicolaus recorded in between their 2003 debut, <i>The Cold Nose</i>, and <i>In Ear Park</i>, might provide an easier entry point. The overall feel is looser, more freewheeling; although a good deal of these recordings were taken from an aborted attempt at recording a follow-up to <i>The Cold Nose</i>, nothing smacks of creative frustration. Rather, you get the feeling that these two guys have a lot of fun playing together, like two session musicians improvising in between takes. ""While We're Young"" and ""Brightest Minds"" are breezy and fleet-footed, the former building to a driving climax and the latter bursting into toe-tapping countermelodies without batting an eyelash.</p>
<p>Indeed, considering that this is for all intents and purposes an odds-and-sods collection, it's shocking how fully formed this material sounds. Rossen and Nicolaus barely flinch throughout, employing expert phrasing to turn even the collection's slightest opening melody (the Nicolaus-led ""Grand Army Plaza"") into throbbing, moonlit romanticism. Even the ""Practice Room Sketches"" that act as interstitials throughout the record are packed with ideas, evoking vocal groups, <i>musique concrète</i>, and after-dark piano jazz.</p>
<p>That last one is integral, considering Rossen's jazz training. That specialized training factors into Rossen's strong ear for the elements of composition. There are two moments on <i>Archives</i> that have been recontextualized in other works of his that especially stand out. The first is the deceptively jaunty guitars of ""Deadly Disclosure"", which were turned into the ending of <i>In Ear Park</i>'s haunting closer ""Balmy Night"". The appearance of the source material is surprising, especially since it's used in a completely emotional context. Even more surprising are the snatches of discordant, minimalistic piano in ""Practice Room Sketch 1"", which appeared ever so briefly in ""Easier"", the opening track to Grizzly Bear's 2006 breakthrough, <i>Yellow House</i>. It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, which makes his own later reconfiguring that much more remarkable.</p>
<p>For Grizzly Bear fans and Department of Eagles devotees alike, <i>Archives 2003-2006</i> is a document rich with revelatory moments and educatory touchstones-- but as an album, it functions even better. You can put this thing on from front to back and not even be able to tell that these were taken from disparate sessions spanning three years; it is that surprisingly cohesive. Even when they don't mean to, Rossen and Nicolaus come off as impeccably having their shit together.</p></div>"|14455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14455-archives-2003-2006/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

In all she's put out two full-length albums, one EP, and a split with Banhart, alongside contributions to other bands, including Phosphorescent and CocoRosie. Her last release was in 2007, and fans wondered where Hunter had gone until she recently started turning up at venues with a new band. The new group, a foursome based in Baltimore, immerses her elastic alto tone in a colorful mix of electric guitar, bass, and drums, yielding unhinged, dreamy rock with just the right mix of flourish and understatement. This is very much Hunter's band; anyone familiar with her work will hear the parallels between the two acts. The biggest difference between <i>Twin-Hand Movement</i> and Hunter's solo albums is the instrumentation: This album is more about her guitar than her voice, which is absent from a few of the songs. Both projects let their guitars go off and wander, but the lilting country twang seems to have been left behind.</p>
<p>Instead, Lower Dens experiment with a broad range of tones, all in the service of atmosphere. They also frequently stick to lower registers and slower tempos, which at times comes off as too introspective, especially on the instrumental tracks. The same could be said of the xx's debut-- when Lower Dens are at their most spare (""Rosie"" and ""Plastic &amp; Powder""), the two bands sound similar-- but in place of the xx's foggy sexual tension, Hunter and company share a wider array of emotion. When Hunter's voice appears-- often deep into tracks-- it can sound spent, alluring, hopeful, and exasperated, and the guitars are just as versatile: screeching, whining, twinkling-- they're the show-offs in the band. That said, there is a placid, warm quality to nearly every track, no matter what the guitars are up to. (For this, credit is due to producer Chris Coady, who also mixed Beach House's <i>Teen Dream</i>; Coady turns busy bunches of layers into an elegant bouquet.)</p>
<p>Hunter's deep, smooth voice-- comparable to PJ Harvey's, especially on grittier tracks like ""Completely Golden""-- is woven in with the least trebly of the instruments, whispery yet tensile. When it's time for the guitars to show off with elaborate arpeggios, gurgling shreds, and distant, glittery calls-and-responses, she stands back from the mic entirely, or at least gives the instruments, including her own, a long intro. Even when her lyrics are a key component of a song, she can sound (like Beach House's Victoria Legrand) a little lost in the mix, as if the force of the instruments were threatening to blow her away. The rare tracks where she's loudest are just as strong as the others: there's the slight ""Truss Me"", whose title is a good indication of how slow and loose the song is, and ""Two Cocks"", a joyous, robust potential single.</p>
<p>Lower Dens appreciate the grimy atmospherics of new wave as much as the dizzy elements of shoegaze, which can make <i>Twin-Hand Movement</i> confusing on first listen. But when variety sounds this good, it's hard to fault a band for sharing so many ideas in one place. The album is primarily about atmosphere: about translating feeling into music, rather than the music serving as a companion to lyrics. When Hunter ruminates about ""just a-standing in your pretty presence"" on ""I Get Nervous"", the instruments, playing a long, cozy intro of noodling and heartbeat percussion, <i>are</i> that ""pretty presence""-- or the closest thing to it.</p></div>"|14339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14339-twin-hand-movement/|8.1|Liz Colville

I say ""almost"" because this is Richard Youngs we're talking about, and nothing he's done has ever sounded tossed off or undercooked. But when I heard last year that the Scot best known for minimalism, noise, and avant-folk had made a ""proper pop album"" on a friend's dare, and released it as a low-run CD-R, I expected some kind of fun trifle-- maybe his equivalent of Pussy Galore's <i>Exile on Main Street</i> cassette, or the infamous bootleg of Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye doing ""Born to Be Wild"" in a karaoke bar.</p>
<p>Instead, <i>Ultrahits </i>(now reissued on vinyl by Jagjaguwar)<i> </i>is a thoughtful, carefully-crafted set of melodic gems. Not that it's overly controlled-- Youngs definitely had fun with this experiment, and many songs are practically giddy compared to his typical solemn mantras. But it sounds as if he put as much time and effort into this album as any before. The beats are nimble and rich, ranging from rock-ish to techno-tinged. Bass lines slide craftily around melodies; organ drones arc into rainbows; and vocals waft over verses and double during choruses, often sounding like British folk crossed with Motown soul. Every tune has a distinct sonic template, as Youngs clearly worked to find a new set of sounds for each.</p>
<p>What's most impressive about the effort behind <i>Ultrahits </i>isn't the amount, but how it always serves the simplicity of Youngs' songwriting. Repetition has always been his favorite tool, and here he discovers many ways to turn chants into hooks. ""I had an idea/ With thoughts of collapsing stars/ That I wanted to see/ Your thoughts of collapsing stars,"" he sings in ""Collapsing Stars"", a spritely counterpart to ""Cluster to a Star"" from last year's Zen hymnal <i>Under Stellar Steam</i>. If that album was a bedtime suite of hypnotic lullabies, think of <i>Ultrahits </i>as an alternate-universe pop station playing on your clock radio the next morning.</p>
<p>Actually, the universe in which these songs could play on the radio isn't that far from ours. This album's title may be self-deprecatingly ironic, but these are confident, accessible tunes by an artist who has often injected melody into even his most difficult work. The converse is also true-- even the brightest tunes here have a dark underside. Take the rubbery ""Summer Void"", which evokes New Zealand songsmiths like Robert Scott and David Kilgour. ""I remember when I had nothing to do/ The void is a dreadful thing,"" he sings in a carefree lilt. ""I remember the joy of self-defeat/ The void is a dreadful thing."" Richard Youngs can now add pop to the list of skills he's mastered, but he couldn't go soft if he tried.</p></div>"|14467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14467-beyond-the-valley-of-ultrahits/|7.8|Marc Masters

While that album displayed an impressive diversity of taste and influences for such a young outfit, the group clearly still had a lot of growing to do. Their frame of reference kept them anchored to the late 1960s, and as fine as its five albums might have been, they largely showcased a band running in place.</p>
<p>They also showcased a band with an uncommonly good instinct for sympathetic producers, beginning with Ian Broudie, continuing through Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Adrian Utley, and here, on album number six, ending up with vet John Leckie. The latter's experience no doubt helped the group weather what was a reportedly tough transitional period, beginning with the departure of guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones and continuing through a two-year stretch of songwriting and woodshedding.</p>
<p>That the results are as modest as <i>Butterfly House</i> is a disappointment, though all the skillful pieces remain in place. Skelly is a subtly soulful singer, and even minus Ryder-Jones, the guitars continue effortlessly to shimmer and glide, resplendent of all the best mildly psych 1960s folk-rock tropes, from frilly little filigrees to freak-out muscle. If the rhythm section remains only serviceable, that's defensible, as their pronounced presence would be out of place in the era from which the band draws: Despite a passing resemblance, their music has none of the past-to-present dance/rock fusion of the Stone Roses.</p>
<p>But while the Coral aren't some tribute band, on songs such as ""Green Is the Colour"", ""Sandhills"", and ""Falling All Around You"", they skirt just those kinds of clichés. The melodicism of ""1000 Years"" is undeniable, as is the spooky exploration of atmosphere on ""Coney Island"". When the title track or ""North Parade"" go nuts, the results are effectively dramatic. But with each song, the déjà vu sense of pastiche is so pervasive it's hard to enjoy them as more than impeccable craft. ""Impeccable"" being the word to accent if you're a defender, ""craft"" the word to stress if you're not.</p></div>"|14470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14470-butterfly-house/|5.8|Joshua Klein

Almost every track here is labeled as having some sort of guest spot, though the identities of those guests are obscured, both in how they're credited and how they sound in the context of these songs. Many are from the band's hometown of Chicago, including Bobby (""Robert"" here) Conn and Jeanine O'Toole from the 1900s, but nearly all of the guest vocals are heavily manipulated until they're indistinguishable from the rest of the band's strange sonic soup.</p>
<p>As disjointed as that sounds on paper, <i>The Long Shadow</i> is the band's most focused and cohesive work. That's partly because it maintains a consistent mood, and partly because it maintains a danceable, frenetic pulse.  At seven tracks, it's their leanest full-length; each song proves the band has stayed as omnivorous as ever-- still borrowing from post-punk, afropop, contemporary R&amp;B. Choosing highlights is almost as challenging as picking out the guest spots: nearly all tracks build from thin but complex drum machine beats and synth tones that range between muffled, tinny, and abrasive. ""Miami Knights"" stands out with its big, slow stabs of synthesized strings and even bigger bass hits, while ""Grooverider Free"" is a densely packed epic that earns every minute of its nine-plus runtime, masterfully ebbing and flowing in tempo and intensity.</p>
<p>But as the keyboards chirp and the drum machines knock, a rambling spoken word interlude on ""Grooverider Free"" promises a ""new world order,"" the lyrics of ""Wardance"" threaten ""no more water"" and ""10 million dead"" over a cheerfully relentless beat, and an ominously slowed-down sample that punctuates the heaving half-time rhythm of ""DeVry"" helpfully reminds listeners that we're all gonna die. <i>The Long Shadow</i> is in the same production style the band has been refining for a while, and it fits this record in particular. It's easy to imagine a song like ""Wardance"" as the sound of a poorer, war-torn, and more globalized future; these songs implore listeners to dance as much as they act as sirens alerting them to duck and cover. This style works for and against them. The lyrics, when you can make them out, amplify the paranoia already present in the music.</p>
<p>Still these sounds sustain the entire album. <i>The Long Shadow of the Paper Tiger</i> makes the trade off from stunning peaks and occasional deep valleys of their previous albums for overall consistency, and just being able to make that trade is a big step for the band. It's hard to find a dance party as distinctive as the one Mahjongg are throwing here, and <i>The Long Shadow</i> is one step closer toward the band's solidifying its own identity, even as it invites so many others into the fold. The only disappointment is the missed opportunity for them to be as provocative as they are danceable.</p></div>"|14456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14456-the-long-shadow-of-the-paper-tiger/|6.9|Jason Crock

A minor qualm, but it's a shame to think about how many Fourth of July barbecues could've benefitted from this batch of originals and reinterpretations from the duo's hybridized dancehall debut, <i>Guns Don't Kill People-- Lazers Do</i>. To paraphrase Scott Plagenhoef's review of that album last year, this is clearly music that works best in the heat, but it still has the dexterity to stick around once the flip-flops have been tucked away. On this concise and surprisingly fresh sounding EP, Major Lazer retain the sweat-soaked club feel that's curried them so much favor but also appeals to their perennial accessibility.</p>
<p>It's no secret that Major Lazer have racked up some serious frequent flyer miles this year. And in between the daggering instructional videos and recording at the legendary Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica (where much of <i>Lazers Never Die</i> was created), it's surprising to find that these guys have had the time to get any kind of work done at all. Last month, they released a remix record with La Roux, a somewhat mismatched pairing but one that proved fruitful and thoughtful. And even if the brunt of the work here has been shouldered by the remixes of tracks found on <i>Guns Don't Kill People</i>, you can tell that the EP is no toss-off.</p>
<p>Among the new songs is the mp3 blog favorite ""Sound of Siren"", which features Lazer's most familiar affiliate, M.I.A., and Jamaica's Busy Signal. With its rigid snare-snappings and militant, sing-songy hook, it's a clever entry point given the Major Lazer mythology. Dancehall heavy-hitter Busy Signal swoops in and does his thing effortlessly, snarling and flailing all over the otherwise uncluttered, straightforward lurch. Somewhat overlooked when it wound up online at the beginning of this year, it's nice to see ""Siren"" getting its proper shine here, with both M.I.A. and Busy making their stop snitchin' talk convincing. Better still is the Collie Buddz- and Lindi Ortega-assisted ""Good Enough"", a pretty down-the-line island-riddim affair that employs great melody and some aqueous synth accents that help lodge this one right into your brain. Ortega-- an under-the-radar Canadian singer-songwriter-- somehow walks away with it, deliciously channeling a rocksteady-pumped Gwen Stefani.</p>
<p>But the remixes feel equally vital to the EP, because after all, the great appeal of Major Lazer is watching these dancehall concoctions transform, as elements of dub and hip-hop and reggae are also smashed into one freaky, juiced up mutant (kinda like the fictional Major Lazer himself). Buraka Som Sistema do a house-y two-step all over ""Bruk Out"", giving it the extra 10% of oomph that Einstein's gleefully whacked-out feature always deserved. And even if the K.L.A.M. remix of ""Can't Stop Now"" doesn't break much new ground, guest rapper Miss Banks brings enough clever, dirty sass that it's hard to pass up. Even the big name-drop moment doesn't disappoint: Thom Yorke laces ""Jump Up"" with queasy, slow-burn dubstep moves, providing an unexpected amount of movement with some simple, sandpapery claps. And it might go without saying, but everyone gets a bonus points for knowing to leave ""Keep It Goin' Louder"" well enough alone.</p></div>"|14462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14462-lazers-never-die-ep/|7.8|Zach Kelly

I don't tend to associate music with a mood or a time of day or a season, but I like to listen to his albums when I'm working late. I have an iTunes playlist called ""That Feeling"" (so-called because it's something I can't quite name), and it is 50% Richter. His music both captures a specific atmosphere and also feels internal.</p>
<p><i>Infra</i> fairly brims with these qualities. Scored for piano, electronics, and string quartet, it's an expansion of a 25-minute piece Richter wrote for a collaboration with choreographer Wayne McGregor and artist Julian Opie. The latter contributed video projections of scenes from everyday life that ran behind the dancers. I can see how the music might complement the piece. His work has an amazing ability to interact with and elevate banality. It's not an uncommon trick to pair a mundane shot-- two businessmen shaking hands, someone cleaning out a garage, birds landing on a wire-- with slow and pretty music. But when it's done well, such juxtapositions still have the power to turn the everyday rigmarole we're seeing onscreen into something emotionally charged.</p>
<p>It's as though music allows us to see the melancholy or even futility of activities we take for granted. The more mundane the activity and the more achingly gorgeous the music, the more we feel the effect. And this music is achingly gorgeous. It's also uncomplicated. If one were to transcribe it, it would look childishly simple on the page: long, held notes, a few repeating phrases locked together, some strings working their way through a chord progression, note by note. But it's not the substance of the music that matters so much as the way it's all put together, and the way the composer understands timbre and what it can suggest. Here, on ""Infra 7"", Richter pulls the strings through electronic processing to give them a hollow, glassy tone that's completely at odds with the sound of vibrating strings bouncing off wood, the dominant sound of the rest of the album. And by setting you momentarily outside of the rich texture he's acclimated you to, he makes you feel all the more at home when it comes back, full bore, on ""Infra 8"".</p>
<p>I should note that the original inspiration for the whole collaborative project was T.S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, a work of great power in its own right that has been over-referenced through the years, to the point where it can feel a bit old hat. But the Eliot poem falls by the wayside as a reference point as the piece progresses, and its haunted aura seems to have remained mostly as an echo in the music. Regardless, <i>Infra</i> works as an enveloping and moving work even absent any knowledge of its beginnings. Others may glean different feelings from it than I do, but that is part of the point. Even if it conjures nothing of the night for you, it is some of Richter's very best work. And if you've ever cared about his music, it will make you feel something.</p></div>"|14452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14452-infra/|8.3|Joe Tangari

That said, the extent to which online chatter and claims-jumping have become more important than actually <i>listening</i> to the new album by, say, M.I.A. or Wavves, is kind of disheartening. So it's a relief to hear a record that's more fun to listen to than it could ever be to talk about. Mountain Man's got its small share of blog buzz, but <i>Made the Harbor</i> evokes, and even seems to encourage, private appreciation.</p>
<p>I guess if you really wanted to incite a message board snipe-fest among authenticity hardliners, you could point out that the three women who record old-timey-souding folk as Mountain Man would never fool an actual mountain man. Molly Erin Sarle, Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, and Amelia Randall Meath met as students at Bennington, and there's a direct line to be drawn from their exquisitely arranged three-part harmonies to the a cappella group sounds that waft through Eastern seaboard college quads. Instead of Depression-era Americana, Fleet Foxes are Mountain Man's best RIYL, and they're sure to appeal to anyone who misses the Be Good Tanyas. The trio, however, appear to have a greater investment in mood and milieu than in crafting a traditionally structured album or even fully fleshed-out songs.</p>
<p><i>Harbor</i> is their second, but first widely available, release and it collects songs that loosely riff on Appalachian folk in ways similar to those of fellow Vermonter Sam Amidon. Nothing on <i>Harbor</i> is a reverent reading of an open-source song, but a track like ""Sewee Sewee"" sounds like it was unearthed in a Carolina Confederate graveyard. Elsewhere, Mountain Man refer to ""the mighty Mississippi"" and ""fair young maidens"" and ask a lover to ""draw me still,"" a balmy archaism that would sound contrived in everyday conversation, but is pretty fantastic in context. Modern sensibilities aren't out of place, though. ""Dog Song"" is a provocative three-minute roll in the hay, and ""Soft Skin"" is frankly sensual both in words and come-hither inflection.</p>
<p>But you don't love a record like this for its lyrics-- or for instrumentation that rarely gets more complicated than plucking out basic chords. It's Mountain Man's bell-toned voices volleying off the walls of an abandoned ice cream parlor where the album was recorded that sells it. If you find yourself indifferent to ""Babylon"", an electrifying a cappella arrangement of Psalm 137, you may want to check your pulse. Then there are the spaces and silences-- between tracks, verses, even notes-- that the trio occasionally fills with false starts, deep breaths, and laughter, but mostly let be. At its best, <i>Harbor</i> feels like a private performance of friends only out to please themselves. But if you promise to sit quietly and listen, you're more than welcome to stay.</p></div>"|14469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14469-made-the-harbor/|7.7|Amy Granzin

It wasn't for lack of trying, of course, and if you gather up every notable soul cover from Otis Redding's powerhouse 1965 rendition of the Stones' ""Satisfaction"" to the sweltering revamp of Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" that Tina Turner recorded 10 years later, you'll have an alternate version of the classic rock canon that stands up to the original articles and then some. And among the better tracks will be Bettye LaVette's fantastic Muscle Shoals-tinged 1972 cover of Neil Young's ""Heart of Gold"", which was recorded during sessions where Patterson Hood's father David played bass and subsequently led to her Drive-By Truckers collaboration, <i>The Scene of the Crime</i>, three years ago.</p>
<p>A good portion of LaVette's career revival these last several years has hinged on her transformative skills as an interpreter, especially in the way she can take her ragged yet lush voice and wring out new emotions from songs you thought might not have any tears left. Her first release on Anti-, 2005's <i>I've Got My Own Hell to Raise</i>, set that comeback-era standard with covers of songs from the likes of Sinéad O'Connor and Aimee Mann, selections that people called ""unlikely"" until they actually heard them. <i>Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook</i> pulls off a similar gambit-- only this time, that vintage tradition of the rock-done-soul cover is applied to a baker's dozen of well-known selections from the annals of 60s and 70s post-British Invasion bands. No obscurities here, either-- you've got your Elton John, your Rolling Stones, your Moody Blues, your Pink Floyd and four selections from all four members of the Beatles (group and solo), plus the show-stopping cover of the Who's ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", from the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors that inspired the project in the first place, as a bonus track. (Check it on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJi6maTueSc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a>; the awed, choked-up looks on Townsend and Daltrey's faces are priceless.)</p>
<p><i>Interpretations</i> winds up following that Who cover's powerfully sorrowful lead. If you're looking for upbeat moments, the closest you'll get is the dynamite gospel-accented version of the Beatles' ""The Word"" that opens the album and a deep funk take on Derek &amp; the Dominos' ""Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad"" 10 tracks later. Between them, it's all elegiac ballads, whether the songs were that way from the get-go (""Nights in White Satin"") or not (""It Don't Come Easy""). But if you don't mind the mostly downbeat backings-- which run the gamut from lush orchestral soul to spare, semi-acoustic country blues-- the material here gives you as fine a showcase as any for how well she can convey pain, heartache, rapture, and love as a singer.</p>
<p>Maybe the easiest track to point to is the most left-field one: Led Zeppelin's synth-drenched soft-rock flirtation ""All My Love"" is stripped down and rebuilt as a smoky number reminiscent of the Dixie Flyers' early-70s work with Aretha Franklin, and in place of Robert Plant's weightless murmur is a deeply hurt-sounding yet tough performance from LaVette. While the album's other great moments take a similar approach-- a stirring update of the Stones' ""Salt of the Earth"", her swooning glide through Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here,"" and a version of McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" where her raspy take on Sir Paul's wordless post-chorus vocalizations is worth the price of admission alone-- it's a template that fits across the board. And while it wouldn't fit such a dignified record to call it payback, it's hard not to appreciate the karma of some of the most well-worn rock standards of LaVette's hard-fought early years rendered new again through a voice time almost forgot.</p></div>"|14394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14394-interpretations-the-british-rock-songbook/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Weapons, and by comparison, Uffie's too in hock to the Four Elements to get the job done.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Another thought: Is it possible to loathe the idea of something like this catching on even if you have no idea who it could possibly be meant for?<span> </span>In this case, yes-- judging by its lyrics, beats, production and attitude, if <i>Art School Girls </i>showed less concern for being enjoyed by someone other than the people who made it, it would be an anti-folk album.<span> </span>It's best taking it step by step.<span> </span>""Dada"" piles on migraine-inducing kick drums over three minutes of chants like ""break that ass on the floor!"" but, like a strip club on a Thursday afternoon, it's too depressing to possibly be erotic.<span> </span>""Toe Wop"" is baked in the fluorescents of <i>Vice</i> (Magazine or City), but ends up sounding like Dâm-Funk if he were ironic.<span> </span>The title track is exponentially more witless than a song about the same topic written by Scott fucking Weiland in 1996.<span> </span>""Berst'a'ball (Skit)"" is two minutes of a drunk guy bitching about picture parties and is every bit
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
as entertaining as that sounds. <span> </span>But then somehow things manage to take a turn for the worse on... ""Picture Party"", which at least tries to fit a proper song into its torturous five and a half minutes before dedicating its second half to <i>more drunk guys bitching about picture parties</i>. I'm willing to take this as a next-level example of ""write what you know.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Now, we're in a year where Eminem and Drake are the two top-selling rap acts, so being solipsistic or even unlikeable isn't a hurdle to successfully communicating with an audience. But Ninjasonik's musical values are so null and void that in a cruel irony, you can't imagine <i>Art School Girls </i>playing anywhere but the <a href=""http://blaggblogg.blogspot.com/2005/07/no-admitted-hipsters-found-at-total.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fashion-conscious Brooklyn get togethers</a> they spend the majority of their time complaining about.  Pretty much the only thing saving this from total failure is the title of ""Drink n' My Ska Step"", and even that gets less funny every time you hear it.<span> </span>It serves as an unintentional metaphor for the compositional method of <i>Girls</i>' Side B, which mostly consists of a joke usually included in the title (""Somebody Gonna Get Pregnant"", ""Holla Front"") that's then repeated ad nauseum for two or three minutes over entry-level electro. <span> </span>It almost makes you nostalgic for the awfulness of the first half, which at least made you feel something.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's just one of those situations where, ""oh, come on-- they're just fucking around"" doesn't work as a copout, not when the heart of this album pumps to the beat of their contempt for others: Although Ninjasonik have no real investment in what you might consider typical street-rap, they still manage to include the kind of casual misogyny, homophobia, and race-baiting you can rely on from your garden variety download from Datpiff.com.<span> </span>So, the question again: Can an album truly be bad even if it achieves exactly what it intended to do?<span> </span>If your intent is to make shit music, I don't even see how it's a question at all.<span> </span></p></div>"|14420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14420-art-school-girls/|1.9|Ian Cohen

Imagine if a blog had posted these clips of goofball hypnotherapist and meditation consultants, or found a tape of a boy and a girl swapping violent threats with each other: You'd chuckle and move on. But when the Books use these samples, they give them integrity. You find yourself engrossed with people who are alien but also familiar. The flotsam and jetsam of American culture aren't a cheap joke to the Books, but a source of endless discovery and joy.</p>
<p><i>The Way Out</i> is the fourth LP-- and the first in half a decade-- by the collage art/folktronica/post-New Age/indescribable duo of guitarist/singer Nick Zammuto and cellist Paul de Jong.  Their new album is experimental for sure, but just like their early works, it wasn't designed for slow chin-scratching.  It works best when it works like a joke: A strange sound or sample clicks in your ears, and then you're on to the next one.</p>
<p>Is ""A Cold Freezin' Night"", a track featuring a recording of one kid threatening to torture another to death, a commentary on how early and how easily little kids assimilate violent fantasies and gender roles? You could read it that way, but mostly I just enjoyed the jolt of recognition: It's a striking example of the way kids talk to each other when nobody else is listening. Likewise, ""Beautiful People"" is pretty straightforward: It's a tribute to <a href=""http://thebooksmusic.tumblr.com/post/556126021/beautiful-people"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zammuto's favorite irrational number</a>, which is a pretty geeky thing to do, but Zammuto connects that number to God, and so he makes it a hymn. Back it with a disco beat and tack on a meticulously constructed brass fanfare at the end, and you have a Books pop song-- one of the only ones they've written.</p>
<p>The band's good humor stops us from mocking ""I Didn't Know That"", where kids and adults shout, ""I didn't know that!"" with unironic gusto. My guess is that the samples come from a kid's television show, but the source doesn't really matter. The Books take the speakers and high-five them again and again, with a boisterous melody and a verse that features distorted, hiccupping vocal snippets arranged into musical phrases and emerging as a kind of scat singing. Which, you know, is something you would normally just get up and perform, but instead they do it this way, and it must have taken them a long time to put it together.</p>
<p>When the Books actually get up and make jokes, they tend to shoot themselves in the foot. And maybe that's the point: they want to say they're not trying to sound prophetic. Don't take this so seriously. But they score a misfire at the end of ""Chain of Missing Links"", which features a self-help guru who's trying to lead us to a higher consciousness. He soothes us and seeks out our pain-- ""You're old and used up at the atomic level""-- and while he sounds silly, the music plays along with him. It complements his message, matching the tension and the transcendence in his words. You almost start to wonder if he's onto something. But the track ends on an easy joke, editing the speaker to make a crack about eating brains, and the music leaves him looking foolish. It seems kinda cruel.</p>
<p>The album is book-ended with excerpts of these self-help records, and the funniest thing about that is that the Books really are a boffo meditation band. As smart and complex as they are, their albums are also super-serene, and they could function as New Age music for people who are too skeptical for the real thing. After all, it's soothing to hear two guys digest and synthesize a mountain of information and pass back an orderly whole-- something that most of us information worker-types try and fail on a daily basis.</p>
<p><i>The Way Out</i> is a step forward for the band, as producers and in Zammuto's case, as a singer: dig his glowing lead vocal on ""All You Need Is A Wall"".  But it's not their best record. Even ""Beautiful People"" can't match the subtler beauty of <i>The Lemon of Pink</i>'s interplay between analog and digital sources, where a glitch and a handclap can form a percussion part, and a vocal line can blend seamlessly with bowed cello. The second half of the album flags, and while it has some eerie moments, ""The Story of Hip Hop"" is a one-joke song. (They start with a children's story about a rabbit, and guess what kind of a beat they add?) That stuff was fun on their debut, 2002's <i>Thought for Food</i>, but today those easy jokes seem like a waste of their skills. Better to seek out the greater mystery of those weird and splendiferous sounds, and those voices that seem so close and so unknowable in the same breath.</p></div>"|14459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

His arrangements were, as the tunes demanded, lush and cluttered or spare and straightaway. His playing was limber, never showy. His own sturdy output was like a workshop in form. He had a songwriter's voice-- a little gravelly, careful to put the weight on just the right syllable. He is, even now, best known for getting kicked out of Wilco for being too conservative; that's the same Wilco that would go on to make <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> and <i>Wilco (The Album)</i>, mind. But Bennett was a classicist, a formalist, possessed of a subdued confidence and a clear vision. Having resettled in downstate Illinois, crafting a series of deft, restrained works with a handful of impressive collaborators, he died unexpectedly a year ago May, leaving behind a mostly completed LP, <i>Kicking at the Perfumed Air</i>, comprised of stalwart, sad, often quite affecting pop-rock songs.</p>
<p>It begins with ""Diamond Smiles"", a patient, somewhat unlikely Boomtown Rats cover that, under Bennett's direction, proves far prettier than its original, the ""love is for others, but me it destroys"" line resounding especially under the circumstances. It's offset nicely by the ramshackle ""Second Last Call"" that follows, a ""Dreamer in My Dreams"" style tumbler that's far and away the album's most upbeat number. From there the record quickly downshifts into far starker balladry, its arrangements plaintive, uncluttered, sunlit-around-the-edges. For as many sneaky, inobtrusive production flourishes he throws on the ballads, there's just as many left bare; it's here that perhaps we see the unfinished side of <i>Perfumed</i>, but these prove largely more haunting than the record's ruddy rave-ups and gently adorned slow numbers. Bennett was a sharp enough songwriter to suggest other master craftspeople without seemingly copping a move, and there are shades of Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, and even Bruce Springsteen here. Although most of the record is Bennett of a recent vintage, ""Mirror Ball"" finds him joined by a few of his old bandmates in the Wilco loft way back in 1999. Despite that-- and the occasional sharp shift in tone-- <i>Kicking</i> coheres in a way few posthumously compiled LPs do.</p>
<p>It's tempting to want to read the tea leaves in a release like <i>Kicking at the Perfumed Air. </i>Although Bennett's death has been ruled accidental, it's no secret that he was battling some illnesses and legal woes at the time of his death, all of which seem to weigh on the songs here. It's most assuredly a sad record, as much of Bennett's output was, and the occasional incomplete-sounding arrangement does lend the proceedings a certain starkness that suits the somber mood. But by all accounts, at the time of his death, Bennett was looking to finish up <i>Kicking</i> and get on with whatever was next. This, then, is to be taken as yet another Jay Bennett solo album, not any kind of final statement.</p>
<p>Indeed, the downtrodden tone is more maudlin than funereal; Bennett knew the power of using merely a couple of words to convey an emotion, and there's far more instances of that sort of keenly observed everyday melancholia like, ""I see her twice a year/ And it breaks my heart"" (which'll knock the wind out of you as Bennett sings it) than the record's more alarmingly depressive stuff. Moments of levity-- like the stunningly sputtery guitar solo on the unbuttoned freewheeler ""Hotel Song"" or the Boomtown Rats cover-- coupled with Bennett's easygoing arrangements keep <i>Perfumed</i> from feeling like a dirge or some sort of prophesy. Indeed, a few of these tunes seem a bit workmanlike, and several of even the stronger numbers might've benefitted from a bit more attention to sonic detail. But <i>Perfumed</i> works simply because Bennett was such a keen craftsman, his mournfulness so elegantly expressed, and as such, nevertheless serves as a fitting elegy for an under-appreciated and occasionally misunderstood songsmith and musician taken too soon.</p></div>"|14468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14468-kicking-at-the-perfumed-air/|6.8|Paul Thompson

The songs he produced, however, were anything but self-pitying. With nothing but his melodic gifts and an appealing sense of wry resignation, McLamb spun his despair into music that felt more like a whoop of joy than a cry of loneliness.</p>
<p>On follow-up <i>Libraries</i>, McLamb sounds less down and out but, oddly, more downbeat. The scrappy, lo-fi production of the debut is gone; he recorded the album by himself again but did so in a proper studio, and the record glimmers with soft-pedaled production touches. McLamb's handsome, worn croon is here blessed with the spiraling reverb it demands, and his colorful arrangements swell impressively to fill the new sonic space. ""Pedals"" announces his intentions out of the gate with an Arcade Fire-size arrangement given a sonic full court press. Like many former lo-fi musicians, McLamb alternately luxuriates and gets lost in his plush new surroundings. On several songs, he evaporates in the arrangement, ""ooh""-ing wordlessly in the background as barroom piano and shimmering tremolo guitar swirl around him. The heart-catching ""This Blood Is Our Own"" is a standout example, beginning as a Stones-y blues ballad before an ethereal countrypolitan string section touches down, sending the song into a delirious coda that hits the same swooning heights Cass McCombs did last year on ""You Saved My Life"".</p>
<p>The pace on <i>Libraries</i> is more measured and the mood more muted, however, which means nothing here hits with the same immediacy as the first record's ""Lalita"" or ""Sparxxx"". Where the debut tapped the effervescent spirit of Merseybeat and the wintergreen harmonies of Dexys Midnight Runners, <i>Libraries</i> nods more to Burt Bacharach, and the record can sag occasionally under the drowsy weight of his influence. Of the album's 10 songs, only the trashcan percussion of ""Heart to Tell"" and the bone-crack backbeat of ""Brittany's Back"" match the debut's ragged exuberance. Others, like ""Horophones"", are well-meaning, well-written mid-tempo tunes that lack an animating spirit. McLamb is still a fantastically talented pop songwriter, though, one with the unerring ability to write melodies that seem to have tumbled out in a spontaneous rush of joy, and several songs here-- the lazy-Sunday-stroll shuffle of ""Anthrophobia"", for instance-- reveal this talent operating at its peak.</p></div>"|14464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14464-libraries/|7.1|Jayson Greene
