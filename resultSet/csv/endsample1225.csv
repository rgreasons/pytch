    portrayals of crucifixions and weeping Marys one finds in any museum.  The rise to auto-complete ubiquity
    of the term ""emo"" underscores this point, not so much in regards to the term reflecting any sort of new
    stylistic genre (it doesn't), but through the word's usefulness as a shorthand for artists taking the easy
    route to publicly bleed out their pain.  Given the traffic jam of acoustic-strumming songweepers striving
    to make their exes feel guilty, it's amazing that there remain a few creative ways of expressing the
    universal pain of heartbreak without succumbing to easy clichés like ""the universal pain of heartbreak.""</p><p>
    Recent months have served up two dandies from that latter group, in Michel Gondry's film <i>Eternal Sunshine
    of the Spotless Mind</i>, and The Wind-Up Bird's ornate, searing album <i>Whips</i>.  Despite extensively
    different approaches-- one being Charlie Kaufman's latest gambit to sneak sci-fi past the hipsters, the
    other being a 40-minute slab of instrumental post-rock via laptop-- both trace strikingly similar paths
    through the seven-step recovery wilderness of The Breakup.  I'll try not to give anything of substance
    away herein, but suffice to say they're so thematically and structurally aligned, you could probably play
    <i>Whips</i> underneath the movie like <i>The Dark Side of Oz</i>.</p><p>
    That a vocal-less album can keep pace with a two-hour soundie is quite the accomplishment, though the
    Murakami-inspired duo that makes up The Wind-Up Bird cheat a bit with the tracklist, constructing the
    eight song titles from the eleven-word Dear John voicemail that sets the record's tone.  It's a pretension
    play that should send emophobes into paroxysms, but such a tissue-grabber move reflects the duo's
    catharsis-by-immersion goals, right down to the gritty move of interweaving the actual phone message
    into the central track.  The sound may be closest to ambient, but this record is far from easy listening.</p><p>
    Musically, Joseph Grimm and Jeff Smith spend most of their time slowly approaching and drifting away from
    crescendo points, stirring up brews of mournful violin, somber trumpet, plucked guitar, and Powerbook
    shimmers.  Peaceful, gauzy moments like the chiming loops of ""Become"" come laced with foreboding
    undercurrents, while discordant, disquieting hard drive noise (as on ""You"") yields to resigned and
    exhausted string and keyboard epilogues.  You don't need an English Lit background to see through the
    symbolism; The Wind-Up Bird is translating the ebb and flow of romance into musical notes, and despite
    the idea's on-paper corniness (and perhaps because of its wordless nature), it succeeds against all odds.</p><p>
    Track most likely to recreate that punched-in-the-gut feeling you had the week you spent curled up in an
    afghan on the floor of your bedroom?  ""This"", wherein Grimm and Smith initially present the ex-girlfriend's
    sobbing send-off message straight, before slowly alchemizing it into jagged white noise.   The track is
    one of the more effective transmutations of emotion into music I've heard, a musical representation of all
    the scariest parts of The Breakup's aftermath: the self-mutilation phase, the tearing up the old photos
    and letters phase, the restraining order phase.  That ""Monster"", the peaceful resolution immediately
    following, sort of resembles ""Theme from Frodo and Sam Sharing a Tender Moment in the Wilderness"" does
    little to undercut the fierce reflux pain of this brutal climax.</p><p>
    Both of <i>Whips</i>' uninterrupted LP-side-long ""movements"" follow this same path, with the first,
    five-track one more memorable due to the presence of ""This"".  By excruciatingly painting both the light
    and dark tones of a relationship's spectrum, the album's message dovetails nicely with that of <i>Eternal
    Sunshine</i>, both concluding that the good times and bad times of love are mutually essential, the
    emotional equivalent of a pop song's loud/soft dynamics.  That such a message seems Hallmark-obvious in
    words is beside the point; that each person has to go through their own pain and joy-filled journey to
    learn it is something that Grimm, Smith, Gondry, and Kaufmann understand, and translate masterfully to
    their respective media for all us current and former sad sacks.</p></div>"|8771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8771-whips/|8.5|Rob Mitchum

When Brent DiCrescenzo reviewed <i>The Moon &amp;
    Antarctica</i> for Pitchfork in 2000, he awarded it a 9.8, nearly the highest rating possible and one
    that I second with only quibbling reservations.  Four years later, Epic Records has re-released the album
    in an ""expanded and remastered edition"" that begs the question: Why?</p><p>
    
    More ambitious in sound, if not in theme, than any of its predecessors, <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> revealed
    frontman Isaac Brock's emotional and existential doubts to be as desolate and tundraic as its two title
    geographies.  Simultaneously far-out abstract and achingly personal, it was a complex, inquisitive record,
    yet for every question Brock asked, he discovered a confounding infinity of even more questions.  From all
    these conundrums he fashioned a bleak, angry philosophy about God, life, death, and his own and others'
    dwindling self-worth.</p><p>
    
    Nothing has happened since the album's release to alter that view very dramatically, but in light of the
    2000 election, September 11th, the ""war"" on terror, and <i>The Passion of The Christ</i>, <i>The Moon &amp;
    Antarctica</i> has only deepened in meaning and relevance.  It may be mere hindsight, but these 15 songs
    seem charged with vaguely political undercurrents of anti-corporate discomfort and antiglobalist isolation,
    particularly in songs like ""A Different City"", ""Paper Thin Walls"", and ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"".  How do
    you secure your own identity, Brock wonders, when everything you buy, watch, listen to, or experience already
    defines you to others?  How do you find a space that hasn't already been branded with a logo?  Or, in his
    own words: ""Does anybody know a way that a body could get away?""  The moon and Antarctica appear to be the
    last pure, untouched places within reach that can offer genuine isolation-- even though there's been an
    American flag planted on lunar soil for about 35 years now.</p><p>
    
    In light of this new relevance, the band's decision to license ""Gravity Rides Everything"" to a Nissan Quest
    commercial seems like a case of can't-beat-'em-join-'em.  Perhaps it's an act of infiltration (do lyrics like,
    ""As fruit drops, flesh it sags,"" and, ""When we die, some sink and some lay"" really sell minivans?).  Or maybe
    the band just needed the money to pay the rent.  Does it really matter?  Only in the sense that this commercial
    is most likely the impetus behind this reissue.</p><p>
    
    But why re-release a new version of an album that's only four years old?  Has it been remastered and expanded
    enough to warrant the $12 price tag?  Well, for starters, the artwork is different.  The reissue has a new
    arctic-blue and orange motif highlighted with machine blueprints (reminiscent of 1999's <i>Building Nothing
    Out of Something</i>), satellite photography, and a cover image that resembles a corroded hipbone.  While I
    applaud the band for jettisoning the original shaking-hands cover art, which was silly in an early-80s Pink
    Floyd way, the new packaging-- the design of which was again overseen by Mary Maurer-- looks too abstract,
    muted, and minimalist, with no new liner notes, documentary photographs, or much of anything to bolster the
    product.</p><p>
    
    More important than the new visuals, the sound of <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> has been reworked, and while
    I doubt there have been any great strides in audio technology that would render the original primitive,
    there is a noticeable difference between the two versions. The new one puts more texture in Brock's guitars,
    more layers in his vocals; Jeremiah Green's drums are a little higher in the mix, with a lot more high-hat
    ride.  Overall, the sound is sharper and much more dynamic-- <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> is now a headphones
    album.</p><p>
    
    And finally, there are the four bonus tracks-- a curious move, as the last thing this 15-strong LP needed
    was more material.  Regardless, the set gives us BBC radio 1 session versions of three album cuts and an
    instrumental version of a track from 1996's <i>This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About</i>.
    The live-in-the-studio approach doesn't add much to ""3rd Planet"", more or less a note-for-note re-creation
    of the original (save the bleeped-out ""f--kin' people over""), but ""Perfect Disguise"" adds a watery effect
    to Brock's vocals and turns the song into a darker, if less lonely-sounding, dirge.  Only ""Tiny Cities Made
    of Ashes"" sounds markedly different, and that's mostly due to Brock forgetting the words and laughing
    into his microphone.</p><p>
    
    But why such paltry offerings?  Why not a second disc of outtakes, remixes, demos, and live tracks?  Certainly,
    there's a wealth of material floating around from these sessions: the <i>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour
    Tricks</i> EP contains seven non-album tracks (including the beautiful ""Night on the Sun"") and an extended
    ""I Came as a Rat"".  Or why not include the upcoming tour-only bootleg <i>Baron von Bullshit Rides Again</i>?
    On the surface, this near-deluxe edition of a still-mindblowing album should be a godsend to Modest Mouse
    fans, but no one was really asking for it, and there's simply not enough here to justify the expense or
    even a rating as high as the original.  Truly, the fact that this edition raises so many uneasy questions
    is the sort of cosmic joke that Brock and his bandmates can really appreciate.</p></div>"|5362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5362-the-moon-antarctica-expanded-edition/|5.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    a bovine species that was nearly eradicated as the country expanded westward.  These three words are perfectly
    suited to the band's music, which finds inspiration in what Greil Marcus called ""the old weird America,"" a
    country of dark corners and decaying glory.</p><p>
    
    In the mid-90s, when all ears seemed directed toward Seattle, the trio of Grant-Lee Phillips, Paul Kimble,
    and Joey Peters were doing their own thing, making music-- especially on their first two albums, <i>Fuzzy</i>
    and <i>Mighty Joe Moon</i>-- that evoked a strange Americana, like an ivy-encrusted mansion with water-stained
    wallpaper, flaking paint, and shutters hanging askew.  It was a haven for fans whose tweed was wearing thin
    at the elbows, who wore their trousers rolled.</p><p>
    
    But a decade later, the foundation of that house has weakened, the wiring has short-fused, and the pipes
    have rusted through.  <i>Storm Hymnal: Gems from the Vault of Grant Lee Buffalo</i>, originally released
    in Britain in 2001, gathers 16 tracks from their four albums on one disc called <i>Takes</i> and 14 rarities
    and acoustic versions on a second disc entitled <i>Double Takes</i>.  The collection reveals a band whose
    moment has passed and whose songs have aged in wildly varying degrees.</p><p>
    
    Tracks like ""Fuzzy"", ""The Shining Hour"", and ""Truly, Truly"" hold up well enough, and the lovely melodies of
    ""Arousing Thunder"" and ""Mockingbirds"" never get old.  Other songs have taken on new and deeper meanings in
    the intervening years.  ""Stars 'n' Stripes"", for instance, sounds creepily prescient, its chorus a portent
    of the current fascination with reality TV: ""Got you on my handycam/ Fits in my hand.""  What was originally
    a reference to the old superstition that cameras could steal souls has become a kind of twisted come-on, a
    promise wrapped in a threat.</p><p>
    
    But for all their loaded imagery, many of the songs are surprisingly only vaguely political.  During Grant
    Lee Buffalo's heyday, Phillips viewed America's ills-- same as now: militias, religious zealotry, industrial
    rampage, etc.-- as deeply rooted in history and in a strange national psychosis.  But he was never a Woody
    Guthrie, a Bob Dylan, or a Bruce Springsteen: His approach tends to supercede his politics and even his
    music, such that his political agenda is usually muddled or overly obvious, as in ""Bethlehem Steel"", when
    he describes the light of a welder's torch guiding industrial tycoons like magi to Pennsylvania.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't help that the band's production today sounds so cumbersome, its mountaintop guitars weighing down
    the melodies and instruments (especially on <i>Copperopolis</i>) and often forestalling any spontaneity.
    Maybe that's why the <i>Double Takes</i> disc is livelier and more engaging for both the band and the
    listener.  Songs like ""We're Coming Down"" and especially the three alternate acoustic tracks from <i>Fuzzy</i>
    sound more off-the-cuff and personal, unbowed by too much production.  They're imperfect, but in these
    flaws lies the charm missing on some of the band's more single-worthy songs.</p><p>
    
    In a sense, it's ironic that any band's outtakes should overshadow its most popular music.  On the other
    hand, Grant Lee Buffalo were interested in America's secret history, so it seems only natural that the
    band's own secret history be more interesting than its public one, and that its neglected, dusty corners
    bear more treasure than its well-trod footpaths.</p></div>"|3553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3553-storm-hymnal-gems-from-the-vault-of-grant-lee-buffalo/|6.7|Stephen M. Deusner

The set they     played that night has long been available on poor-quality bootlegs, and though I've never heard any of those     bootlegs, I cannot imagine how the sound quality could be any worse than on this official release.  Sometimes     it actually sounds as if the tape were slowing down, and various instruments have that weird, warbly sound     that one associates with old cassette tapes well along the way to becoming spaghetti.  Still, the novelty     of hearing these by-now overly familiar songs in these lo-fi, round-robin, coffee-house renditions has a     certain charm that is at times both poignant and illuminating.  And the stage banter, always a key selling     point with any live Velvets album, is suitably deadpan and entertaining.</p>
<p>""Waiting for My Man"" opens the set.  The traditional, scene-setting Moe Tucker drum kick-in being unavailable,     Cale opts for traipsing in with an almost comically earnest school-recital piano figure.  Reed, the star     pupil, seems to be concentrating on his Sinatra-esque phrasing at the expense of his strumming, but he's     in rare form with the quips.  Before ""Berlin"", he tells the French people, ""This is my Barbra Streisand     song.""  Before ""Wild Child"", he explains, ""This is about a wild child, funnily enough.""  The mandatory     ""Heroin"" is given a decent read, Cale sawing away on his viola, and ""Black Angel's Death Song"", arranged     for viola and acoustic guitar, turns out to be laugh-out-loud funny.</p>
<p>Cale takes center stage after some extended tuning, and some frustratingly inaudible off-mike conferencing     with Reed (this is often better than the stage banter), before running through a song off <i>Vintage     Violence</i>, and two previously unreleased numbers: ""The Biggest, Loudest, Hairiest Group of All"", which     sounds like one of those old Peter, Paul &amp; Mary sing-along children's songs, and ""Empty Bottles"", a stately     love song he originally wrote for Jennifer Warnes.  This last song is the first genuinely moving moment of     the entire set.  Of course, Lou pipes up: ""Anybody got a straw?""</p>
<p>The boys kick in with ""Femme Fatale"" soon after, without Nico, as if they didn't trust her to talk on-mike,     but they have to stop as she misses her cue.  You can hear her sigh audibly and give a little embarrassed     laugh before the song restarts.  Her singing is so careful, it's clear that she's terrified.  She doesn't     have Reed's above-it-all snottiness, or Cale's formal detachment to hide behind.  Her gift, such as it is,     is pure human sadness unadulterated by irony.  The song ends, the crowd finally goes nuts, and rightfully     so.  She is the evening's entrée.</p>
<p>She does three of her own songs next, ending with a literally gut-wrenching version of ""Janitor of Lunacy"":     She erupts in a fit of coughing for almost a full-minute after the song ends.  Then, Reed, as if he didn't     deign to speak directly to Nico, instructs Cale, ""Uh, John, have Nico tell them this is the last song.""     More coughing, then finally Nico recovers and is back at the mike.  The crowd cheers her on.  ""I want to     sing the last song now.  If I can,"" she says in her halting English, ""I try my best.""  After a beat, she     feels compelled to add, ""I don't smoke cigarettes.""  ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" is the song.  Nico's voice is     wrecked, the sound is crummy, but somehow, with Reed and Cale propping her up with two-part harmonies, and     finally wrenching substantial sounds from their acoustics, it's an incredibly affecting, heroic rendition.     The encore (""All Tomorrow's Parties"") can't touch it, but gives the audience a chance to exhale.</p>
<p>If you collect fine-art photography, you probably won't care much for this record.  It's under-rehearsed,     poorly recorded, and the uneven performances range from the sublime to the incoherent.  But if you appreciate     the fleeting revelations to be found in snapshots, then this may be just the bit of quicksilver for you, a     unique moment in musical history just before these three erstwhile Jekylls became forever Hydes.</p></div>"|6737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6737-bataclan-72/|7.6|Philip Shelley

    sophomore effort, <i>Atlas</i>.  The song, titled ""El Presidente"", is meant as a jab at Mexican president
    Vicente Fox's noncommittal politics, but could easily apply to the band as well.  Kinky refuse to define
    themselves by genre, generation, or nationality; with rash splashes of funk, electronica, batucada, and
    good, old-fashioned guitar rock, they throw a Technicolor tantrum that shows the up side of globalization.
    As the name implies, Kinky's swing isn't rough trade or edgy fetishism: Simply put, this five-piece out of
    Monterey-- Mexico's gritty, thriving industrial center-- make dancefloor ear candy balanced by a refreshingly
    giddy naivete and sophisticated, hip-shaking rhythmic approach.  Though <i>Atlas</i> doesn't bring the same
    sexed-up potency as their self-titled debut, its No World Border pastiche pushes the band a step further on
    the international stage and proves these guys are serious about their fun.</p><p>
    Where their first album featured dense, sequenced keyboard textures, <i>Atlas</i> finds Kinky making
    electronic music that genuinely rocks, and like French house-funk outfit RixF4çérôse, they take up guitars
    as their weapon of choice.  Producer Chris Allison (Beta Band, Coldplay) plays a major role in icing down
    the band's sound, never sapping the life from these snappy, crystal-clean barnburners.  Lead guitarist
    Carlos Chaires gets substantial facetime on tracks like ""Do U Like It?"", a blazing instrumental propelled
    by timbale breakbeats, and ""Salta-Lenin-El-Atlas"", with its wicked Brazilian rhythm, vocoded chorus, and
    Cesar Pliego's fuzzy, distorted bass.  Cake vocalist John McCrea makes an appearance as ""The Headphonist"",
    his straight-faced narrative backed by bright horn samples, swollen organ, and percussionist Omar Gongora's
    incessant cumbia beat.  Suffice to say, Cake's funk-pop sensibility and ironic intellectual bent clearly
    rubbed off on Kinky during 2002's Unlimited Sunshine tour.</p><p>
    Opening with a radio rock riff and bouncy bass, ""Airport Feelings"" gets a trumpet treatment as Cereso croons,
    ""Now your skin is my runway/ I'm ready for a landing."" It's on these English-language songs that the band's
    youthful, wide-eyed charm renders some rather poetic concepts somewhat goofy and cloying.  ""My God Is So
    Quiet,"" goes one song, ""that sometimes I can't hear him when he speaks loud.""  ""Not Afraid"" strings together
    stoneriffic musings like, ""They say that rugs are just floor with overgrown hair/ And the broom is the comb/
    The vacuum is the blow dryer.""  Cute and clever, if shallow, these lyrics might better be rendered in Spanish--
    Cereso is far more articulate in his native tongue.</p><p>
    The two tracks with the sharpest melodic focus are standouts for both their uniqueness within the album's
    context and as truly memorable, progressive pop compositions: ""Minotauro"" bumps Far East tabla up against
    South-of-the-border rocanrol with humming synthlines, a hard-rock bridge, and a sunny, blissed-out chorus.
    Meanwhile, the album's closer, ""Semillas De Menta"", plays like a bossa nova lullaby, a total departure from
    the dancefloor dynamite which it follows.</p><p>
    A band with incredible talent and potential for mass appeal, Kinky is too infatuated with their multi-culti
    influences and all-inclusive musical ethic to pull together the cohesive, definitive opus they may be capable
    of.  The relentless touring and explosive, sweat-drenched live shows they're known for should continue to
    refine their sound.  Hopefully, it won't drain their machismo.</p></div>"|4574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4574-atlas/|7.2|Jonathan Zwickel

    Mego.  Sitting in for Dick York is Dick Sargent, for Valerie Harper is Sandy Duncan, and for everyone else,
    Mister Ted McGinley.</p><p>
    Ted: Thanks for reading the bottom review, folks.  Let's get things started with the topic which must be on
    everybody's mind: As they near the ten year mark, when exactly did Mego stop putting out stimulating,
    quality computer music that showcased international artists and set their ideas in the best light?  Starting
    with the man introduced in television series <i>Bewitched</i> with little or no explanation, Dick Sargent.
    Dick, when did Mego jump the shark?</p><p>
    Dick: Well, Ted, I'm going to go with the highly ambitious but ultimately impenetrable and boring Farmers
    Manual RLA DVD set, compiling nearly four days worth of audience fuckery audio files, all live.  Christ,
    there were MP3s on that over three hours long!  What were they thinking?  Didn't they realize what this
    technology would mean to Phish-heads?</p><p>
    Sandy Duncan: Well, any label that releases a Jim O'Rourke CD is sending a warning sign.  Creatively, it
    screams, ""We are grasping at straws.""</p><p>
    Ted: Excellent point, Sandy.  Incidentally, Sandy Duncan heads up the new season of the recently renamed
    hit show, <i>The Hogan Family</i>, on NBC this fall.  Now, Mego's most recent release is <i>Semi Peterson</i>
    by the Swedish group Sluta Leta.  Or at least, they were Swedish until this release, when all the original
    members were replaced by Mego employees General Magic and Gerhard Potuznik.</p><p>
    Dick: This is a bad sign right off the bat.  While General Magic put out an endearing, whimsical title early
    in the Mego label's storied catalog, their follow-up, <i>Rechenkönig</i>, was just not fun.  And Potuznik's
    CD on the label was held back for years, an obvious stinker right out of the gate.</p><p>
    Sandy: The 12-inches Sluta Leta put out on Mego, Cheap, and Chocolate Industries were lively, but I don't
    know if I should be commending the Swedes or the Austrians.  Either way, this time, the record is named
    after a Swedish race car driver from the 70s, Ronnie Peterson.</p><p>
    Ted: That's right, Sandy, they called him ""The King of Drift"" back in the day.  Similarly, this disc is all
    over the place, causing horrendous accidents left and right.  It starts with those damned digital skips that
    have become so routine, neither brutal enough to become the point nor long enough to be anything more than
    something left on the hard drive floor.  That is, given that hard drive's don't have floors, per se...</p><p>
    Dick: ""Forests of the Moon"" can't figure out what to do with its boom-tick, opting for faceless new-wave
    voice-overs, while ""Smakfull Basmusik"" can only muster up the most inane of stuttering canned beats, which
    it vomits up over and over and over again.  It's too bad, as most of drummer DD Kern's peppy beats could
    power the thing alone.  ""Yea Song"" is fun for its two-minute drive time, but that's before they decide to
    return to the gimpy glitches with ""Flash"".  There's no hope of the disc getting steady after that.</p><p>
    Ted: The noises themselves show that they're just not trying.  That rubberband bass sound they resurrect on
    ""Vissna Bort"", while invoking all that is unholy, isn't as awful as the karaoke crooning that accompanies
    it.</p><p>
    Sandy: The guest vocals are truly abysmal, be they by the Austrians or their friends.  Remember, when you
    have guests on, or any special episodes, or you adopt a new child-character, that's a definite ""red flag""
    for far deeper problems.  ""Super Swede"" falls asleep on its digital accordion and programmed bongos while
    guest vocalist Catriona Shaw crawls through the mess.  She makes it up on the backing vocals to ""Förjaga"",
    but by then it's much too late.</p><p>
    Ted: Agreed.  Maybe it's the writing by committee or something, but no one can figure out a direction, much
    less finish a track.  Nothing is abrasive or abstract enough to work on those terms, and what intends to be
    danceable gets undercut by its own mischievous production.  Sluta Leta, wherever they may be from, can't
    decide on a decent set of vocals or an ability to turn the half-baked beats into actual pop songs with
    catchy words.</p><p>
    Sandy: And the surest sign of doom-- be it for television shows, recording groups, or music publications--
    is when the writing goes down the tubes.  There's no going back then.</p></div>"|7745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7745-semi-peterson/|3.4|Andy Beta

    of your futon, slurping tea from a chipped mug, absent-mindedly fiddling with an old acoustic guitar and
    scribbling words into a coverless notebook.  He is always chewing on a pencil, and when he talks, his
    words come slow.</p><p>
    
    Shake it off.  While the idea of Sam Beam tugging at your afghan might seem perfectly inviting, it's
    actually just dangerous: the traditions and artists of the American south have long been fetishized
    and vilified with equal fervor, and, perhaps appropriately, both the region and its inhabitants are
    starting to assume near-cartoonish proportions in print and onscreen.  Unsurprisingly, Iron and Wine's
    grubby campfire hymns are subject to the very same kind of blind, moonlight-heavy romanticizing-- which
    might make swallowing a new, gently-buffed Iron and Wine album doubly difficult.  Picture crisp, fuzz-free
    vocals and gently brushed snares shooting like darts, incisive and stinging, each chiseled tip dipped in
    hot studio poison: This is not the Iron and Wine of yesteryear.</p><p>
    
    When <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> puttered quietly out of Sub Pop's warehouse in 2002, it was stupidly
    easy to be tugged into the quasi-escapist, heavily idealized portrait of Beam-as-basement-troubadour-- a
    bearded, southern, ""down home"" father of two with a cardboard box full of shitty equipment and an unassuming
    shoulder shrug.  The whimsical inadvertence of Beam's debut-- and the vague sense that the composition and
    realization of <i>Creek</i> were just as profound and accidental as the record's eventual distribution--
    lent Beam's work a dangerous edge of serendipity.  Listening to <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> felt like
    accidentally digging up a diamond, clutching it briefly in a soil-streaked palm, and then shoving it deep
    into your front pocket, eyes shooting around suspiciously.  Nobody who found it ever wanted to give it up.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <i>The Sea and the Rhythm</i> EP, which featured five previously unreleased <i>Creek</i> tracks,
    saw Iron and Wine maintaining his four-track sigh, bringing his hissing home-studio work to a glorious,
    satisfying end.  For <i>Our Endless Numbered Days</i>, Beam darted out of his basement and into Chicago's
    Engine Studios, and the resulting record sees Beam taking a satisfying break from air-conditioner-as-rhythm-section:
    Producer Brian Deck (Califone, Fruit Bats, Holopaw) folds in twittering percussive bits, while sister Sarah
    Beam coos sweet harmonies and bandmates Jonathan Bradley, EJ Holowicki, Jeff McGriff, and Patrick McKinney
    provide ample backing.  <i>Our Endless Numbered Days</i> is cleaner, more diverse, and generally sparser
    than its predecessor, and, given the apparent limits of Beam's former setup, it's also an astoundingly
    progressive record: Beam has successfully transgressed his cultural pigeonhole without sacrificing any of
    his dusty allure.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""On Your Wings"" mixes Beam's pert guitar picks with rolling slide; scraps of percussion gradually
    fold in, vocals fall off, and the band somersaults into a comparably raucous mini-jam.  In ""Naked as We
    Came"", Beam nods to the album's enigmatic title, softly lamenting mortality (""One of us will die inside
    these arms/ Eyes wide open, naked as we came/ One of us will spread our ashes around the yard"") over
    <i>Creek</i>-ish acoustic strums, while Sarah whispers along, her barely audible murmurs more haunting for
    their delicacy.  ""Each Coming Night"" is instantly moving, perfectly hinged on a bubblegum melody, while
    ""Sodom, South Georgia"" nails gothic disquiet both on and off the page (""All dead white boys say, 'God is
    good'/ White tongues hang out, 'God is good'"").</p><p>
    
    Studio tweaking aside, there's another, more subtle tonal flip here: Beam's lyrics, once dribbling over
    with issues of faith and fidelity, are distinctly more guarded, a switch which seems inextricably linked
    to the relative (and unexpected) ubiquity of his debut.  <i>Creek</i> was full of gently whispered secrets,
    each tiny, grinning confession or perverse admission only adding to the record's furtive charms.  A sizable
    audience might not have been part of Beam's songwriting equation before, but it is now-- and while <i>Our
    Endless Numbered Days</i>' lacquered cuts might seem slightly more transparent at first, their lyrics are
    infinitely more obscured, heavy with their own predestined publicity.  Now, Beam juggles bits of dialogue
    (over half of these tracks feature extra speakers; ""Naked as We Came"" and ""Each Coming Night"" both focus
    almost exclusively on clips of conversation), painstakingly easing himself out of the narrator's chair,
    and voicing what would otherwise be some wincingly maudlin bits (see ""I want your flowers like babies want
    God's love"").</p><p>
    
    Obviously, none of this makes Beam any less of a poet; if anything, Beam's freshly veiled lyrics have simply
    pushed Iron and Wine toward more subversive levels of storytelling. The song-as-poem critical course has
    been applied to Beam before, but the accuracy of the analogy never wanes: Beam and Deck toy with syntax and
    meter, using shaky bits of percussion, volume shifts, and tempo changes to mimic the twitchy movement of the
    best epic poetry.  In the past, Beam's lyrics have proved his linguistic prowess, but it's the eerie
    lyricism of the instrumentation that ultimately pushes <i>Our Endless Numbered Days</i> deep into the canon
    of American verse.</p><p>
    
    Slavic poet Charles Simic talks about poetry as ""a table on which one places interesting things one has
    found on one's walks: a pebble, a rusty nail, a strangely shaped root, the corner of a torn photograph.""
    And it's in this sense that Beam is, above all else, a poet: His tabletops are littered with gritty little
    snapshots of life well-lived, strewn with tender acoustic strums, pictures of the ocean, shaken maracas,
    mothers, fathers, arms.  It's a beautiful display.</p></div>"|4127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4127-our-endless-numbered-days/|8.6|Amanda Petrusich

    have stretched to include a bucketful of lame euphemisms for ""nice""-- check the ever-ubiquitous ""soothing,""
    the half-assed ""sweet,"" or the just-barely-a-compliment ""effortless.""  Much like scoffing at the Pernice
    Brothers' super-syrupy pop, it's awfully easy to unconsciously deride the Brooklyn-by-way-of-L.A. folk
    collective Ill Lit for being stupidly comforting, particularly given their tendency to reassure in geeky,
    predictable ways-- with gentle acoustic guitars, quivering strings, and soft, honeyed warbles.  In ""The
    Passing Lights"", vocalist/songwriter Daniel Ahearn hungrily indicts a lost lover as ""too cute to be trusted,""
    and it's impossible not to wonder if Ahearn's felt the brunt of that sentiment himself, instantly dismissed
    for his band's sometimes overwhelming palatability.</p><p>
    
    Being called earnest may no longer seem like very much of a compliment, but Ill Lit are still a defiantly
    compelling band, with generous, lilting melodies, evocative lyrics, and low, salty guitars, all sunsets and
    cacti, highways and road soda.  Like country/folk/electronic brethren the Fruit Bats and Holopaw, Ill Lit
    attempt to temper their twang with bits of synth and stray 808 beats, building toward a vaguely more accurate
    version of Americana, with technology and human hands quietly colliding and pushing toward an agreeable
    medium.  Although <i>I Need You</i> is significantly less synthetic than its predecessor, 2002's blip-heavy
    <i>WACMusic</i>, the communion of steel strings and hardware feels more serendipitous this time, with
    rickety Moog lines petering in and out, drum machines fading into actual kits, and songwriting superseding
    gimmickry.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Mid-City"" introduces Ahearn's lonesome croon, billowing out in generally striking (if unpredictable)
    ways, over a loose base of drums, spare beats, electric guitar and keyboards, ending in the perfectly perplexing
    assertion, ""I'm almost out of space here/ Cannot tell the girls from the wait staff.""  ""Spring Chicken"" is
    a pop-perfect bit of alt-country, beset by a frail, ethereal synth whisper, like a ghost shooting through
    the farm, blowing up stalks of hay before finally crashing face-first into a wall.  ""Broken Open Fence""
    starts in a fleeting haze of feedback, drifting into acoustic guitar and doubled, broken vocals, wisps of
    drone kicking up and then politely receding.</p><p>
<i>I Need You</i> is an unmistakably self-serious record, painstakingly composed and gracefully executed;
    on paper, Ill Lit's deliberate compositions may seem capable of eliciting groans from even the most
    forgiving listeners, who still can't help but wiggle away from the band's imposing sincerity.  But clench
    your fists and try for a second: If you can just swallow your knee-jerk smirk, there are things here to
    grin about.</p></div>"|4076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4076-i-need-you/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

    very hot places never became global economic forces is because of the oppressive weather.  It's just too
    damn stifling, the premise goes, for citizens to be productive.  But imagine what the people of Gabon,
    Maldives and Kiribati could accomplish if given whatever drugs are powering the sweaty but prolific Josh
    Homme, who runs his empire of rock from the sun-scorched sands of Palm Desert, California.</p><p>
    
    Homme has barely taken a breath since he left the corpse of the mighty, lumbering Kyuss rotting in the
    desert in 1997, casting a shadow over the entire, stupidly named riff-heavy sub-genre, stoner rock.  Since
    then, in only three albums' time, he's taken Queens of the Stone Age from dive club misfits in thrift store
    threads to internationally acclaimed rock stars who wear shiny shirts and win <i>Q</i> magazine readers'
    polls.  Homme has lent his vocal, guitar, percussion and production talents to acts as varied as the
    shamefully underrated melodic blues-rockers Masters of Reality, and ambient electro-Brits UNKLE.  In 2002,
    he contributed music to Jodie Foster's coming-of-age, death-by-cougar film <i>Dangerous Lives of Altar
    Boys</i>. Last year, he became a full-on impresario, inevitably founding his own label, RekordsRekords.
    And most recently, Homme has performed a reverse Grohl, jumping from frontman to drummer with his new band
    Eagles of Death Metal.</p><p>
    
    Of course, in his rare downtime, Homme invites friends over for slumber parties, packs the bong, and rolls
    the tape.  The result is the charmingly loose <i>Desert Sessions</i> series, now up to volumes 9 and 10.
    This latest installment was recorded out in Joshua Tree over eight days, and features, among others, PJ
    Harvey, Dean Ween, Twiggy Ramirez, Mark Lanegan, and Alain Johannes.  The 14 songs sound as all over the
    map as you might expect with a group so diverse, and that's exactly the point.  Sure, it's self-indulgent
    and ill-advised at times, but that's what the spirit of pure experimentation will get you.  For example,
    the throwaway ""Sheperds Pie"" is a loony-- and irritating-- a cappella hoedown, an ode to the British
    delicacy that sounds like it was recorded in the throes of cabin fever.  Mostly, though, the project hits
    all the right notes; you can tell it was a hell of a lot of fun to record, which helps you to forgive the
    rough patches and go along for the ride.</p><p>
    
    Homme puts his resin-stained fingerprint on the proceedings from the get-go, playing and/or singing on
    almost every track.  The first one, ""Dead in Love"", kicks off with a riff shamelessly stolen from Alice
    Cooper's ""School's Out"", but, with its eventual wash of dreamy, layered vocals, the song would sound at
    home on any Queens record.  The same could be said for a couple other numbers, particularly ""Holey Dime""
    and ""In My Head. Or Something"", two examples of the kind of tight, dramatic guitar rock the Queens have
    always had a knack for.</p><p>
    
    But it's PJ Harvey, not surprisingly, who dominates here, adding an air of mystery and danger.  Her haunting
    vocal couples perfectly with Homme's theatrical falsetto, and on ""Crawl Home"", the pair duet over an
    impossibly low guitar rumble.  A solo PJ track, ""There Will Never Be a Better Time"", was only ""performed
    once"", if you believe the liner notes, and it's a powerful snapshot of the immediacy of some of the sessions.
    Polly's at a peak here, crooning mournfully through a haze of reverb over a spare guitar line.</p><p>
    
    But while these PJ-fronted songs are clear standouts, the disc hits an apex with the soulfully horny Mark
    Lanegan number, ""I Wanna Make It Wit Chu"".  With rolling piano and some tasteful guitar licks courtesy of
    the great Dean Ween, the former Screaming Tree works his whiskey-seeped croak to the hilt.  Lanegan spits
    lines like: ""These mysteries of life just ain't my thing/ If I told you I knew about the sun and the moon,
    I'd be untrue/ The only thing I know for sure is what I wanna do/ I wanna make it wit chu.""  Like Ween,
    the two are tweaking a genre (bedroom soul), while also paying it homage.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, Dean Ween, who seems to know no musical barriers, figures heavily on some of the more
    out-there tracks.  He contributes what the liners call ""chickin' pickin'"" to the (almost) funky low-end
    instrumental workout ""Subcutaneous Phat"" and adds ""bizarre guitar"" to Johannes' ""weird guitar"" on the
    ancient-sounding ""Creosote"".  The latter, with its staticky edges and trashcan drum sound, could be a
    Library of Congress field recording from early last century-- proof that our forebears took mescaline and
    made music in the shadows of the cacti, too.</p><p>
    
    It must be rewarding for Homme to put out the call and see so many great musicians arrive at his doorstep
    to participate in his ongoing musical experiment.  Of course, it could be slightly more rewarding for the
    listener.  Even so, this is <i>Desert Sessions</i> strongest volume yet.  As Homme's star grows, so does
    his Rolodex-- I look forward to seeing who's invited next time.</p></div>"|2549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2549-desert-sessions-9-10/|7.4|Chris Weber

It's been a slow process of discovery for him,
    as seven years of steadily improving and diversifying output from Calexico strikingly illustrates.  On the
    band's 1997 debut, <i>Spoke</i>, he seemed almost afraid to rise above a whisper, as though he wasn't sure
    he wanted to be a frontman.  And maybe he wasn't.  At that point, Calexico were still a side project for
    Burns and John Convertino, who made their day jobs as Giant Sand's rhythm section, as well as in-demand indie
    session men.  But as the band has slowly come to outshine everything else Burns and Convertino have done,
    they seem to have gained a good deal of self-confidence-- by the time they released last year's astounding
    <i>Feast of Wire</i>, they didn't seem to be limiting themselves at all.</p><p>
    
    Though their core sound still remains the aural embodiment of the nexus between the American Southwest and
    northern Mexico, they now deviate into simmering jazz, falsetto pop, dub, ambient electronics, and anything
    else that comes to mind more or less at will, and it's resulted in a fascinating and unpredictable discography.
    Lately, Burns retreats to his old whisper only for the effect it creates, and on the band's new <i>Convict
    Pool</i> EP, he spends more time in full croon than ever before.</p><p>
    
    In relation to <i>Feast of Wire</i>, this EP is pretty musically conservative, spending most of its time
    exploring variations on the band's Tex-Mex roots through three originals and three well-chosen covers.
    Love's ""Alone Again Or"" is really a no-brainer for a band like Calexico to cover, with its baroque Sonoran
    horn parts and Spanish guitars, and the band has been playing it live for some time now.  This is the first
    time it's made it out of the studio onto a disc in the U.S., and frankly, it's the only disappointing track
    here.  They've trucked in Swedish singer/songwriter Nicolai Dunger to sing what amounts to a lead vocal, and
    while it's not a desecration of a classic or anything, it comes off a little flat.  The other two covers are
    more inspired: French singer Francoiz Breut's ""Si tu Disais"" gets a languid, waltzing read, with mariachi
    horns and pedal steel trading off the instrumental hook.  D. Boon's ""Corona"", meanwhile, from the Minutemen
    masterpiece <i>Double Nickels on the Dime</i>, gets the full borderline treatment it so richly deserves,
    his original guitar riffs transposed to the horns and violins.</p><p>
    
    It's the originals, though, that ultimately bring it all home for the fan, and the three here find the band's
    songwriting in strong, if not peak, form.  ""Praskovia"" is a twirling, equilibrium-challenged Eastern European
    wedding march for circus freaks, opening with a pretty accordion refrain before spilling over Convertino's
    rolling drums with swooping horns and wild accordion runs.  ""Sirena"" is another of the band's charging
    spaghetti Western mariachi tunes, this time with a female backing chorus and twanging Morricone guitars.
    The title track takes a second to get going, but it's Burns' best vocal showcase, as he lets himself really
    emote and follow the melody where it wants to take him on the chorus, while Convertino rolls on the mallets
    beneath him.</p><p>
    
    As a layover between albums, <i>Convict Pool</i> is just about everything a devotee might want, a brief
    appetizer that tugs lightly at the edges of the band's sound and tosses out a couple of decent covers for
    good measure.  It's place for the uninitiated to start-- that's <i>Feast of Wire</i>, or the <i>Even My
    Sure Things Fall Through</i> EP-- but it's a healthy reminder that Calexico are capable of making some
    fantastic music, even at their most casual.</p></div>"|1233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1233-convict-pool-ep/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    ideological choices, production styles and conceptual decisions.  But in the case of rappers like Cormega,
    Saigon and Murs, the line is blurred by the conflict of their unapologetically accessible subject matter
    and the dedicated individuality missing from your average mixtape emcee.  Baby Blak is one of the newest
    rappers to take on this often inconsistent paradigm with his debut <i>Once You Go Blak</i>, a pleasantly
    atypical mix of common vocal influences.</p><p>
    
    Baby Blak doesn't break much ground on his first record: He raps about ill friendship, catching bad breaks
    in life, his various sexual partners, and childhood.  But considering his more accessible style and his
    Philadelphia accent, you wouldn't necessarily expect songs about peace and economic structure.  Blak's
    style is understated and subtle, with a constantly shifting flow and a lean towards repetition that seems
    to be a way of connecting the dots to other Philly artists (Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Black Thought).</p><p>
    
    The only times the album's structure goes to the wayside is when Blak randomly and consistently references
    his dick or others'.  Practically every song has a reference to the third leg with at least two songs
    containing vivid imagery regarding the subject at hand.  Maybe it isn't as noticeable for other people,
    but I totally lost focus whenever a woodblock sound would follow up the reference, because if that sound
    is supposed to represent the performance of fellatio, it sounds like someone's doing it wrong.</p><p>
    
    Either way, Baby Blak is impressive on the mic, especially on his anti-materialist anthem, ""Diamonds
    (Diemon)"".  Riding what sounds like a smoothly chopped <i>Final Fantasy</i> sample, Blak details the
    diamond-processing industry and the crimes committed to gain these emblems of success.  He criticizes the
    distributors of these products (""Jacob don't love us, Tito don't love us"") and attacks the diamond-mining
    industry (""Made into slaves, in the caves, working all night/ So you can brag on what you paid, rocking
    your ice"") in a creative stab at conscious lyricism, making for one of a few major standouts on the album.</p><p>
    
    At first listen, Baby Blak comes off as the type of rapper that DJ Premier would gravitate toward.  Depending
    on who you ask, that can be a compliment (Nas, Guru) or an insult (Group Home).  Although the production on
    this record lacks big names or major shifts in style, the beatmakers ultimately keep this album afloat.
    There's an obvious tilt towards jazzy textures and ethereal chops, ranging from the low-toned Roots-esque
    bass groove of ""Fallin' Down"", to the echoing organ, bongos and piano stabs of ""Tasters Choice"", to the
    anthemic orchestral chops of ""Starvin' Artist"".  Sure, there's a definite lack of larger sounds and
    bombastic samples (especially for a rapper who could dominate the mixtape freestyle arena), but the
    production works to the positive side of the spectrum.</p><p>
    
    Baby Blak has some derivative subject matter, a couple of dry beats and occasionally questionable lines, but
    overall, he largely defies expectations.  For a rapper I'd expected would regularly contradict himself
    throughout his record, he never really does-- the true victory for any vaguely commercial emcee.  For those
    in the market for an intriguing style of rap with chill beats and memorable lines, Baby Blak is a name to
    look into.</p></div>"|1102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1102-once-you-go-blak/|7.3|Rollie Pemberton

    With albums as flawless as <i>Liveage!</i> and <i>Milo Goes to College</i>, and a mission statement that
    lacks the words ""reshaping"" and ""new era,"" The Descendents have never made any bones about being desperately
    teenage, despite the creep of years, family and, in Milo Aukerman's case, an actual career.  If their songs
    aren't dwelling on shitty parenting skills or unrequited affection, they're mocking the customs of the adult
    world and reveling in juvenilia.  So <i>'Merican</i> might come as a bit of a jab to the hardcore fan who
    always assumed they could count on at least one punk band to never change.</p><p>
    
    ""Nothing with You"" opens the album as a sigh of contentment over the laziness of true love, only breaking
    the illusion of a lost 80s master by mention of <i>Mad About You</i> and <i>Seinfeld</i> re-runs.  Everything's
    in place on this song, from Aukerman's pleading vocals to Stephen Egerton's quick and tidy solo, and it resonates
    as strongly and vividly as anything they've recorded previously.  But the following title song is like nothing
    they've done before.  Unfortunately, it <i>is</i> a lot like what Bad Religion's done before:  It sounds
    like that band soft shoeing a typical dismantling of the pretty picture of Americana.  To be fair, The
    Descendents take a softer tone, listing the bad (racism, Joe McCarthy) alongside the good (Mark Twain, Otis
    Redding) which makes the song more about knowing the country you love before you slide down the steep slope
    of jingoism.  An admirable effort, the song is a bright red flashing signal that the train has left the
    tracks.</p><p>
    
    The Descendents pick up the torch and tighten the slack with the other side of their love-song coin on the
    lost/never-had song ""Here with Me"", and they carry the momentum with a kinetic resignation letter in ""I
    Quit"".  As Aukerman laments time not spent with his wife and the encroaching caricature of a Mick Jagger-aged
    rocker, the band seems to barely take a breath.  It's a near-perfect capper on the stalwarts' first statement
    in seven years, and would that the album was as long as advertised.  But then the hidden track, ""Alive"",
    starts in, chasing out all the fans who stuck through the culture shock of the title track.  Being that
    ""slow"" and ""heavy"" are another two styles The Descendents have never dabbled in, the wall of sound-- complete
    with thorazine vocals and depressed riffs-- verges on smashing the band's already battered illusion.  Like
    the title track, the closer's message suggests that four guys in their 40s singing hymns to teenage love
    and caffeinated excess is the sanest choice to make.</p></div>"|2546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2546-merican-ep/|6.9|Christopher Sebela

As the name implied, the Amalgam Universe brought together the two most dominant and popular comic factions-- Marvel and DC-- and all of their respective characters, styles and quirks.  The long-awaited collaboration between producer/emcees Madlib and MF Doom, <em>Madvillainy</em> is the <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em> of rap, a tense mainstream-meets-indie, avant-meets-antique melee that, as the opening sample suggests, plays on a ""seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings.""</p><p> <strong>""MADVILLAIN: RETARDED HARD COPY""</strong></p><p>  In November 2002, Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib) went south to Brazil on business.  For the trip, he compiled two mix CDs of beats and unfinished tracks: one stored his collaborations with Detroit's Jay Dee; the second held work with Brooklyn's Daniel Dumile (aka MF Doom).  As a true testament to both fidelity's fragility and the power of file-sharing, both discs leaked a few months later, giving birth to a logical buzz, but more importantly, heightening expectations to impossible heights; these demos were pretty fucking tight.  If ""Peeyano Keys"" and ""Powerball #5"" were just rough drafts, what could be expected of the completed project?</p><p>  Undoubtedly, Madlib and Doom felt the pressure.  The leak seemed to be a huge kick in the ass, especially for Madlib, who in the past few years has been garnering the reputation of being brilliant and prolific, but distracted: His <em>Blunted in the Bomb Shelter</em> mix (rumored to have been concocted in less than a day), Blue Note-sampling <em>Shades of Blue</em>, and even the Jaylib collaboration are fresh, but sloppy and often unfocused.  <em>Madvillainy</em> is anything but: The samples are smart and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs.</p><p> <strong>""Wild guess, you can say he stay sedated.""</strong></p><p>  One of the noticeable differences between the unauthorized promo and the final burn of the album is a change in vocal tone from Doom, which has shifting from an excited, measured performance to a slower, scratchier and ultimately better-suited delivery, considering Madlib's low-key, bass-oriented production.  Some people take the new chilled delivery as somehow inferior to the old incarnation, but taken in context, the album benefits from the re-recording, particularly in cases were Doom re-arranges couplets to optimize his punchlines (""Meat Grinder"") or adds new lines altogether (""Figaro"").</p><p> <strong>""Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion.""</strong></p><p>  Doom's acknowledgement of Madlib's accordion sample (the same one Daedelus used on 2002's <em>Invention</em>) is the most obvious instance of <em>Madvillainy</em>'s lyrics/production integrity, but the album is chock full of them.  For a collaboration which the duo has described as something ""like a telepathy thing.  There wasn't a lot of talking,"" Madlib and Doom, proponents of two distinctive hip-hop styles, are of one unusually strong mind.</p><p> <strong>""Mad plays the bass like the race card.""</strong></p><p>  The axis of <em>Madvillainy</em> is Otis Jackson Jr.'s production.  While Doom's entire career has been shadowed by consistently strong production efforts, never has such chemistry developed between him and another beatmaker.  From the unbelievable <em>Castlevania</em>-meets-<em>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle</em> piano chase music of ""Supervillain Theme"" to the shifting keyboard jazz suite of ""Great Day"" to the dark chamber bass, timbales and jump-cut ukulele plucks of ""Meat Grinder"", Madlib proves himself as much more than just a loop digger, topping his best work on Quasimoto's <em>The Unseen</em> with an album of consistently incredible beat work.  And it isn't just the beats that make the partnership work so well: The character of his vocal samples and the smoothness of his song-to-song segues make this album individual to the styles of both artists-- a difference that puts this pairing far ahead of similarly talented teams like Rjd2 and Blueprint's Soul Position.</p><p> <strong>""Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in.""</strong></p><p>  Both Doom's and Madlib's myriad aliases make sparkling cameo appearances on <em>Madvillainy</em>, most notably on ""America's Most Blunted"", in which Madlib bickers with alter-ego Quasimoto, and on ""Fancy Clown"", which features Dumile as Viktor Vaughn.  Here, Vaughn steams on an ex-girlfriend's unfaithfulness-- but she's cheating with Metalface, another Dumile alias.  It's a brilliant conceit, and perhaps makes ""Fancy Clown"" hip-hop's first schizophrenic self-diss track.</p><p> <strong>""Hey you: Don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it.""</strong></p><p>  Okay, so maybe that's a little harsh.  Although the guest appearances from the Stones Throw massive are Jackson Jr.'s take on label-based self-aggrandizement, they never disrupt the album's flow, and never say anything too stupid (Medaphoar even garners a laugh on ""Raid"" with, ""My niggas take 'no' like Kobe"").  Still, it helps that these extraneous verses are few and far between; most listeners would likely have preferred an additional Doom cut instead, or at least an appearance from Doom's Monsta Island Czars.</p><p> <strong>""Spit so many verses, sometimes my jaw twitches/ One thing this party could use is more... booze.""</strong></p><p>  When much of the underground often aspires to Truth and Something Bigger, Madlib and Doom have always seemed content to be quirky through and through, lightly roasting themselves and subverting the genre itself to brilliant effect.  Like in the above quote from ""Great Day"": The rhyme's pattern and rap's topical stereotype demands the word ""bitches,"" yet Doom hilariously says ""booze"" instead.  Or on ""Money Folder"", in which Doom starts off, ""Don't mind me, I won't just rhyme lightly off of two or three Heinies,"" but flips beers to babes midway: ""And boy was they fine, G: One black, one Spanish, one Chi-nee.""</p><p> <strong>""The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard.""</strong></p><p> <em>Madvillainy</em> is inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of carefully considered yet immediate hip-hop, forward-thinking but always close to its roots.  Madlib and Doom are individually at their most refined here, and together, they've created one of the most exciting blockbuster alliances in the underground to date.  Good luck finding a better hip-hop album this year, mainstream, undie, or otherwise.</p><p> </p></div>"|5579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/|9.4|Rollie Pemberton & Nick Sylvester

    Pharrell Williams.</p><p>
    
    Pharrell Williams wears a diamond and gold skateboard around his neck.  Ingrid Sisley kisses him on the
    cheek.  Supermodels get his voice mail.  In his spare time between writing worldwide pop hits as part of
    the Neptunes production duo, Pharrell records funk-rock with falsetto lyrics like, ""Unzip your skirt, take
    off your blouse,"" and, ""I fucked you from behind,"" with his band, N.E.R.D.  Really, Pharrell Williams is
    no way a nerd.  Not in the Eddie Deezen mold or the Harry Knowles mold or the Ramones mold.</p><p>
    
    Debating the validity of Pharrell Williams' bandname seems like a contentious trifle, but the dude
    continuously positions himself as a wide-reaching musicologist.  In the press, he seems convinced that
    merely mentioning the fact his record collection contains Steely Dan, Chick Corea, Stereolab, and EPMD
    coupled to his role as producer of tracks for the likes of Britney Spears and Philly's Most Wanted makes
    him a pop prodigy crossover messiah.  The name ""N.E.R.D."" arrogantly admits to a higher IQ, while excusing
    Williams' potentially embarrassing prog-R&amp;B; hybrid as a goofy cult experiment.  Sadly, like a tackle-shocked
    J.O.C.K., <i>Fly or Die</i> is stupid and boring.</p><p>
    
    Publicists limit their vocabulary to the Hall of Fame when thinking up superlative comparisons for their
    acts.  One article alone already compared <i>Fly or Die</i> to Sly Stone, Frank Zappa, Queens of the Stone
    Age, Curtis Mayfield, The Beatles' <i>Rubber Soul</i>, and De La Soul's <i>Three Feet High and Rising</i>.
    No shit.  Actually, it's <i>not</i> like two of the best albums ever made and three of the most brilliant
    people to ever record music.  (Sorry, Josh Homme.  Your band's mention is the 2004 way of saying ""it has
    loud guitars."")  Oddly, <i>Fly or Die</i> finds the safe middle ground between Adam Ant's rumbling
    Burundi-drummed new-wave pop, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's digital elevator nightmare <i>Raise!</i>, and Lenny
    Kravitz's Folgers granule guitars.</p><p>
    
    Pharrell croons, ""Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride,"" in the somehow standout track, ""She Wants to
    Move"".  Let's assume N.E.R.D. are travelling around the Earth in this ass-ship at 299,985 kilometers per
    second.  Inside, Pharrell, Chad Hugo, and the useless guy wear their ""astronaut suits from the BBC"" [""Jump""]
    and ramble through the entire album in its 44 minute runtime.  Back on earth, we observe the ass-ship moving
    at 99.995% the speed of light broadcasting <i>Fly or Die</i> from speakers fixed into the ""exhaust port"" of
    the anatomically detailed craft.  To the asstronauts inside, the album last 2640 seconds, but to the
    listeners on earth, that same album seems 3.05 days.  And that's just relativity.  Einstein never factored
    in two consecutive tracks on a record featuring whistling or two consecutive tracks growing so bored with
    themselves that they slip from their own unmelodic pop into introverted moebius jams concerned with fishing
    stories and sounding like Nile Rogers producing Gentle Giant.  For a production team renowned for their
    bleating, percussive keyboards, the synthesizers here sound milkier than Vangelis.</p><p>
    
    Forgetting the musical shortcomings for a moment, let's shift focus to Pharrell Williams' abysmal lyrics.
    ""Chariot of Fire"" begins, ""I wrote this song when I was drunk.""  True or not, this is a no-win situation,
    lyrically speaking.  Strike ""she,"" ""bad,"" ""ass,"" and George Carlin's 7 words from Pharrell's vocabulary
    and he's got nothing.  There goes the entirety of ""Don't Worry About It"".  Other lyrics rarely surpass the
    expletives of a dad stuck in traffic: ""Shit happens/ just blow it off.""  ""Gonna make you feel rage.""  ""Fuck
    'em up.""  ""Breakout/ Push people.""  These are entire <i>choruses</i> and hardly fit the writing style of a
    supposed nerd.  To further the point, Pharrell invites Hot Topic cosmetic counter explosion casualties Benji
    and Joel from Good Charlotte to ""spit"" on ""Jump"".  The one that looks like your gay aunt's mascara brush
    whines, ""Hey, Dad/ Okay, Dad/ That's what you say, Da/ I never could obey Dad/ Punk rock tattoos/ Leather
    jacket/ Good grades don't come with that package.""  Actually, this is the most academic the album gets.
    Who is that kid fooling?  He's more B's and C's than CBGB's.</p><p>
    
    In trying to expand their sound beyond commercial hip-hop, N.E.R.D. has exposed both the shortcomings and
    silver linings of the genre.  Taking the simple chest-beating, booty-humping themes of club hits into
    overproduced Phish-rock territory merely exposes their offensive banality.  Expanding the minimal,
    percussive rhythms of turntables to florid, multi-layered studio fusion rock only underscores the power
    of economy.  And that's in the ""spartan production"" sense, not the ""Pharrell Williams' presents The
    Billionaire Boys Club Clothing Line"" sense.  Each track is bloated and soft like Morgalis' middle, and
    waxed clean of texture like Ricardi's back.  Though Pharrell Williams poised himself at the center of
    millions of people's attention, he's spilled his head to show nothing but unsharpened pencils.</p><p>
    
    The last year has seen The Neptunes beat themselves into tired ubiquity.  For every ""Milkshake"" or ""Bubble"",
    there are ten ""Change Clothes"" or ""Frontin'"".  <i>Fly or Die</i> was their appropriately titled chance to
    evolve beyond staccato acoustic guitars, bongos, and robot synths and stake their claim as true personalities
    in music.  Sadly, when left to their own devices they seem more fascinated by the opening clang of ""Purple
    Haze"", yet technically unable to reproduce any other element of Hendrix's playing, style or impact.  They
    need the pop tarts dropped into their toaster.  On their own, N.E.R.D. are the hip-hop Toto.  And the
    nerdiest thing about Pharrell Williams is that he probably takes that as a compliment.</p></div>"|5749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5749-fly-or-die/|3.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    audiences in a live setting.  Thus far, in my experience, most mouse-draggers are unmasked on stage as
    composing non-visual video games for ""avant-garde"" adults.  But there are a handful of electronic acts
    that fare well in the club, and judging from <i>Fabula</i>, Skyphone might be one of them.  On their debut,
    the Danish laptop-rock trio mesh analog and digital with live and pre-recorded instruments, creating a
    lovely downtempo hybrid that milks interesting aspects from both approaches.  Though this is a debut, the
    three have been acquainted musically/personally for some time, and have played in a number of rock bands
    prior to committing to Skyphone in 1999.  They mention somewhere being inspired by glitch as well as 80s
    mood-rock and folk, and the rock interplay certainly establishes an enjoyable dynamic.</p><p>
    
    A number of these 11 tracks share a vibe similar to Tape's recent release, <i>Milieu</i>, but Skyphone
    usher in a more digitally hermetic, sprawling sound.  Sure to be at least generally enjoyed by fans
    of Boards of Canada, Matmos (especially <i>The West</i>), Four Tet, et. al., the band generally avoids
    generic laptopisms, managing to locate a sweetly naturalist groove within even the most drag/click tracks.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Monitor Batik"" mixes sounds by the dozen: Occasional radio hiss (or rain), tone patterns, toy bells
    (or xylophone), and the triad of delicate notes at song's end stand out clearly, unmarred by the detailed
    layers.  Close listening illuminates abrupt/attenuated percussion, wind chimes, quavery sci-fi satellite
    tones, maybe even the lapping waves of an ocean.  Otherwise, the strongest (and for some reason briefest)
    tracks flaunt the analog/digital disconnect.  ""Cent Gauge""'s fluttery music box pulses, taps, and digital
    wind opens quietly to drifting folds of gently sunny psych-folk guitar.  ""Into Hill Country"" similarly
    juxtaposes guitar strums with synthesized buzzes and sighs.  A longer piece, ""Airtight Golem"", provides a
    bright patch of sun shadows and a diaphanous exhale layered over water-drop percussion, a quicker techno
    beat placed so far back in the mix you'll strain to grab its prettiness.</p><p>
    
    Between the glories, though, are the ho-hum doldrums: ""Sinne Gas"" is run-of-the-mill besides the gentle
    interweaving of acoustic guitar, steel-drum style percussion, and rotating hiss.  The pretty but vacant
    guitar pulses of ""In Our Time"" noodles here, flanges there, but doesn't budge.  And in the end, this
    ability to multi-track ad infinitum makes me nostalgic for the more inventive punk rock splices pioneered
    by Marinetti, Schwitters, Cage, etc.  I don't know, call me a Luddite, but there's something about making
    music on the same machine that orders your books, types your papers, and downloads your porn that just
    isn't all that sexy.  I'm not necessarily calling for a return to a razor-blade and tape method (though
    many admirable composers still operate solely in that old-timey realm), but it seems to me that the
    intermittent use of real-life incisions amongst software-heavy compositions could bring something more
    to the music.</p><p>
    
    My idealistic desire for naturalism aside, Skyphone certainly know to utilize space.  And ultimately, it's
    <i>Fabula</i>'s rich, uncluttered soundscape, as well as its sometimes darkened, brocade corners, that wins
    me over more often than not to those electro-acoustic charms.</p></div>"|7744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7744-fabula/|7.3|Brandon Stosuy

The chilly, ghostly sounds of Piano Magic are so suited to     crisp, thin air and falling leaves or snow that the group named their exquisite singles compilation     <i>Seasonlly Affective</i>.</p>
<p>Ironically, then, ""Out of season, out of heart"" is the first line on <i>The Troubled Sleep of Piano Magic</i>,     the band's seventh album and first for Spanish label Green UFOs.  Of course, frontman Glen Johnson is referring     to a rapidly fading summer love, rather than his music, but you can hear his wink and nod.  In another sense,     however, this album follows the typical springtime arcs of renewal and re-emergence, coming after the most     disappointing stretch of Piano Magic's career to date.</p>
<p>Among the things that may have kept Piano Magic lying awake at night was a rather fruitless relationship     with 4AD.  On paper, it made all the sense in the world: Gorgeous, baroque artist meets top purveyors of     atmospheric, dreamy pop.  However, the results-- <i>Son de Mar</i>, the score to a Bigas Luna film, and     career nadir <i>Writers Without Homes</i>-- were mixed, at best.  Fortunately, these low-key releases return to both the quality and mood of previous     Piano Magic records without sounding like a retreat or a retread.</p>
<p>Delicately weaving organic and electronic instruments with spectral, detached vocals from Johnson and others     (most notably Klima's Angele David-Guillou), <i>The Troubled Sleep</i> is another collection of spellbinding     ruminations on loss and unrequited love.  Recorded with a six-piece band, the album is probably the most     rock-oriented record Johnson has ever made, carrying tinges of the brooding guitar work of Nick Cave, Low,     and The Dirty Three, and its fragility-- plucking acoustic guitars often meet gently throbbing rhythms amidst     spacious, almost desolate soundscapes-- belies the emotional disquiet that runs through the best of Johnson's     work.  The more rock-oriented approach doesn't always play to Johnson's strengths, but it might appeal to     a wider audience than his (often far better) musicbox electronics.  From the solitary, distant cry to ""Help     Me Warm This Frozen Heart"", to the almost Southern gothic desperation of ""Speed the Road, Rush the Lights"",     to the haunting (and unexpected) release of ""Luxembourg Gardens"", Johnson escapes his tendency to tempt a     listener's mind to wander over the course of a sometimes monolithic record.</p>
<p>Despite whispers that <i>The Troubled Sleep</i> would be the final Piano Magic record, the band recently     returned to its more typically rewarding format-- the single-- with the 26-minute, six-song <i>Saint Marie</i> EP.  Here, the title track is re-recorded with Low's Alan Sparhawk replacing Johnson on vocals with slightly     disappointing results.  Fortunately, Sparhawk's other guest performance, on the surprisingly menacing ""Wrong     Turn"", is much more rewarding.  That track is also one of two that has Johnson reunited with folk star Vashti     Bunyan, whom he coaxed out of a lengthy retirement to sing on <i>Writers Without Homes</i>.</p>
<p>More a return to a traditional Piano Magic sonics than a full band setup, <i>Saint Marie</i> features a     trio of instrumentals and additional guest work by Cornershop's Ben Ayres (on tamboura) and Swedish harpist     Linnea Malmberg.  At turns elegiac and fierce, the EP is a reminder that short sketches play to one of     Johnson's greatest strengths: excavating and expressing sentiment and emotion.  With these two release,     there is, for the first time in a few years, a wealth of Piano Magic material worth mining.</p></div>"|11802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11802-the-troubled-sleep-of-piano-magic-saint-marie-ep/|7.3|Scott Plagenhoef

<p>Among the things that may have kept Piano Magic lying awake at night was a rather fruitless relationship     with 4AD.  On paper, it made all the sense in the world: Gorgeous, baroque artist meets top purveyors of     atmospheric, dreamy pop.  However, the results-- <i>Son de Mar</i>, the score to a Bigas Luna film, and     career nadir <i>Writers Without Homes</i>-- were mixed, at best.  Fortunately, these low-key releases return to both the quality and mood of previous     Piano Magic records without sounding like a retreat or a retread.</p>
<p>Delicately weaving organic and electronic instruments with spectral, detached vocals from Johnson and others     (most notably Klima's Angele David-Guillou), <i>The Troubled Sleep</i> is another collection of spellbinding     ruminations on loss and unrequited love.  Recorded with a six-piece band, the album is probably the most     rock-oriented record Johnson has ever made, carrying tinges of the brooding guitar work of Nick Cave, Low,     and The Dirty Three, and its fragility-- plucking acoustic guitars often meet gently throbbing rhythms amidst     spacious, almost desolate soundscapes-- belies the emotional disquiet that runs through the best of Johnson's     work.  The more rock-oriented approach doesn't always play to Johnson's strengths, but it might appeal to     a wider audience than his (often far better) musicbox electronics.  From the solitary, distant cry to ""Help     Me Warm This Frozen Heart"", to the almost Southern gothic desperation of ""Speed the Road, Rush the Lights"",     to the haunting (and unexpected) release of ""Luxembourg Gardens"", Johnson escapes his tendency to tempt a     listener's mind to wander over the course of a sometimes monolithic record.</p>
<p>Despite whispers that <i>The Troubled Sleep</i> would be the final Piano Magic record, the band recently     returned to its more typically rewarding format-- the single-- with the 26-minute, six-song <i>Saint Marie</i> EP.  Here, the title track is re-recorded with Low's Alan Sparhawk replacing Johnson on vocals with slightly     disappointing results.  Fortunately, Sparhawk's other guest performance, on the surprisingly menacing ""Wrong     Turn"", is much more rewarding.  That track is also one of two that has Johnson reunited with folk star Vashti     Bunyan, whom he coaxed out of a lengthy retirement to sing on <i>Writers Without Homes</i>.</p>
<p>More a return to a traditional Piano Magic sonics than a full band setup, <i>Saint Marie</i> features a     trio of instrumentals and additional guest work by Cornershop's Ben Ayres (on tamboura) and Swedish harpist     Linnea Malmberg.  At turns elegiac and fierce, the EP is a reminder that short sketches play to one of     Johnson's greatest strengths: excavating and expressing sentiment and emotion.  With these two release,     there is, for the first time in a few years, a wealth of Piano Magic material worth mining.</p></div>"|11802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11802-the-troubled-sleep-of-piano-magic-saint-marie-ep/|7.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    farce, or as a chronicle of a man's battle with schizophrenia.  I've since found that there's a happy
    medium between the two, but when I first became acquainted with his music, my appreciation was firmly
    planted in the former category.  It was 1996 when I first came across Willis' <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 1</i>,
    and it instantly struck me as among the funniest, most absurd things I'd ever heard.  I marveled at the
    similarity between every song, each clearly run through a bargain-basement Casio with preset melodies.
    I reveled in Wesley's impromptu rants and sound effects.  But most of all, I was struck by the way Wesley
    chose to end every song with an advertising slogan.  Surely, this was the work of a comedic genius.</p><p>
    
    For most, the novelty quickly wore off, but rather than returning to my shelf to be forgotten, the album
    inched its way into my regular rotation, much as William Shatner's <i>The Transformed Man</i> had the
    summer before.  Intermixed with Pulp, Morphine and Pavement, it was easier to take Wesley's work more as
    music than comedy.  I began to develop a strange appreciation for his twisted stories, and to see that this
    man, despite his failings, possessed an earnest musical vision, and was determined to foist it upon the
    world, ready or not.  So keep in mind that it's as a fan that I assign this album a 4.6.  For those of us
    who range from casual admirers to Wesleynauts, <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 3</i> simply serves up more of the
    same stuff we've come to oddly enjoy, which is unfortunate given the volume of music he produced in his
    lifetime.</p><p>
    
    Wesley's songs traditionally fall into a finite number of categories, and the material on <i>Vol. 3</i>,
    compiled by longtime friend Jello Biafra, offers no real exceptions to the rule.  There are odes to popular
    venues (""Viper Room"", ""Wrigley Field""), tributes to heroes (""Oprah Winfrey"", ""Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers""),
    and surreal lyrical and sonic experiments (""If"", ""Suck a Polar Bear's Dick"").  Some of the latter delve
    more into the realm of the bizarre than his previous offerings (""Make My Joyplane Crash and Burn"", for
    instance, features modulated vocals reminiscent of early Ween), while much of the record's second half
    features lo-fi demos, as well as his varied work with both The Fiasco and The Dragnews.  Unfortunately,
    too many tracks pop up to simply retread old ground.  On ""Your Way Right Away"", Wesley rehashes ""Rock 'n'
    Roll McDonalds"" with Burger King instead, and ""I Whipped Spiderman's Ass"" once again pits Wesley against
    the superhero <i>du jour</i>.  These poor choices undermine what little novelty remains this far into
    Wesley's career.</p><p>
    
    Like his previous collections, <i>Vol. 3</i>'s strongest moments are Wesley's most intimate, when he
    writes about events in his daily life like an entry from some demented diary.  On tracks like ""My Keyboard
    Got Damaged"" and ""I'm Going on a World Tour"", Wesley's spoken lyrics reveal how disjointed and tortured
    the life of a schizophrenic can be.  ""Verbal Assault"" recounts a number of times during which he's been
    unintentionally disruptive when riding the bus: ""Just as when I was listening to my rock and roll, a mean
    schizophrenia voice whipped my ass with profanity... Suddenly, I started to rave at the bus driver, calling
    him a jerk.""  Naturally, these rants can seem absurdly hilarious at first, but with time, one can get past
    that and recognize the sadness of these stories.</p><p>
    
    As most Pitchfork readers know, Wesley lost his battle with leukemia late last year at the age of 40.  In
    that respect, <i>Greatest Hits, Vol. 3</i> serves just as well as any of Wesley's previous efforts as a
    showcase for his unique vision.  But for those who've followed his story and music since his Alternative
    Tentacles debut, there's little new ground here.  Surely, some new and interesting sounds could have been
    culled from his hundreds upon hundreds of recorded songs; instead, we're left with a record that is, for
    a Wesley Willis album, relatively by the book.</p></div>"|8770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8770-greatest-hits-vol-3/|4.6|Jedediah Gilchrist

    Stuart Nicholson's article in <i>Jazz Times</i>, which called the record ""one of the most important... to
    appear in more than a decade.""  I wouldn't encounter those outlandish words until much later, after
    developing a bulletproof affection for the group, which no underhanded assailment of their big-league
    marketing histrionics and neo-fakebook verbiage could derail.  At that point, I agreed wholeheartedly
    with Nicholson's sentiments, and consciously chose to ignore their implications.</p><p>
    Months earlier, <i>These Are the Vistas</i> had been foisted upon me by my dad, of all people, who brought
    it to my attention after hearing the Midwestern jazzbos' zippy rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on
    NPR.  Never mind that the Old Man confused the album title with the bandname, and introduced The Bad Plus
    to me as ""The Vistas, or something""; I was impressed by his ear for new music.  It could have been The
    Mars Volta he was crushing on for all I cared-- intrepid spirit is a rare attribute among AARP cardholders.
    Upon giving the disc an inaugural whirl, my feelings morphed from mere family pride into Gollum-like
    covetousness, and I've guarded our copy ever since, much to my dad's displeasure.</p><p>
    Well, Dad, here's payback. This one you can keep.</p><p>
<i>Give</i>, the band's follow-up, suffers from a paucity of original ideas.  Even its best moments sound
    like an amateurish reiteration of <i>These Are the Vistas</i>' quasi-jazz anarchy.  Pundits who pilloried
    that album for failing to situate itself decisively in either jazz or rock might actually have an argument
    here, as songs like ""1979 Semi-Finalist"" lack the slightest personality.  Whereas even <i>Vistas</i>' most
    ambiguous numbers were sustained on the strength of the group's playing alone, much of <i>Give</i>'s material
    comes off as unprovocative novelty.  ""Cheney Piñata"" seeks to redefine the Cha-Cha, but falls flat on David
    King's galling polyrhythms and Ethan Iverson's cheeky piano melody.  Similarly, ""Layin' a Strip for the
    Higher-Self State"" experiments with the New Orleans blues shuffle by removing the blues, the shuffle, and
    the rugged sophistication of New Orleans-style playing.</p><p>
    Then, of course, there are the covers, a penchant for which earned The Bad Plus ample fame on <i>Vistas</i>.
    While a good cover will merely testify to the greatness of the original, a great one will invade the memory
    of its elder and stamp a new identity in the listener's mind.  The group's take on Nirvana's mainstream
    flagship was, without question, a great cover, managing to stand apart from the original as a substantive
    piece of art.  Unfortunately, none of the covers on <i>Give</i> pack the same gusto.  Nor, for that matter,
    do they even match <i>Vistas</i>' lesser interpretations of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" and Aphex Twin's
    ""Flim"".  Here, the underspoken emotionality of the Pixies' ""Velouria"" is asphyxiated by Iverson's grandiose
    pounding and King's madcap drumming.  Conversely, other songs are too consciously delicate, bypassing tasteful
    and heading straight for stilted.  Even <i>Give</i>'s most boisterous moments, including a key-hopping take
    on Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"", are genteel.  At times, Iverson's upper-octave twinkling sounds like <i>The
    Sims</i>' theme music.</p><p>
    Other treasured aspects of <i>These Are the Vistas</i> have either been mishandled this time out by Tchad
    Blake's close-to-the-vest production, or are just missing altogether.  On a rendition of Ornette Coleman's
    ""Street Woman"", Reid Anderson hypnotically recreates token phrases from his spectacular solo on <i>Vistas</i>'
    ""Keep the Bugs Off Your Glass and the Bears Off Your Ass"", only here, he shares the spotlight with an
    overzealous King.  And unlike on <i>Vistas</i>, the original compositions on <i>Give</i> feel limp and
    underdeveloped, as if rushed to meet a record company deadline.</p><p>
    One of the more commonly lodged complaints about <i>Vistas</i> was simply that it was so vehemently and
    lucratively backed by a major label.  But those of us who managed to get past the superficial reasons to
    dislike The Bad Plus, and deigned to try something from Columbia, were doubtless glad we did.  Unfortunately,
    <i>Give</i> only serves to validate the band's senseless gadflies.  If a requirement for having an album
    attain ""essential"" status, in any genre, is proving that it wasn't a happy accident, The Bad Plus have put
    <i>These Are the Vistas</i> at a serious disadvantage.</p></div>"|1075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1075-give/|5.6|Sam Ubl

    good for the bars, a spectacular mess of sprawling guitar, ferocious vocals, and well-channeled, raucous
    irritation.  Former Lifter Puller vocalist Craig Finn and bassist Tad Kubler (now on lead guitar) are now
    ably backed by Galin Polivka and Judd Counsell, and their collective spew is awfully impressive: Earnest
    without being sentimental, and authentic without sounding contrived, The Hold Steady are one of the most
    convincing rock bands to emerge in recent years, a can-crushing throwdown of unadulterated aggression and
    ear-splitting amps.</p><p>
    
    Which is not to say they don't push an intellectual agenda: ""Hold Steady"" is more than a bandname, it's
    a self-fulfilling mantra, invoked repeatedly for casual assurance in the face of social/societal disgust
    (""All you sniffling indie kids/ Hold Steady/ All the clustered-up clever kids/ Hold Steady"").  Thus: The
    Hold Steady are the anti-trucker hat, the anti-laptop, the anti-West-Virginia-t-shirt.  And they rock
    without repent.</p><p>
    
    Finn's lyrics and delivery are the crux of The Hold Steady, skewering whole characters and lifestyles with
    unapologetic aplomb.  Boasting all the seething, pent-up fervor of someone who's been talk-singing for
    nearly a decade, Finn expertly shoots his lyrical barbs like little arrows, knocking down and dismantling
    everything from recreational drugs and the tech boom to bartenders and jukebox codes, all in a familiar,
    half-smirking growl.  The Hold Steady stand staunchly opposed to youthfully misappropriated irony, and
    <i>Almost Killed Me</i> contains countless glorious allusions to scenesters being stupid: Check ""Barfruit
    Blues""' testimonial that the ""Clever kids are killing me/ For one, they ain't that clever.../ This was
    supposed to be a party,"" or the presumably anti-electroclash dig, ""The 80s almost killed me/ Let's not
    recall 'em quite so fondly.""</p><p>
    
    Without explicitly finger-pointing to disaffected Brooklynites, or pissing in his own backyard (Finn and
    Kubler relocated to Brooklyn in 2000), Finn inadvertently derides the kids in plastic bracelets and yellow
    leather armbands, swinging their arms to fleeting retro jams; obviously, it would be just as easy (if not
    more so) to counterattack Finn and friends for equally absurd purist-posturing, but The Hold Steady are
    just so unbearably good at what they do-- and listeners are all inevitably persuaded that the only reasonable
    thing to do is throw your hair around and chug.</p><p>
    
    Like any decent barstool poet or rock frontman, Finn can sometimes prod your patience (see ""Knuckles""'
    instantly-tiring holler of ""I been tryin' to get people to call me Sunny D/ 'Cause I got the good stuff
    kids go for!""), or lock himself into periodic lyrical ruts, relying on exhaustive semiotics (see various
    permutations of: ""Lots of people call me,"" ""I'm trying to get people to call me,"" ""My name is _________,
    but people call me _________"") to convey his vague cultural dissociation.  But Finn's glib repetitions can
    be ridiculously fun, given the preposterous amount of genuinely clever bits streaming out of his mouth.
    And, like any good bar buddy, Finn always buys your next drink.</p><p>
    
    If Finn's snarky words aren't sufficiently indicting for your hipster-hating self, Tad Kubler's riffage
    is gory enough to disembowel whole synth-pop bands.  Spastically invoking a wide array of historically
    grinding axmen (from Mott the Hoople's Mick Ralphs to perennial favorite Slash), Kubler mercilessly noodles
    his way around Finn's toothy monologues; there's an instant disconnect between the vocals and the instrumentation
    that's enormously compelling, with Finn's sprawling dissertations pausing only to let Kubler scream, each
    element sidestepping the other in service of a common mission.  Ultimately, The Hold Steady end up sounding
    like a bizarre amalgamation of Lifter Puller and Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E-Street Band; when they're done
    with their assault, there's blood on the stage and everyone pours sweat.  Just not from dancing.</p></div>"|3976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3976-almost-killed-me/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

    fitting a meditation on space, waste and transience as there ever was.  Laika's album, their fourth, could
    never hope to be as succinct as a fifty-five word poem, but with only 10 songs and 42 minutes, it tries.</p><p>
    
    Named after the first dog to be slung off the Earth, Laika is the brainchild of Britain's Guy Fixsen and
    Margaret Fiedler.  <i>Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing</i> marks their first studio album since 2000's
    <i>Good Looking Blues</i>, but that four year gap is a mirage; Fixsen acknowledges in the bio that the
    majority of the music for this record was, in fact, recorded in 2001.  It's not a cheat, but given that
    Laika are the type of band that tends to offer relentlessly small variations on one specific theme, it's
    close.  Some bands like that need serious time apart to stay interesting; hell, most need it to <i>get</i>
    interesting-- time not to marinade, but to grow fissures, to break through the fortress of that one specific
    theme and chip away at its nature.  Still, unless we're counting minute variations (and we're not), Laika's
    nature hasn't changed much on <i>Whatever I Am</i>.</p><p>
    
    The painting of a snow globe on the cover of 1999's <i>Sounds of the Satellites</i> is a useful image to
    invoke when describing Laika's music.  Consisting of crisp, shuffling grooves, swirling keyboards and
    Fiedler's icy vocals, there's a specific motion and temperature to what they do.  That this is pretty much
    a constant means their albums are different like snowstorms in Buffalo are different than snowstorms in
    Reykjavik are different than snowstorms in Prague.</p><p>
    
    With this record, I found myself listening less for Laika's melodies and above-ground ornamentation, and
    more to their grooves and bottom end.  The duo are, contrary to received wisdom, much better with rhythm
    than they are with melody, and <i>Wherever I Am</i> is passable in this regard.  As exemplified by tracks
    like the kinetic ""Fish for Nails"" and the fidgety ""Falling Down"", the record is punctuated by all sorts of
    stereo pings and timed delays that make it an interesting textural listen.  But ultimately, Laika make
    pleasant music that's difficult to be passionate about.  At best, it succeeds as a low-impact tint, a
    chilly motorik electronic that swirls around the room for a while before settling and melting away into
    vapor before you even realize it's vanished.</p></div>"|4642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4642-wherever-i-am-i-am-what-is-missing/|5.1|Mark Pytlik

    Arkansas-by-way-of-Memphis-based Lucero were labeled alt-country, mainly because Ben Nichols sounded
    suspiciously like Jay Farrar, and because John Stubblefield's bass was of the upright variety.  Just
    a few years later, though, they've become a solid part of the Southern rock revival that covers almost
    every state in the Confederacy: scene godfathers Drive-By Truckers from Alabama, Kings of Leon from
    Tennessee, and the North Mississippi All-Stars from, er, North Mississippi.</p><p>
    
    The Southern rock tag fits Lucero much better, not only because the band members fit the dual criteria of
    a) being Southern and b) rocking, but because they rock in a way that has little to do with country music,
    alt- or otherwise.  As much as they derive their sound from classic and Southern rock, Lucero also borrow
    from indie and punk sources like Pixies and The Replacements, taking pop noise from one and pop romanticism
    from the other.  In other words, they're not as out of place on the Tiger Style roster as they might seem.</p><p>
    
    Lucero's third album, <i>That Much Further West</i>, is not only their first for Tiger Style, but also their
    first to be self-produced (without the help of All-Stars Cody and Luther Dickinson). It was recorded mostly
    live in their Bluff City practice space, so it sounds less polished than its predecessor, <i>Tennessee</i>,
    but more melodic and adventurous.</p><p>
    
    The 13 tracks, not counting the instrumental coda, can be easily and handily divided into two categories:
    songs about romance and songs about manliness.  On tracks like ""Hate and Jealousy"" (a satisfyingly cynical
    play on fellow Memphian Al Green's ""Love and Happiness""), Nichols ponders what it means to be a real
    Southern man, solid, sturdy, and moral: ""I want nothin' that ain't truly mine.""  On the one-minute-plus
    ""Joining the Army"", he considers enlisting as his only route to Greatest Generation-style manhood: ""Said
    I wanted to make my grandfather proud/ But he's not around/ Been gone since I was 13/ I'm still worried
    what he'd think about me.""</p><p>
    
    Much more interesting are the songs about tenuous or doomed relationships.  Taken together, songs like the
    title track, ""Sad and Lonely"", ""Mine Tonight"", and ""Across the River"" form the unifying narrative of <i>That
    Much Further West</i>: Nichols is out in America somewhere playing shows and dreaming of his best girl, who
    is probably already ""breakin' my heart to the boys back home.""  In these moments, he adheres to a particular
    brand of rock and roll romanticism-- the self-described ""boy with the most metal heart of all"" calls her his
    ""best girl"" or ""little girl"" and consoles her with, ""I don't plan on dyin' young""-- which often limits his
    insight into his own problems.  As a result, the songs are not as deftly analytical nor as coldly scrutinizing
    as, say, the divorce songs on the Drive-By Truckers' Southern rock revival watershed, <i>Decoration Day</i>.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, few songwriters pull off romantic resignation quite as well as Nichols, who comes off in
    these songs as masochistically passive-- always the left, never the leaving.  At the end of ""Across the
    River"", he knows that ""when I get back, you're gonna break this heart,"" but accepts it with a shrug and
    a ""well, alright.""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the rest of Lucero add dramatic punch to these tales of heartbreak.  The group sounds rejuvenated
    by the addition of new guitarist Todd Gill, who replaces band co-founder Brian Venable.  Venable's playing
    always sounded somewhat apologetic; by contrast, Gill asserts himself nicely, adding intuitive guitar lines
    that sound steeped in cigarette smoke and late-night letdowns.  Unfortunately, Gill left the band in January,
    a development that does not bode particularly well for future releases.</p><p>
    
    Guitarists may come and go, but Lucero's mainstay, besides Nichols, is Roy Berry, the band's inventive and
    articulate drummer.  His intricate rhythms and counter-rhythms pump and pulse like dance beats, invigorating
    and complicating the band's sound, never stifling its momentum with too much heavy-metal thunder.  The
    instrumental parts on ""Mine Tonight"" move like drum-n-bass tracks, and the constant pounding on ""Hate and
    Jealousy"" adds bombast to guest John Murry's fiery guitar solo.  ""Tears Don't Matter Much"" begins with an
    evocative guitar intro, before Berry's drums come in about twice as fast as you expect, completely redefining
    the song and dramatically expanding its possibilities.</p><p>
    
    On the penultimate song, a ballad entitled ""When You Decided to Leave"", Nichols finally realizes that his
    problems with himself and with women are more or less one and the same, but Berry interrupts his epiphany
    with blasts of staticky programmed beats.  They ruin the song's intimacy but they don't ruin the song; it's
    less about Berry fucking around with Nichols than about pounding drums upstaging a sensitive ballad, rock
    and roll defeating settled commitment.  If Nichols is the sad-sack journeyman dreaming of home and his
    best girl, then Berry sounds like the madman driving the tour van further and further west, ensuring that
    Nichols will have plenty of heartache to write about.  Well, alright.</p></div>"|4959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4959-that-much-further-west/|7.6|Stephen M. Deusner

    present.  The things they froth over are decades and millennia old, lending credence and legitimacy to the
    subject of their devotion.  And then there's Westside Connection, whose second album longs for the halcyon
    days of 1992, when bitches were bitches, tricks were tricks, and rags and gats were the coin of the realm.</p><p>
    
    Which is odd, really, since <i>Terrorist Threats</i> is an album that also celebrates post-9/11 terminology.
    Osama bin Laden and the Taliban are name-dropped alongside 911 and Saddam, while members Ice Cube, Mack 10
    and WC giddily assert themselves as old-school terrorists who pose a bigger threat than al-Qaeda, Hamas,
    and Hezbollah combined.  Opening with a ominous Keith David-esque narration that lets you know you're in
    for a very serious experience, the album's first song, ""Call 9-1-1"", quickly slips into traditional
    gangsta-rap fare, with politics running a distant second.  On songs like ""Terrorist Threats"" and ""Lights
    Out"", the trio refer to themselves as ""the young Osama with that al-Qaeda drama,"" and more impressively,
    ""Saddam, bin Laden and O.J. in a Chevy.""</p><p>
    
    But rather than confronting the endless ammunition of a Patriot Act world, Westside Connection prefer to
    look backwards.  In the world of <i>Terrorist Threats</i>, the drive-bys and color wars of early 90s L.A.
    are still great fodder, while the more topical 50 Cent and 911 just make for good rhyme schemes and
    half-hearted stabs at controversy.  The soundtrack is perfect for a throwback.  With a batch of producers
    from longtime Cube collaborator Sir Jinx to new darlings Midi Mafia, the album is equal parts G- and P-Funk.
    Even Nate Dogg shows up to croon on ""Gangsta Nation"", the album's most infectious track.</p><p>
<i>Terrorist Threats</i> delivers on the challenges Westside Connection throws out to the softer new-school,
    with clever verbal feints and menacing rolls.  In fact, most of this record would be great if not for its
    overarching lack of currency.  In the early 90s, the record would have made a nice snapshot of gangsta rap
    in its prime, but coming out 10 years late, it offers no revelations-- hearing three renowned professionals
    defy innovation and return to their already well-traveled ground tends to suck the joy out of even this
    album's most compelling moments.</p><p>
    
    Given that Ice Cube helped change the face of rap music a decade ago with N.W.A. and his first two solo
    records, his new move from the streets of Compton to the policies of Washington comes as something of a
    disappointment.  Here, his output's gradual decline sadly culminates in what amounts to a retread of his
    career, ""Bop Gun"" and all.  In the years since gangsta's birth, rap has made huge, evolutionary leaps;
    it's a shame that Westside Connection haven't.</p></div>"|8769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8769-terrorist-threats/|5.9|Christopher Sebela

    <i>Robot Jazz</i> as a working title, riffing on the record's stiff 1's and 0's swinging between the beats.
    Gazing at the complex grid of squares, triangles, and parallelograms that interstice the rippling razor
    grass on the cover of Joe Takayuki's stateside debut, <i>Mushi No-ne</i> (roughly translated: ""sound of
    insects""), Beck's quip is less a joke and more a reality in this age, thankfully realized by artists like
    Takayuki who pull off the juxtaposition effortlessly.</p><p>
    
    As rigorous as the discipline of this music appears to have been in the past, a recent spate of releases
    from Onkyo-based players like Tetuzi Akiyama, Toshimaru Nakamura, and Ami Yoshida suggest that the silence
    which informs most of the city's music is more a sieve, allowing all sorts of other referential music to
    sift in, while at the same time keeping the focus squarely on soundspace.</p><p>
    
    As No. 9, Takayuki mixes abstract jazz-- in the tradition of Eric Dolphy, Bobby Hutcherson, and Tony Williams
    in their Blue Note days-- with field recordings, then reassembles the results into crystalline, mathematical
    patterns.  Flung into a melodic mix, he hyperactively shifts these patterns, provide every track with complex,
    double-helix turns that reveal previously unglimpsed structures with each listen.  Not since Four Tet's
    <i>Rounds</i> have I heard drum programming as loose with the kit, yet firmly interknit with timekeeping,
    evoking post-bop drummers more than hip-hop producers.</p><p>
    
    No. 9 released the single ""Where Come From?  And Where To?"" last year with remixes from Hrvatski and Bundy
    K. Brown, and the song re-appears here, a sliver of a Henry Mancini film score gone manic spliced with
    catchy pieces of scatted gibberish.  ""Survive"" seeks to invoke horn man Gato Barbieri (somewhere between
    his free-skronk days and 1972's <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>), transforming the sax into a sinewave that
    hovers at a <i>Star Trek</i> tiki bar, while drums blink in infinite Simon patterns on the back panel.
    Swaggering Lalo Schifrin spy themes swish along with monk-robed Autechre, never letting the complexity
    override the simple beauty of the sounds.  Elsewhere, crickets shine like moonlit ponds and frogs twinkle
    like galaxies on the blatantly titled ""BUG BEATS"" and ""ECO EGO"", the lines between microscopic and
    macroscopic lost in the drift.</p><p>
    
    The final portion of <i>Mushi No-one</i> is perfect for night listening.  Basslines walk in the peaceful
    darkness, a perfect balance between stillness and skitter achieved after the knotty jazz charts that appeared
    earlier. ""Insatiable World"" gurgles and spits up tiny shards that should be familiar to Lithops fans, slowly
    sinking into evening's ambience.  The title track is 17 minutes of crickets, digital buzz, and chopped up
    metallophones, the natural, digital, and hand-made permutating into one another.  Closer ""For Sister""
    brings together church bells, flamenco guitar, cello, snares, and snaps (not to mention a cellphone melody
    at the end) for a lively farewell, proving that Joe can do downtempo as well as no-tempo.  Mysterious or
    humorous, peaceful or bustling, <i>Mushi No-ne</i> remains always in flux.</p></div>"|5894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5894-mushi-no-ne/|8.2|Andy Beta

Keep searching, and you'll also find     a huge, tattered file called ""mixed results,"" and that's where you'll undoubtedly find a cache of documents     on Konkurrent's <em>In the Fishtank</em> series.  The idea is surely a great one: Grab one or two bands as     they tour through the Netherlands, put them in the studio for a couple of days together, give them the run     of the place, and release the results on an EP.  Those results, however, vary wildly in quality.</p><p>This is the eleventh <em>In the Fishtank</em> release, and it's become clear as the series has progressed     that this process doesn't work for everybody-- Willard Grant Conspiracy &amp; Telefunk, in particular, couldn't     get an interesting record together-- but when the bands are roughly of a piece with each other (Low &amp; The     Dirty Three, or Motorpsycho &amp; Jaga Jazzist, for instance), it can produce fascinating, even excellent music.     I confess that I know very little about Dutch prog trio Solbakken-- I couldn't even lazily look them up on     All Music Guide, because they don't have an entry-- but from what I can gather from limited audio samples,     they subordinated themselves almost completely to their sparring partners: This procession is decidedly     black-hearted in every respect.</p><p>Black Heart Procession have been riding an upward quality arc ever since their debut, culminating in 2002's     masterful expansion on their sound, <em>Amore del Tropico</em>.  And while this EP doesn't approach such great     peaks, it also proves they're in no mood to revisit the persistently inky American primitive terrain their     initial trio of numbered LPs trod upon.  That's not to say things are getting all sunshine and lollipops in     the Black Hearts camp, but the sound they've settled on here is the most reverberant I've heard from them.     This is perhaps one of the biggest values of a series like this-- its casual, off-the-cuff nature shows     sides of bands that perhaps even the members themselves didn't realize existed.</p>
<p>From minute one to thirty-four, the EP is dominated by the heavy piano of Black Heart Procession's Tobias     Nathaniel, who does the most to shape the music's tone and color.  Black Heart vocalist Paulo Zappoli     (formerly known as Pall Jenkins) hides in towers of reverb, but it's startling how much range he shows     here, relative to the average Black Heart Procession album, letting himself employ a gentler delivery than     usual on several tracks.  Guest vocalist Rachael Rose (she's not in either band) complements him nicely     with a spoken French monologue on opener ""Voiture in Rouge"", and amidst the billowing, romantic piano parts,     it's criminally sensual.</p>
<p>The EP's most impressive achievement, though, is ""Things Go On with Mistakes"", a 10-minute thriller propelled     by both bands' drummers.  This is the most obviously collaborative composition, building up from a chorused     bassline and sparse guitar, and eventually spilling over with piano, organ, guitar and hyperactive percussion.     It's songs like this that illustrate the full potential of the Fishtank, and make a case that the project's     ""great outcomes"" folder might one day grow larger than the ""great ideas"" one.</p>

Splattered into a harrowing dustbowl of depravity, deprivation, and deliverance, I quickly found myself placing it on that hallowed shelf of ""My Ten Favorite Records.""  The following year, I played it for some country aficionados who proudly informed me that these were miserably smooth 1994 re-recordings of Haggard's work in the 60s. I sought out a different collection, realized my error, agreed that <em>16 Biggest Hits</em> was indeed not far from a travesty, and learned that, though my country naiveté, I had deceived myself.  I bring this up for a few reasons:</p><p>  1) Because hopefully those who fell into Will Oldham's recordings solely through his indie rock connections may enjoy this album for its (seemingly) novel production; and perhaps, through it, find their way to someone like Chet Atkins, Faron Young, or Kris Kristofferson.</p><p>  2) Despite Drag City's lofty press releases or <em>Rolling Stone</em>'s perplexed reviews, everyone from Son House to Black Flag has covered themselves under the guise of fresh stylizations and trappings.  It was not a crazy idea then, and it is not a crazy idea now.  Just a bad one.</p><p>  3) I wanted to bring some personal nostalgia into this review in order to quell my present discomfort with <em>Greatest Palace Music</em>.</p><p> <em>Greatest Palace Music</em> is the long-awaited album of sauntering, weightlifting, sugar-coated covers of Will Oldham's work as Palace.  The tracklist was selected via fan poll.  The cover is a bizarre, expressionist jumble of lakes and lacerated rainbows.  The players include such legendary Nashville muscle as Hargus ""Pig"" Robbins and Eddie Bayers.  Its renditions are often syrupy, bombastic, truckin'-through-McDonalds, barrel-hoppin' blitzes, delivered in a voice that creaks and secretes sincerity.  And it does this even as it seems to revel in mocking, I-can't-believe-you-morons-are-actually-listening-to-this production that mechanically smoothes out any soulful, or even human, perturbations with the slightest chance of sneaking through the sheen.</p><p>  I fancy myself of average intellect and, frankly, the album is entirely bewildering.  It's perhaps the most entertaining and thought-provoking album released so far this year.  And one of the worst.  Thankfully, its allure is easily experienced without ever having to actually listen to it.  It's as much of a concept album and process work as any German micro-improv-musique-concrete release in print these days, and it should simply be framed and given a state-sponsored museum tour.  The enjoyment it doles out is entirely extramusical, deriving from its packaging, its contributors, Nashville history, Oldham's interviews pertaining to it, its place in his discography, and his intent, whatever that may have been.  <em>Greatest Palace Music</em> is almost uniformly tedious, uneventful, dispassionate, and overambitious when it comes to multi-tracking, and underambitious when it comes to arrangements and instrumentation.</p><p>  Except that, at the same time, it never feels anything but essential.  Its paradox of earnestness and pranking is relentless, jarring, and (unintentionally?) amusing.  And though none of us are in a position to guess Oldham's intent, one hypothesis might be that the album was intended to befuddle, muddle, and generally piss off listeners' expectations; and, therefore, if you indeed detest it (as you probably should), you're actually one of its biggest advocates.  Maleficent and resentful hatred should greet this album, and if it does, well, we've got something of a classic on our hands.</p><p>  Unfortunately, through some trick of fate, this mischievous and contradictory art took the form of music (at least superficially), and I am a music critic.</p><p>  The standard procedure now would be to contrast these new versions with the original Palace hits, which might be impossible.  Murmurs around my Internet database suggest that ""now we can finally find out if Oldham's songwriting skills stand up without the stark atmospherics.""  Well, based on <em>Greatest Palace Music</em>, they absolutely collapse.  ""New Partner"", probably the greatest moment on <em>Viva Last Blues</em>, and one of the best recordings of Oldham's career, is sieved through jingoistic guitar that veers to the brink of schmaltz and back again.  Elated vocals bounce down a wedding-march keyboard.  The background vocals are resigned and remote.  And when Oldham sings, ""You're always on my mind,"" his voice is so unconvincingly impermeable and tuneless that it lacks any of its previous resonance.  Oldham's delivery doesn't imply his usual trepidation and reluctance before death or love, but rather echoes the way people sound when they're waiting in line.</p><p>  Albums like <em>Days in the Wake</em> or <em>I See a Darkness</em> were propelled by hobbling, fitful marches, and smothered by brazen minor chord blasts.  And there are moments on <em>Greatest Palace Music</em> (""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", ""The Brute Choir"") of stark emotion; gaps and holes occasionally filled with light; a fragmented voice grafted onto the back of Oldham's haggard head; where even the slide solo is condensed and whimpering.  But, for the most part, the shambling, stately pallbearer pace is replaced with a bouncing, undeviating, and totally inappropriate luster.</p><p>  ""Gulf Shores"" climbs toward a swarm of overlapping voices in perfect harmony, robotically in sync.  On ""Pushkin"", Oldham preaches The Word with a shell-shocked, Appalachian puberty that caricatures itself, and holds its springing slow-jazz drabness in contempt.  It's not just polished; it's fabricated, deceitful, condescending, belittling.  It's a trick upon the audience and the band itself.</p><p>  Why would anyone inflict these cruel shenanigans upon an unsuspecting audience?  How could it possibly affect or motivate its listeners?  By making this album, it feels as if Oldham is scorning me, a longtime fan, personally.  It's ceaselessly mediocre, and it actually physically hurts me to know that Oldham has backpedaled, knowingly and irrationally, against his own genius.  Yet, it's precisely in the listener's painful struggle-- the reaction to the artist's self-annihilation, devastating arrogance, and backstabbing repugnance-- that this record finds its wisdom and radiance.</p><p> </p></div>"|702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/|5.0|Alex Linhardt

    themes of death, hopelessness and fear.""  Unfortunately, it sounds more like an exploration into an
    afternoon nap.  Which is a shame: Before calling it quits in 1998, the bassless, mostly instrumental trio
    raised the bar for mysterious post-Slint math-rock, with gorgeous, swirly guitar interplay floating above
    ratatat drumming.  1996's <i>Pills Vs. Planes</i> EP and the 1999 full-length <i>German Water</i> were brooding,
    introspective and powerful, even during the whisper-quiet moments.  Few bands were better at evoking despair
    and loneliness through bursts of distortion and mere hints of melody.  It was the stuff to fire up philosophy
    grad students hunkering down for an existentialism all-nighter.</p><p>
    
    And then Ativin abruptly packed it in, their legacy secure, if obscure.  When they returned four years later
    with the overly ambitious <i>Interiors</i>, the indie faithful were confused by its elaborate production.
    Strings?  Electronics?  Was that a bass guitar?  This wasn't the lean, angular Ativin of old.  Guitarists
    Dan Burton and Chris Carothers seemed to go overboard at the mixing board to compensate for the absence of
    founding drummer and musical linchpin Rory Leitch.</p><p>
    
    Now, on <i>Night Mute</i>, Ativin attempt to get back to their roots.  Once again, the sound is spare and
    the range dynamic: Elastic guitars alternately duel and caress, transforming from hushed fuzz to explosive
    blasts and back again, while new drummer Mark Rice holds it all together admirably.  Indeed, there's no
    mistaking it for Ativin.  The problem is, I get the sense that their hearts just aren't in it.  There's
    no punch.  When <i>Night Mute</i> strives for mystery, it comes out overwrought; when it goes for dreamy,
    it comes off sleepy.</p><p>
    
    ""Blood"" exemplifies the album's wasted potential, kicking off with an almost doom-metal riff, then softening
    and repeating itself over the pound of building drums.  But just as the dark mood begins to take hold, the
    song comes to an anticlimactic end.  Similarly, ""Endless"" is two minutes of pointless, crackly guitar
    feedback with no sign of actual melody or effort.</p><p>
    
    There are flashes of pre-split Ativin here, particularly on the somber cover of Love &amp; Rockets' ""The Game"",
    in which Burton quietly murmurs repetitive lyrics while the guitars work a refreshing quiet/loud/quiet
    dynamic to the hilt.  But oddly enough, the record's best moment comes with its nameless hidden track,
    an (almost) downright pretty tune, with flowing guitars that flirt with a haunting melody.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, nothing here shakes the overwhelming sense that Ativin are just going through the motions
    these days.  The sense of urgency that made their earlier work so strong-- that certain something separating
    the humdrum from the Holy Crap-- is gone, and in its wake is a band that sounds, in even their best moments,
    tired, lethargic, and frankly, bored to tears.</p></div>"|336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/336-night-mute/|5.5|Christopher Weber

    art-damaged and experimental European rock bands.  A few have been given decent due: This Heat, Pere Ubu,
    Suicide, and other NYC bands like DNA were among the most forward-thinking outfits of the day, yet
    possessed all the immediacy of the greatest punk bands.  In England, This Heat weren't only inspired by
    the same air of change and angry resistance that fueled early punk, but were also well-informed by an
    already rich history of art-rock through bands like The Residents, Faust and Captain Beefheart.  They
    were certainly aware of the archetypical avant-prog group Henry Cow, as well.  Like the aforementioned
    bands, Henry Cow played music that was mostly unprecedented before their existence, and likewise shared
    an outsider ideal, even if they weren't ingratiated into the same circles after punk broke.</p><p>
    Drummer Chris Cutler and guitarist Fred Frith were core members of Henry Cow, who had collaborated with
    German singer Dagmar Krause's band, Slapp Happy, on a pair of albums in the mid-70s.  Krause brought a
    highly distinctive vocal presence to the band, one both wildly idiosyncratic (witness her various shrieks,
    growls and unclassifiable utterances throughout the Art Bears catalog) and schooled in traditional European
    art songs, particularly those of Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht.  With her voice and phrasing, she managed
    to single-handedly unify lengthy works that might have otherwise lapsed into typically arch, classically
    structured Cow pieces.  When Krause joined the band on a permanent basis, it was only natural that they
    should gravitate towards something more like ""songs.""</p><p>
    The musicians who would become Art Bears began recording their first album, <i>Hopes and Fears</i>, before
    the band even formally existed.  In January 1978, Cutler, Frith, Krause, Georgie Born, Lindsay Cooper and
    Tim Hodgkinson went to Switzerland with the intent to cut the fifth Henry Cow album at Etienne Conod's
    Sunrise Studio.  However, when it became apparent that Cutler's shorter songs (along with Krause's vocals)
    weren't going to result in anything resembling a Henry Cow album, Cutler, Frith and Krause simply decided
    to rename themselves Art Bears, and with the others, agreed to record different, instrumental pieces for
    what would become Henry Cow's final album, 1979's <i>Western Culture</i>.  And then they decided to disband
    Henry Cow altogether.</p><p>
    In addition to songs initially worked on as Henry Cow, the Art Bears' core trio recorded four songs with
    electronics and studio whiz David Vorhaus (of White Noise) in London.  The band's insistence on trying to
    push the boundaries of narrative forms and studio technology is typical of their drive to produce ""art
    music,"" while sharing many attitudes with concurrent punk and post-punk musicians, yet differing completely
    in their response.  <i>Hopes and Fears</i> covers everything from suicide and world politics to witch-hunts
    and an allegory of the maze-- and that's just the first four songs.</p><p>
    Beginning with a cover of Hans Eisler and Brecht's ""On Suicide"", <i>Hopes and Fears</i> makes no secret of
    its eccentricity.  Unlike Henry Cow, group improvisation and lengthy modern-classical asides are de-emphasized
    at the hands of songs and Cutler's text-delivered messages.  ""The Dividing Line"" is a tense, darkly realized
    piece wherein Krause delivers a plea of, ""O give me the order and I'll cross the border/ I don't want to be
    where I am,"" in reference to citizens kept under watch by a military state.  Cutler's muffled drums pound
    away in the background while distorted organ and Cooper's oboe play dissonant counterpoint.  It might have
    been ""progressive,"" but it certainly wasn't ""progressive rock.""  ""In Two Minds"" does erupt into a Who-like
    fury at one point, but is for the most part a bleak, understated take on folk balladry about an adolescent
    committed because her parents deem ""she is clearly not herself.""</p><p>
    Else, <i>Hopes and Fears</i> sounds very much of the RIO tradition (such as it was), with angular, intricate
    woodwind lines and avant-prog textures.  ""Terrain"" is an instrumental that could well have fit on Henry Cow's
    classically tinged <i>Western Culture</i>, though is still clearly a song-based piece.  ""Moeris Dancing""
    sounds similar to Belgium's Univers Zero in its use of Eastern European folk rhythms and harmonies, but
    also to latter-70s Magma as Krause doubles the instrumental melody with a wordless, eerily wavering vocal.
    If this album still holds relatively true to ideas suggested by Henry Cow and their peers, subsequent
    releases would be singularly unique.</p><p>
    At the end of 1978, Art Bears went back to Sunrise Studios to make their second album, <i>Winter Songs</i>.
    Cutler had a concept for the record, which would be the first recording made from scratch with Art Bears
    in mind: His words were based on bas-reliefs (three-dimensional figures carved into wood or stone) from
    the Central Porch of Amiens Cathedral.  The LP jacket contained small pictures of the carvings next to
    their respective songs, though Cutler's texts range from literal translations of the image (""The Bath of
    Stars"", ""First Things First"") to abstract or political prose (""Gold"", ""Three Figures"").  Frith's music,
    though written only shortly prior to the recording, runs the gamut of styles from abrasive rock (""The
    Slave"") to folk (""The Hermit"") to impressionist, experimental electronic (""Man and Boy"").  However,
    throughout, the band displays a more focused approach than on <i>Hopes and Fears</i>, and Conod's studio
    techniques are in magnificent display.</p><p>
    ""The Bath of the Stars"" begins with cathedral organ and Krause's declaration, ""He steps from a crucible,
    held by an angel"" (referring to the boy in the accompanying carving), doubled by her own whisper, and
    sounding not unlike something Björk might try during a particularly adventurous moment.  Frith's piano
    and organ clusters give the short piece a pastoral quality all but obliterated by ""First Things First"",
    wherein Krause's odd, reversed vocals are driven by dissonant guitar and eventually overtaken by the
    sludgy, downcast pound of drums and piano.  However, even that doesn't prepare me for the abrasive
    avant-hardcore of ""Rats and Monkeys"".  There, Krause's high-register mantra, ""Rats and monkeys crowd the
    city as it crumbles into ruin, walls are loosening, true, but gates are blocked!"" pierces like a siren
    over a battering ram of explosive percussion and chaotic guitar.  When the piece literally explodes for
    a furious coda of all manner of noise and effects, most folks will either squeal with delight or recoil
    in horror.  <i>Winter Songs</i> can be an intimidating experience, but one that's never without a core
    of compassion and morality.</p><p>
<i>The World As It Is Today</i>, originally released in 1981, is my favorite Art Bears release, and arguably
    one of the best collections of experimental rock songs ever recorded.  Despite having to endure a particularly
    difficult tour of Eastern Europe after their second album (including a near-riotous gig in Prague), and
    frustrating difficulty arranging to have Krause sing with the band on a new release, Art Bears reconvened
    at Conod's studio in Switzerland during the late summer, 1980.  This time around, Cutler's texts dealt in
    much more overtly political reams than on <i>Winter Songs</i>, doubtlessly influenced by his opposition to
    the onset of Thatcherism in England, and Reagan's America.  In Cutler's view, the idealism and creative
    freedom at an apex during the late 60s was subsumed by survivalist economics and the Age of the Impersonal.
    His feelings are reflected in song titles like ""Truth"", ""Democracy"", and ""The Song of the Dignity of Labour
    Under Capital"".</p><p>
    Again, Conod's way with the studio lends considerable depth to the songs: The potentially ham-fisted protest
    of ""The Song of the Martyrs"" (sample lyric: ""Were we martyred to finish with all forms of slavery forever,
    only to witness our offspring complacent and bought off with scraps?"") begins as a backdrop of cymbals
    splashing in reverse and ominous rolls of thunder-crescendos over which Krause plays the role of dead
    idealist questioning the state of the world.  Her voice stays mostly in the higher range, where every
    syllable is as close to crying as it is to singing.  On the loping, jagged ""Freedom"", she sings in chorus,
    ""I saw multitudes forced from the land, cleared for the wool, dispossessed, refugees who were told to be
    free,"" with such satirical, bitter edge as to make me cringe.  And then she really lets you have it: Over
    a scraping, near-atonal guitar solo from Frith, Krause lets out a shriek that spans almost two-full minutes.
    Of course, a lot of old prog fans ran for the hills, but let anyone who doubts the passion behind this
    music be subject to her wail.</p><p>
    In addition to the three studio albums, the newly released <i>Art Box</i> contains three discs of remixes,
    live tracks and unreleased songs.  The two-disc <i>Art Bears Revisited</i> set contains remixes by folks
    like Otomo Yoshihide, John Oswald, The Residents, Bob Drake, Biota, Jon Rose, and Christian Marclay.  Fans
    will be interested in hearing fresh interpretations of the songs, though two discs is probably a bit much
    to wade through for the uninitiated.  Cutler's own <i>Three Bear Rooms</i> piece uses bits of multiple
    songs and comes out like a beat-heavy experimental trip-hop piece, sort of like This Heat's ""24-Track Loop""
    slowed down by half.  Jon Leidecker/Wobbly spins ""Winter/War"" and ""Force"" into similarly ""out"" dance music,
    though also turns a few neat tricks with Krause's vocals.  Fans will also want to hear the live tracks on
    the last disc of the box, especially ""The Song of Investment Capital Overseas"" from 1984, featuring an
    expanded line-up including Tom Cora and trombonist George Lewis.</p><p>
    Beginners may not feel so hot about laying down $70 for a box set of a band they've never heard before, and
    even longtime fans will probably be more interested in the studio albums than the bonus material.  However,
    this band is well deserving of the deluxe reissue treatment: Art Bears not only spoke for the best of the
    canon, but their music also sounds almost as ahead of the curve today as it did twenty years ago.  Not many
    others can make such a claim, and those that can (say, Can or Kraftwerk) are rightly revered.  Art Bears
    were that good.</p></div>"|429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/429-art-box/|9.0|Dominique Leone

Its improvisatory approach encourages
    open-minded musicians to tinker with the mechanics of the tune, to subvert traditional structures, to take
    a song apart and rearrange it in new ways.  So it's not especially revolutionary or avant-garde for a jazz
    musician to cover modern rock.  In fact, it's downright nostalgic, recalling a mid-century moment when
    similar reinterpretations were <i>de rigueur</i>.  Too often, however, such coverage can revert to either
    easy irony (Lounge Against the Machine, which is hardly jazz but rooted therein) or stuntwork (The Bad Plus,
    who've recorded versions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Iron Man"").</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, Brad Mehldau, a New York pianist influenced by Bill Evans and Vince Guaraldi, has made
    the Radiohead jazz cover his personal calling card; he has reinterpreted two Radiohead songs on previous
    albums: ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" on <i>The Art of the Trio, Vol. 4: Back at the Vanguard</i> and ""Paranoid
    Android"" on <i>Largo</i>.  It's skirting predictability, but it's not schtick: His versions are never ironic
    or showy, and Mehldau proves resourceful and intuitive in his approach.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Anything Goes</i>, which consists of ten covers, Mehldau tackles ""Everything In Its Right Place"", from
    2001's <i>Kid A</i>, which seems to counter the musical philosophy encapsulated in the album title.  It
    might seem a curious choice-- either incredibly daring or incredibly stupid.  The original emphasizes Thom
    Yorke's digitized and mutilated vocals over the melody itself, which doesn't seem to incorporate more than
    three or four notes in a fairly simple rhythm.</p><p>
    
    But there's something compelling translated into a comparatively bare-bones arrangement.  After a bass intro
    by Larry Grenadier, Mehldau elaborates on the theme thoughtfully, letting the tune spiral out from its center
    while maintaining the tense tone.  What's missing is the original's eerie claustrophobia: In a sense, Mehldau
    liberates the song from the airless confines of <i>Kid A</i> and takes it for a walk around the park.  He
    makes the song both evocative and cerebral, and it fits perfectly among the nine other reinterpretations.</p><p>
    
    While the rest of the album lacks the hipster cache of ""Everything in Its Right Place"", each track is similarly
    deeply thought out and deeply felt.  Mehldau captures the folksy casualness of Paul Simon's ""Still Crazy
    After All These Years"" and the intimate ruefulness of Lerner and Loewe's ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her
    Face"".  ""Get Happy"" takes on a near-manic stride as Jorge Rossy spazzes out on drums, while ""Dreamsville""
    and Hoagy Carmichael's ""Nearness of You"" flow patiently and pensively, easy and unrushed, as the trio
    explore their melodies.</p><p>
    
    Mehldau saves his boldest interpretation for the title song, which of all this album's tracks, strays
    farthest from its source material.  The piano redefines the melody in the first verse, then Grenadier
    hammers the second verse out on bass, before the trio break it open completely.  Cole Porter's original
    had pluck to match its wit; stripped of the lyrics, Mehldau's version is more inward-looking, a statement
    of artistic intent rather than a movie-house crowd-pleaser.</p><p>
    
    It helps that Mehldau co-produced the album, alongside longtime jazz producer Matt Pierson (Miles Davis,
    Count Basie, Bill Evans).  <i>Largo</i>, his previous album, was helmed by Jon Brion, whose SoCal sheen
    gave the songs a clunky, busy sound and usually had Mehldau chasing his tail up and down the keyboard.
    <i>Anything Goes</i> has a much more refined sound: just bass, drums, piano, and no fidgety studio tricks
    to get in the way.  The result is a more focused, but no less resourceful, album that finds a place between
    invention and interpretation, between its everything-in-its-right-place perfectionism and its anything-goes
    adventurousness.</p></div>"|5578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5578-anything-goes/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

How can a fey indie-kid condemn this collection
    of cloying twee-pop covers and not seem like some sanctimonious snob, shrieking cries of ""sacrilege!"" at
    these minor-league indie bands' attempts at hero worship?  Surely these bands are our brethren-- wistful,
    floppy-fringed romantics who fumble through life reciting poetry, being trodden-on and getting caught on
    unattainable women.  Like us, they see the songs of Steven Morrissey as painfully acute in describing
    their own dysfunction.  Why attack them for paying tribute?</p><p>
    
    Maybe because it all seems so heartless.  While <i>Romantic and Square Is Hip and Aware</i> is not the first
    attempt at a tribute to The Smiths (the bored Britpop B-league of <i>The Smiths Is Dead</i>, with its fudged
    covers from Placebo and Supergrass, bears that backwards honor), but it's certainly the most galling, as its
    cast of clueless college-rock enthusiasts clumsily recreate Marr/Morrissey's rain-splattered, angst-laced
    elegies.</p><p>
    
    Frustratingly, the collection begins with promise.  Employing backwards guitars and fragile, folkish whispers,
    female-fronted The Pines provide a soft, autumnal take on ""Ask"".  Later, The Lucksmiths-- the only band on
    this collection whose own material is at all noteworthy-- knock out ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out""
    as the kind of boy/girl duet that Morrissey might have attempted had he ever met many girls.</p><p>
    
    But finding impressive moments on this record is like looking for moments of untainted joy on <i>Meat Is
    Murder</i>.  Take Slipside's straight-laced rendition of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"".
    From the sound of it, they've simply snatched the chords from some bookstore songbook and furnished it
    with a pitch-perfect Morrissey impersonation.  You could hear this shit for free in any student bar in
    the northern hemisphere.</p><p>
    
    Also noteworthy for its cringe-inducing ridiculousness is the Would-Be-Goods' garbling of ""Back to the Old
    House"", whose weightless wreck of anemic harmonies and cuddlecore-cuteness could inspire Isobel Campbell
    pick up an electric guitar.  Lovejoy's ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" even manages to inject some Johnny Marr-mimicking
    guitar lines into its pallid, toiling shoegaze, while Pale Sunday's ""I Know It's Over"" is absurd,
    vocoder-ruined Euro-pop, completely devoid of emotion with impoverished production and cheap keyboard
    whirls.</p><p>
    
    In an age where mere over-exposure is enough to make people revise their opinions of bands, <i>Romantic and
    Square</i> does The Smiths no favors.  It's a record that succeeds in rendering such classic songs as limp,
    lifeless and utterly unremarkable, stripping them of the passion, context and camp wit that made them great
    to begin with.</p></div>"|7743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7743-romantic-and-square-is-hip-and-aware-a-matinee-tribute-to-the-smiths/|3.7|Neil Robertson

Or, to be more specific, I hate the haggard notion that art must
    always strive for so-called truth.  Often, the best literature, film, and music has little or no grounding
    in actuality, instead constructing elaborate, fantastical worlds that may or may not have some loose
    allegorical underpinning.  Tolkien insisted that <i>Lord of the Rings</i> wasn't about World War II or
    the Nuclear Age, and I believe him.  The Coen Brothers are brilliant precisely because their films are set
    in vacuous parallel worlds, which, thanks to their freedom from all things real and current, are usually
    better developed and more palpable than movies that attempt to be relevant.  But music, because
    of its tendency towards abstraction, is perhaps best equipped for escapism.  Some of my favorite albums in
    recent memory used exotic instruments, indecipherable lyrics, and amorphous structures to create a sublime
    aura of the unreal.  If <i>Up in Flames</i> is secretly about politics, I don't want to know.</p><p>
    That said, electronics play a somewhat ambivalent role in music: They can either bend reality beyond
    recognition, or relentlessly exaggerate it.  On!Air!Library!'s self-titled debut LP uses synthesizers
    and other digital affectations largely to the former extent.  While the nine songs follow a highly
    conventional format and feature a bankable triptych of guitar, bass, and drums, the record is engrossing
    and unique despite its obvious limitations.</p><p>
    Finding myself thoroughly absorbed by this album after only a few listens, I was somewhat confused when I
    noticed that the brooding ballad ""Fell to Earth"" uses sound effects from AOL Instant Messenger.  I'd
    previously written it off as obnoxious background noise from my perennially malfunctioning laptop, but at
    that moment, administering the crucial headphone test, I couldn't help feeling betrayed.  What had until
    then provided a pleasant 40-minute vacation from essay writing and general neurosis had been encroached
    upon the harshest of all realities: a reminder of one's inescapable life as a loser.  For objectivity's
    sake, it was the only-- and thus best-- employment of AIM's ubiquitous, creaking digital door that I've
    heard in indie music.  But it nevertheless dampened my enthusiasm, if only nominally, for this svelte pop
    record.</p><p>
    A brief biography of the band at the Arena Rock Recording Company website makes the bold proclamation that
    ""<i>On!Air!Library!</i> looks not to the past but the future.""  This may be true, but On!Air!Library! are
    then subconsciously well-steeped in a vibrant history of forebears.  ""Bread"", with its slack, reverb-laden
    guitars and lazily unfurling lyrics, drips yolky remnants of Galaxie 500 and My Bloody Valentine, while
    ""Feb."" packages a panoply of post-punk and new-wave bands via their Interpol incarnation.  (Interpol drummer
    Sam Fogarino even cameos with angular percussion on the opener, ""Faltered Ego"".)  Other songs regurgitate
    their reference points in sufficiently abridged form.  ""User 28"" effortlessly slithers through several
    different guises before fulminating with impassioned vocals and an insurgent drumbeat.  The song germinates
    in a pool of nebulous drones, and then evolves into a loose structure with twangy guitars and a Bill
    Laswell-inflected bassline, before finally erupting at around the 2\xBD-minute mark.  It's easily the zenith
    of this compact but wonderfully rich album.</p><p>
    Sticklers might disparage Alley and Claudia Deheza's vocals for being tonally off somewhat, but compared
    with another celebrated pair of vocal sisters I recently reviewed for this site (CocoRosie), their style
    is vastly more honest and engaging.  While alternating between derivative and rudimentary, <i>On!Air!Library!</i>
    is nevertheless well executed in its obviousness.  My critiques are mostly caviling, and purposely
    mentioned lastly, as something of an afterthought; this album's merits far overshadow its occasional moments
    of banality.  It's a billowy pop blanket in which to curl up and forget everything that isn't as sweet. If
    On!Air!Library! strive for truth and gritty realism, they've captured something from a distant future where,
    all told, things don't look so bad.</p></div>"|6092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6092-onairlibrary/|8.0|Sam Ubl

    Both a Scribble Jam champion in 1999, and an HBO Blaze Battle winner a year later, Eyedea wields a variety
    of styles, ridiculous flow, a penchant for storytelling, and a distinctive nasal vocal.  Meanwhile, partner
    DJ Abilities is a two-time regional DMC champion and arguably one of the underground's best DJs.
    Unfortunately, their sophomore release, <i>E&amp;A;</i>, brings up the same question prompted by their debut,
    <i>First Born</i>: With all this talent, how is it that these two can't come up with a solid album?</p><p>
    
    Here, it may easily be chalked up to a kneejerk change of direction.  Seemingly taking the negative press
    surrounding <i>First Born</i>'s pretensions as a universal distaste for rap records that display topical
    depth, Eyedea makes a deliberate move away from heady concept and into the worn realm of the angry b-boy:
    <i>E&amp;A;</i>'s material here ranges from songs about wack rappers, to rap fans, to the rap industry, and
    tacks on a song about glass as an afterthought.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes, the approach works-- usually when progressive means are attached to it.  ""Reintroducing"" opens
    the album with a serious bang, with applause and a rigid drum loop bookended by upright bass.  But Eyedea's
    impassioned vocals are what really drive the track home:  As Eyedea delivers his lines, DJ Abilities
    simultaneously scratches them, causing an incredibly weird effect I've never heard before.  ""Now"" is tied
    together by an interesting piano vamp, with Eyedea styling all over the cut, and switching from a slow-motion
    chant to an impressive staccato flow that's tracked by Abilities' constantly evolving jazz-drummer speed-shifts
    and drum rolls.  Songs like these lean closer to more of a Quannum-style sound, and they open the album,
    leading to high expectations.  The remaining songs, however, follow traditional song structures, their
    beats and lyrics largely failing to impress or remain with the listener.</p><p>
    
    If anything stands out on <i>E&amp;A;</i>, it's DJ Abilities' turntable talents.  He's far from the level of
    professional awe-inspirers like Q-Bert, Nu-Marc and Cut Chemist, but he comes through shockingly strong on
    ""Reintroducing"" and ""One Twenty"".  Still, his production is off.  Fundamentally speaking, his drum work is
    solid, if ultimately uninventive, and his general aesthetic falls squarely within the tried-and-true
    boundaries of barebones, mid-90s-styled jazz-hop, a style that's worked well for hundreds of others.
    The problem lies with his sample choices and lack of creativity in composition: Check his played-out 80s
    bass nodes, car alarms, and irritating spacy synthline on ""Star Destroyer"", or the cartoonish, accelerated
    saloon piano and cliched beat programming on ""One Twenty"".  Although his ambient approach goes well with the
    purpose of the album, he tends to make poor choices where beatmaking is concerned.</p><p>
    
    Eyedea's lack of intriguing topical choices is a problem area, too.  It's understood that he doesn't want
    to be labeled ""the borderline Anticon conceptual guy"" but when your most ambitious tracks whine about
    humankind's domination over nature and rely on estrogenic reflections, there's a problem.  You'd think a
    Scribble Jam battle champion would have some punchlines, right?  Then again, you'd probably also think a
    DMC champion DJ might have some decent samples up his sleeve.</p><p>
    
    Granted, the album does hit in both departments on occasion, from the dark, reflective beats on ""Glass""
    and Eyedea's emotive vocal performance on ""One Twenty"", but the duo's retro approach doesn't provide them
    the proper setting to display their technical prowess.  There's no doubting the wealth of talent displayed
    on <i>E&amp;A;</i>, but until they find a better producer, or at least find a way to better utilize their obvious
    chemistry, they'll likely be doomed to more identity crises like this one.</p></div>"|2886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2886-ea/|6.0|Rollie Pemberton

    sight of the fact that B-sides are B-sides for a reason.  Frequently, outtakes simply break from an album's
    self-determined tenor; other times, they're just undeveloped.  Unfortunately, like most compilations of its
    nature, Broken Social Scene's freshly minted collection of rarities and otherwise unreleased material,
    <i>Beehives</i>, is plagued by both problems, and suffers from a paucity of ideas.</p><p>
<i>Beehives</i> finds the band indulging in the post-rock noodling of 2001's stuporific <i>Feel Good Lost</i>.
    Generally, the tracks here are pleasant and well-produced, but are rarely engaging enough to justify their
    runtimes.  This is not the Broken Social Scene of <i>You Forgot It In People</i>, and indeed, it was clearly
    not intended to be, as the collection describes itself as ""songs for the come down.""  But perhaps <i>Beehives</i>
    comes down a little too much, almost consciously avoiding the band's proven strengths: energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>
    
    Most of these songs could stand to be about a third their length.  Tracks like the guitar-sliding shuffle
    ""Weddings"", ""Ambulance for the Ambience"" with all its blips, bells, and solo synth whistles, and the horny,
    throaty scream-lullaby ""Time = Cause"" are cavernous and wholly pretty, but stagnate almost instantly.  It
    doesn't help that these meanderings all share the same mid-tempo lilt: When taken in its entirety, this
    continual sameness gives the album an unbearably flat feel.</p><p>
    
    ""Da Da Dada"", to its own credit, manages to spark some interest at the compilation's midpoint by launching
    into a brief, hazed reprise of <i>You Forgot It in People</i>'s ""Cause = Time"", but before you know it,
    the song has settled back into the tepid fog of held belltones and noise which it opened with.  Ambient
    music does not mean stagnant music-- in fact, the word itself is derived from a compound of the Latin verb
    ""to go""-- but all too often on <i>Beehives</i>, this distinction seems to collapse.  The most successful of
    the instrumentals here, ""Hallmark"", succeeds precisely because, as an upbeat, drum-machine driven number,
    it refuses to stick with one pattern for too long, as its guitar lines and harmonica hums anxiously
    crisscross one another and grow in complexity.</p><p>
    
    ""Market Fresh"", meanwhile, is as close to a B-side as we might expect from <i>You Forgot It in People</i>--
    its midtempo groove situates itself squarely between their two full-lengths in terms of haziness and propensity.
    Leslie Feist's vocal/piano reworking of ""Lover's Spit"" is temporarily intriguing, but fails to differentiate
    much from the original LP version.  <i>Beehives</i>' only real standout, then, comes with ""Backyards"".  Here,
    Emily Haines' vocals are mixed democratically with the other instruments, and her matte delivery adds
    further texture to the exceptionally lush accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, with this one exception, <i>Beehives</i> remains pretty but formless, and its status as an outtakes
    and rarities collection confirms that the band, to whatever extent, agrees in this regard.  It's a shame
    that this offering fails to display the kind of passion and intensity Broken Social Scene have displayed
    in the recent material they've played in concert, but then, most of these tracks are culled from a time
    before the band hit their stride.  It seems we'll just have to wait until their next full-length.</p></div>"|954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/954-beehives/|5.6|Nick Sylvester

    next to abstract paintings and you couldn't buy <i>Ulysses</i> without an authoritative guide to explain
    the references.  Who could enjoy Joyce if you can't tell the Biblical references from the Dublin slang for
    abusing oneself?  I'm right there with you, which is why I used to bang my head against Cerberus Shoal's
    last disc, <i>Chaiming the Knobblesome</i>.</p><p>
<i>Chaiming</i> was a major break from the past for a band that had already changed directions many times
    since their formation in the mid-90s.  Cerberus Shoal have always played unique avant-rock, from the hardcore
    influence and glorious crescendos of their first albums to the steady pacing and global thrift store
    arrangements of their mid-career line-up.  But <i>Chaiming</i> was their most complex effort yet: Suddenly,
    they had a torrent of words, in a surreal language.  It was too meticulous to be stream-of-consciousness,
    but too chaotic to reveal any kind of meaning.</p><p>
    
    It never occurred to me that there might not be a right answer, until I drove up the coast to Portland,
    Maine, to ask the band in person.  The change came after they lost three members--- who went back full-time
    to playing as Tarpigh-- and gained three new ones.  Erin Davidson signed up after leaving Red Light City,
    but the band also brought in two less experienced musicians: Colleen Kinsella, who has drawn their cover
    art since <i>Homb</i> and sung in a folk duo with Shoal co-founder Chriss Sutherland, and Karl Greenwald,
    who had never been in a band, and who became their chief lyricist and Dr. Sample operator.</p><p>
    
    Even in avant-rock, a song's words are usually its focus.  But that goes against the collaborative nature
    of Cerberus Shoal's music, where each member gets equal say and the music never centers on a lead voice.
    So the lyrics that Greenwald and the others write winds through the music like another instrument, and the
    words don't resolutely dictate a meaning-- except what the other players, and the audience, can find in
    the mysterious but provocative images.</p><p>
    
    The schism between 2002's <i>Mr. Boy Dog</i> and 2003's <i>Chaiming the Knobblesome</i> makes more sense if
    you listen to the split EPs they recorded in that time.  (""Ding"", on <i>The Vim and Vigour of Alvarius B and
    Cerberus Shoal</i>, is a definitive track for this line-up.)  But <i>Bastion of Itchy Preeves</i>, which was
    actually recorded before <i>Chaiming</i>, is the most complete document of the band's transition.  You can
    hear the methodical pace of the earlier Shoal on ""Tekel Upharsin"", where Tom Kovacevic returns to play oud.
    But the exotic instrumentation of the Tarpigh line-up makes way for alarm clocks and noise collages, from
    the howling scrap metal of ""Grandsire"" to the shimmering wrap-up, ""A Head No Bigger than a Man's Cloud"",
    where the electronics and bass drip like mercury.</p><p>
    
    And after the occasional vocals of their past few albums, most of this line-up sings.  Sutherland's grainy
    tenor meets graceful wordless choruses on some songs, and eerier ejaculations on others: Kinsella's cackling
    on ""Train Car Nursery"", or Greenwald muttering and cranking like the troll that lives in your closet.  The
    words on ""Baby Gal"" and ""Train Car Nursery"" have the sinister tone of the <i>Chaiming</i> material, but most
    of the lyrics slip in gradually.  You can hear the excitement in the build-up of ""Bogart the Change"", where
    Sutherland grasps for words and fragments of lyrics as the music escalates, and when he reaches the climactic
    line-- ""I know your feathers are wet""-- it bursts out not as cryptic nonsense, but as a near-epiphany of
    triumphant understanding.</p><p>
    
    Even at its extremes, <i>Bastion</i> has a smoother flow and more consistent palette than either <i>Mr. Boy
    Dog</i> or <i>Chaiming</i>.  For a transitional album, it doesn't show a new band's fits and starts so much
    as the organic evolution of its voice.  This is such a strong lead-in to <i>Chaiming</i> that the people
    who were surprised by the band's new direction may wish they'd heard this first.  Fascinating in its own
    right, this album also taps your imagination more gently, and it's a smoother introduction to the world
    that Cerberus Shoal moved into.  Either way, the two albums are perfect complements: <i>Chaiming</i> fully
    realizes this line-up, but <i>Bastion</i> illustrates how they got there.</p></div>"|1386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1386-bastion-of-itchy-preeves/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

    as one of his favorite storytellers.  At the time, I'd only passingly listened to her two self-released
    EPs, and was more familiar with her keyboard work with San Francisco's The Pleased and harp contributions
    to the Deerhoof/Hella side project Nervous Cop.  But that's changed with the release of her first long
    player, <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i>.  Here, the words to her meandering stories-- disarming in their formal
    purity, but still highly individualized and eccentric-- elaborate on an aesthetic that evokes French coins,
    dark maroon leaves, shafts of wheat, and ostrich feathers as much as it references them directly.</p><p>
    
    Born in Nevada City and currently residing in San Francisco, Newsom's yarns summon a deep, rustic South.
    A line in the buoyant ""Bridges and Balloons"" uses e.e. cummings neologisms and <i>Omoo</i>'s breezy prosody
    to impart the tale of a winter's day on a fallible ship: ""The sight of bridge and balloon/ Makes calm canaries
    irritable/ They caw and claw all afternoon/ 'Catenaries and dirigibles/ Brace and buoy the living room/ A
    loom of metal, warp-woof-wimble/ And a thimblesworth of milky moon/ Can touch hearts larger than a thimble.""
    In ""Sadie"", the title character is asked to accept a pinecone and a bone, talismans to ward off death.
    Really, they're the gentlest tokens that mark the beginning of a relationship, and later reaffirm the love
    despite an inevitable move towards taciturnity.</p><p>
    
    Newsom's wonderfully detailed romanticism (""Your skin is something that I stir into my tea""), homespun
    wisdom (""Never get so attached to a poem, you forget truth that lacks lyricism""), idiosyncratic flourishes
    (""See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus""), and insights into the prosaic (""There are some mornings/
    When the sky looks like a road"") infuse each track with the weightiness of an embroidered travel narrative
    and a private field-recording.</p><p>
    
    She wields a joyful trill reminiscent of Texas Gladden on her ""Devil and the Farmer's Wife"", while
    her often childlike intonation also recalls Linda Hagood of the early '90s Uncle Wiggly-related trio,
    Smackdab, saturated with the air of '60s English folkie Vashti Bunyan.  Showing an appreciation for
    Appalachian folk and the experimental composer/folksong scholar Ruth Crawford Seeger, her spare
    arrangements-- harp, Wurlitzer electronic piano, harpsichord, piano, and slide-guitar on two tracks--
    unwind like early Homestead oddity, The Supreme Dicks.</p><p>
    
    Creating avant-garde American music for the back porch, she expands upon tradition without losing authenticity.
    In this sense, her practice could be linked to Devendra Banhart, a friend and kindred spirit.  Both map a
    pile of eccentricities that tumble together to create something useful, familiar, and nearly sacred.  Here's
    hoping to a duet for the new folk future.  Perhaps Kenny-and-Dolly style?</p></div>"|5893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5893-the-milk-eyed-mender/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    indie circuit for years, producing self-released CD-Rs at the kind of prolific pace that would make Ryan
    Adams look like a recluse.  Now, with his cult status ensured through his affiliation with the little-known
    Fence Collective and Khartoum Heroes, he gives us <i>Kenny &amp; Beth's Musakal Boat Rides</i>, his first
    ramshackle release of hard-hearted, sample-addled lo-fi folk.</p><p>
    
    When he gets it right, the results can be quite beautiful.  As an accordion weeps with an asthmatic wheeze
    and a sole guitar plucks in the distance, Anderson slurs through ""Lavender Dream"", detailing some spoilt
    fantasy, aided and abetted by labelmate James Yorkston's effortless harmonies.  With its single lyric,
    ""You've got rise about the gutter you are inside,"" the sparse acoustics of ""Harper's Dough"" are perversely
    uplifting, promising hope and redemption from life's great lows.  Here, King Creosote seems similar in mood
    to fellow Scottish miserablists Arab Strap, dispensing bar-room philosophy that treads a thin line between
    downbeat observation and the faith that something better will come.</p><p>
    
    Some of the record's more uptempo offerings aim for the strange synergy of classic folk and electronics
    attempted by the likes of The Beta Band, with whom Anderson's brother Gordon (now of Lone Pigeon) co-wrote
    ""Dry the Rain"".  ""Homeboy""'s buoyant marching-band beat and underbelly of samples and looped vocal fragments
    only enhance the song's bold melodic grandstanding, while ""So Forlorn"" sounds like hip-hop that's been
    gutted of its gruff machismo and hi-jacked to suit the screwed muse of its author.</p><p>
    
    But for all the blissful torch-songs here, there are certainly elements that frustrate.  The lovely
    ""Counseling"" may be embellished with Anderson's sweet Scottish croon, but it stops dead and undeveloped
    at just over 90 seconds, as it runs out of things to say.  And when the songs don't crash to an abrupt
    end, they can tend to meander without ever getting started.  For example, the number of ideas shown in
    the labored ""Friday Night in New York"" can't justify it stretching into an eight-minute odyssey of
    slow-motion strumming.</p><p>
    
    In spite of its faults, King Creosote's debut can still be seen as a charming piece of bashful and
    embittered troubadouring, and a clutch of touching lamplight laments that manage to outshine its tendency
    to flit from emotion to idea without always knowing how to connect the two.  It may soon be forgotten in
    the rush to discover the next great songwriter, but for a few late nights in the timid uncertainty of the
    new year, a few of the songs on <i>Kenny &amp; Beth Musakal Boat Rides</i> may find your soft-spot, and proceed
    to stroke, push and pester it into submission.  Sometimes that's all you can ask.</p></div>"|4573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4573-kenny-beths-musakal-boat-rides/|7.1|Neil Robertson

Ever since he hooked up with jazz pianist Satoko Fujii at the outset of the decade, I've     noticed a calmer tendency in his music; be it a greater willingness to emphasize improvisation and chamber-jazz     dynamics, or just his gradual distancing from manic, screeching, distorted chaos, the guy seems somehow less     combustible than in previous years.   Although longtime fans somewhat mourn the days when he might have spent     an entire LP side exorcising demons from his larynx, I welcome the change.  Yoshida no longer needs to prove     his endurance or facility with piss-take screaming etudes, nor does he need to ram out a hundred more     avant-zeuhl tunes to express himself.</p>
<p>By the same token, Fujii's collaboration with the drummer seems to have brought out her most concise and     aggressive qualities.  While her big band releases (Eastern and Western) were admirably open to experimentation     and the kind of eclectic sound palette, I've always thought she was at her best in a small group.  With     Yoshida, her pieces seem to unfold without any hint of rehearsed mannerisms or particular obligation to     appease the jazz tradition.  <i>Erans</i> is their second release as a duo, and fourth together if you     include their work with Fujii Quartet.  Judging by the music therein, they're only getting better together.</p>
<p>The two performers split writing duties down the middle, and share composer credits on two songs.  The first     of those is the excellent title track, beginning as impressionistic rumbles from Yoshida's kit and fragmented     runs by Fujii.  They gradually build up tension with faster and faster statements before Fujii announces the     head with a short unison fanfare and the pair nails accents together in a similar fashion as most other     Yoshida projects.  The difference here is in both the refined precision of the playing (it's certainly the     closest to straight jazz Yoshida has come), and in the advanced harmonic ideas Fujii introduces.  And     although the other writing collaboration, ""Shimesaba"", presents a completely different mood-- imagine     modern jazz and speed-disco crossed with the Charleston-- the willingness to compliment and follow one     another marks the sign of a mature group, one whose aims betray forward momentum at all costs.</p>
<p>Yoshida's ""Feirsttix"" appears twice on the CD, once as an instrumental and later adding vocals.  It's the     kind of tune that would sound perfectly at home on a Ruins record, but again, Fujii's way with harmonic     development and her ease with covering the entire range of her instrument to lend the broadest possible     range of sound to this music are what make <i>Erans</i> an invigorating, accommodating listen.  Her own     pieces, like the ECM-tinged, odd-meter ""Westerlies"" or Ravel-meets-Cecil Taylor vignette ""Iwashi No Uroko"",     shine via restrained, relaxed performance and a highly sophisticated use of rhythm that almost always     perfectly offsets Yoshida's more brawny style.  And somehow, they always manage to lock onto each other     during the structured moments, even after spending most of the CD exploring areas far outside the lead     sheet.  ""Westerlies"", in particular, should be held as an example of how to fuse explosiveness with     subtlety in jazz without seeming contrived or convoluted.</p>
<p>Fans of either musician should grab hold of <i>Erans</i>, but perhaps better, modern small-group jazz     listeners in general will find much to enjoy here.  Though ten years ago it would have been crazy to     assume that Yoshida might one day find an audience among the bookstore and coffee-table socialites, this     record is right at the cusp of being accessible to jazz snobs and noise freaks alike.  And the best news is     that nobody had to compromise to get to that point; it was merely a matter of finding the right musical     partner.</p></div>"|8906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8906-erans/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    electronic label Gooom Disques.  M83, Cyann &amp; Ben, Mils, and Abstrackt Keal Agram comprise the white-hot
    nucleus of the imprint (and, for that matter, the French electronic scene, at least as far as we
    &lt;<am>&gt; can ascertain).  If Europe has traditionally housed small, prolific pockets of
    groundbreaking electronic artists, Gooom is the DFA of the labels that sponsor them, sporting an upstart
    roster of innovative acts and an impressive cache of mixtapes to prove it.  Abstrackt Keal Agram are the
    most hip-hop-oriented of the crop, as witnessed by frequent collaborations with rap duo Atoms Family and
    a pesky jones for remixing, which resulted in last year's sensational transmogrification of M83's ""Run
    into Flowers"".  Unfortunately, <i>Cluster Ville</i>, the Morlaix, France duo's sophomore album, lags
    somewhat behind their proven remix skills.</am></p><p>
    The album kicks off on a sterling note with a trio of songs that run neck-and-neck with the bulk of the
    Gooom repertoire.  ""Del"", the incendiary opener, chugs for four minutes on a determined beat while
    weaving a firm tapestry of no-frills synthesizers.  The compositional style recalls nothing so much as
    instrumental rock bands like Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, whose songs incorporate a static foundation
    on which they can perform instrumental variations, forcing the listener to experience every subtlety in
    order to gain a full appreciation of the music.  ""Pièce"" continues in this fashion, as a similar beat
    drives a gently pulsating array of synthesizers.  Meanwhile, a Rhodes piano scatters spare, repetitive
    dabs of color, suggesting Prefuse 73's sci-fi beatmaking.  The aptly titled ""Brouillard"" is a scatterbrained
    montage of orchestral swells, parsed beats, and hissing found sound.  Coupled with spare, monastic murmuring
    and an austere synth melody, the song sounds like a Hitchcock mystery overture from the 22nd century.</p><p>
    Those three inaugural tracks, however, constitute the effervescent summit of <i>Cluster Ville</i>, which
    means it's gently but steadily downhill from there.  When the haze clears, the listener is left with the
    inexplicable ""Mata Hari"", a dull, mechanical rap that features clunky verses, drooled in the Queen's best
    English, from Cryptic and Alaska of the Atoms Family.  The French stylings of James Delleck and La Caution
    on ""L'oreille Droite"", <i>Cluster Ville</i>'s only other vocal track, are a slightly smoother and more
    interesting, mainly due to their foreign novelty.  Other songs, named for such great minds as ""Nietzsche""
    and Grandaddy's ""Jason Lytle"", show promise early on, but are quickly smothered by lachrymose monotony and
    epic length.</p><p>
<i>Cluster Ville</i> is distinctively hip-hop in flavor, more indebted to Josh Davis and Scott Herren than
    to other musique electronique artists such as M83 or Air.  At times, though, the group seems equally enamored
    of the American hip-hop aesthetic as they are of its sound.  The aforementioned ""Mata Hari"" is littered with
    irreverent, tough-talking emcee samples and references to, among other things, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, Elton
    Brand, and naturally, guns, and while there's nothing wrong with these subjects, the song lacks a context to
    substantiate their usage.  The overwrought solemnity of certain songs is another hindrance.  Without the
    much-needed contrast of sunnier moments, ""A.C.,"" ""Audio Crash"" and ""Petersbourg"", which form the middle
    section of the album, turn languorous, plodding onward like cogs in Maxime Gorky's factory.  Too often, the
    duo seem to force emotional gravity upon their songs through a reliance on minor key drones and near-industrial
    beats.  The effect is enervating.</p><p>
    Abstrackt Keal Agram are the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques roster.  They posses the
    enthusiasm and the talent to create good work, but <i>Cluster Ville</i> lacks the consistency, urbanity,
    and introspectiveness of recent albums by M83 and Mils.  Whereas their labelmates have assimilated
    technology into their songwriting styles to the point that it's become as elemental as acoustic
    instrumentation, Abstrackt Keal Agram still seem unduly fascinated by it.  If they can trim their
    eagerness, and lend the same verve to their original songs as they do to their remixes, Gooom might
    have another winner on their hands.  And if they can't, well, the label could still employ them as
    the resident house mashers.</p></div>"|436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/436-cluster-ville/|6.2|Sam Ubl

Nesmith, of course, is better known as the lanky, wool-capped Monkee, but his career also took     turns into weird film/television projects like Popclips (which would one day morph into the behemoth known     as MTV) and Elephant Parts, as well as a modest stake in that gilded-country sound of his solo career     (his greatest success still being the pen behind Linda Ronstadt's ""Different Drum"").</p>
<p>Fans of <i>Being There</i> or <i>The Royal Tennenbaums</i> soundtrack can imagine a mashing of the two     for Ian Matthews' exquisite, swooping country-take of ""These Days"", his reedy voice replacing Nico's     morphine drip.  As a collector of songs, his ear was excellent, with many of his covers being turned     into gold for other MOR artists.  Without the help of the songwriter credits, it'd be hard to glean     what songs are the traditional folk standards and which are 50s country two-step.  Then there's the rare     Richard Thompson song and the rare Randy Newman one.  Not to mention that Matthews' is an adept writer,     too, slipping his originals into the running order.  He commingles the disparate strands effortlessly,     infusing them with his laidback pacing and quivering, gentle voice until they're all of a piece.  His     take on Nesmith's concise friendship-into-love song ""Propinquity"" gets delivered with a tender lilt,     while his cover of Steve Young's ""7 Bridges Road"" was lifted wholesale by the Eagles in the early 80s.</p>
<p>They also made a hit out of Tom Waits' ""Ol' 55"", a song which opens Ian Matthews' sixth album, <i>Some     Days You Eat the Bear and Some Days the Bear Eats You</i>, released a year later.  Without Nesmith's     Texas twang touch behind the board, the album hangs a little more precariously, less cohesive than its     predecessor.  Matthews' ""Keep on Sailing"" (which opened <i>Valley Hi</i>) gets slowed to a sluggish,     sax-stuffed pace.  The covers still stun, though.  Crazy Horse's heartbreaking ""I Don't Wanna Talk About     It"" (Rod Stewart hit with it) and Gene Clark's ""Tried So Hard"" (covered back in his days with Fairport     Convention) are delivered with a mastery that stands along with the originals while also sounding refreshed     in Matthews' throat.  The second side of the album, however, falls off with the Steely Dan and Jesse     Winchester covers lost under that ever-increasing smog of adult contemporary radio.  Still, for a good part     of this two-fer collection of his Elektra solo albums, Matthews' recasts the future hits with effortless     grace, reaching into his English past and his American country present to amalgamate something distinct,     never once sounding like he's just out riding fences.</p></div>"|11782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11782-valley-hi-some-days-you-eat-the-bear-and-some-days-the-bear-eats-you/|7.8|Andy Beta

Still, for a good part     of this two-fer collection of his Elektra solo albums, Matthews' recasts the future hits with effortless     grace, reaching into his English past and his American country present to amalgamate something distinct,     never once sounding like he's just out riding fences.</p></div>"|11782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11782-valley-hi-some-days-you-eat-the-bear-and-some-days-the-bear-eats-you/|7.2|Andy Beta

It
    wasn't a bad album but the overt Pole worship was hard to overlook, especially considering that Stefan
    Betke himself had by then decided that ghostly digi-dub was tired and decided to move on.  Yes, Monteith
    made some unusual decisions, such as pinching the bass to focus on busier, more detailed midrange, but
    <i>Wildlife Documentaries</i> would never have happened without the groundbreaking (and still great)
    <i>Pole 1</i>.</p><p>
    Since then, Monteith has teamed with Stephen Beaupré to record micro-sampling minimal house (last year's
    <i>It's a Crackhaus Thing</i>), and now returns with <i>Something Borrowed, Something Blue</i>.  On first
    listen, it's clear that <i>Something Borrowed, Something Blue</i> was shot with the same film stock as
    <i>Wildlife Documentaries</i>.  Dub again provides the structure and there's plenty of pop.  But can this
    seemingly limited set of variables be combined into a successful record one more time?</p><p>
    Well, yes, miraculously.  <i>Something Borrowed, Something Blue</i> is a major improvement on <i>Wildlife
    Documentaries</i>, and it manages to create an intriguing and unfamiliar world from commonplace building
    blocks.  The album was inspired by Monteith's recent marriage (hence the title), and damn if it isn't more
    direct and emotionally engaging than anything he's done.  The short track ""A Brief Explanation"" bleeds
    seamlessly into ""Head Over Heels"" to open the album, and the two function together as an 8\xBD-minute
    statement of purpose.  I'm reminded of the remix EP that Pole did for the Leaf label with Four Tet,
    because ""Head Over Heels"" so brilliantly combines a simple, delicate piano flourishes with clusters of
    throbbing crackle and the suggestion of reggae underneath.</p><p>
    I believe sampled crickets make up at least part of the main rhythm element in ""Head Over Heels"", and this
    churning, high-end pattern becomes a curiously essential feature of the album.  It serves as a bridge from
    one track to next, dropping out occasionally to focus the energy on the bass, and then returning to remind
    us of what album we're listening to.  The percussion echoing away from the center of ""White Out"" might be
    disappearing into primeval jungle, and ""Requiem"" answers with commanding bass that stretches far beneath
    anything on this album's intentionally thin precursor.</p><p>
    The aptly named ""Joyful Noise (Part 1)"" guides the quaking bottom into more melodic territory, as it
    provides a loping, sun-ripened tune to complement the endless swarm of double-time shakers.  ""Joyful
    Noise (Part 2)"" finds Deadbeat drifting into noisier territory, as the track swells into a chorus of
    digital insects and leaves development behind.  On the whole, this record is an interesting inversion.
    Where quintessential glitch describes a world existing on an abstract plane of pure energy, Deadbeat's
    music manages to be playful, fleshy and surprisingly fresh.</p></div>"|2221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2221-something-borrowed-something-blue/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Yet, from an art-historical perspective, it's the dissociation of the two, not the intersection, that has always been most curious: Relatively speaking, only recently have religion and high art not been commonly joined at the hip.  Religion has always served as an inspiration and benefactor of art, a fact which has made it all the more amusing when people criticize <em>The Passion</em> as an awful film purely because of its religious content-- they might as well pass over, among others, the Laocoon statue, the Sistine Chapel, Bach's St. Matthaus Passion, and practically every Dostoevesky or Joyce novel.</p><p>That said, skepticism still greets the release of <em>Seven Swans</em>, Sufjan Stevens' sparse and intimate fourth album, in which the Detroit-raised Brooklynite deals with the stories of his Christian faith most directly.  Which is not to say that <em>Michigan</em> and its tales of personal grief and acceptance of one's suffering were any less Christian in ethos, just that <em>Seven Swans</em> is so topically concerned with Christianity that a few wrong steps could easily have been a disaster.  Religious content, by its very faith-based nature, is passionate and fantastical, and, if not fashioned with a commensurate degree of care and artifice, the emotion exceeds the form, throwing the listener headlong into the realm of melodrama and self-parody (confer all ""Christian rock"" bands).</p><p>Frank Rich himself talks of <em>The Passion</em>'s unbridled over-the-toppity, the film ""constructed like nothing so much as a porn movie.""  Where <em>The Passion</em> fails artistically for Rich is not in its highly charged subject matter, but in its crudely considered execution.  On similar grounds, <em>Seven Swans</em> partly succeeds for me because Sufjan rarely steps foot in the excess of pedantic preaching, despite the openly Christian nature of his lyrics here.  At their melodic cores, the songs on <em>Seven Swans</em> are equally as potent as those on <em>Michigan</em>, though perhaps a little rougher around the edges and generally more sparsely arranged.  The raw simplicity, coupled with the stripped-down, banjo-led instrumentation, lends <em>Seven Swans</em> a particularly high degree of sincerity: Even if we're not taken by the subject matter, we're taken by how beautifully and personally Sufjan is taken by it.</p>
<p>On songs like ""All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands"" and ""To Be Alone with You"", Sufjan does well to collapse the distinction between divine- and human-directed affections-- his ""You"" could apply to God and loved one alike.  Especially in the former song, which opens <em>Seven Swans</em>, Sufjan showcases his curious ability to change a song's grief-stricken tenor to a hopeful one on the flash.  The opening moments prove this eloquently: As Sufjan sings, ""If I am alive this time next year,"" his weary banjo accompaniment slowly imbues the line with convincing optimism, a progression that continues throughout the song with similar effect as Sufjan is joined by a breathy background chorus from Elin and Megan Smith and drummer David Smith's labored tympanics.</p>
<p>Because Sufjan commits himself so rigorously to this sparse, acoustic compositions, those few moments when electric instruments are used are particularly powerful.  The first comes in ""The Dress Looks Nice on You"", in which tandem plucks and sweeps of guitar and banjo are suddenly contraposed midway against a quirky Casio keyboard breakdown.  A second comes during the vaguely alt-country lullaby ""Sister"", which positions a light, nondescript jangle behind a screaming electric guitar that arises from the swell to become even more lively and expansive as the song builds on its repeated anthem.</p>
<p>""Abraham"", ""Seven Swans"" and ""The Transfiguration"" confront religion most directly, and to varying success. In ""Abraham"", Sufjan briefly recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith to sacrifice his son Isaac (""Take up on the wood/ Put it on your son""), leads Isaac up a mountain and prepares to kill him as commanded before God sends an angel to intervene.  (See also: Leonard Cohen's beautiful ""Story of Isaac"".)  Musically, the song marks the lowpoint of <em>Seven Swans</em>: Sufjan's vocal melody is well-delivered but somewhat impotent, and the backup chorus seems incongruous given the subject matter.</p>
<p>As the last two songs on the album, ""Seven Swans"" and ""The Transfiguration"" seem to work as a pair.  Both are of relatively epic lengths and movement-like constructions, and as equal statements of faith-- the fear-inspiring ""My father burned into coal,"" and the comforting ""Have no fear! We draw near!""-- they dovetail perfectly.  First, ""Seven Swans"" is a dark, brooding anticipation of the Apocalypse in which Sufjan begins with a foreboding banjo line, only to be swept up in crashing storms of resonant piano and a terrifying octave-jumping chorus of ""He is the Lord!"", easily one of <em>Seven Swans</em>' most memorable moments.  ""The Transfiguration"" follows immediately on the bittersweet note of Jesus' requisite suffering, the song performatively ebbing back and forth from major to minor chords as new melodies and instruments are stuffed into the mix.</p>
<p>Given Sufjan's ability to handle such dangerously effusive material as his own religion so well, it's no wonder that he aligns himself with the similarly concerned writer Flannery O'Connor, whose short story, <em>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</em>, is recast here from the perspective of O'Connor's Mephistophelic character, The Misfit.  O'Connor, as the late Yale professor Robert Dubbin noted, is unusually capable of masking the Christian mechanisms at work in her stories without cheapening them-- she effectively crafts Christian revelatory experiences into ones of universal enormity and applicability.  The same comment could very well apply to Sufjan Stevens on <em>Michigan</em> and <em>Seven Swans</em> alike: A gifted musician to begin with, Sufjan invites not our religious conversions, but our innate human compassion.</p></div>"|7512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7512-seven-swans/|8.1|Nick Sylvester

I don't mean more than your
    friend or that guy on that message board who seems to know about every buzz-worthy leaked CD before anyone
    else, but rather, more than any previous generation of active music fans.  Think about all our MP3s and
    CDRs, the stuff we actually buy, and then add in the music we hear once and immediately declare isn't
    worth the 45 seconds we spent with it.  It almost seems ridiculous, because ultimately, few of us would be
    willing to recommend more than but a few songs (let alone albums) to anyone outside our close-knit music
    circles.  Digital media was supposed to satisfy the audiophiles with better sound and the businessmen with
    yet another kind of product to convince us we weren't getting everything we could out of music/life.
    However, its primary effect has been to level music's impact to a similar scale as any other commodity--
    outside those few songs we cling to like family, most of it ends up being used as trade-bait, rep maintenance,
    decoration and garbage.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to blame this on the digital age, but then, it seems to have been going on longer than MP3s and
    file-sharing.  Kids have been comparing and competing with record collections for as long as I can remember--
    probably as long as my mom can remember, too-- but there must have been a time when our hallowed few songs
    were the only ones that mattered at all.  Maybe during the days when people were more worried about war or
    disease or how they were going to eat in the winter; was it ""folk music"" they were hearing and singing?  I
    imagine ""entertainment"" and ""self-expression"" weren't as valuable as functionality and therapeutic relevance
    in music.</p><p>
    
    Devendra Banhart's second full-length (and first of two planned 2004 releases), <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i>,
    harkens back to a time before music had so many cultural roles.  It's not necessarily an ""old-fashioned""
    record, insofar as his performances or songs are concerned.  Banhart's lyrics are as often seemingly
    nonsensical as they are evocative or descriptive, and his songs defy almost any conventional form you care
    to introduce.  There are references to traditional American folk and blues, as well as hints of British
    acoustic folk along the lines of Fairport Convention, Bert Jansch and Banhart favorite Vashti Bunyan (who
    sings on the title track).  However, for the most part, <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> is a record concerned
    with the absolute smallest things in life-- which usually end up being the most important-- helping pass
    the time when time is the only thing going anywhere.  It's unconcerned with the past or the future, and is
    only too ready to supply songs you could sing after dinner or first thing in the morning.  It seems valuable
    to hear something like ""we have a choice, we chose rejoice"" coming from a new CD, as if that was the only
    kind of value music was ever supposed to have.</p><p>
    
    Unlike Banhart's 2002 debut, <i>Oh Me Oh My</i>, <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> was professionally recorded,
    and a few tracks feature backing musicians (including Angels of Light alums Thor Harris, Joe McGinty and
    Siobahn Duffy).  It's far from slick, though, reeking of rustic, homemade charm.  Furthermore, it surpasses
    <i>Oh Me Oh My</i> in both songwriting and Banhart's singing.  His songs no longer veer into bizarro
    cadences or witchy vocal overdubs; Young God's Michael Gira remarks that he didn't want to pigeonhole
    Banhart as a lo-fi eccentric, and consequently, the singer's range of expression (and surprising delicacy)
    is given full justice.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""This Is the Way"" sets forth the unhurried charge, confident in its own idiosyncrasy.  Banhart's
    wordless count-off to his subtly accomplished fingerpicked guitar work betrays a casual ideal, even as
    couplets like, ""I knew, I knew I could stand tall/ I could lay low,"" seem typically Banhartian in their
    benign whimsy.  Likewise, the short guitar instrumental ""Tit Smoking in the Temple of Artesan Mimicry""
    seems strangely familiar in its relaxed, uncomplicated feel, as Banhart's deceptively intricate lines cross
    one another like dueling minstrels on the road to nowhere.  ""Todo Los Dolores"" even stops down as Banhart
    forgets the lyrics and has to begin again, much to the chagrin and amusement of a studio companion.  If
    nothing else, <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> celebrates the informal and comfortable.</p><p>
    
    Other songs seem weightier.  ""When the Sun Shone on Vetiver"" features Banhart accompanying his acoustic with
    angelic slide guitar, and a ghostly violin harmonizing his lead vocal.  The midtempo, folky drone underneath
    his pseudo-psychedelic melodic vocal phrasing contributes to an unearthly ambience.  ""Will Is My Friend""
    features plaintive piano and double bass accompaniment, and comes off as a midnight country-blues lament
    for ""Going Back to California"".  Closer ""Autumn's Child"" forgoes guitar almost entirely, featuring Banhart's
    quivering vocal over a soft, minor-chord piano dirge.  Lines like, ""She wanted to leave it, but she could
    not because it was her own child,"" sound melodramatic on the page, but over the course of song, seem almost
    offhandedly frank.</p><p>
<i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> establishes Banhart as a major voice in new folk music.  Not only does it
    improve on the promise of his earlier releases; it effortlessly removes the listener from the context of
    the recording.  That is, it doesn't seem like an album so much as a collection of road hymns and journals,
    and small tributes to smaller pleasures.  If some people miss the appeal of this stuff in an attempt to
    digest it as any other product, all the better knowing Banhart will probably keep on rejoicing until
    forever.</p></div>"|548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/548-rejoicing-in-the-hands/|8.4|Dominique Leone

<i>If it hurts you, be glad of it.</i></p><p>
    
    Though I was too young at the time to have read James Agee's famous introduction to his pastoral/political
    tale of the working South, <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, the simple statement quoted above never
    rang more true than in the memory of searching for my grandmother and grandfather beneath the bastard-floral
    haze of the stagnant tobacco field.  Unable to raise above the stalks and fearful of the potentially harmful
    life-forms that were to be found in the undergrowth, I made my way quickly through the slight paths created
    by the adults, weary of slaps on my shoulders and thighs from gruesome, sticky plant monsters, begging to
    be harvested before succumbing to either the heat or the insects.  It was with elation that I would finally
    find one or the other of my grandparents, who, upon seeing me would lift me out of the muck I wallowed in,
    hoist me over their shoulder, and make their way back to the house in preparation for that evening's
    celestial exercise-- the local broadcasting of Asheville, NC's radio program, <i>The Long Crescent Baptist
    Choir Hour</i>.</p><p>
    
    It's with such a background in the Gospel and Old-Time Religion of the Southern Tradition that I approached
    Dust-to-Digital's recent anthology of sacred songs and sermons, <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i>.  Watching Grandma
    Maxine transform twice weekly before my very eyes, from a curved-back and sturdy farmer's wife into a
    wailing and praising songstress, I understand all too well the power and majesty that the Protestant
    liturgical music can invoke in even the humblest of God's creatures.  To this end, the compilation--
    featuring both world-famous names (Mahalia Jackson, The Carter family, Hank Williams, Sr., Blind Lemon
    Jefferson and Blind Willie McTell) and obscure ones (North Carolina Cooper Boys, Sister O.M. Terrell, Bela
    Lam and Blind Mamie Forehand)-- sheds a blinding light on a tradition that up to this point had remained
    as publicly lackluster and benign as the practice of leaf-tying or cotton-tilling before it.</p><p>
<i>As near as you will ever get, you are inside the music;</i></p><p>
    
    Unlike other anthologies of so-called ""old-time"" music-- Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>
    readily comes to mind as a valid choice of comparison-- <i>Babylon</i> strikes a deified note of distinction
    based upon its unique organization and central theme.  Whereas other collections of folk and gospel music
    may call upon the spirit to simply shine down upon the globe, <i>Goodbye</i> dually keeps one eye at all
    times on the music and the other toward the sky, never once forgetting that there's both reason beyond
    reason and sight beyond sight.</p><p>
    
    Organized not by the Elements of the destitute race-- as is Harry Smith's previously mentioned collection--
    but into the multivariant portions of a typical sermon, the corpus of the collection lends itself to the
    more introspective and contemplative thoughts of the typical listener: An introduction encompassing all
    themes, an illustration of God's justice in the Johnson Family Singers' ""Deliverance Will Come"", the
    separation of the wheat from the tares in Rev. Sister Mary Nelson's New Testament-tinged glimpse of the
    Lord's Salvation, ""Judgment"", and a final plea to all those who still remain without true sight in the
    oddly ironic final disc, <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i>.  Add to this the unexpectedly non-preachy sixth disc of
    early 20th-Century gospel sermons-- with such imaginatively titled works as ""Black Diamond Express to Hell
    (Pt. I &amp; II)"" by the Rev. A.W. Nix and ""Death Might Be Your Santa Claus"" by the progenitor of the broadcast
    sermon, Rev. J.M. Gates-- and you have a masterpiece so intimately connected to the dogged human spirit that
    it's difficult to imagine a time when such a thread was not woven between Man and his God.</p><p>
<i>Not only inside it, you are it; your body is no longer your shape and substance, it is the shape and
    substance of the music.</i></p><p>
    
    More astounding than the sheer volume of songs collected within the <i>Babylon</i> box is the breadth of
    performers and performances that are covered and condensed into such a strongly supported theme.  Culled
    from the catalogue of such former record company giants as Victor, Okeh, Vocalion and more, the disc
    brazenly tramples outdated notions of segregated ""Race Music"" (mainly blues and gospel) and ""Old Familiar
    Tunes"" (country, white gospel, and bluegrass) that dominated the commerce of music production at the time.</p><p>
    
    So successful is the set in this amalgamation that it's often difficult to imagine a time when former-""Mole
    in the Ground"" performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford's ""Dry Bones"" could not be found a stone's throw distance
    from Skip James' ""Jesus Is a Mighty Good Leader"" or Jimpson's spiritual-like prison round of ""No More, My
    Lord"".  Further evidence of implied ethnic harmony can be heard in the gentle juxtaposition of the Golden
    Gate Jubilee Quartet's impressive and oft-covered ""Rock My Soul"" sliding over the back of an imagined
    glissando into the markedly less-pigmented ""There's a Light Lit Up in Galilee"" by Ernest V. Stoneman's
    Dixie Mountaineers.  A similar effect can also be heard between the laid-back ""Christ Arose"" by the
    Sheffield Quartet, and one of the true musical Rosetta Stones of the collection, the blues and gospel-inspired
    Thomas A. Dorsey achievement ""If You See My Saviour"", a piano-driven number that doesn't pave the road for
    the later R&amp;B; tinged classics of artists such as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Little Richard, but most
    assuredly clears a path.</p><p>
<i>Everything that is is holy.</i></p><p>
    
    A valid criticism of <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i> lies ultimately in its prodigious claim of comprehensive and
    empiric inclusion of all the music that may fall under such a description as ""sacred.""  To this claim, one
    might broach the subject of hypothesizing such foreign conceits as ""other religions"" to the stalwart and
    preoccupied Christian, or perhaps simply focus upon the idea that there is more to the American Christian
    mindset than what may be found south of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of the Mississippi.  Insofar as the
    anthology does collect moments of the inspired Southern liturgical oratory, though, Dust-To-Digital has
    the rather novel boon of a true masterwork of sacred music on its hands.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, to deny that this collection of doleful musings and backwood hollers is anything less than
    heavenly is to deny whatever higher being in which one may or may not believe.  Add to this the fact that
    the label has created one of possibly five beautiful and lasting works of the digital media as an artifact,
    and you have a justifiably immortal assortment of both the divine and human condition-- a call that might
    finally answer the lingering prompt, ""Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; shew forth from day to day His
    salvation"" (I Chronicles 16:23).</p></div>"|2039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2039-goodbye-babylon/|9.5|Andrew Bryant

    accessible persona.  For an artist like Murs, the underground rap landscape is slightly more difficult to
    traverse.  With a rhyme style that merges both early 90s West Coast tangents (his work invokes both Tupac
    and Souls of Mischief), Murs seems to get lost in the fold, especially while trying to find his musical
    identity with progressive rap imprint Definitive Jux.  But by taking up a harder edge and striking a deal
    with one of the hottest producers to come out of the underground in 9th Wonder, Murs may have finally found
    his formula to success with the unfortunately titled <i>Murs 3:16 - The 9th Edition</i>.</p><p>
    
    No longer rapping about failed kickflips or world domination, Murs has decided to take to a barebones clinic
    that could easily find as much favor with a Rocafella fan as with the typical Def Jukie.  The topical range
    screams accessibility in favor of experimentation, with cuts about street violence, the negatives of hip-hop
    culture (""That throwback jersey is a dress/ I remember diamonds used to be a girl's best friend"") and various
    romantic entanglements.  But the variety comes directly out of Murs' personality.</p><p>
    
    He's another emcee in the currently profitable ""everyman"" rapping profile, but with a weird sense of
    self-deprecating humor and a strange obligation to street credibility.  Here's the case of an emcee who
    claims on one song to be ""more Coldplay than I am Ice T"" in his treatment of ladies, while another song
    amounts to his take on Jay-Z's ""Girls, Girls, Girls"".  Murs himself says it best: ""I'm tryin' to walk that
    thin line between intelligence and ignorance/ Have a little fun while making music of significance.""  And
    as is the case with most contradictory emcees, it works admirably.</p><p>
    
    ""Walk Like a Man"" is the longest, most involved cut on the record, focusing on the played-out issue of gun
    drama.  The song works specifically due to the variety inherent in the song by 9th's decision on a different
    beat to match the different mood of each verse.  The first verse is Murs questioning his own need for a
    pistol over blaxploitation stomp (""I never did use it/ What's the point of holding heat if you're never
    gonna use it, stupid?""); the second verse is drifting angelic voices to frame the death of Murs' friend;
    the final verse is a barrage of church choir singers and a hydraulic bassline to work with the funeral and
    the murder of the killer, with the closing chorus looping to the issue of the first verse (""Now I'm haunted
    with remorse and I wish I hadn't done it"").  A song that stands out in its creation of classic gangster
    moral-telling.</p><p>
    
    9th Wonder has improved drastically from the days he shopped his Fruity Loops-produced beats on his
    Soundclick site, with a singular tone that shows more complexity than the work he did on Little Brother's
    debut and a maturing style that instantly harkens back to the glory days of DJ Premier.  ""Bad Man!"" is
    simultaneously a backdrop with a shockingly original take on the obligatory dub reggae beat and a
    call-and-response chorus that actually works, making it an major standout. ""The Pain"" is midtempo, chopped
    soul that tips its hat to the RZA, and ""H-U-S-T-L-E"" is composed of addictive, time-phased vocals shifted
    into a jagged funk.  9th Wonder not only shows promise here, but fixes up the one constant issue of Murs'
    career: inconsistent production.</p><p>
    
    It isn't all prosperous for Murs' strongest all-around album.  First off, it's too short in today's world of
    music, where <i>Illmatic</i> length is only acceptable if your album is <i>Illmatic</i>.  Secondly, his
    scenes of graphic sex (including sex with a raver who puts a ""glow stick in her pussy"") and violence sound
    forced in context with his older, less visceral music.  Still, Murs has found the positive side of what I
    call Aceyalone Syndrome.  This time, when the rapper started making music specifically for his friends, it
    turned out for the best.  In what could stand to be a strong year for independent hip-hop, Murs could easily
    sneak into a few lists with his <i>9th Edition</i>.</p></div>"|5514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5514-murs-316-the-9th-edition/|8.1|Rollie Pemberton

    Hooters, Bitter Bitter Weeks, Boston, mom and dad, <i>Mr. Show</i>, and all four of Philadelphia's major
    professional sports franchises (Phillies, Flyers, Sixers, Eagles) are but a tiny sample of the entities
    and people thanked in the expansive list contained in the booklet that comes with this album.  Whether
    or not the Phillies or Egon Schiele had much to do with bringing this album into this cruel, absurd world I guess is beside the
    point-- I think people whose primary mental focus in life is something around which a body of knowledge
    can be built, like, say, music or baseball, are just natural list makers, for whom a written list of stuff
    means just as much as a detailed essay.</p><p>
    
    In this case, Los Halos frontguy Samezvous seems to be laying out what he thinks made his life what it is,
    and then sticking it in his album insert whether it will make sense to anyone else or not.  And, of course,
    even though I don't really know where some of the references on the list came from, I still read the whole
    thing and got something out of it.  You can hear some of these things in the music, when you look for them.
    The Cure, for example, get a mention, and I don't have too much trouble hearing them in opener ""Lioness"",
    albeit with a sight less melodrama.</p><p>
    
    The album as a whole falls somewhere between the two previous Los Halos albums, the first of which was a
    noise-laden psychedelic wall of guitar and drum stomp, and the second a 170-degree turn into radiant
    electro-acoustic folk.  On <i>Leaving VA</i>, Samezvous and his attendant assemblage of collaborators
    shoot for a floating, evenly paced sound, amply widened with reverb and a consistent midtempo.  ""Lioness""
    really does sound like an especially mellow Cure track, with its nervously hovering rhythm and slowly
    shifting chords.  ""Lo Siento"" is the biggest pleaser in the bunch, stretching space-based guitar over a
    loose, eight-minute frame of basic organ, percussion and bass.  Samezvous' wispy tenor sounds relaxed
    delivering these confident melodies, with his best showcase coming on the mostly acoustic ""The Back Home"",
    a song that nicely changes from an almost country opening into a tambourine-driven British Invasion number,
    with a detour into vintage folk for good measure.</p><p>
<i>Leaving VA</i> closes with its title track, a methodical, measured ballad that doesn't shy from
    sentimentality, slowly unfurling a story about two young lovers who grow up and get married.  Set against
    the backdrop of world events, it seems lightweight, but it fits well enough with the slow jangle around
    it, rounding out the album on a positive, optimistic note.  Los Halos seem to have discovered the sound
    that works best for them on <i>Leaving VA</i>, a sound that taps the tension between softness and rough
    edges for its energy.  There are still a few bugs to be worked out (some quicker tempos might be nice,
    for one thing), but Los Halos have made a quietly ingratiating record here.</p></div>"|4863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4863-leaving-va/|7.3|Joe Tangari

<p>My wife and I are led down a long aisle away from the other passengers and asked to remove our shoes and     place them in molded plastic tubs so that they may be x-rayed with our coats and bags.  As I step through     the metal detector, it says nothing, but I'm still shepherded to an enclosed space where I'm told to spread     my arms as a security guard runs his wand over me.  Nothing again, but I'm used to this now-- it's been this     way for more than two years.  The guard places my shoes on a table and looks at them, then glances at my     aged <i>OK Computer</i> t-shirt and remarks, ""Hey, that's a pretty good band.""  He stares at the floor and     distantly mutters, ""Alright, you can go ahead and put your shoes back on now.""</p>

<p>For me in my white skin, traveling through airports was never difficult before September 11th, 2001.  Even     today, any delay I encounter is never more than an inconvenience, a standard set of instructions to follow     in the name of an abstract concept called ""national security.""  Others aren't always so lucky.  In April of     2001, Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was merely passing through New York's JFK International Airport, in     transit from a film festival in Hong Kong to another in Buenos Aires, when he was detained by the INS for     refusing to be fingerprinted, and kept in a crowded holding cell for ten hours.  He was ultimately returned     to Hong Kong in handcuffs, famously attempting to explain himself to his fellow passengers: ""I'm not a thief!     I'm not a murderer!  I am just an Iranian, a filmmaker.  But how could I tell this, in what language?""</p>
<p>Indian-American jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and underground hip-hop luminary Mike Ladd have seized upon this     incident for both the title and inspiration for this collaboration, a cycle of songs about lives in transit,     brown-skinned people from around the world living in unfamiliar places, passing through the world's airports     in search of work, home and asylum.  It's a world of businessmen, cab drivers, refugees, porn sellers and     detainees, each of whom Ladd brings to life with his vivid poetry and spiraling rhymes, several of which he     hands off to guest vocalists who inhabit their characters as needed.</p>
<p>Ladd himself veers back and forth from the wide-eyed poetic delivery that he perfected on <i>Welcome to the     Afterfuture</i>'s ""Feb. 4 '99 (For All Those Killed by Cops),"" and his usual, unpredictable flow on his six     lead vocal tracks, which he uses to lay out his thoughts on the topic at hand in broad terms.  His actors,     Allison Easter, Latasha N. Nevada Diggs and Ajay Naidu, are called upon to elaborate on these themes through     narrative and dialogue.  This kind of setup has plenty of potential for disaster, but Ladd keeps it all     together with his wit and expansive knowledge of the subject matter.</p>
<p>""Swipe the coded stripe and my name drops in ones and zeroes/ Somewhere a computer may know/ Ladd is to     Pratt as Cawthorne is to Willis is to Pickett and on/ What it won't show are the moments/ Of love or lust     that swirl through centuries/ And tan me here/ Making me one more memento/ Of a close-quartered world,"" he     reels on the opening, ""Color of My Circumference I"", setting up a journey that is by turns harrowing and     humorous.  Naidu takes a hilariously acerbic turn as a thick-accented NYC cab driver from Mumbai, blasting     through verses like, ""My cab as amusement/ My cab as escape/ My cab is my job/ No tip? Then fuck off/ New     York to Bombay/ BJP's Mumbai/ As Bloomberg is to play-pen is to/ I'm too tired/ 1010 WINS Radio/ 94.6/ WIN     India's number one station, all hits,"" with liquid fluency, something that must be tough when delivering     rhymes you didn't write.</p>
<p>Ladd hits everything hard, feeding lines like ""My language a threat as well as my limbs/ My skin a question/     My skin a critique"" to Easter on ""Asylum"", wherein she plays a refugee from Sierra Leone forced to hide under     beds from soldiers in sneakers and flip-flops through multiple countries only to be detained in her promised     land.  Naidu tears it up again on ""Rentals"" as he discusses his adult magazine stand: ""I am a porn walla/ I     mop Dahi for thirty dollars a day/ I can police shoplifts in four different languages/ Can they?/ They are     cops/ I'm a cop/ A laser eye close-cam brain/ A lust proctor/ And they search me/ Green carded/ Legal as 18,     baby.""</p>

<p>Indianapolis International Airport, November, 2001</p>
<p>The girl in front of me has syringes.  Nine of them, with needles at least an inch long.  She sets off the     metal detector, but the guard, an old white man who seems to be in charge, ignores this, leaves his wand on     the fold-out table and pores over the syringes in their case.  The girl tries to explain that they're for     her medicine, and that she needs to have them with her on the plane.  The second guard, a young black woman     perhaps 19 years old, waves me through the metal detector and I set it off.  She tells me to stand aside and     wait, but the man turns away from the syringes and yells at her: ""Don't tell him to stand over there.""  He     looks at me and says, ""You can go.""  The guy behind me in line, a light-skinned black man who's maybe about     30 in a tie and glasses, has now come through the detector.  It hasn't gone off.  The guard allows the syringe     girl to leave, and directs the man behind me to stand aside and spread his arms, picks up his wand and tells     me to go again.  I look at the female guard but she's too busy trying to explain that I should be getting     wanded to the male guard to notice my glance.  I pick up my bag and head into the terminal.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Without a compelling backdrop, Ladd's words would still be compelling, but they wouldn't be much to listen     to, and Iyer's arrangements range over a broad swath of improvisational and textural ground, flirting with     hip-hop, ambient drone and jazz noir.  Iyer's piano playing is expressionistic and cloudlike, more Edvard     Munch than traditional jazz.  He builds those clouds up to thunderheads on the four ""Color of My Circumference""     tracks, and creates a riverlike current for closer ""Plastic Bag"", with cellist Dana Leong floating amidst     the eddies and whitecaps.  ""Asylum"" is told over trumpets and piano clusters that hang like cobwebs, while     drummer Trevor Holder explodes in whip-crack breakbeats on ""TLC"".</p>
<p>One thing Iyer doesn't do is concern himself much with thematic development or melody, submitting his     compositions solely to the service of Ladd's subject matter.  This works surprisingly well, as there's     already a lot to take in without the top of the mix getting any busier.  The way Ladd constructs his rhymes     also hints at melody more than most, so it's not missed.</p>
<p>What might make <i>In What Language?</i> truly important, though, is that it's focused intently on probing     social issues in meaningful ways.  We've all spent time lately lamenting the fact that modern music is so     apolitical, and this is a good start for an antidote.  If it takes a poet and a jazz pianist to expose some     truth in an age where the American dream is being able to watch TV and play video games at the same time,     so be it.  We can only hope it inspires real discourse and real thought.</p></div>"|4152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4152-in-what-language/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    singer/songwriter and New Pornographers contributor Daniel Bejar, could be the soundtrack for a Sega
    Genesis game about kittens studying post-structuralism.  It is host to unapologetic MIDI instrumentation,
    glaringly theatrical vocals, and that ubiquitous but rarely implemented synth preset called ""aah voice.""
    Much more so than with any other Destroyer album, the aesthetic of <i>Your Blues</i> can be intensely
    jarring, and will likely annoy the fuck out of many, many people.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, it's the most initially vexing aspects of <i>Your Blues</i> that prove the most
    endearing, memorable, and surprisingly touching.  Like Bejar's 2002 release <i>This Night</i>, <i>Your
    Blues</i> constitutes a fundamental challenge to deeply ingrained conventions of sincerity and emotional
    honesty.  The record's conceptual brilliance lies largely in Bejar's ability to craft deeply moving
    passages out of ostensibly artificial and contrived elements, subtly suggesting that all music, if not
    all human expression, is in effect some sort of artifice.  Bejar's critical engagement with codified
    aesthetic techniques certainly renders <i>Your Blues</i> a less immediately ""accessible"" record, and can
    at first come off as kitschy or detached.  But the album's unique and defiant expression makes this the
    most holistically accomplished album Bejar has released to date.</p><p>
    
    Though it's a conceptually fascinating record, it would be unfair to write off <i>Your Blues</i> as a
    ""concept album,"" or to suggest that its atypical aesthetic renders it unlistenable.  Without a doubt,
    it's the songs here, not the conceptual meaning that could be read into them, that constitutes the core
    of the album's appeal.  In fact, Bejar's newfound ability to conjure a plastic orchestra allows many of
    these songs to achieve a textural and structural richness only hinted at on previous albums.  ""The Music
    Lovers"", previously released as a Sub Pop Singles Club seven-inch, benefits greatly from this treatment,
    as rising lines of synthesized strings grant the song a terse harmonic complexity absent from its more
    previous incarnation.  ""It's Gonna Take an Airplane"" is an exercise in pure melodic elegance, a sing-songy,
    cleverly composed construction of bright acoustic guitars, multitracked vocals, and warm, evocative
    synthesizers.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Bejar's songwriting takes on a more grandiose bent.  The album's opening track, ""Notorious
    Lightning"", finds Bejar sing-speaking his way through a string of vague-yet-striking images, slowly
    building to a rousing, anthemic finale.  Framed by fake tympani, strings, and snare drums, Bejar sings,
    ""And someone's got to fall before someone goes free,"" his voice carrying an unrestrained, fist-clenched
    passion never before present in a Destroyer song.  ""Notorious Lightning"", like many songs on <i>Your Blues</i>,
    has a markedly theatrical quality to it, its breathy vocal delivery and artificial orchestral arrangements
    landing somewhere between Stephin Merritt and Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Like Merritt, Bejar explores the emotional
    momentum that these theatrical forms can evoke, reinforcing this connection with a computerized simulacrum
    of bombastic arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Bejar is at the top of his game, his words reinforcing his musical play on artifice in lines
    like, ""Warm yourself by the fiery stage/ Fiery 'cause I lit it,"" and most notably, ""Always the play, never
    the thing.""  The song ""An Actor's Revenge"" borrows its title from a Japanese movie, but replaces the film's
    visceral and dramatic plot with a more general and pointed discussion of impersonation, sincerity, and
    frivolity.  On ""What Road"", Bejar hijacks a Smiths lyric, whispering, ""There is a light and it goes... out,""
    before an ascending swell of synth-strings ushers in a forceful coda, with Bejar hissing, ""Your backlash is
    right where I wanted you,"" a clever (whether or not intentional) address to his potentially befuddled
    audience.  Oftentimes, Bejar's delivery evokes <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>-era Current 93, only more fangy
    and melodic, and with substantially fewer lyrics about dragons.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, those hoping for a return to the more straightforward Destroyer of yore will initially be put
    off by <i>Your Blues</i>.  But it's hard to see Bejar's refusal to backtrack as a creative hindrance.  A
    full six albums into his career, Daniel Bejar is making a compelling case for self-doubt as a fine art--
    not content to rest on the fractured charm of <i>City of Daughters</i>, the formal, classicist brilliance
    of <i>Streethawk: A Seduction</i>, or the epic, perverted rock-isms of <i>This Night</i>, Bejar has made
    his bravest and most iconoclastic album to date.  Now, finally, the bandname begins to make sense.</p></div>"|2293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2293-your-blues/|8.6|Matt LeMay

You've wasted many a midnight hour, slow from cheap wine and a
    sleeping problem, glaring passively at the projections emitted from your laptop's media player.  Tonight
    it's <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>, and translucent splashes of blue and green seep into each
    other as though it's the music that's summoned those images and not some random computer processor.</p><p>
<i>Stand with the Stillness of This Day</i>, the dramatic debut from Montreal songwriter Elizabeth Anka
    Vajagic, is relentlessly black.  Its seven slow, tear-drowned laments paint a dark and unsettling otherworld
    that you want no part of; a derelict, rat-ridden distopia of neglect and madness which she draws with such
    vividness that, at times, it seems as though you're already there; strapped in the backseat whilst she
    gives you the guided tour.</p><p>
    
    Enlisting some of the most recognized hired-hands from the Montreal community, including Sam Shalabi,
    Godspeed's Efrim Menuck, and Silver Mt. Zion's Beckie Foon, the record works as a suite of paceless,
    funereal death-dirges built around sparsely strummed guitars, layers of cello and piano, and all the
    background dissonance and distortion you've begun to expect from a Constellation release.</p><p>
    
    When it works, it all sounds chillingly evocative.  On ""With Hopes Lost"", Foon's cello weaves around the
    space between each slow guitar chord, as Vagajic's voice bellows the bruised refrain, ""Let it go now,
    before your hopes get lost;"" Efrim Menuck echoes the sentiment on backing vocals, and inserts a sublime
    jazz-piano line.  Maybe it's just Menuck's inclusion in the line-up, but you can't help thinking that
    this baroque chamber-folk was the sound he was striving for on <i>This Is Our Punk Rock</i>.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, one of the advantages that <i>Stand with the Stillness</i> has over Silver Mt. Zion's last
    outing is that Vagajic can actually sing.  Her voice is a powerfully versatile instrument, capable of
    mewling a seductive moan similar to Lisa Germano, and then breaking into a lung-bursting bawl with
    impressive ease.  And when combined with Chris Burns' guttural, guitar-driven shrieking on ""Where You
    Wonder""-- a wailing cortege of Neanderthal drumming and music-box harmonium-- it hits the mark of
    fear and paranoia that this record's entirety seems to strive toward.</p><p>
    
    However, lyrically, the record is left wanting.  As side-splittingly sincere as caterwauled lines like
    ""How could such happiness end?"" may be, Vajagic is no Leonard Cohen; her words aim for the dull and direct
    rather than the vague, subtle and oblique.  Furthermore, there's little room on the record for variety of
    form or structure.  On the toiling, seven-minute-long ""Iceland"", you sense a certain degree of formula
    following; a guitar strums without charisma, propped-up by some characteristically sorrowful cello and
    standard piano flourishes, but because the structure echoes that of every other song on the album, it
    leaves the listener restless and with a diminishing attention span.</p><p>
    
    Still, this record possesses undeniable promise for Elizabeth Anka Vajagic.  Though it's too reliant on a
    dark and unwieldy texture to be truly affecting, and too stuck on repetition of form and ideas for it to
    be praised purely on musical terms, <i>Stand with the Stillness of This Day</i> is, at its best, a collection
    of ragged, haggard and howling post-folk songs that mix acoustic elements with chilling dissonance to
    conjure a dystopic nightmare that might be closer to the real world than we'd care to admit. She may have
    spent too long staring into the darkness, but she's making a beautiful shade of black.</p></div>"|8526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8526-stand-with-the-stillness-of-this-day/|7.0|Neil Robertson

    the first kids onboard the laptop mashup barge when it first lumbered off in the late 90s.  Trading in chart
    music, gabba, booty, jungle, dancehall, noise, bling, bleep, Europop-- basically anything with a certain pop
    cultural quotient-- Pollard's music has always hinged on the act of smirky reappropriation.  His breakthrough
    track, ""Dancemix2000"", released on London's Irritant Records, was an obnoxious but faintly loveable curio
    that predicted the Boom Selector and Violent Turd bonanza by sellotaping Eminem, Destiny's Child, Pink, and
    The Vengaboys to a pulsehammering hardcore beat.</p><p>
    
    Although he's already released two other full-length records, Pollard's best known for his string of
    irony-drizzled sevens and twelves, which have come mainly via Irritant and kid606's Tigerbeat6 imprint.
    <i>Rockstopper</i>, his first long player for the latter, is comprised of equal parts newer studio material
    and rehashed vinyl classics, all of which are offered here in remixed forms.  As a complete listening
    experience, the hour-long effort is a bit of a hard slog, if not only because half of its tracks were
    originally designed to exist on their own terms, as the singular and immovable exclamation points that all
    good seven inches are.  Placed side by side by side by side, and without the benefit of a seamless mix to
    smooth out the breaks, they tend to run into a jagged, pummeling blur.</p><p>
    
    Since the novelty of Knifehandchop's catalogue can quickly wear you down in this abundant context, it's
    better to pluck out individual tracks and listen to them sparingly, as sides.  ""Not for Tha Ladies"" pistol
    whips Beenie Man and Redman's ""Love Me Now"" with a fistful of electro and jungle breaks, ""2 Sexxxxy Booty""
    lifts a booty lyric (""Bump and then pump that ass, ho/ Pump it fast now pump it slow/ Work that thing like
    a fulltime job/ Same way you slobbed on his knob"") and loops it over a manic electro break, and the Mecha
    Knifehandchop remix of ""Bounty Killer Killer"" runs the dancehall MC through a gabber/noise funhouse of
    thumps, bumps and static.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the chill-out remix of one of Pollard's best-known (and most boneheaded) moments, ""Hooked
    on Ebonics"".  With its strung pastiche of MTV hip-hop buzzwords and Ja Rule samples (all delivered derisively,
    like a punchline) fighting against a searing electro line, ""Hooked On"" is Knifehandchop's entire aesthetic
    rolled up into a single track: a tiresomely self-aware exercise made great in the moment thanks to its
    inspired programming.  That's a routine worth enduring in short bursts, for five minutes, maybe ten, but
    submit for any longer and the whole thing goes sour, the great moments crumble, and you're left wondering
    why you ever needed a full hour in the first place.  Significantly less than the sum of its parts, but
    entertaining nonetheless.</p></div>"|4497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4497-rockstopper/|6.1|Mark Pytlik

    Libertines swarming the calcareous canyons of the commercial-industrial complex, but shift to just 15
    minutes outside any major metropolis, in the surrounding slums or white collar suburbs, and their
    swashbuckling riffage doesn't quite pack the same punch.  Out in heartland Iowa, or the New Mexico desert,
    forget it; irrespective of its misleading brand name, garage-rock embodies the spirit of the city, and no
    place else.</p><p>
    
    This, of course, hasn't prevented songwriters from all over the world from trying to capture the globe
    with their scuzzy aesthetic.  Hailing from the tiny northern Norwegian village of Stokmarknes, 160 miles
    north of Arctic Circle, Madrugada's swagger is as cocksure as any of their municipal counterparts.  Their
    incubated surroundings allowed them to develop freely, untainted by critical pressure, but the band has
    since uprooted its humble origins, playing music that's decidedly metropole-minded.</p><p>
    
    When Madrugada finally
    emerged from their frozen matrix to release 1999's <i>New Depression</i> EP, they were greeted with
    open arms by both the public and the press: The somber, Cohen-afflicted ""Riverbed"" shot to #2 on the
    Norwegian charts, and the band was summarily snatched up by Virgin Records.  <i>Grit</i> was originally
    released in 2002-- placing it a hair behind the fore of the revivalist rock movement-- and is now seeing
    reissue in the U.K.  But Madrugada were writing music together while The Strokes were still in private
    school, and belong to a tight but prolific Scandanavian rock scene that has produced a handful of significant
    acts in recent years.</p><p>
    
    The 11 songs here move at a furious pace, awash in treble and bombastic drums, rarely stopping to reconnoiter.
    Naturally, there are references to people crossing the proverbial ""line,"" and a few songs come dangerously
    close to doing so themselves by spilling into monotony.  Madrugada's sound is tight-clenched and frenetic,
    if ultimately unspectacular, and when the band runs out of killer riffs, and begins to sound overtly and
    incoherently derivative, the album falters.  ""Ready"" is a clumsy MC5 takeoff that would better suit a more
    simple-minded band like The Mooney Suzuki, while other tracks are content to rehash The Stooges.</p><p>
    
    With numbers like these, it seems like Madrugada are trying to subvert the Norwegian stereotypes of eternal
    darkness and habitual suicide.  By now, it's legend: When Dead, lead vocalist from Norway's premier death
    metal group, Mayhem, killed himself with a gunshot to the head in 1991, the band's guitarist Euronymous
    allegedly cooked and ate pieces of his brain.  Euronymous was later stabbed to death by bassist Count
    Grishnackh, who was reportedly jealous of Euronymous's evil reputation.  Top that, Cannibal Corpse.</p><p>
    
    That said, this is potentially the most happy and exuberant record you will ever hear from a group of
    Norwegian musicians.  <i>Grit</i> is uplifting even for Madrugada, whose 2001 LP, <i>The Nightly Disease</i>,
    echoed with the loneliness and despair that is protocol for Norwegian art of any stripe. ""Seven Seconds"" is
    a rocksteady blues-tinged romp that wastes all Scandinavian conventions, as Madrugada take a cue from their
    neighboring Swedish rivals, The Hives.  On ""Blood Shot Adult Commitment"", vocalist Sivert Hoyem displays
    his ample talent, curling his lips as he spits searing emotional indictments with a honed elegance.  The
    wistful ""Majesty"", one of <i>Grit</i>'s weightiest moments (along with the wrenching ""Hands Up -- I Love
    You), is particularly affecting, as Hoyem delivers a breathtaking performance reminiscent of Smog's most
    harrowing tracks.</p><p>
    
    While Madrugada manage to evade sobriety in their sound, Hoyem's lyrics can't seem to avoid digging at a
    ponderous philosophical underpinning.  The band are one of the more literate in rock: The title for <i>Grit</i>
    was lifted from a passage in a Henry Miller novel, in which workers at a shipyard collected thick black
    soot on their hands that stayed with them until they died, and then resisted even the embalmer's harshest
    chemicals.  The name Madrugada, Spanish for the hour before sunrise, was bestowed upon the band by a writer
    friend.  Wading in flanged drones evocative of The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Hoyem's verses offer telling
    metaphysical nuggets that help flesh out this straightforward but sophisticated album.</p><p>
    
    One could easily define Madrugada's music in terms of a specific locale, but to do so would be reductive
    and unfair.  With <i>Grit</i>, the band have produced a record that is palpable and full of nuance.  This
    is music that's too intelligent and idiosyncratic to surrender pat answers, and, like the best rock music,
    it offers accessible routes to its hidden treasures.</p></div>"|5572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5572-grit/|7.3|Sam Ubl

You just have to politely smile, pay for the dope, and explain that playing no music while     living in total degradation is not avant-garde.  The term ""avant-garde"" itself has slaughtered millions in     its lifetime.  It means absolutely nothing, and any review that uses it ought to be immediately ignored.     Whether you're talking about Frank Zappa or the AACM, allegedly avant-garde music has always pretended to     challenge hegemony, structure and foundation.  And it's rarely succeeded because true liberation probably     doesn't mean dressing like Bleep the Silver Robot or constructing labyrinthine geometrical diagrams to     prove your music is as improvisational as you claim it is.</p>
<p>I feel bad saying it, but Ornette Coleman is among the handful of true avant-garde artists.  He invented the     goddamn garde using only an alto sax while everyone else was still in diapers toying around with modality.     Though he was deemed a dangerous heretic throughout his career, he never expressly assailed tonality or     tradition as some sort of macho athlete or vigilant revolutionary (despite his frequently apocalyptic album     titles).  He played as he felt.  If his music required wading into harmonic or rhythmic conventions, so be     it.  Art should be about the subtleties and fluctuations of life, not formal constraints or attempts to     repeal them.  In proving his point, he released six of the greatest jazz albums of all time, starting with     1959's <i>Twins</i> and ending with 1961's <i>Ornette on Tenor</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ornette!</i>, the penultimate album of Coleman's Atlantic era, came after 1960's <i>Free Jazz</i>, which     had been the biggest leap in improvisation music since (at least) <i>Kind of Blue</i> and basically     restructured the rest of modern music for the next several decades.  A tough act to follow.  Nevertheless,     the attempt is certainly valiant: this permutation of the Quartet retains half of the performers from     <i>Free Jazz</i>, with Don Cherry on trumpet, Scott LaFaro on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums.</p>
<p>Split into four cuts, <i>Ornette!</i> doesn't begin as much as it thrusts you in mid-spiral.  Coleman's     reeling, rasping abrasion is already plaiting Cherry's whinnying lunges and half-drunk two-steps.  Blackwell     breaks down into simmering cymbals which become progressively more militant, seeming just a few steps removed     from kneading funk.  LeFaro's bass is anticipatory and ethereal at some points, eerie and alluring at others.     His bass might as well be made of clay since every time he touches it, the tones harden and remain imprinted     for the rest of the 16\xBD-minute song.  By the end, these echoes and traces form elaborate riffs that sprawl     below Coleman and Cherry's upper registers.</p>
<p>Although it was recorded only months before LeFaro's untimely death, ""C&amp;D;"" features a bowed bass that's     equally adept at frantic gypsy dervishes as it is at slumping, slinking subtlety.  And even though this is     supposed to be almost entirely improvisational music, ""W.R.U.""'s climax is deployed with such vigor that     it's hard to believe Coleman wasn't bending the rules a bit: His alto grows increasingly violent and agitated,     and then his breathing is restored, paced, elongated, and laced with some sort of orgasmic or epiphanic     overtones.</p>
<p>Blackwell is typically a bit of an unreliable drummer, but at least on his solo, ""T&amp;T;"", he delivers a     meditative, dexterous African rhythm.  Coleman and Cherry dangle around a cracked, low tone, smoothly     segueing from taut frowns to gaping smiles.  Though Blackwell is the most traditional of the four participants,     he musters enough intentional awkwardness to leave drawling gaps and drowsy brushes all over the session     outtake, ""Proof Readers"".</p>
<p>Throughout, Coleman is seductive and charming, sometimes venturing into brief moments that could pass as     showtunes.  Fortunately, there's always enough skronks to stave off monotony or mawkishness.  Tones are     preserved, whether fragile or booming, before being called off at the brink of shrillness.  It's another     impressive, comfortable record by someone who knows that racket extraordinarily well.  It may not quite     match the audacity and shock value of <i>Free Jazz</i>, but when you've just razed the scaffolds of     structured music, it's probably as good as you're going to get.</p></div>"|1545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1545-ornette/|8.8|Alex Linhardt

    prosaic cultural mythology: The South would bleed into one colossal tobacco field where shape-note karaoke
    is scheduled for alternate Thursday nights and cornbread graces every pewter plate; the Midwest would
    flatten into snug, aluminum-sided subdivisions, with brown-haired families cuddling calmly into church
    pews and exchanging benign pleasantries; the Northeast would rise into a massive, ivy-wrapped liberal
    arts college, with everyone sporting purple fleece vests and distractedly steering Labrador-dribbled
    Volvo wagons; and the West Coast would become a continuous California, the sun perpetually beating down,
    ocean breezes gently kicking up grains of pink sand, its bands all sounding exactly like the Beach Boys.</p><p>
    
    It's not unusual for iconic bands to lay claim to slabs of otherwise communal land (see Liverpool, Memphis,
    etc.), and the Beach Boys have long seized control of the Pacific shore, perpetuating unbreakable notions
    of harmony, jangle, and perfectly sugared sun-melodies.  Californian upstarts Dios not only play psychedelic
    beach-pop, they're also natives of the Beach Boys' hometown of Hawthorne-- a collision of coincidence that
    would have rendered them annoyingly Californian were they not so independently great.  Fusing squeaky
    electronics with acoustic guitars and soft, breathy vocals, Dios are dry and spacy, as indebted to Neil
    Young as they are to Brian Wilson.  Constantly shifting focus-- from earnest folk-singing to found-sound
    experimenting to deliquescent indie psych-pop-- Dios are also stubbornly contemporary, a quirky, whimsical
    bit of California past, present and future.</p><p>
    
    Brothers Joel and Kevin Morales sing and play guitar, and their harmonies are expectedly copasetic,
    complimentary in the way that only siblings' voices ever are.  Backed by keyboardist Jimmy Cabez DeVaca,
    bassist J.P. Caballero, and drummer Jackie Monzon, Dios occasionally sound like the only proper soundtrack
    to your local schoolyard: playful, energetic, and sorta bizarre, with more than enough ups-and-downs to
    power every last see-saw.  Opener ""Nobody's Perfect"" eases from aimless synth zaps into a sweet acoustic
    melody, periodically punctuated by a handful of piano notes and perfectly carried by Morales' able coo;
    like contemporaries Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio, Dios playfully fiddle with listener-expectation,
    flip-flopping between nicely comprehensible pop and fuzzed-out bursts of psychedelic weirdness.  ""All Is
    Said and Done"" has a brassy AM-radio glow, with a chorus of la-la-la-la breaking up already soft, hazy
    vocals; the jingling ""You'll Get Yours"" is a yawning bit of psych-rock, complete with totally random
    handclaps.</p><p>
    
    Dios openly admit to an irrational interest in the Beach Boys, reportedly insisting that their international
    paperwork be inked in the same diner where the Wilsons signed their contracts, and even launching into an
    exaggerated homage to <i>Pet Sounds</i>' ""You Still Believe in Me"" towards the end of ""50 Cents"".
    Harmony-heavy tracks like ""The Uncertainty"" point towards their hometown heroes as well, but Dios are far
    from another mediocre Beach Boys cover band: Without ever attempting to reinvent California, Dios manage
    to make its pop a little less predictable.</p></div>"|2544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2544-dios/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

    peering through the windows of empty thrift stores and boarded-up bookshops.  On the route home, you
    wander through the weekend rush-hour with a disc full of sad songs on your CD-R.  You watch the grizzled
    faces of passers-by, groaning and wincing into their wallets; the sportswear-clad kids making fake male
    poses to each single girl they see; the dispossessed park-benchers, clutching cheap supermarket booze and
    silently screaming out, ""Fuck the world.""</p><p>
    
    There's something comforting about surveying such sights with just a solitary voice reverberating through
    your headphones, siphoning out the sounds of a thousand strangers' voices and focusing upon one woman's
    restless muse.  It's like hearing a voice that's been lost in the crowd, taken and amplified to drown out
    all that lies in its periphery until on its own, it sounds lonely, strange and fearlessly beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Laura Veirs' first album, <i>Troubled by the Fire</i>, was a beguiling infant of a record; a slow hug of
    furnace-warmth and lilting grace that reveled in romance and lovestruck simplicity, striding down a similar,
    country-flecked path to songwriters such as Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams.  However, on this follow-up,
    Veirs treads a vastly different path, producing an album of opaque, wintered laments that evoke the cold,
    jagged landscape of the Colorado Rockies that formed this Seattle-based songwriter's childhood.</p><p>
    
    The mood is evoked with arresting results.  Playing with the same kind of geeky, grad-school persona as Liz
    Phair on <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, yet with a hauntedness similar to Chan Marshall or Kristin Hersh, songs
    such as the beat-less outsider blues of ""Chimney Sweeping Man"" stalk with controlled, simmering psychosis
    (""Maybe you thought I'd be president with my Cheshire grin.../ Well, I'm a lowland forest resident"").  With
    its cross-stitched guitar-line, sprinklings of synthetic ambience and lyrics snatched from stream-of-consciousness
    journal entries, the opening ""Ether Sings"" is starkly beautiful.  Much of this is due to the credible
    production work of sometime Modest Mouse/Howe Gelb collaborator Tucker Martine; whose bare and simplistic
    arrangements still bear enough edge and interest so as not to dull the listener into passivity.  As Veirs'
    voice reaches its angel-sweet peak on the chorus to ""Rapture"", a strange, descending vibraphone emerges,
    conjuring an air of stargazed self-discovery.</p><p>
    
    Veirs' songwriting and Martine's intuitive production reach their combined peak on the wonderfully distant
    ""Salvage a Smile""-- ironically the album's shortest track.  Above a flurry of urgently-plucked, overdriven
    guitar and Veirs' despondent poetry, experimental stringsman Eyvind Kang creates a wonderful cacophony of
    human despair and strained dissonance.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, where the album surpasses its predecessor in terms of songcraft and musicality, it lacks the
    same hand-held warmth.  This is not simply due to the dour, disaffected subject matter; on ""Icebound Stream"",
    Veirs sounds so detached and impenetrable that the listener is left without any empathy for the song or its
    orator.  Furthermore, as anyone who's ever tried to write in a free-flowing, stream-of-consciousness style
    knows, 90% of what comes out is hideous self-indulgence.  While much of <i>Carbon Glacier</i> avoids this
    charge due to strong editing, one can't help but think how Veirs can possibly sing ""Rapture"", with its line,
    ""Doesn't the tree write great poetry?"", and not want to tie her own face in knots.</p><p>
    
    These flaws come as the result of an ambition that has not yet been fully realized, but cannot detract
    from the fact that <i>Carbon Glacier</i> is a cold, beautiful and engaging record that translates the bleak,
    isolated vastness of nature into the bleak, isolated vastness of the modern city-sprawl, leaving one voice
    to sing in solitude.  If only more records sounded this alone.</p></div>"|8524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8524-carbon-glacier/|7.7|Neil Robertson

    clones, sang in his nostalgic, sardonic paean to his Grandparents' romance, ""Bruxelles"":</p><p>
<i>C`était au temps oú Bruxelles r\xEAvait<br/>
    C`était au temps du cinéma muet<br/>
    C`était au temps oú Bruxelles chantait<br/>
    C`était au temps oú Bruxelles bruxellait</i></p><p>

<i>It was the time when Brussels dreamed<br/>
    It was the time of silent film<br/>
    It was the time when Brussels sang<br/>
    It was the time when Brussels... bruxellait.</i></p><p>
    Bruxellait.  A word that Babelfish and online translation engines fail to process.  Brel, unable to better
    describe his hometown, simply uttered, ""When Brussels was Brussels, when Brussels... brusseled.""  Camden
    hipsters may be more familiar with Belgo, the Chalk Farm eatery where servers in monks' habits serve mussels,
    frites, and trappist ale in a cold, aluminum, industrial loft, than the Belgian stepsister of Factory Records,
    Factory Benelux, and its Brussels-based sister label Les Disques du Crepuscule.  Though the label served as
    a continental dumping ground for the tour-support one-offs of major players-- like A Certain Ratio's inaugural
    ""Shack Up"" seven-inch, and later, New Order's ""Touched by the Hand of God"" and ""Everything's Gone Green""
    singles-- it cultivated its own indigenous roster with groups like The Names, Minny Pops, and the massively
    overlooked Antena.</p><p>
    The Names waded in slowed Peter Hook bassline facsimiles and faux-Morrissey moaning on their <i>Swimming</i>
    LP.  Minny Pops ventured into colder electro-Teutonic territory.  Antena, however, macheted into theretofore
    (and heretofore) unexplored territory for post-punk-- namely the oddball psychedelic scene of South America.
    Recorded with echoing minimalism, Antena's major release, <i>Camino del Sol</i>, evokes dreaming, singing,
    charmingly off-the-mark sci-fi futurism, and the black-and-white nostalgia of Brel's Brussels.  It's as
    beautifully outdated, yet strikingly mind-boggling and timeless, as the towering Atomium over the Expo '58
    grounds.</p><p>
    The newly formed vinyl junkie reissue label, Numero, sniffed this truffle, and has released it between more
    traditional reissues of a rare soul compilation and a power-pop box set.  <i>Camino del Sol</i> was
    originally a five-song twelve-inch from 1980, but was later expanded to a full-length by Crepuscule in
    1982 with added singles.  This reissue further expands the release with the ""Seaside Weekend"" single, two
    unreleased tracks (""Frantz"" and ""Ingenuous""), and new artwork.  With any justice, it will bring new light
    to a lost gem, as similar reissues did for Os Mutantes, whose adolescent dementia influences this record's
    tropicalia songs (""The Boy from Ipanema"", ""Sissexa""), and Shuggie Otis, whose piquantly primitive drum
    machines propel each track.  So much hidden influence lies in these songs.  The wonderful opening punch of
    ""To Climb the Cliff"" and the title track predate Stereolab's Gainsbourg-gone-Kraftwerk by over a decade,
    and Air's cool, Parisian sex by nearly two.  Tortoise directly lifted the syncopated synthetic funk of
    ""To Climb the Cliff"" on their equally rare seven-inch, ""Madison Ave/Madison Area"".</p><p>
    Stuttering kick drums, icicle synths, and robotic bass jerks the listener through ""Spiral Staircase"" with
    better effect than a handful of contemporary NY revivalists.  Limited to the use of the above ingredients
    and the occasional dry electric guitar, Antena relied on vast amounts of space for haunting texture.  Each
    member sounds isolated in far corners of an airport hangar, allowing coke-bottle percussion, sound effects,
    and Isabelle Antena's detached, seductive voice to float.  The more propulsive tracks are offset by opiated
    cocktail numbers like ""Silly Things"", ""Bye Bye Papaye"", and ""Noelle A Hawaii"".  Yet, the faint echo of
    Antena's label cousins Joy Division keeps things perversely intoxicating.  Only on ""Les Demoiselles de
    Rochefort"", a cover of Michel Legrand's theme to the Catherine Deneuve film, do Antena sound positively
    retro-minded.  Even then, the strings and horns seemingly waft from a wormhole.</p><p>
    The band fell apart soon after this release, and carried on into goofy plastic jazz before Isabella turned
    it all into a solo vehicle.  These days, Isabelle Antena still rides the stereotypical ""Big in Japan"" wave,
    touring the country and releasing smooth adult albums in some cruel approximation of <i>Lost in Translation</i>'s
    Sausalito.  Yet she'll always have this document of inspired originality in her past, which, with this
    reissue, could very well make her a rediscovered figure.  As this album proves, she was much more akin to
    Beck and Björk than her dour trend-following contemporaries.  So unique perhaps only Jacques Brel found
    the verb for it.</p></div>"|426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/426-camino-del-sol/|9.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

In the late-90s, they struck me as a band that might actually deliver some
    of the gooey-sweet dream music I'd imagined upon reading their hyperbole-ridden reviews and press releases.
    They seemed young, exotic and bulletproof, as if through karma and luck, they'd finally figured out how to
    lull us into states of sentimental hypnosis, while at the same time keeping their sleek, metallic veneer
    intact.  Clearly, I'd mistaken them for some kind of meta-compassionate sports car.</p><p>
    In 2004, the band has graduated to soundtracks, a fate so fitting it's anti-climactic.  Chris Ott exposed
    Sigur Rós' modest flaw in his review of 2002's <i>( )</i>: The twelve blank pages of its CD insert said
    more than enough about the band's second shot at cinematic grandeur, and despite their command of
    studio-generated atmosphere, they only fleetingly managed to hit upon the supernatural.</p><p>
<i>Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do</i>, featuring music Sigur Rós were commissioned to write for the Merce Cunningham
    Dance Foundation, is not hard to like.  The EP contains three pieces joined at the seams to form a single
    compact structure of ambience and incidental ping.  Like many new electronic mood music artists, Sigur Rós
    use the music box, presumably to imply delicacy.  In any case, ""Ba Ba"" seems delicate to me.  It fades in
    on just a few plucked tones, eventually revealing a synthesizer pattern reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's
    ""Tubular Bells"".  This is the music of crystals forming, or the moment water changes from liquid to ice:
    There are no sudden movements, just a mass gravitation towards an end nearly identical to its beginning,
    except that time dictates that we're in a different location than where we started.  The band uses this
    phenomenon as both harmonic center and rhythmic loop; it's a clever way of making music.  My only complaint
    is that Sigur Rós don't pull it off as well as some of their peers (cf. Mileece, Lullatone, even Björk).</p><p>
    As ""Ba Ba"" ends with smattering of pseudo-infant vocalizations, ""Ti Ki"" ushers in a recap of the opening
    music box tones.  This piece puts the natural ambience of the instrument to better use than the opening
    track, allowing it to play alone for a couple of minutes before attacking it with software.  Along the way,
    faint crackling sounds sneak in and out, and when the music box is cut up and spit back in reverse, the
    crackling is more dominantly featured.  Unfortunately, Sigur Rós' deconstruction of this sound isn't
    far from its original form, and ultimately, the EP suffers from its monolithic landscape.  ""Di Do"" admirably
    shakes the flow with a wavering, stereo-panned vocal drone, and stuttering, single-syllable accents (""Ba ba/
    Ti ki/ Di do"") that remind me of similar vocal splicing done by Asa-Chang &amp; Junray.  It ends with a shriek
    of feedback, and just as I perk up to see what all the commotion is about, the disc is over.</p><p>
    Still, I find reasons to come back.  The tightly wound constructions and gradual, unhurried development
    appeal to the music theorist in me, and the sounds of music box, mutated human voice and analog synth
    appeal to the closet twee-tronica nerd in me.  But I know this is temporary, and that it's only a matter
    of time before it makes its way onto the shelf, where it will be continually glossed over when I'm looking
    for something nice to put on.  Sigur Rós indeed have found a method of enticing listeners to step inside
    their world, but have yet to master staying power.</p></div>"|7153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7153-ba-ba-ti-ki-di-do-ep/|5.5|Dominique Leone

Excessive genre-hopping
    or wearing stylistic flexibility as a badge is often considered honorable or even proof of an artist's
    restless, boundless talent.  Yet when this approach is put under a microscope, the choice to aim for a
    variety of different sounds often seems like a mask for artists unable to do any one thing particularly
    well.</p><p>
    A lot of the initial praise garnered by Scissor Sisters stemmed from their oscillation between what many
    consider to be disparate styles: To be reductive, those are rollicking early 70s Elton John-esque pop songs
    and buoyant disco.  However, on their self-titled debut, Scissor Sisters not only do quite a few genres
    justice-- not least of which is witty, irreverent pop songs-- but both their idiosyncratic approach to
    music and their sensibilities seem to have common roots in glam-era rock or Philly soul.</p><p>
    On the face of it, that's an odd blend.  Unless you're Ryan Adams, Homer Simpson, or those bearded fellows
    in Kings of Leon, you aren't likely of the mindset that rock achieved perfection in 1974.  But the Sisters
    embrace the playfulness and panache of that era's artists-- from Sparks and Elton, to 10cc and Mott the
    Hoople, to The Spinners and, um, Pink Floyd-- and come out smelling like roses.  Here, the Sisters skip
    smartly through glam's linear history, and stray far enough from the beaten path to discover a sound of
    their own, all while resisting the sacrifice of context for pantomime.</p><p>
    With one part arched eyebrows and droll wit, and one part melancholia and sharp social observation, the
    Sisters' debut is bursting with golden moments.  To the disappointment of some, large portions of the
    Scissor Sisters' highly circulated and heavily dancefloor-leaning demo has been either re-recorded or
    exorcised from the final cut, but the retail version outstrips the demo by a mile.  ""Doctor (I'm Only
    Seeing Dark)"", ""Backwoods"", and ""Bicycling with the Devil"" in particular are missed, but with their
    inclusion, the finished product would likely have been a far more schizophrenic affair.</p><p>
    Instead, the Sisters' debut hangs together well, despite sounding at times more like a career-spanning
    singles compilation than a cohesive work. (Although, in this MP3 era, where's the harm in that?)  Debut
    single ""Laura"", with its overflow of rollicking piano and wah-wah guitar, is the hyper-jovial opener.
    Break-up song ""Better Luck"" and the falsetto-drenched disco cover of ""Comfortably Numb"" (what might have
    been had Pink Floyd followed their classic rock contemporaries into late 70s disco tourism) are the
    dancing-with-tears-in-your-eyes tracks.  ""Tits on the Radio"" is New York's best protest dance song since
    !!!, and ""Lovers in the Backseat"" is a gold lamé-draped take on voyeurism.  ""Mary"" and ""It Can't Come
    Quickly Enough"", meanwhile, are the 4 a.m. ballads, contenders for the night's penultimate spin before
    ""Last Dance"" soundtracks the queue at the coat check.</p><p>
    Best of all are ""Take Your Mama"" and ""Return to Oz"".  The former is a clever Primal Scream-meets-""Freedom
    '90"" suggestion to come out to your mother during a night on the town.  The latter is a weary, hungover
    ballad lamenting the influence of crystal meth on the gay nightclub scene (""What once was Emerald City's/
    Now a crystal town"").  In combination, those two tracks delightfully reveal that under Scissor Sisters'
    sheen of fabulousness and irresistible hooks beats a heart that breaks as easily as it bursts, and that's
    a sort of versatility that can't be easily concocted.</p></div>"|7740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7740-scissor-sisters/|8.3|Scott Plagenhoef

The theatrical arts are all about poses.  Office politics in
    America practically mandate that employees wear a glossy veneer to hide their true, often contemptuous
    feelings for each other.  Heck, even us Pitchfork writers aren't entirely genuine: We don't actually like
    reviewing music; most of us are just in it for the sex.</p><p>
    For musicians with star ambitions, a well-practiced public facade is an evil necessity; it's what divides
    mainstream from underground.  The shortest (if not only) route to pop stardom is to lube-up and fake your
    way through the capricious and unapologetic record industry gauntlet.  Play your public relations cards
    right, and you may one day earn an outside shot at winning a contract with a major label subdivision.  From
    there, you're at the mercy of American teenagers.</p><p>
    And yet, there are those who proudly wear the makeup but manage to smuggle some illegal substance underneath.
    Björk, Beck, and the Smashing Pumpkins all had at least one great album to their credit in the last decade
    that were nothing if not MTV-ready.  CocoRosie, a Parisian vocal duo comprised of sisters Sierra and Bianca
    Cassidy, may one day be such a group.  Judging by their promotional 8x10s, in which the sisters purse for
    the camera doused in copious amounts of Cabaret-style rouge and mascara, they've already got the makeup
    part down pat.</p><p>
    Brace yourself for a high school French reprise: CocoRosie have a verifiable case of Francophilia.  <i>La
    Maison de Mon Reve</i> translates literally to ""the house of my dream,"" and the title is just the beginning:
    The album was recorded in Paris in the springtime, and beams with all the lazy romanticism of an unemployed
    Upper East-Sider on expat life-delay.  But never mind the superficial reasons for disliking the Cassidy
    sisters; not just any bored globetrotters could pull something this elegant and sonically intriguing out
    of their trust-funded asses.</p><p>
    Musically speaking, <i>La Maison de Mon Reve</i> is an ingratiating album that suffers only from its
    sometimes overbearing affectation.  The familial duo have garnered vast acclaim for their effortless
    melding of blues and hip-hop, a putatively groundbreaking bridge that CocoRosie are far from the first
    to cross.  Relatively speaking, blues and hip-hop share a lot in common; crooning fragile melodies over
    boombox beats isn't going to cure cancer, now or ever.  In fact, what CocoRosie have done with original
    source material on <i>La Maison de Mon Reve</i> is essentially what Danger Mouse attempted to do with
    existing music on his lauded <i>The Grey Album</i>: They've overdubbed two styles of music, generationally
    removed but deceptively similar, and the result is closer to the mean of its parts than the sum.</p><p>
    That doesn't stop the Cassidy sisters from crooning unabashedly within the cozy walls of this cold-water
    flat.  On paper, some of the lyrics are doggone cringe-worthy, but lines like, ""I fell in love with you/
    Just because the sky turned from grey to blue,"" and, ""All I want with my life/ Is to be a housewife,"" are
    delivered passionately enough to slide by unnoticed.  The particularly guileless ""By Your Side"" and
    ""Butterscotch"" are even more impressive for their ability to transcend their shortcomings.</p><p>
    Like any truly cosmopolitan city, <i>La Maison de Mon Reve</i> draws from a rich past of diffuse influences
    while simultaneously seeking to make use of modern resources.  That much is apparent from the opening cut,
    ""Terrible Angels"", a bucolic blues paean that slyly incorporates sporadic synth blips and what sounds like
    the metallic squeal of a rusted swingset.  Delta blues is a prominent influence throughout the album, and
    the backwater vocals are coolly affected and instantly appealing.  Unfortunately, the Cassidys' entreaties
    wear thin over repeated listens.  Both sisters possess the type of coy yet wracked and powerful voice that
    has vaulted artists like Fiona Apple and Nelly Furtado to stardom, even while the band's roots are planted
    in the indie loam, right beside their Touch &amp; Go compatriots TV on the Radio.</p><p>
    A lot of words have been wasted trying pigeonhole this album into a genre, and the general consensus seems
    to be that <i>La Maison de Mon Reve</i> is impossible to define outside its own Bohemian splendor. If you're
    trapped in a Parisian idyll, maybe, but here in suburbia, the album is about as romantic as a clod of
    freshly mown grass.  CocoRosie are transparent and derivative, yet immensely promising.  If they can
    overcome the insular boundaries of their make-believe world, they might one day produced something utterly
    spectacular.  But they're in no hurry; was a woman who thought she was well-dressed ever cold?</p></div>"|1756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1756-la-maison-de-mon-reve/|6.9|Sam Ubl

How else to explain the lone instrumental track that makes
    up the entirety of this record, chugging for one hour with no climax and just a handful of variations?
    Even at its most droning, this isn't a new age record that syncs up your brain waves and cycles you to a
    cloud-breaking revelation; nor is it straight jazz, as the rhythmic pulse is this record's dominant
    attribute.  Instead, it's an excitingly monotonous long-form work that holds its rewards close to the
    vest.</p><p>
<i>Drive By</i> is only the trio's latest disc-long piece.  Chris Abrahams fronts the band on keyboard,
    droning organ and a smattering of glass-etchingly resonant piano, but the rhythm section drives this date,
    with Lloyd Swanton playing a select few different riffs on upright bass and Tony Buck displaying robotic
    endurance on drums and shakers.  And even though The Necks work routinely in the hour-long format, they
    can still turn it into an event: <i>Drive By</i> ramps up portentously and then plows ahead like an engine,
    until (spoiler warning:) it wraps up like a puff of air at the finish.</p><p>
    
    The clarity of their playing actually makes the disc something of a hard read.  Minimalist music can drown
    you in tones, until the smallest details poke out like shadings in the instruments' wood; other bands' jams
    show signs of fatigue or clear arcs and releases, no matter how repetitious the music.  But The Necks
    give up nothing.  Any flaws or limits are hidden, and they draw your attention to the music instead of the
    means: You never get the idea that they're playing for an hour to prove that they can do it, or to showcase
    a glut of ideas, but simply to give you the pleasure of focusing on music in extreme detail.</p><p>
    
    The music doesn't mesmerize as much as it propels: Either because of the title or because I listen to this
    on my hour-long highway commute, the piece reminds me of a long drive on a straight road, with only a
    handful of distractions.  Listen to how gradually Abrahams veers from the course to improvise, less like
    a jazzman leaning in for a solo than a dog leaning its head out a car window; meanwhile, when Swanton
    revisits an early bass riff it sounds like a major milestone, even though he's absorbed right back into
    the flow.</p><p>
    
    The biggest events are the flashes of beauty along the way, not arranged narratively so much as dropped
    intuitively like landmarks-- tapes of crickets, the sound of children, and most of all, the wide-skyed,
    transcendent primary melody that Abrahams states just a few times, which sounds like a snippet of Joe
    Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"".  It's to their credit that even these touches don't ""pretty up"" the album or
    force the way you interpret it, and you can take it as transcendent or mindless, ambient or rocking: As
    the Necks have figured out, you can hear a lot in a piece if you listen long enough.</p></div>"|5892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5892-drive-by/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    outsourcing, but the States' fine musical heritage continues to be sold back to us by the more attuned
    tastemakers in Japan, Germany, Italy, and England.  The Brits, with that sterling exchange rate and
    unequivocal love of-- as one music journal states it-- ""American Negro Music"" continue to kill us with
    our once-exported music.  Late last year, the excellent <i>Country Got Soul</i> comp, which compiled
    homegrown redneck-soul, swamp-sludged funk, and proto-Outlaw tracks, was released in England, and labels
    like Kent and Ace (not to mention Soul Jazz) regularly dig through our American R&amp;B; and soul vaults and
    repackage them for new ears in the digital age.</p><p>
    
    While previous releases on the London-based Honest Jon's label at least looked to their isle's own for
    tasteful calypso and dancehall sides, they've now turned their attention to the crucial work done down
    at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, at the end of the 60s' pipe dream and on through the 70s'
    rough soul-survivalism.  Behind only the mighty Stax label and house band in terms of Top 40 success,
    they churned out gritty Southern soul at a pill and whiskey-fueled pace.  The consistency of this
    powerhouse and stable of artists deserved documentation beyond the Percy Sledge, Etta James, and Aretha
    Franklin sides continually sold to Big Chillers.  Though her record has now been reissued Stateside as
    well-- on Astralwerks, of all labels-- it was Honest Jon's that first brought attention to this 26-track
    collection of songs from forgotten vocalist Candi Staton, whose vocal range falls squarely between the
    Queen of Soul and Marie Queenie Lyons.</p><p>
    
    Reared on church singing and gospel groups, and ironically ignoring her voice to raise a family with an
    abusive preacher's son, one fateful night out brought her to the attention of singer Clarence Carter and
    ultimately the owner of Fame Studios, where she would record all of these sides.  As love returns as an
    album-length theme (everyone from Outkast to Superpitcher has recently succumbed to its onus), here it
    comes in three-minute chunky cuts, world-wise beyond Staton's years.  In each of her songs, love is cast
    as irrational, temporal, and sinful.  There are at least four cheating songs, none of them shying away
    from their awful truths.  And then there's love as sweet entanglement, rendered in the South's down-home
    fetter metaphors of the chain, the prison, the fishhook, and the puppet string.  And let's not leave out
    that love is also without age or legal boundary, as songs like ""I'd Rather Be an Old Man's Sweetheart
    (Than a Young Man's Fool)"" and ""Another Man's Woman, Another Woman's Man"" lay out explicitly.</p><p>
    
    The earlier tracks are tougher, with muscular bass and snares like rifle shots, as Staton testifies, pleads,
    and cries until she's hoarse, boasts, or else shouts aloud her tales of love gone bad or love too good to
    last.  I return more to the middle of this set, though, to the country comforts of Candi's interpretations
    of soul as well as country standards as her voice finds new nuances in the worn words.  Her rasp elevates
    ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" to the same level as Otis Redding and O.V. Wright's own takes.  Though I may
    be more familiar with Patsy Cline's heartbreaking loss on ""He Called Me Baby"", Staton's strength makes known
    the more redemptive side of the song.  With the addition of string sections that come later to the Muscle
    Shoals sound, ""Stand by Your Man"" is sharper than the syrupy Tammy Wynette original.  And Staton's vocal
    performance on ""In the Ghetto"" even wrought fanmail from Elvis himself.</p><p>
    
    26 tracks is a bit much to get through in one sitting, but the compilers have mixed it all up nicely, the
    slow-boiling, gospel-based ballads leading into the more ecstatic brassy blasts and natural funk of the
    uptempo tracks.  And given that even the least-crucial songs feature a tough backing band and a powerful,
    raspy performance from Candi, that's a lot of soul for your diminished-value U.S. buck.</p></div>"|7741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7741-candi-staton/|7.9|Andy Beta

    calling her that is like calling the current outbreak of bird flu Asia's least deadly epidemic.  I'm an
    unapologetic relativist when it comes to music, so Spektor's alliance with the repulsive likes of The Moldy
    Peaches does color my perception of her.  Antifolk's modus operandi is to masquerade drooling insolence as
    outsider art, but the unholy progeny of Tiny Tim and Beat Happening have a pretty good thing going, because
    it's absolutely impossible to approach them with any objective criterion of quality.</p><p>
    Regina Spektor doesn't need that coat of post-modern protection.  Her songs are clever and touching in any
    context, and her technical prowess is considerable: A girl from a good Russian-Jewish family (her father
    comes to her shows), she's put her inevitable piano lessons to good use.  Spektor does, however, constantly
    employ a trick I consider dirty: She reaches her audience's ears and heartstrings through feigned naivete.
    The I'm-just-a-wee-lass stance is apparent throughout <i>Soviet Kitsch, as well as her live performances,
    where she's been known to pout and giggle and murmur and feed the crowd chocolates; what the Russians call
    </i><i>manernost' is her only liability, but it's badly holding her back.</i></p><p>
    Take the best song on the record, ""Ghost of Corporate Future""; this exquisitely structured number steadily
    spirals up from a plinky opening to a majestic finish, from a street sketch to a Big Statement on life and
    how to live it.  ""Everything is plastic/ And everyone's sarcastic/ And all your food is frozen/ And it
    needs to be defrosted,"" sings Spektor in an inimitable mix of horror and wonderment.  But watch the whimsy
    go to work: ""Maybe you should cut your own hair/ 'Cause that would be so funny/ It doesn't cost any money/
    And it always grows back.""  Spektor delivers ""funny"" in a kindergarten squeak that would only be accessible
    to the rest of us through regression therapy; this kind of stuff only works live, and then in measures.  In
    the studio, it's murder: Even if Regina's mannerisms are totally spontaneous, guess what?  They won't be by
    your third listen.</p><p>
    Other songs suffer a similar fate.  There's a wealth of great material here-- ""Carbon Monoxide"", the
    expansive ""Chemo Limo"", ""Your Honor"" with its sudden outbursts of punk thrash-- all diminished, to various
    degrees, by genre affectations.  When Regina's not belting Billie, she's cooing Tori, or vamping up elastic
    Bronx vowels; although there's no Russian accent to speak of, Spektor's occasional Björk-isms compound the
    cuteness.</p><p>
<i>Soviet Kitsch, which was deliberately intended as a minor release, is currently enjoying a wider
    audience than it appears to have been made for.  Some of it has to do with Julian Casablancas' dabbling
    in arts patronage: Spektor opened for The Strokes on their European tour dates and duets on the inconsequential
    ""Reptilia"" B-side ""Modern Girls and Old-Fashioned Men"".  I'm reminded of the way David Bowie parades around
    his admiration for Daniel Johnston: Spektor is becoming a unit of freak-cred currency.  Except in this case,
    the ball is still in her court; she can still walk out of the corner into which the circumstance and
    alliances are painting her, with wits and talent intact.</i></p></div>"|7739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7739-soviet-kitsch/|6.8|Michael Idov

    bleeding edge of music technology.  Soon after, magnetic tape came into use
    and set experimentalists like John Cage and the French concréte crew to work
    figuring out all the weird shit to be done with recorded sound.  At some
    point in those heady days, the tape loop became part of the new music
    composer's orchestra, and during the late 50s and 60s, composers like Terry
    Riley, Steve Reich and Pauline Oliveros were using the technique to make some
    pretty incredible music.</p><p>
    The tools and technology of the modernist 50s have come to be seen as quaint
    and arcane, and when they're deployed now, their very age becomes part of
    their appeal.  The idea of a collective working exclusively with tape loops
    is like a baroque chamber group dedicated to period instruments.  Australia's
    five-man collective The Loop Orchestra is such a throwback.  Live and on
    record, they work with analog tape loops and analog tape loops only.  They've
    been around in various incarnations for over 20 years, but <i>Not Overtly
    Orchestral</i> is only their third album.</p><p>
    The back cover of <i>Not Overtly Orchestral</i> excites me.  There's a picture
    of two open reel decks set fifteen or so feet apart in some sparse warehouse,
    and stretched between them is a loop of \xBC"" tape.  This photo makes me realize
    that The Loop Orchestra would be extra great as a live act, with a stage
    full of beautiful machines spinning out tendrils of sound in all directions.
    Still, this particular CD is an excellent consolation prize.</p><p>
    The general M.O. here is to introduce and layer various loops, ride the faders
    so the mix is constantly in flux, and then tear the music back down at the
    track's end.  It's a simple technique that's been done a million times, but
    experience has taught The Loop Orchestra how to find loops that work well
    together and complement the overall intentions of each specific piece.  ""Son
    of Not Overtly Orchestral"" combines phrases of symphonic music of various
    lengths with some reversed radio static.  The varying duration of the loops
    causes the piece to warble to and fro unexpectedly, so that each cycle brings
    a different combination to the foreground.</p><p>
    ""Radiophony"" is sourced from materials nicked from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop,
    so it's filled with old synths and sound effects.  These loops are shorter and
    more numerous, so the entire track seems like a tightly choreographed vibrating
    cluster.  ""Gam"", which uses bells and electrical interference among other identifiable
    sounds, is fast and percussive and, fittingly, of pop song length.  The 16-minute
    closer ""Profiles"" is the most ominous track on the collection, with vocal samples
    that sound pained, bordering on demonic, some nasty bird calls, and a noisy train
    of backing noise that makes me think of a world in serious trouble.</p><p>
    The Loop Orchestra remind me a bit of Philip Jeck in the way they use old technology
    to evoke the hazy dreams of another time.  Consisting as it does of cycled fragments
    of sound, <i>Not Overtly Orchestral</i> can on the one hand be slotted alongside
    current electronic music that makes heavy use of repetition.  But The Loop Orchestra's
    sources are old and creaky without any hint of a digital edge.  Everything about the
    sounds is antiquated, and yet the music remains oddly timeless, ""classic"" in the realm
    of modern experimental music.</p></div>"|4958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4958-not-overtly-orchestral/|8.0|Mark Richardson

    Deerhoof's excitement in toying with the building blocks of pop songwriting-- and their characteristically
    short, almost infantile attention span-- energized <i>Reveille</i> and <i>Apple O'</i> to near-unparalleled
    levels of melodic potency, while the music's lack of any discernable patterns kept listeners continually

    clear that the San Francisco quartet had come to understand the mechanics of melody-making, and, more
    importantly, that pop, when too saccharine, eats itself.  But Deerhoof never compromised their melodies to
    avoid potential schmaltz; rather, they kept their lines short and to the point, coating the songs with
    well-placed sheets of noise and fragmented melody.  And yet, Deerhoof have never come off calculated or
    bookish.  In fact, they seem to stumble upon their ideas: Their songs are strings of perfectly fortunate
    accidents, explosive and radioactive, but also instable and always on the verge of self-collapse.</p><p>
    
    At least with automobiles, there's a practical endpoint to mechanical deconstruction, but even with endless
    possibilities for combination (I wonder what happens when I hook the steering wheel up to the CD player?),
    one can only tinker for so long before the ideas become elaborate enough that the car must be rebuilt to
    support them.  Deerhoof have reached a similar point in their career.  With the exception of <i>Holdy Paws</i>,
    the band's songs have never seemed to aspire to ""song status""; they were basically well-assembled sequences
    of simple and powerful ideas-- even one-minute tracks like ""Holy Night Fever"" covered a tremendous amount
    of musical ground.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Milk Man</i>, Deerhoof harness all they've learned from their previous experiments, and written what
    may be their first truly conventional songs.  Here, they've focused their maniacal energy into seriously
    dense and carefully considered songwriting; even the cleaner and deeper production betrays Deerhoof's
    commitment to letting the songs speak for themselves, and to keeping individual parts as precise and
    undistracting as possible.  Greg Saunier's drumming is the most restrained I've ever heard it, while Chris
    Cohen and John Dieterich-- who are of such one (brilliant) mind that in concert they can play in perfect
    tandem without ever looking at each other-- find themselves more concerned with static harmonies and more
    dominant of their precious miasmatic outbursts.  Satomi Matsuzaki, meanwhile, has improved considerably as
    a singer, and is now capable of delivering remarkably complex vocal melodies.  And with more developed
    vocal melodies comes Deerhoof's first crack at meaningful lyrics: Over the course of this record's 11
    tracks, Satomi narrates a coherent (if somewhat disturbing) story about a milk man who kidnaps children
    and hides them in the clouds.</p><p>
    
    So is this Deerhoof's best?  Is <i>Milk Man</i>, as <i>SPIN</i> remarked, ""a perfect album?""  It isn't,
    unfortunately, but the album plays host to what are easily some of Deerhoof's best songs, conventional or
    otherwise.  Four-minute opener ""Milk Man""-- longer than nearly every other song Deerhoof has recorded--
    is as much a statement of the album's overall tenor as it is of the band's change of pace: Unaccompanied
    guitar lines interact confidently, building sparse but lush harmonies that together function as the song's
    recurring theme.  The keyboard, which was noticeably absent from <i>Apple O'</i>, returns here with
    remarkable subtlety, a respondent to Satomi's pristine melody.  The internal interactions within the song--
    as opposed to the external reactions of the band members-- are the focal point of ""Milk Man"", possibly
    Deerhoof's finest moment.</p><p>
    
    ""Desaparecere"" may be as good as the title track.  Set to a drum machine, the quiet song boasts <i>Milk Man</i>'s
    most complex harmonies, built entirely from keyboard sounds and Satomi's razor-sharp Spanish delivery and
    glissandi.  Not a note is out of place.  The song marks the first time Deerhoof have indulged so openly in
    the clicks-and-cuts of minimalist beatmaking, and it's done to beautiful effect.  ""C"", originally released
    on seven-inch in 2002, finds a place on the album perhaps for its similar degree of restraint; here,
    Deerhoof experiment with slow, static harmony composition and phaseshifted white noise, as Satomi squeaks
    out a poignant minor-key melody and Greg taps out frantic snare rolls.  What's most noteworthy about ""C""
    is its terrifying use of space, particularly in the moment before a tense guitar chord is resolved by Satomi
    restating her melody on keyboard.</p><p>
    
    The three songs I mention above-- and to a lesser extent ""Giga Dance"" and ""Milking""-- are simply fantastic;
    the rest of <i>Milk Man</i>, however, performs at a frustratingly lower level.  The instrumental ""Rainbow
    Silhouette of the Milky Rain"" boasts a brilliant, spidery guitar duet in 3/4 time, but is otherwise an
    incongruous, ill-conceived medley of mediocre riffs and uninteresting drumming, while ""Dog on the Sidewalk""
    seems completely pointless, an unusual misstep for Deerhoof.  And the album's last four tracks, while hardly
    offensive, sound somehow unfinished in comparison to the album's high points.</p><p>
<i>Milk Man</i> is certainly not some point of no return for Deerhoof-- they certainly aren't locked into
    writing in this more conventional style, just as they weren't locked in after the similarly song-oriented
    <i>Holdypaws</i>.  The band is too committed to growing as musicians and writing better songs not to revisit
    the rambunctious <i>Reveille</i> and <i>Apple O'</i> woodsheds for inspiration.  <i>Milk Man</i> not only
    testifies to how potent those sessions proved, but also to how successfully the band can step back and craft
    those rabid ideas into impressive songs without devitalizing them.</p></div>"|2253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2253-milk-man/|7.6|Nick Sylvester

Seriously,
    cut the dead weight.  Brave?  Follow the solitary examples set by Merzbow,
    Jim O'Rourke, Keiji Haino, Tyondai Braxton, et al, and break eardrums by
    your high lonesome.  And if the rugged solo thing isn't up your alley then
    consider the toxic chemistry that emerges when two artists decide to stop
    just short of a trio.</p><p>
    
    At least in the more rambunctious rock section of my record collection, two is
    often the magic number for the creation of the headiest of discombobulation.
    Off the top of my head, I'm thinking of couplings like Harry Pussy, Climax
    Golden Twins, The Hospitals, Orthrelm, Hella, Pink &amp; Brown, and godheadSilo.
    Most likely, though, the first two-person hardcore noise act to jump into
    post-<i>Oops!</i> minds is Fort Thunder's premiere export, Lightning Bolt.
    Over the past couple of years, the Providence, RI twosome has uncharacteristically
    flirted with the musical ""mainstream,"" first via 2001's <i>Ride the Skies</i>
    and then through the absolute stunner, <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i>.  But whatever
    the hipster down the streets tells you, these high-profile lads were just the
    tip of an ever growing iceberg.</p><p>
    
    You needn't travel far from there to consider Mindflayer, another Providence
    one-plus-one battle ax connected to the aesthetically correct Fort Thunder.
    Comprised of Lightning Bolt drummer/screamer Brian Chippendale and analog
    electro-terrorist Matt Brinkmann of Forcefield, the pair offer a less
    psychedelic sandblast, subsisting on lapidary, alien-abduction blast-offs.
    The change in dosage is largely due to instrumentation.  Mindflayer trades
    bass for a pile of electronic bursts, which means they often sound like
    they've buried themselves in a flooded basement, surrounded by bright plastic
    toys and demolished spiderwebs.  Where I often imagine the triumphant Lightning
    Bolt sending its open-ended blitzkrieg down from an ice-capped mountain,
    Mindflayer's approach is of the murkiest, damaged swamp-monster depths.  The
    duo's hermetically overstuffed take on tribalism lacks the wiggle room to
    allow for anything as starkly arresting as <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i>'s title
    track, and Lightning Bolt do make better dance music.  Despite the obstacles,
    though, there's something to be said for music this crackly.</p><p>
    
    Bedecked in Happy Flowers' naive art, <i>It's Always 1999</i> was originally
    released at the macrolevel in 2001 by Ooo Mau Mau.  Recorded prior to last
    year's first proper recording, its 21 salvos offer a little peak at an ecstatic
    earlier offering.  (To be fair and accurate, the band's been around since 1996,
    so even when this was put to tape in 1999, they were hardly newcomers.)
    Enjoyable for its gusto and ramshackle territorial pissing, most of these
    all-too-brief compositions would benefit from considerably longer lifespans.</p><p>
    
    The abridged tracks like ""Mud Lazer Lazy Lazers"" or ""A Worming Is Coming""
    have merit, but feel like tonal exercises or ColecoVision outtakes, not
    burly rockers.  The skeletal ""Argamnimals"" shouts for additional crunk from
    Lil' Jon.  ""Five Minutes of Sporadic Beats"" lies about its length but remains
    pretty spot-on regarding the rest of its physical make-up.  We all know it
    takes time to unearth transcendence, right?  Well, much of the clipped efforts
    here crash back to earth just when you start nodding elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    Most successfully, ""Revenge of Whales/Whale War""-- part one of a slight, but
    intriguing series of whale-centric tracks-- builds a rhythm of drum/flange
    rolls into a towering edifice of torturous Hendrixian feedback.  It's a
    lovely climb, my boys.  Less caustic, the fluttering lock-groove of ""1999
    Animals Revenge"" is my idea of an unhinged booty jam for over-sexed
    pterodactyls in Gap t-shirts. And while I'm at it, the equally longwinded
    ""Psychic Fields of Animal Town"" blows a huge psych bugle into your mind's
    eye: As the drums pick up in the final few seconds, it's like experiencing
    a midtempo 80s hardcore show from the bottom of a sweaty pile of wasted
    delinquents.</p><p>
    
    While <i>It's Always 1999</i> remains an unrelenting serving of dark stew, it
    at times wades into the entropic (not always in the positive Melvins-esque or
    Sleep meaning of the term).  There are more highlights, more duds, and some that
    fit both categories.  Still, given the highs and lows, Chippendale and Brinkmann
    have such a raging dual chemistry that even their unsuccessful overdoses spit
    and kick and tell you to fuck off like a couple of anarchic hoodlums snuffing
    out the world on their way home from school.</p></div>"|5544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5544-its-always-1999/|7.3|Brandon Stosuy

All these sorry tales of murder,
    blood-spilt love and the dead cow skulls scattered by gravel roads have become so synonymous with the music
    of the Midwest and the songs of the South, that it becomes easy to lose perspective.  Are the likes of
    Houston and Omaha really the barren, backwards dustbowl towns you hear of in songs?  Are there no people
    who wear suits, drive foreign cars, sip lattés and read the <i>New York Times</i> while making snide remarks
    about Bush?  Yes, of course there are.  So why doesn't the music ever reflect that?</p><p>
    The Willard Grant Conspiracy is another clichéd country band, another bunch of blues-ridden, fire-and-brimstone
    missionaries whose opaque, gothic hymnals add to the myth of Americana.  They've never been great, even
    back to 1998's sort-of well regarded <i>Flying Low</i>, a record that, in retrospect, seems virtually
    identical to all their others.  Now on their fifth record, the band has shown no signs of growth, and the
    fact that their core partnership of frontman Robert Foster and guitarist Paul Austin is augmented by an
    alumni of assorted waifs, strays and passers-by (including Kristin Hersh, and members of Lambchop and The
    Walkabouts) does nothing to alleviate the sameness of what is essentially another set of safe, formulaic
    ballads for the <i>No Depression</i> set.</p><p>
    By all measures, <i>Regard the End</i> is a conventionally ""beautiful"" record.  Robert Fisher's bass-tinged
    voice can stretch from meek and tender to intense and bellowing, with an aged wisdom that adds grace and
    gravity to tracks like the near-Celtic lament ""Beyond the Shore"".  They've also got the knack for ""tasteful""
    arrangements.  On the pompously titled ""Ghost of the Girl in the Well"", guitars strum and shimmer in line
    with Foster's voice while a bored rhythm section reminds the band to stay awake.  Strings sway, shiver,
    and flail helplessly, reaching for a heartstring to grab.</p><p>
    Yet, for the most part, The Willard Grant Conspiracy are grabbing at thin air.  On tracks like ""Rosalee"",
    you're stunned by the utterly formulaic approach to some of the songwriting.  As an acoustic guitar sparks
    up its folksy strum, Foster dictates a tale of a girl that refuses to speak with all the melodic distinctiveness
    of a Dave Matthews tune, before a violin takes its cue, embellishing the song with some unnecessary
    attention-seeking.  This cycle repeats itself for 3\xBD minutes before stumbling to a failed, idea-drained
    finish.</p><p>
    And then there's the suffering-- lots of it, all over the album-- not all of which belongs to the
    bored-to-tears listener.  On closing track ""The Suffering Song"", Foster moans about how ""mother's got
    a few days left/ She thinks it's time we all learnt to pray.""  And as the song climbs to its climax,
    with the rousing chorus of ""suffering's going to come to everyone someday,"" you certainly get the sense
    that, well, he might be suffering a bit.</p><p>
    But suffering from what?  What infuriates most about this record is not its rigid predictability, its
    absence of invention or its reliance on tired-out alt-country clichés; it's the fact that throughout
    <i>Regard the End</i>, the songs rely on only the vaguest utterances of emotion, amounting to little
    more than a bad landscape painting-- all grand brushstrokes, no substance or detail.  It seems that
    the band is fully competent of evoking a mood, but incapable of articulating why.</p><p>
    Rarely has a genre sounded so tried and tired, so forced, formulaic and reliant on its own mythology as
    country music is made to sound on <i>Regard the End</i>.  Though its application and musicianship is
    admirable, its lack of lyrical argument or narrative leave us with a canon of paceless funereal laments
    that conjure endless feelings of enforced sadness without explanation.  In a field full of fellow lovesick
    souls, these are failings we simply shouldn't have to accept.</p></div>"|8686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8686-regard-the-end/|3.9|Neil Robertson

    just as powerful as million-man productions.  No matter how many work hours are ultimately logged manipulating
    records and tweaking songs into perfect shapes from black leather studio chairs with sweaty-fingered engineers
    clutching knobs, the odd, unmediated moment of sonic serendipity can never be completely discounted: <i>Nonesense
    Goes Mudslide</i>, the first solo outing from Holopaw drummer Michael Johnson, is heavy with a kind of accidental
    grace that simply can't be manually inspired.  Packed with peculiar, homemade twists and charmingly bewildered
    lyrics, the album is a wildly spontaneous and nicely composed platter of sound.</p><p>
    
    Holopaw's self-titled debut was so soft and organic it almost felt edible; the band's yawning pedal steel,
    swampy electronics, and brisk acoustic strums established a crooked kind of Americana, something imminently
    more complex than the fetishized, backwards-country yelping of their contemporaries.  <i>Nonsense Goes
    Mudslide</i> opts for a slightly less nostalgic turn, though, pairing Johnson's pert, friendly vocals with
    quirky electronics and fragile percussion, eschewing earnest acoustic laments in favor of perverse
    ideological lessons.  Still, despite the obvious departures, there's a looseness to the record that mimics,
    however inadvertently, Holopaw's cowed, scrappy elegance: Each of Johnson's disparate components are laced
    tightly together, yet <i>Nonsense</i> still continually threatens to collapse on itself, as if any moment
    could bring the inevitable release of cymbals suddenly popping off their stands and rolling around the room,
    microphones spontaneously dissembling, and synthesizers shooting open, angular bits of black and white
    plastic rocketing in every direction.</p><p>
    
    Johnson is nothing if not immensely resourceful, and <i>Nonsense Goes Mudslide</i> is riddled with
    archaic-sounding pops and snippets of found sound: a phone rings (and rings), someone clears their throat,
    water rushes, rain trickles, tapes crackle, taut strings bow in and out.  Meanwhile, Johnson's sweet,
    meandering vocals are interrupted by groaning synthesizers and creaky beats.  Opener ""Faulty Family"" is
    a twinkling, sprightly song built around an innocuous recorder line; zaps and claps rise and fall in the
    background, crafting a bizarre bedroom symphony that always remains surprisingly subtle.  ""And Now, The
    Sequel"" features a synth line drowned in fuzz and plenty of giant drumming; ""The Staring Contest"" (Johnson
    routinely provides the audio for Staremaster, a Florida-based professional staring contest which has since
    spawned both a documentary and a national tour) is a fleeting splash of spectral, drowning keys. ""The
    Natives Going Under"" pits Johnson-in-falsetto against plucked guitar and a lone trumpet swell, before
    abruptly descending into the throes of quasi-tribal drumbeat and spacy, vaguely psychedelic vocals.</p><p>
    
    Johnson's compositions are quick and impossible to map on paper, flitting relentlessly between styles,
    tempos, and sounds, a vaguely manic swarm of noise and melody. The resulting songs are disorienting, but
    lovingly so: like being blindfolded and led around by your best friend.  With Holopaw plotting a spring
    tour with labelmate Iron and Wine, and a new record expected soon, it seems unlikely that Johnson's private
    experiments will see the exposure they deserve, but <i>Nonsense Goes Mudslide</i>'s relative obscurity is
    an essential part of its charm: lock your front door, turn up the volume, and play every item in your house
    until you're officially part of the fun.</p></div>"|4343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4343-nonsense-goes-mudslide/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

    Fair Enough</i> provided welcome respite from IDM's relentlessly brittle and increasingly boring routine.
    Steeped in the same burbling warmth that defined Scott Herren's pre-Barcelona output as Savath &amp; Savalas,
    <i>Fahrenheit</i> politely suggested a new direction that electronic music might take, one that relied as
    heavily on the Rhodes as it did the Cubase VST.  Although it wasn't a radical approach, it was enough to
    differentiate Telefon's languid post-rock from the digital drill bit sounds buzzing out from every other
    18 year-old's laptop.  Temporarily, anyway.</p><p>
    
    Three years is an eternity in electronic music's timeline; certainly more than enough to expose the inherent
    limitations in making chillout music for a subset that defined themselves by never going out much to begin
    with.  In 2004, more of Telefon's once-novel blend of digital squiggles and organic arrangements would seem
    passe, a little late to its own party.  So, rather than scale back the soul in their electronic music, Tel
    Aviv's Joshua Eustis and Charles Cooper downsize the electronic in their soul, in the process adding two
    singers and re-emerging as a sort of twerkier Zero 7.</p><p>
    
    Where <i>Fahrenheit Fair Enough</i> was entirely instrumental, seven of the nine tracks on <i>Map of What
    Is Effortless</i> feature vocals.  Singing duties are split by Damon Aaron, whose reedy tenor is serviceable
    but never exceptional, and L'Altra's Lindsay Anderson, whose disaffected vocals-- with only one exception,
    and only then with the help of some mansized DSP work-- are similarly unremarkable.  But even with better
    performances from its singers, <i>Map of What Is Effortless</i> would still be a deeply flawed record.  The
    reason for this is simple: The addition of vocalists and the move to a song-oriented structure demands
    better songs, and yet Telefon Tel Aviv continue to lean on immaculately sculpted sonics and massive
    orchestral swoops for their drama.  Without decent source material, the singers are left to languish,
    and usually, they take the songs with them.</p><p>
    
    Frustratingly, the instrumentals account for two of the album's best three tracks.  Opener ""When It Happens
    It Moves All by Itself"" is a rolling slice of string-noir that invites comparisons to Cinematic Orchestra,
    while the album's title track contains an achingly bittersweet string motif that builds to a muted climax
    before slipping nimbly out the backdoor.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if the third standout, ""My Week
    Beats Your Year"", stands out because it's particularly good or simply because it's something other than
    prettified, meandering neo-soul.  Featuring Anderson's icy, mulched vocals, a clapback rhythm and a
    staccato keyboard line, it plays like Tel Aviv's approximation of a Richard X clubfloor track.</p><p>
    
    But everything else, from the wandering ""I Lied"" (propped up by a well-placed rush of strings) to the
    stillborn ""What It Was Will Never End"" (propped up by a well-placed surge of guitars), just kind of
    hopelessly meanders, waiting, as if the arrangements might suddenly do something different to redeem it.
    Sometimes that happens, but too often, <i>Map of What Is Effortless</i> just plods, one track lazily into
    another, lukewarm and glazed over, all dressed up, nowhere to go.</p></div>"|7963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7963-map-of-what-is-effortless/|6.3|Mark Pytlik

    hunched over a laptop, biting his tongue and copying studiously from a <i>Thesaurus</i>.  No, no, Franz
    Ferdinand was the perfect vehicle for a comeback.  I'm half Hungarian.  My family had two dogs named
    Huszar.  I've been looking for a way to work schnauzers and Magyar into a review.</p><p>
    It didn't have to be that contrived.  The parallels were fluorescent: Franz and I were both stubbornly
    nostalgic for the decade-gone heights of Britpop.  In their silk button-downs and slickly combed hair,
    the band mimicked the gauche decadence of Suede to such a point that it appeared they were wearing Anderson
    and Butler's hand-me-down menswear.  Each song on their self-titled debut catwalk swaggered with sucked-in
    cheeks like Alex James' effortless bounce on Blur's ""Girls &amp; Boys"".  If that sounds too hopelessly recent
    and uncool for the hipsters, I could go obtuse and say Franz Ferdinand revive the sounds of the John Cale-era
    Squeeze or the New York never-weres The Necessaries.  I could erroneously throw Franz Ferdinand in with
    the recent dance-punk, freak-shit, whatever ""scene.""  But I'm calling a spade a spade.  Call it Scotpop
    if you feel uncomfortable.</p><p>
    Not content to kickstart their career on an album laden mostly with potential, the Glaswegians have banged
    out a celebratory LP with lyrics bearing surprising satire, wit, and unabashed romance.  On the upcoming
    single, ""Dark of the Matinee"", Alexander Kapranos positions himself as a bitter cynic who eventually gives
    in to fame (though it may be, as the title suggests, in the dimmer regions of the spotlight) after being
    charmed by an attractive optimist, and, one would imagine, the unapologetic funk of the track itself.  By
    the last verse, Kapranos imagines himself smiling wide, sitting with Abba-loving AM talk show host Terry
    Wogan.  With their meteoric rise, Franz Ferdinand could very well be within a year of it.  They're poised
    to be the next Duran Duran or the next Pulp.  Or they could be the next Menswear.  In any case, it will be
    a spectacle.</p><p>
    ""Jacqueline"" opens the album deceivingly with gentle acoustic strums and student poem prattle before raygun
    guitars and splashing cymbals annihilate any notion of plaintive reflection.  Kaparanos soon blurts phrases
    like ""it's so much better on holiday,"" ""I'm so drunk I don't mind if you kill me,"" ""I'm alive, I'm alive,""
    and ""we need the money.""  The pace never lets up.  Even their breakthrough single, ""Take Me Out"", blatantly
    changes its mind from Pixies-like pop to squiggly guitar disco a quarter of the way through.  Only on
    ""Cheating on You"" do the drums drop their high-hat riding for stuttering punk.</p><p>
    Franz Ferdinand rarely stray far from the dueling-guitars-with-occasional-keyboard approach, granting even
    the bounciest dance floor numbers pleasantly rough edges, but the final two tracks peak with greater
    arrangement and studio flourish.  Flashy flanger-flecked guitar and layered, lachrymose keyboards add an
    epic air to the tale of confused post-relationship emotions of ""Come on Home"", while ""40 Ft"" tiptoes in on
    spy guitars.  Like the overlooked brilliance of <i>Parklife</i>'s Side B, the song turns back to triumphant,
    operatic music spiked with pessimism and noise.  Even Damon Albarn's beloved melodica makes an appearance
    2\xBD minutes in.</p><p>
    Like all lasting records, <i>Franz Ferdinand</i> steps up to the plate and boldly bangs on the door to
    stardom.  There's no consideration for what trends have just come and gone.  There's no waffling or
    concessions for people who won't get it.  As with all great entertainment, it will divide opinion.  I
    honestly couldn't remember Volodrag, The Hold My Coat, Santa Schultz, or the bands in whose reviews they
    appeared.  I'd made that stuff up to amuse myself during boring albums.  As I told Ryan, Franz Ferdinand
    didn't need a concept.  We would all remember this one.  Like that wizard's cap.</p></div>"|3279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3279-franz-ferdinand/|9.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    circles.  With the emergence of online commerce centers and message boards, finding and commenting on the
    best, most obscure artists has become incredibly easy.  Rising from the ashes of <i>Hip Hop Infinity</i>
    and the Anticon doppelganger fallout, Australian-born rapper Sankofa (best known for his collaborative work
    with the Cunninlynguists and his group, White Collar Criminals) makes his long-awaited solo debut with <i>The
    Rosetta Stone</i>, a record that finally places him above the millions of CD-R mic assassins lying in wait.</p><p>
    
    Sankofa is, on first listen, the sum of the largest components of the white underground movement-- Sole's
    speedy monotone, Sage Francis' wit and multi-syllabic wordplay, Buck 65's gravely voice and introspective
    rhymes-- even while his most direct influences lie in the roots of mid-90s hip-hop icons.  His greatest
    strengths are his strong, unwavering flow and his commanding mic presence, at once booming, memorable and
    vulnerable.</p><p>
<i>The Rosetta Stone</i> is structured around relatively generic subject matter, for the most part, a
    wholesale defamation of the mainstream hip-hop machine and its proponents, as well as some well-placed
    battle rap and esoteric exercises.  The most creative tracks are the poignant memorial to his father
    (""RDB"") and an industrial upheaval anthem (""All of Heaven's Angels""), but even in less powerful moments,
    his overwhelming talent makes up for his lack of topical variety.  However, songs like ""Bill Macy"" (where
    Sankofa attempts to play a label rep/commercial label salesman) and ""Asphyxia"" (a lame, esoteric sub-Anticon
    death march) grate on nerves with their absolute pointlessness.</p><p>
    
    Sankofa is by far at his best in his angrier incarnation.  On ""Sunday Morning"", the rap protagonist allows
    the listener into his starkly distinct battle style, a mix of subtle wordplay and relentlessly dry wit.
    Over producer Ear Max's stunning mix of bells, chimes and harsh drums, Sankofa takes it to an enemy emcee's
    hypothetical girl, claiming that he's ""crushed apples and cinnamon/ Strictly in cider"" and that he's ""up in
    her body cavity with more decay than in NY.""  He caps it with the brag rap statement, ""No smokin' haze,
    Romeo rope-a-dope/ I'm chilling in the Pokonos, eatin' Toblerones.""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the beats often fail to match Sankofa's abilities, especially in achieving a level of
    cohesion.  The major standout is Kno's stellar twist on vocal samples and mesmerizing jazz-hop with ""RDB"",
    while Manic Depressive's heavy crunch funk guitar fits well on ""45 Notches"".  Other beats, such as ""Eeyore""
    and ""The Making of Believe"", are completely forgettable, while ""4th Wall"" and ""Asphyxia"" border on Anticon
    piggybacking.  The general patchiness here underscores that what Sankofa really needs is to find a production
    style and stick with it.</p><p>
    
    While it's difficult to find fault with a guy who refers to Penelope Cruz as ""Selma Hayek minus talent, body
    and sensuality,"" Sankofa could find much greater success by focusing his energies on either the esoteric
    side of his persona or on a more traditional battle rap angle, as the many sides of his character aren't
    so much refreshingly varied as difficult to get a handle on.  His spotty beat choices and the occasional
    derivative subject matter hold him back, but his talent is almost staggering, especially given his lack of
    name recognition in the underground.  <i>The Rosetta Stone</i> may be a relatively solid experiment, but
    Sankofa has yet to discover his personal sound.</p></div>"|7737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7737-the-rosetta-stone/|7.1|Rollie Pemberton

Reviewers can
    pontificate all they want about the latest subgenres, but let's face it, the underground is way too big for
    us to thoroughly examine its every nook and cranny.  To keep up with the rapid metastasis of today's indie
    world is nearly impossible, and specialism seems inevitable.  I won't go on record to predict a Pre-Crit
    program at Harvard anytime soon, but at the rate things are going, terms like lap-pop, glitch-funk, and
    psych-folk may eventually be used as universally as jazz or classical.</p><p>
    The strongest evidence I see of this coming sea change is the orgiastic output from French electronic label,
    Gooom Disques.  The music pretty much speaks for itself: <i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</i> by M83,
    <i>Spring</i> by Cyann &amp; Ben, <i>Cluster Ville</i> by Abstrackt Keal Agram, and now, <i>Le Grand Pic Mou</i>,
    the most challenging and utterly Francophone of them all.  It seems the folks at Gooom are on to something
    we opining mortals yet lack the capacity to understand.</p><p>
    Mils are a Gooom rarity, a group with more than just a couple years' experience and a handful of EPs and
    mixtape appearances under their belt. 1999's <i>7 Masses Déplacées</i> and 2001's <i>Echotones</i> helped
    establish the four-piece outfit from northwestern France as one of the premiere voices in musique electronique.
    <i>Le Grand Pic Mou</i> is the group's fourth full-length, and offers a challenging counterpoint to the
    expansive drones of M83 and Abstrackt Keal Agram.</p><p>
    Instead of creating space for a melody to shine, Mils have an IDM maven's infatuation with exotic textures.
    But unlike other glitch artists, whose work often suffers from a prevailing sense of prefabrication, Mils
    have found a way to enliven their creations: Even the most robotic numbers are swabbed with impressionistic
    dabs of color.  From the trilling flutes and clarinets that introduce ""Les Mecaniques du Pic"" to the
    vibraphone and lightly plucked harp behind ""Societe Duret-Mol"", each composition breathes with a deep
    lifeforce.</p><p>
    The fourteen songs on <i>Le Grand Pic Mou</i> are either extremely long or extremely short; its three longest
    constitute more than half the disc's total runtime.  This disparity creates an interesting dichotomy within
    the complex architecture of the album.  Melodies warble through vortexes of clipped rhythms and jagged beats,
    slowly gaining momentum as they head for either of two final destinations: a sideling plunge into the next
    song, or a prolonged denouement that offers a moment of cordial relief.  ""Vivencia de un Copo"", for instance,
    builds for nearly four minutes upon a brusque repetition of washed-out beats, high-pitched drones, and
    hollow synth accents before a discernable melodic line emerges.  Soon afterwards, the song performs another
    turnabout, as a subtle key change gives way to a sweeping synthesizer, instantaneously illuminating the dank
    milieu and bearing the listener heavenward.  Of course, the problem with any kind of nine-minute song is
    that most listeners lack the patience to see it through to resolution.  Conversely, <i>Le Grand Pic Mou</i>'s
    shorter numbers are often stifling in their brevity.  Still, the constant transitions between epic- and
    interlude-length songs doesn't hinder the flow of the album one bit.</p><p>
    For those who prefer talking about music strictly in terms of other music, Mils can be thought of as a
    French answer to Múm, though perhaps not as touchingly demure.  And of course, while these reference points
    do dot the landscape, Mils coat their influences in enough originality for them to be distinctly felt, if
    not easily identified. ""Tomato Kiki"" sounds vaguely redolent of Bablicon's noisome free-jazz, yet a marked
    difference lies in Mils' reliance upon programmed electronic sounds.  ""Carotine"" and the fourth track
    (several songs have no titles) recall <i>Kid A</i>'s celestial warmth, but remain ineffably unique.</p><p>
    The bands on the Gooom roster do share one thing in common: They have all found a way of invoking the ghosts
    in the machine.  Musicians long ago realized the once-remote potential for beauty in electronic instruments;
    Mils and others are now coming to epitomize it.  ""Solid Fingz"" serves here as a testament to a positive
    human relationship with technology, as well as a convenient mission statement for the band.  The song
    features <i>Le Grand Pic Mou</i>'s only ""lyrics.""  At first, a disembodied female voice delivers a soft-spoken
    monologue, expressing its desire to step outside the machine and become human.  Minutes later, the voice
    returns, louder, exclaiming, ""I can feel it./ What is it?/ Is it being a human being?""  Talk all you want
    about the deleterious effects of technology: Mils see it as a mere manifestation of our most basic humanity,
    and I'm not ashamed to say the robot's words are some of the more poignant I've heard on record yet this
    year.</p></div>"|5571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5571-le-grand-pic-mou/|8.2|Sam Ubl

Numbers are The Cowsills of showroom dummy punk.  Numbers are the American Melt-Banana,
    with singsong choruses in place of scream-song choruses.  Numbers are to opening bands as Vienna sausages
    are to baby showers-- they're kind of always there, but I'm not sure they actually have any fans, except
    that one group of weird guys.  Numbers are to Wm. Bowers as Wang Chung is to C. Ott.  Homemade synthesizers
    are to Numbers as post-punk is to <i>Rolling Stone</i>: Technically, they have to be mentioned, but it reeks
    of tokenism.  Numbers vocalist and drummer Inda Dunis is to tall as is is to is.  Thoughtful commentary is
    to Numbers as it is to this year's presidential race: You can try it, but you're probably going to end up
    just bitching about nothing.  Numbers are the Numbers of fun, retro dance-punk bands.  And there's nothing
    terribly wrong with that.</p><p>
    On their second ""full-length"" (approx. 24 minutes) release, Numbers tighten up their act and spit out 12
    micro-machine sized pellets of spirited pogo-pop spaz.  <i>In My Mind All the Time</i> is reminiscent of
    2002's <i>Life</i>, except that the sound is more polished and the songs are marginally closer to ""songs.""
    That means they tend to have verses and choruses, and sometimes little synthesizer or guitar figures other
    bands might call riffs.  Same old martial bark, though, and that classically rigid human-drum machine beat
    is everywhere to be found.  In a way, this album is a lot less energetic than <i>Life</i>, perhaps as
    Deerhoof's <i>Milk Man</i> suffers in comparison to their previous records.  However, unlike Deerhoof,
    Numbers haven't yet won my trust that they can fall back on songwriting in place of visceral thrills.  In
    the best case, they're a good dance band-- and no good dance band does their best work on record.</p><p>
    By far the most interesting song on the album is the last one, ""Feelings"".  It begins as a distorted synth
    drone, alternating between pulsating laser growl and pulsating major chord laser growl.  It sounds simple--
    and it is-- but it also sounds similar to the rudimentary black-box experiments coming out of Wümme 'round
    about 1971.  The synthesizer carries on by itself for a couple of minutes until drums join in with a slow,
    military snare pattern.  Numbers will probably always be robots, but at least here, they're softhearted
    robots with pleasant Krautrock memories.  The only time they get so nice elsewhere on the album is on
    ""Drunk with Pain"", which, during the verses, could almost pass for The Cars.  Still, the chorus rams the
    zombie staccato vocal pretty hard, and there's a big guitar feedback breakdown in the middle, so best not
    look for too many changes of pace.</p><p>
    The meat of <i>In My Mind</i> is the meat of Numbers: speedy, goose-stepped punk vignettes.  ""Go to Show"",
    ""Disease"", ""Dance Attack"", ""We're Numbers"" and ""I Will Smile No More"" are all variations on that template,
    while ""Hot Fire"", ""Waiting"", ""Anything"" and ""Product Lust"" are different mostly in that they're a little
    slower.  That last tune actually reminds me of the first XTC album, but even that would have been a Barry
    Andrews song with disturbing background yelping.  Two albums into their career, Numbers have amply
    demonstrated their niche among American dancepunk bands, but I could do with even more distinction.  In
    fact, I would love never to begin another discussion about them with a lengthy comparison to other bands
    and/or party snacks.  You know, Numbers are like sugar-free candy: I want to like them, but there's always
    something in the way.</p></div>"|5866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5866-in-my-mind-all-the-time/|5.4|Dominique Leone

    and I was impressed enough by their half of the record that I figured they were worth further investigation.
    It turns out a brief trip back into 2003 reveals all there is to know about Parts &amp; Labor: Prior to that
    split CD, they issued a single album of their own, <i>Grounswell</i>, and taken together, the two releases
    give a pretty good picture of a band rapidly maturing and developing a singular sound.</p><p>
    
    The New York trio's half of <i>Rise, Rise, Rise</i> found them playing drone-centered instrumentals that
    had the effect of mimicking hurdy-gurdys and bagpipes, as well as balancing their electronic noise tendencies
    with melodic development, and even a quick pass through <i>Groundswell</i> displays the groundwork that
    they were building off of.  The band's noisier tendencies tend to be less regulated and the compositions
    less streamlined, but the basic mix of pummeling percussion, frequently distorted bass and squelching
    electronics feels like a natural precedent for what came after.</p><p>
    
    This record's overall sound is extremely bright-- from the massive low-end to the buzzing treble leaping
    from the speakers-- although Parts &amp; Labor don't seem interested so much in establishing a mood as in
    punching you in the face (like Lightning Bolt, only slightly less akin to dental surgery).  Keyboardist/electronics
    manipulator Dan Friel creates dense, aggressive textures with what sound like simple tone generators and
    oscillators, a la Silver Apples' Simeon, and the rhythm section then has their way with them, carrying the
    squealing cloud of melting drones that open ""Happy New Year"" on an epic ride through four-on-the-floor
    passages smothered in Jim Sykes' octopedal drum fills, half-time crawls and ecstatic crescendos.  ""Parts &amp;
    Labor"" staggers over queasy oscillation before launching into an alternate dimension surf tidal wave
    somewhat reminiscent of Disco Inferno's ""In Sharky Water"" in its third minute, BJ Warshaw's bass slapping
    around the reverb chamber like Dick Dale in an especially foul mood.</p><p>
    
    For all their experimental and confrontational tendencies, though, Parts &amp; Labor do occasionally see fit
    to just rock the fuck out, and the towering fuzz bass riff and thundering drums of ""TB Strut"" do the job
    nicely, while the textural mix of overdriven bass and oscillating electronics that carry the low end of
    ""Mike Burke for President"" are almost as hip-shaking as they are earthquaking.  Parts &amp; Labor still show
    room for improvement on their debut, and they've already hinted at how they'll make those strides on
    <i>Rise, Rise, Rise</i>, but it's still a sharp salutation from a band that seems capable of creating
    some incredible mayhem.</p></div>"|6532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6532-groundswell/|7.2|Joe Tangari

It's true that the <i>Young Liars</i> EP had a
    metallic sheen, a mechanical repetitiveness that both boosted and encased the silver-throated vocals of
    Tunde Adebimpe.  The songs were full of distance and voyeurism, as if Adebimpe was stuck on his own
    satellite, watching lovers from afar.  When he got close to a woman, on the stunning soliloquy ""Blind"",
    he couldn't close the deal without giving up the truth: ""My love is a suckerbet.""  But that ain't
    soulless.</p><p>
    
    Another description that never rang true was the comparison of Adebimpe's voice to Peter Gabriel-- a decent
    match in timbre, but Adebimpe's such a different person that I just can't hear the likeness.  This isn't a
    man who would go on stage dressed like a flower.  Instead, Adebimpe sounds like a superhero-- a troubled,
    Batman-style superhero, who can rescue the girl but frets over whether to take the grateful French kiss
    when they hit safe ground.  Nobody with his talents and forthrightness could also have insecurities, yet
    that was what the lyrics made us believe.  His vocals resonate because of his identity: He towers over most
    vocalists, not just for his skill, but because he's so transparent behind it.</p><p>
    
    The band's full-length debut may be one of the most eagerly awaited records of the year.  Until now, TV on
    the Radio have only flashed their talent: David Andrew Sitek's chugging beats and harsh grey textures,
    Adebimpe's voice, and new member Kyp Malone on vocals, guitar, and even more loops.  So the final product,
    <i>Desperate Youths, Blood Thirsty Babes</i>, can't help but sound like a curveball when held against the
    flawless <i>Young Liars</i>, the monumental expectations, and the fact that they're still indulging their
    growing pains.</p><p>
    
    The record starts strong: On opener ""The Wrong Way"", the sound of a sidewalk sax blower is interrupted off
    the beat by a dark chugging loop, a sound that resembles refrigerators being pushed down a hole-- but also
    resembles human feet stomping and hands clapping.  Funk and gospel enter the palette as Malone and Adebimpe
    harmonize on lyrics that grapple with race.  TV on the Radio don't base their work on the fact that they're
    an interracial, mainly African-American band; unlike Living Colour or the 2 Tone bands in the 80s, there's
    no reason to peg them as a ""black rock band"" more than a rock band that happens to have black members.  So
    when race comes up, they use it for questions more than statements.  On ""The Wrong Way"", they pick up and
    dismiss a series of black icons and stereotypes, from the ""soft shoe"" entertainer or the gentle ""magic
    nigger"" in the movies, to the ""fist up"" protesters and ""new negro politician""; but they're also trying out
    the roles, as if assessing where they stand or questioning whether they could end up ""playin' the whore.""
    If they have a message, it's mostly about themselves: TV on the Radio reflect the world they're in, but
    they'll never say they speak for it.</p><p>
    
    The album repeats one track from the EP, ""Staring at the Sun""-- the catchiest but least introspective track
    on that album-- and that sets the path for the band's new style, which is alternately driving and repetitious.
    The guitar parts are almost as static as the beats, and no track develops with the subtlety of, say, <i>Young
    Liars</i>' ""Blind"".  The loops and settings run out of ideas by the end of the record; ""Don't Love You""
    chugs ahead with no progress, making the next song, ""Bomb Yourself"", sound more plodding than it actually
    is.  Even ""Wear You Out"" seems limited when the swarthy opening picks up horns, and then plateaus right
    away.  It isn't a climax so much as proof of how cold those textures can become.</p><p>
    
    The last third is a tough slog.  But track by track, the album's songwriting is tight and often beautiful,
    like the harmonies on ""King Eternal"" and ""Poppy"" that scrape the sky and even overshadow the graceful a
    cappella ""Ambulance"".  And the lyrics are exceptional, with not-too-cryptic images that are both surreal
    and frank: ""All men condemned by men to die/ Damned by blind bitch in hallowed halls"" is an intriguing
    image of the justice system, but to follow it with ""Cover your balls/ 'Cause we swing kung fu"" is truly
    the way to greatness.</p><p>
    
    The biggest improvement here is the addition of Malone.  Is it even right for one band to hog two great
    vocalists, two singers with real personalities and no stylistic self-caging, at a time when most people
    just struggle to follow a template?  Malone creeps through the high registers and whispers the heat that
    Adebimpe won't release; the two of them sound great as co-leads.  My only objection is that the record
    sounds less intimate than when Adebimpe has the mike to himself.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Young Liars</i> EP was as fully realized as all the critics suggested, yet now, TV on the Radio
    sound like a work in progress.  Still, <i>Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes</i> shows more strengths
    than mistakes.  The band's best work comes out of tension, out of a dramatic setting or the sparking of
    elements against each other-- multi-cultures smashed together, men harnessing their voices to machines,
    the excitement of that saxophone cutting against a sludge-loop at the start of the record.  They wrestle

""It's something in my
    later years I've come to regret a little bit just because everybody has their stories of when they were a
    metal head.  And it wasn't until recently that I started listening to Black Sabbath and started appreciating
    it.""</p><p>
    
    Two albums and a six-song <i>Five Songs</i> EP into their career, The Decemberists' are beginning to seriously
    define their sound; a sudden plunge into, say, heavy metal, seems unlikely.  Yet the first movement of <i>The
    Tain</i> EP, the band's new 18-minute composition based loosely on the 8th-century Celtic Ulster cycle's
    central poem ""Tain Bo Cuailinge"", finds Meloy and the others most immediately concerned with-- am I about
    to say this?-- serious Ur-metal riffage.  Granted, Decemberist metal is not going to weigh down the Dominique
    Leones of the world, but make no mistake: Never has this band sung a flag so black, a maiden so iron.</p><p>
    
    The opening of <i>The Tain</i> is indeed jarring, though there's always more than meets the ear with this
    band, and the disc's dark acoustic guitar opening is not without foil: Pay attention to how Colin overdramatizes
    the dark line with his heavy plucks, disarming its sense of foreboding.  When the rest of the band joins
    him in unison, what should be enough of a killer riff for friendly genocide is undermined by the organ's
    funny whir and Rachel Blumberg's gentle cymbal taps.  In short, the sound is off-kilter, though not without
    ample deception, and only hints at the level of sophistication to come in the remaining movements.</p><p>
    
    The Decemberists have consistently proven that they understand the tensions that can be exploited in song:
    Morbid verses are set to straightforward, ""fun"" pop instrumentals (""July July""; ""Chimbley Sweep""), narration
    is often not Colin's own, but another's (""Leslie Anne Levine""), inconsequential banalities are granted
    cosmic musical significance (""Song for Myla Goldberg""), sincerity is performatively lampooned (""I Was
    Meant for the Stage"").  <i>The Tain</i> is no different: In fact, it's easily The Decemberists' most
    carefully considered and sophisticated effort yet-- to a limited degree, some of Colin's subtle musical
    humor even depends on cursory knowledge of its bizarre Celtic cycle namesake.  In short: the cycle's most
    celebrated tale is how Queen Medb's army attacks the town of Ulster with the intention of carrying off
    their great sacred bull, and only CuChulainn, the story's hero, is able to resist the invasion and defend
    the town.  To call a queen, as Colin does, a ""salty little pisser,"" is a brilliant conceit, matched only
    by his decision to set her raid for a bull (her ""shiny prize"") to bombastic hard rock hooks.</p><p>
    
    When the song reaches its third movement, Colin switches the focus of his narrative to how CuChulainn,
    originally named Setanta, became ""CuChulainn"", or literally, ""Hound of Cullan.""  As a mournful bassline
    sways, accompanied by occasional strums of heavily distorted guitar, Colin assumes different points of
    view with each passing line, and the band swells to an ironic degree of celebration upon the words, ""Here
    come loose the hound/ To blow me down,"" the moment at which Setanta is attacked by King Cullan's guard dog.</p><p>
    
    This is not to say that one cannot at all appreciate <i>The Tain</i> without knowledge of Celtic mythology--
    though, for me, personally, the interaction between the instrumentation and Colin's lyrics has always been
    The Decemberists' most fascinating trait.  Take <i>The Tain</i>'s ghostly fourth movement, by far the entire
    composition's most poignant melody.  Rachel assumes vocals akin to her orphanry on ""Chimbley Sweep"", this
    time accompanied by light piano and bowed cello.  The accordion finally makes its somewhat tongue-in-cheek
    appearance at the bridge, fighting with found sounds and music box bells.  Meloy reassumes vocals for the
    fifth movement, which restates <i>The Tain</i>'s original theme-- though not before he beautifully overextends
    himself in lines like, ""Darling dear, what have you done?/ Your hands and face are smeared with blood,""
    subjects that last word to a strange guttural contortion.</p><p>
    
    With each release, The Decemberists grow more sophisticated in their songcraft and subtler in their wit.
    The result, naturally, is that their releases are increasingly more demanding on the listener.  Meeting a
    record on its own terms, though, is to a large extent a forgotten responsibility.  Especially given its
    disorienting opener, <i>The Tain</i> EP is dense musically and lyrically, a bona fide grower, but certainly
    worth the effort to unravel it.</p></div>"|2242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2242-the-tain-ep/|7.7|Nick Sylvester

    audience over a predetermined path towards a particularly myopic interpretation: ""I see overexposed
    mountains and sideways falling snow, therefore I'm sad.""  It's worse when the appropriated imagery falls
    into one of the following standardized genres: high-contrast industrial locales, 80s video-art
    wipes/dissolves, suburban 8mm ennui, ironic juxtapositions (i.e. black metal and Sesame Street),
    faux-Brackhage avant.  Such heart-tugging nonsense is common enough at stadium shows, and certainly
    felt at home accompanying downtown performances in the 60s, but over the past few years, the practice
    has crept into more and more situations that don't make an ounce of conceptual or aesthetic sense.  If
    possible, a much more interesting ideal would be to turn your songs inward in a way that reflected the
    song's compositional guts.  This way you become your visual geography and establish a work that acts as
    its own stimulus and response.</p><p>
    
    Formed in the late 90s, San Diego's premiere ""noir-wave"" trio Kill Me Tomorrow definitely position
    themselves as a band jamming to their own damaged, apocalyptically stylish science fiction flick.  Here,
    it works, mainly because it's easy to see the band as equal parts DIY art project, well-dressed gutterpunk
    commune, and rousing punk-rock act.  I admire the self-sufficiency: Bassist and visual artist K8 Wince
    makes the paintings on the band's records and designs the lopsided t-shirts they wear.  According to her
    husband, drummer/multi-instrumentalist Zack Wentz, he's working with her on a novel composed of 13 stories
    based on the seedy and beautiful characters inhabiting the realm of their newest full-length, <i>The
    Garbageman and The Prostitute</i>.  In fact, rather than providing lyrics for their releases' liner notes,
    KMT prints song/story summaries, giving a sense that the actual lyrics are told, not sung.</p><p>
    
    A follow-up to last year's <i>Skin's Getting Weird</i> EP teaser, <i>The Garbageman and The Prostitute</i>
    launches through nice feedback, pulling with the littlest, most claustrophobic details of post-punk noise
    and the percussive spirit of hip-hop, dub, and the Butthole Surfers.  For those drawn to underbellies,
    KMT negotiate a jam-packed junkyard atmosphere like <i>Blade Runner</i> or <i>Mad Max</i> to write songs
    that might help the Bones Brigade negotiate a 360 from a corroded half-pipe.  They overload their sonic
    palette with garish grumbles, screeches, trash-can noise; at the front of the mix lie processors, samples,
    and drum machines, establishing a schizophrenic dust-storm that flits and sails around the central
    guitar/bass/drums.  Voices drift and shout at the same level, another color of paint.</p><p>
    
    For me, <i>The Garbageman and The Prostitute</i> works best taken in sections; all at once, the insistence
    of the sprung rhythm gets exhausting-- the flatter materials are undistinguished.  In the best songs, you
    can feel a front, middle and back, each member chipping away at a different area and uncovering all sorts
    of potential in their surroundings.  ""Xerox My Hand"" mixes kinetic Texan twang and angular skree to
    impart the story of an office worker who, after copying his body with a Xerox machine, realizes he can
    spot the ghosts of past employees, as well as rat-race comrades of the future.  The particularly meta ""This
    Is a Movie"" is OMD car-jacked by Crass-- breakdowns appear, turning out a shriveling bout of choose-your-own-adventure
    noise, dance loops, and grumbling amphetamines.  ""I Require Chocolate"" discovers sex crimes in the heart of
    a superhero and turns The Commodores' ""Three Times a Lady"" into a frantic teenage riot, its shimmering guitar
    outro and schematic return to tunefulness reminiscent of the blasted beauty of distortion mastered by SY in
    their salad days.</p><p>
    
    After ""I Require Chocolate"", the record skids into a bit of a lull.  Some tracks are muddled, others too
    repetitious.  Before the formula wears too thin, though, KMT gain momentum with the title track, which
    honestly possesses a <i>Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights</i> feel (if rebrewed as werewolf lore).  After
    dullsville, this cathartic rampage emerges amplified and all the more jubilant.  While <i>The Garbageman
    and The Prostitute</i> isn't a complete success, it remains a worthwhile treat.  Whether looting a 7-11
    or inhabiting the body of a transsexual, Kill Me Tomorrow convincingly navigate within a universe of
    their own making-- a rambunctious scene crammed with scattered, toppling, spray-painted things.</p></div>"|4572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4572-the-garbageman-and-the-prostitute/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

Dressed like extras from a Lawrence of Arabia theme park and
    hiding behind secondhand Roman centurion stylistics, NYC's Vaz are another
    white-male duo linked incoherently to Pink &amp; Brown and Lightning Bolt by
    lazy-bone critics. Sure, they've shared stages, situate that certain
    pummeling aesthetic within an obvious sartorial gimmick, and exhibit a
    not-unenjoyable penchant for gliding slippery hands up and down fretboards
    in the name of air-raid-siren squeals, but a more properly obvious comparison
    might be a hollowed-out version of Hammerhead, the middling ex-AmRep cock-rock
    trio that Vaz's Paul Erickson and Jeff Morridian, Jr. used to be two-thirds of.</p><p>
    
    But maybe that's defining a word with another definition.  To be more specific,
    when listening quietly to <i>Dying to Meet You</i>, its aged SST-era vibe
    unexplainably mustered the panoramic sense of dynamics found in Bitch Magnet.
    Turning up the speakers, though, Soo Young-- that gentle bastard-- was nowhere
    to be found.  In his place were swooning modulations-- something like Thurston
    Moore's vocal contributions to <i>Daydream Nation</i> but remixed with ineffable
    elements of Dinosaur Jr's early guitar wash.  Of course, Vaz sound nothing like
    Dinosaur; it's more a feeling of a particular time hidden somewhere behind the
    Black Flag adoration. If possible, Vaz crib the generational vibe of <i>Our Band
    Could Be Your Life</i> by heading sideways through the vocal territories of a
    more macho Depeche Mode covered by Midwestern punks discovering Joy Division
    in their first summer of cheep beer and wide-eyed discontent.</p><p>
    
    Not mere pranksters-- despite the gleeful rocking horse winner of the album's
    cover-- Vaz don the obtuse black mask of gritty depression with pithy lyricism
    that tends to focus metaphorically on violent death, macular degeneration, bodily
    decomposition, and ghosts turning towards blindness. Obsessed, really, with ways
    of seeing, eyes are mentioned in the lyrics or titles of most of the fourteen
    tracks: in ""World of Death"", ""shadows freeze eyes upon your face"" and ""it's hard
    to breathe with crystal lungs,"" and in ""Fired Eye Quit"", ""daylight bends down on
    red knees"" while ""the twilight strains me in a gray sea.""</p><p>
    
    Purple prose and a sense of underground USA's formative years are decent
    punk-noir ingredients, and if stronger works like ""They've Won"" and ""Blue
    Lip Special"" were placed tightly on a seven-inch single with the mopey ""Fired
    Eye Quit"" as the weaker, half-tempo B-side, Vaz would escape my censure. But
    alas and alack! As with many of today's thinly conceived bands and records,
    the shit loses steam after its first four minutes, after which hook-free
    stinkers gum up the operation: ""White Wall""'s sub-par Pussy Galore overdrive,
    the Arab-on-Radar-in-spirit dreck of ""Give Us the Creeps"", and the spoken
    word Arab-Strap-sans-narrative-arc of ""Kill the Strings"" are relatively
    pointless throwbacks to, well... a lot of boring AmRep bands.</p><p>
    
    Relatively speaking, Vaz are best when tweaking the revved-up art-rock
    guitar swoons of days past. Any deviation from this tightly dated formula is
    a bore. While it pains me to diss a band who punningly name-drops John Fante,
    by the end of the set, Vaz is outed as the often tedious, randomly enjoyable
    band opening for your friends at CBGB's in 1997: they take too long tuning,
    plow through a much-unloved cover of ""Teenage Riot"", and fade out on a
    20-minute medley of Cows tunes.  You might find a fleeting moment to admire
    before passing out while talking to a business major from Hoboken who has a
    green mohawk and ""just loves"" the Didgits.  And then again, you might not.</p></div>"|8513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8513-dying-to-meet-you/|5.3|Brandon Stosuy

    sound to more avant-garde leanings.  It can either bring you critical acclaim and general acceptance from
    the populace (Andre 3000) or it can alienate your original fanbase without appealing to the new audience
    whose eye you'd hoped to capture (Common).  Cee-Lo's latest record, however, treads the line perfectly,
    allowing him to play by his own terms, while maintaining the kind of strong hooks, production, and songs
    that pretty much anyone can get into.</p><p>
    
    His solo debut, 2002's <i>Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections</i>, was solid but ultimately forgettable
    and singularly toned.  But Green seems to have focused on cohesion this time out, as this new collection of
    songs tie together nicely, despite the record's diverse melting pot of spoken word, R&amp;B;, rap and gospel.
    Those expecting the pensive introspection and homemade synth-hop of his debut should look elsewhere, as
    this record draws on his greatest strength: the excitable rhyme flow that initially made him stand out from
    the rest of the Goodie Mob.</p><p>
    
    Cee-Lo's most interesting aspect is his adaptable persona:  The way he shifts from an apologetic former
    gun-toting drug dealer to a discotheque lover man to a church preacher gives this album a ridiculous depth
    of replay.  And lyrically, he dominates much like he did on the Outkast side project Dungeon Family's <i>Even
    in Darkness</i>, spitting battle salvos (""I've been running since 'Rock Box'/ I've cocked glocks and locked
    blocks/ And rocked rocks in drop-tops"") and street knowledge (""When it hit ya, it usually hits somebody with
    ya/ Make 'em risk a total eclipse of the sun to get richer"") with the confidence of a man on a mission.</p><p>
    
    His mission statement is ""The Art of Noise"".  Produced by The Neptunes with background vocals from Pharrell,
    the track is equal parts <i>In Search Of...</i> snares, and the piano part from Jay-Z's ""Allure"", making
    for a minimalist exercise that burrows into your skull with its emphatic chorus.  Cee-Lo sounds as excited
    to have this beat as we are to hear him over it-- and he doesn't disappoint.  Employing his half-singing/half-rapping
    cadence, he draws attention instantly, asking the listener to ""Have mercy, if I seem to be heavy/ I don't
    mean to be heavy,"" as if asking for acceptance regardless of his many distinguished quirks.  Needless to
    say, in a post-""Hey Ya"" environment, a song like this could easily make a giant dent in the singles chart.</p><p>
    
    The playgrounds that this ""five-foot-six-inch god"" inhabits, for the first time, match his obvious technical
    proficiency, maintaining a general tone of futuristic chops and bombastic horns throughout the record that
    recall Lyrics Born's monster debut <i>Later That Day</i>.  Standouts include the Organized Noise-produced
    stuttering chopped toy piano and xylophone on ""Childz Play"", the shockingly original DJ Premier production
    of finger snaps and subtle cop-show sax on ""Evening News"", and the Roswell synth whistle, exploding black-college
    horn line and ""We Will Rock You"" stomp of ""Scrap Metal"".  The only drawbacks are the occasional disco and
    80s R&amp;B-inspired; cuts, as they fail to completely fit in context with the other beats.</p><p>
    
    Cee-Lo doesn't come out completely unscathed himself: At 18 tracks, there's a bit too much music here, and
    some tracks, like the occasional spoken word-style pieces, prevent the record from being the opus Cee-Lo is
    clearly capable of making.  But even with these minor faults, a happy medium is achieved-- especially given
    that the record contains only two skits (the ""Intro"" and ""Outro"", both roughly 20 seconds long).  Which leaves
    us with a strong experimental record that draws on Cee-Lo's malleable style of rap, staying deeply grounded
    in the Southern traditions that started his career even while he pushes the boundaries of convention, making
    for one of the year's strongest hip-hop albums to date.</p></div>"|1755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1755-cee-lo-green-is-the-soul-machine/|8.3|Rollie Pemberton

    omnipresence and paternal proselytizing of neo-superstar Jack White:  White co-produced their 2001 debut,
    <i>Lack of Communication</i>, offered the band a coveted opening slot on The White Stripes' European tour,
    and secured them a track on his fairly influential (and predictably retro-styled) compilation, <i>The
    Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit</i>.  It wasn't until late 2003 that White and The Von Bondies finally
    somersaulted out of smiley symbiosis-- in December, White engaged vocalist Jason Stollsteimer in a bizarre,
    bruise-heavy scrapple, mashing Stollsteimer's mug beyond recognition and earning them both a mess of press.
    (White's injury: an oddly apropos ""redness to the face."")</p><p>
    
    As 2004 rolled over, The Von Bondies seemed destined to ride out their fledgling career in the sidebars of
    American print mags, neatly framing glossy, art-heavy White Stripes features.  But <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i>,
    The Von Bondies' massive major label debut, sees the band clawing their way up from the footnotes, and
    cramming a splintered drumstick into an otherwise diminutive little-brother trajectory.  Entirely White-free,
    and produced by former Modern Lover and Talking Head Jerry Harrison, the album is crisp where you'd expect
    it to be crackly, billowing when you think it should whisper.  With huge, ballooning vocals and a
    shit-kicking rhythm section, the record consistently threatens to pop its own feeble seams; by carefully
    shuffling away from their past outings, The Von Bondies have produced a booming sonic statement that's
    far more glam than garage, and a lot less ""Detroit"" than we've been trained to expect.</p><p>
    
    From the chainsaw feedback of opener ""No Regrets"" to the scrappy punch of a blues-addled hidden track,
    <i>Pawn Shoppe</i> pummels unapologetically.  Despite their pristine Motor City pedigree, The Von Bondies
    sound as much like Danzig here as they do The Gories, as <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i> is riddled with walloping
    rock riffage.  Stollsteimer and guitarist Marcie Bolen drive their shit like it's stolen, ripping each
    song apart and kicking it to the floor; ""Broken Man"" sounds like all four members met up to pitch a
    simultaneous tantrum, pounding their instruments with unchecked, sweat-spewing fervor.  It's that kind of
    kinetic flailing that keeps <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i> afloat when the songwriting sags (see ""Tell Me What
    You See""), and ultimately rockets the record out of mediocrity and straight into the street.</p><p>
    
    Lead single ""C'mon C'mon"" is the album's goofiest and most instantly accessible track, with an undeniable
    chorus and plenty of quiet/loud flip-flopping.  ""Been Swank"", a kicky nod to Detroit scenester/Soledad
    Brother Ben Swank, sees Stollsteimer's vocals backed up by Carrie Smith's plodding bassline, his bold
    caterwauls spot-on, pitch-perfect, and completely insane.  ""Not That Social"" sees Smith swagger up to the
    mic, blankly admitting, ""I'm not that social/ I'm just a good drinker.""  Stollsteimer returns here for
    Pixies-esque harmonizing, but ""Not That Social"" is really Smith's moment alone: With expressionless
    abandon, she guides listeners through a steady, solo-heavy pop song, her monotone coo dripping with loads
    of delicious attitude.</p><p>
    
    The Von Bondies are most compelling when their hinges are a bit rusty, and Harrison's production, while
    impressively monumental, occasionally glosses a bit too hard, sacrificing some of the band's live spunk
    in favor of pure, colossal sound.  But what little <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i> lacks, it eagerly makes up for
    in hooks, drive and raw conviction.  It's a giant leap forward for The Von Bondies-- one that blasts them
    out of their homogeneous garage-rock roots and into their rightful position as amp-crashing successors to
    the indie rock thrones of Nation of Ulysses and Drive Like Jehu.</p></div>"|8491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8491-pawn-shoppe-heart/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    a Saturn advertisement on the strength of its first EP.  This may get the hand-wringers in a bind, but for
    PAS/CAL and ""The Bronze Beached Boys (Come On Let's Go)""-- the standout track from 2003's <i>The Handbag
    Memoirs</i> EP-- it's a well-deserved, welcome opportunity for their summery, refined sounds to reach a
    wider audience.  That track's lazy, hazy plea to leave your notebooks at home and ""be leaves pushed by the
    breeze"" perfectly captures the band's optimistic, open-armed approach to blissed-out pop.</p><p>
    
    That approach is delightfully continued on the Detroit band's second EP, the five-track <i>Oh Honey, We're
    Ridiculous</i>.  While many indie poppers stroll down the dead ends of traditionalism, aiming to either
    soothe the bruised souls of bedsit lonelyhearts or put the skip in your step with unabashed summery hooks,
    PAS/CAL manages to do a bit of both with panache and intelligence to spare.  The band's kaleidoscopic
    arrangements and deft tempo changes waft and swirl, nicely framing Casimer Pascal's soaring, feather-light
    falsetto but still allowing it plenty of room for acrobatics and elegance.  Not many bands can sashay from
    Morricone to doo-wop in less than a minute without snapping necks, but PAS/Cal manage the trick on ""What
    Do the American Girls Have on Jennifer JoJo?"".</p><p>
    
    They'll likely receive more than enough comparisons to the Beach Boys (as well as contemporaries such as
    The Shins), but that sort of misses the mark.  From pensive opener ""What Happened to the Sands""-- which
    starts with a few melodic tugs before accelerating into a whipsmart frenzy-- to ""The Handbag Memoirs"" and
    its acoustic approximation the low-rent style of <i>His 'n' Hers</i>-era Pulp, PAS/CAL sounds more like
    the humid haze of summer dusk rather than the scorching heat.  Fittingly, then, <i>Oh Honey</i> is full of
    missed opportunities and haunts from the past, moments in which the sun is set and yet one can still feel
    its heat.  From PAS/CAL's lament at the loss of the Sands Hotel and the exploitation of the 115-year old
    ""Poor Maude"", to a girlfriend's handbag full of ""notes [written] without me in mind"" and a litany of
    musical references, there's a tangible friction between the past and present.  Which is just as well,

In light of America's recent turmoil, eminent voices
    in the genre are using their influence to ignite a protest movement-- though maybe not the kind you were
    expecting: The new rock dissent is proudly apolitic, concerned more with its fashion statements and coolly
    apathetic poses than changing the system.  In short, it ain't your dad's counter-culture.</p><p>
    
    While we sit around waiting for the dancepunk answer to <i>Hair</i>, Trans Am have gathered the chutzpah
    to call out the indie messiahs on their shameful disinterest.  <i>Liberation</i> is the latest contribution
    to a burgeoning, as-yet undeclared genre of instrumental rock with a political message.  A scant handful of
    bands have made albums of this nature over the past few years, but their putative ""protests"" are often as
    ambiguous as a Bush State of the Union Address.  In lieu of lyrics, Godspeed You! Black Emperor drew a
    schematic diagram for their 2002 LP, <i>Yanqui U.X.O.</i>, detailing the intricate web of relations between
    the recording industry's major labels and a nuclear holocaust's worth of weapons manufacturers.  The results
    were, at best, lukewarm.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, creating an impacting political album without lyrics seems about as predestined to fail as an
    Israeli-Palenstinian peace negotiation.  As songwriters like Phil Ochs and Woody Guthrie established long
    ago, it takes the full brunt of articulate, meaningful lyrics to rile up any sort of populace, and that
    a movement is nothing without people behind it.  That, of course, hasn't deterred Trans Am, who go for the
    jugular on seventh album, <i>Liberation</i>.</p><p>
    
    Song titles like ""Uninvited Guest"", ""Divine Invasion"", ""Spike in Chatter"", and ""Total Information Awareness""
    seek to parody the Bush rhetoric of terror.  And if names like ""Idea Machine"" don't tip you off to the
    anti-war message, there are the vocoded voice samples of the president on ""Uninvited Guest"", which make
    it abundantly clear: ""Our commitment to weapons of mass destruction is America's tradition,"" ""The Iraqi
    people love their oppressors,"" etc.  This cut-up technique, of course, is awfully tired: bedroom novelty
    artists have been doing it virtually since Bush took office.  The difference is, Trans Am aren't laughing,
    and juxtaposed against their demonic synths, the speech is awfully disturbing.  Unfortunately, ""disturbing""
    is hardly the mark of a successful protest album.  Any music that has ever contributed to political upheaval
    has done so by way of emotional appeal.  In that sense, <i>Liberation</i> is closer in attitude to propaganda
    than an impassioned plea for humanity: It fails to invoke the necessary compassion that might compel us to
    act.</p><p>
    
    Politics aside, <i>Liberation</i> does rock pretty fierce.  Like the country it recriminates, the album
    sounds intentionally monolithic.  Dank, unfeeling synthesizers and bombastic drum sounds conjure harsh
    futurism, while songs like ""Idea Machine"" and ""Total Information Awareness"" make up for their didacticism
    by just plain shredding.  Unlike other instrumental soapboxers, Trans Am shun a barren, apocalyptic sound
    in favor of something tighter and more claustrophobic, and the result is more effective for it.  Rather
    than creating a sense of imminent destruction and finality, <i>Liberation</i> ensnares you in an enduring
    hell, its unmistakable new-wave sheen invoking the political ghosts of the Reagan era and recalling the
    20th century's legacy of totalitarian prophesy.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, the album offers few musical thrills beyond that, and the disappointment is doubled once one
    considers the record's intended impact.  Trans Am's intentions, like all the best ones, are noble and
    unrealistic.  And while it's nice to see them getting serious for a change, <i>Liberation</i> will only
    serve to bolster the argument of those who contend that it's impossible to make effective political music
    without lyrics, and help others to appreciate the work of the past's truer crusaders.</p></div>"|8139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8139-liberation/|6.0|Sam Ubl

The ""Norfolk""
    is Norfolk, Virginia, still one of the country's busiest ports, and in the rail line's pre-Civil War
    nascence, the ""Western"" was western Virginia, the Appalachian regions that otherwise took days to reach.
    Over time, like any well-run business, Norfolk &amp; Western expanded, buying other rail lines and extending
    its passenger and freight services across the Eastern half of the country.  The company became something
    of an icon for American ingenuity and progress, a footnote to the larger American experience.  And then,
    in 1998, after more than a century, it ceased to exist, subsumed by the financial interests of larger
    competitors, and gone without fanfare, leaving behind little more than appreciative websites set up by
    admirers.</p><p>
    
    The railway also left its name to an unassuming Northwestern songwriter named Adam Selzer, whose quiet
    whisper of a voice delivers his songs of meditative resignation with a solemn, understated grace.  Selzer's
    project got off to an inauspicious start in the same year that the Norfolk &amp; Western gave way to the new
    economy, with a Spartan EP called a <i>Collection of Norfolk &amp; Western</i> that showed some promise but
    didn't quite fulfill it.  Since then, Selzer's thrown his recordings open to an ever-widening group of
    collaborators, including M. Ward and Calexico's Joey Burns, and as his sound has expanded, he's staked
    out a nice piece of atmospheric folk ground for himself.  His two full-lengths thus far have worked on
    incorporating a wide range of textures into his simple songs, and this one continues the trend.</p><p>
<i>Dusk in Cold Parlours</i> wastes no time in attesting to the aptness of its title with ""A Marriage
    Proposal"".  Accompanied by banjo, piano, buzzing organ, brushed drums and watercolor electric guitar,
    the song is a stark reading of Selzer's poetic take on a couple's engagement despite their uncertainty
    of the future.  The sound is dusty and sepia-toned, a sound the band takes to another level entirely a
    few songs later on ""Terrified"", whose spacious corners are awash in vibraphone, B3 and Raymond Richards'
    gorgeous pedal steel.  Multi-instrumentalist Rachel Blumberg offers breathy backing vocals that perfectly
    meld with Selzer's own voice-- her impact on the album as a whole is inestimable, as she not only provides
    all of the relaxed drumming that drives it, but also plays about half a dozen other instruments, from piano
    to tubular bells.</p><p>
    
    The ensemble offers two excellent instrumentals to fully flesh the mood they're going for; the first,
    ""Kelly Bauman"", is a cockeyed swirl of melting carnival organ and M. Ward's trembling, immediately
    recognizable guitar playing.  The other instrumental, ""A Hymnal"", belongs to guest cellist Anna Fritz,
    whose portamento flights are the most sensual thing on the album.</p><p>
    
    One thing the instrumentals make plain is the band's sense of dynamic interplay, perhaps the single
    greatest element of their success-- the music breathes and is always in the midst of a rise or a fall,
    and it turns songs that might otherwise sound pedestrian into something much greater.  <i>Dusk in Cold
    Parlours</i> is the kind of album that rewards multiple listens, revealing details slowly but surely,
    and once it captures you, it's hard to escape its grasp.  But then, it's hard to imagine why you'd want
    to.</p></div>"|5889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5889-dusk-in-cold-parlours/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    Berliniamsburg.  Having morphed from a diminutive pupa into a full-grown, sex-positive gadfly since her
    first recordings with Blectum from Blechdom, she's now spreading her wings (and legs) and confidently
    striking out on her own.  Her identity carves itself: <i>Bitches Without Britches</i> sounds like the
    creation of an bipolar NYU freshman who, frustrated by the rigidity of her classmates' buttoned-down
    conformity, watched full seasons of <i>The Simple Life</i> and <i>Rich Girls</i> for inspiration, revolted
    against her parents, popular culture and democracy, and is now living out her Dr. Jekyll/Ms. Hyde fantasy
    at subway stops and bodegas between Lorimer and Canarsie.  The trade-off is that in place of the Pretty
    Girl Conspiracy Academy now stands the Electroclash Fashionista Cadre.</p><p>
    
    Sure, this album reeks of the elitism it putatively refutes.  Once it gets past its saccharine absurdity,
    the electro-torch song ""Use Your Heart as a Telephone"" would sound equally at home at Marie's Crisis as it
    does at Luxx.  One dystopian industrial lovesong later, Blechdom deconstructs the consumerist/hygiene
    nexus, each new product or surgery relieving the user/recipient of certain duties and concerns, and further
    complicating the crux of the postmodern condition (""Binaca"").  The frenetic abuse of presets and Reds
    makes each song sound like a botched overdose, a suicide incurring unconsciousness without fatality. ""I
    Am Nast-ay"" sounds like an intellectually honest take on Kylie Minogue, and it's imaginable that one could
    sync the ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" video with this song.  Elsewhere, the exhibitionist ""Boob-B-Q""
    sounds like a Pasolini orgy complete with ""dick-rowaves"" for his pleasure.</p><p>
    
    Still, this all brings us back to the broader question of whether electroclash really accomplishes all it
    could.  The genre's shameless indulgence in excess and shopping not only reinforces the sectarianism of
    pop culture that it should be subverting, but <i>relies</i> on it, making the music's absurdist,
    hypersexualized drama a novelty.  In that spirit, <i>Bitches Without Britches</i> won't convert any
    nonbelievers, but the choir will gleefully singing its praises anyway.  Regardless, the record is
    extraordinarily danceable and worth a number of good laughs, if not as many listens.  But be forewarned:
    In 20 years' time, you'll be persuaded to pick up revivalist comps of this kind of stuff and love it.
    Don't wait for the boxset!</p></div>"|797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/797-bitches-without-britches/|7.5|JT Ramsay

    short of brilliance should save themselves the trauma and skip right to <i>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</i>'s
    seventh track, ""Such Large Portions!"", a serene rocker packed with pitch-bent guitars and acrobatic drumming;
    or crank up the cacophonous, multitracked percussion of the Breeders-esque ""The Western Prayer"".  Either of
    these songs could allow a person to maintain, indefinitely, that Clark is among indie music's great talents,
    so long as they never delved into the rest of this record.</p><p>
    The band, however, have made the regrettable decision of opening their long-awaited debut full-length with
    ""Goodnight for Real"", a listless jingle on which Chad Clark sings, ""There's a band on stage tonight/ Every
    note they play turns its back to you.""  It's a sentiment that pretty much sums things up for fans of Clark's
    former band, whose emotional doomsaying and snappy minor-key geometry produced one of the best post-punk
    albums of the last decade.  Unfortunately, all that made <i>Con Art</i> so effective is lost on <i>The
    Unsustainable Lifestyle</i>, save an overbearing cynicism, which, lacking an apposite musical backing,
    quickly grows tiresome.</p><p>
    Since the late 90s, the once-influential Dischord Records harvest has proven the seminal D.C. punk label
    hell-bent on one goal: capturing that never-influential J. Robbins sound.  So far, the label has been
    fairly successful at putting forth a sturdy lineup of D.C. post-punk prospects who, with proper guidance,
    may one day ascend to great heights.  But what they seem to have failed to appreciate is that each band
    has a vastly different array of talents, and whether through mismanagement or the bands' own aspirations
    to a preconceived ""Dischord sound"", their creativity has too often been stifled.</p><p>
    The Beauty Pill, thanks in part to their high-profile ancestry and their solid 2001 EP, <i>Cigarette Girl
    from the Future</i>, have been billed as the most promising of the lot.  But expectation is a cynic's death
    knell, and on <i>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</i>, the band cuddles up to the safety of innocuous clichés.
    Instead of tearing loose here, The Beauty Pill elect to bottle their ample cynicism, and any emotional
    impact is lost to a relentless finery.  Vocalists Clark and Rachel Burke often struggle to hit their notes,
    but rather than conceal a limited vocal range with flanger effects or high-volume ululations, they hog the
    spotlight with ambiguous verses.  Perhaps most estranging is the caustic chirpiness of ""Won't You Be Mine"",
    which opens with a sample of Mr. Rogers offering friendship, and vaguely hints at a discourse on race
    relations.  The chorus asks the question, ""What I really want to know is/ Are you my nigga?"" with delineation
    offered only in lyrics like, ""The leash is loose enough to feel like autonomy/ The milk's watered down in
    the tenement kitchenette.""  Another misstep lies in the band's apparent unwillingness to attempt vocal
    harmonies: Possessing a halfway competent duo of vocalists is a rare blessing that The Beauty Pill sorely
    squander.</p><p>
    The Beauty Pill are a surgically precise band whose compositions perform limber arabesques without losing
    a step, and Clark's homespun production accentuates every contortion.  But then, that's Dischord in a
    nutshell.  What was novel and exciting about Jawbox and Burning Airlines a decade ago is quickly growing
    stale in modern incarnations like this one.  For a label that once prided itself on the spit-in-the-wind
    innovation of bands like Fugazi, Minor Threat, Jawbox, Rites of Spring, and Shudder to Think, its recent
    catalog's homogeneity is disconcerting.  I'd be lying if I claimed not to enjoy J. Robbins' earlier work,
    but his production style was never more than a pedestal for adroit musicianship; it's feckless of a record
    like <i>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</i> to cling to ghosts when the musicians behind it have proven
    themselves capable of so much more.</p></div>"|614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/614-the-unsustainable-lifestyle/|5.7|Sam Ubl

He's weathered the rise and fall of Britpop with a creative
    and relatively daring body of work (at least, relative to that of your average Gallagher brother), and, in
    the face of losing longtime musical partner and melodic powerhouse Graham Coxon, even led Blur to new
    heights in 2003 with <i>Think Tank</i>, which pushed the band in brave new directions that frequently
    echoed his dabblings with Gorillaz and Mali Music.  But as much as the fates have smiled on Blur's frontman,
    no amount of conceit warrants the release of half-baked ideas masquerading as songs, even if that release
    is mercifully limited to a homegrown 10-inch vinyl pressing of 5,000 copies.</p><p>
    The 14 tracks that constitute Albarn's <i>Democrazy</i> are symbolic of both his creative process and
    celebrity hubris.  Recorded in hotel rooms during Blur's 2003 <i>Think Tank</i> tour, this record offers
    naked representations of what may one day become fleshed-out tracks for any one of Albarn's pet projects.
    Composed principally of canned beats, acoustic guitar, Casio synths and Albarn's trademark whine, the
    songs vary between flat instrumentals (""Reedz"", ""Saz Theory Book""), truncated melodies (""Half a Song"",
    ""I Need a Gun""), and loop-centric vamps (""A Rappy Song"", ""Five Star Life""), most of which are less
    adventurous than the average self-produced download from the heyday of mp3.com.</p><p>
    A few of the stronger tracks manage to approach full-blown song status, but fall short for one reason or
    another.  With ""Sub Species of an American Day"", Albarn zings us Yanks with an ever-so-biting commentary
    on ambivalent American culture, pointing out our ironic simultaneous love for both exercise and leisure
    (touché, my limey friend-- Albarn 1, America 0); ""I Miss You"", at best, could have made for a subpar
    <i>Great Escape</i> B-side; and the pleasantly simple acoustic strum of ""American Welfare Poem"" is blown
    by Albarn's mumbled, extemporaneously wandering vocals, producing a half-song both uninventive and
    inaccessible.  <i>Democrazy</i>'s strongest moment comes with the hideously titled ""Gotta Get Down with
    the Passing of Time"", which, not coincidentally, is the closest thing here to a fully realized song.
    Curiously, the track seems to owe a debt to early Beat Happening, and in spite of its pithy lyrics,
    remains a brief respite from overwhelming mediocrity.  However, it's been sequenced as the album's
    penultimate track, which makes it an unfortunate case of too little, too late.</p><p>
    The release of such an incomplete and stillborn collection begs the question: Who really cares about Albarn's
    hotel room musings?  It's not as though there's a shortage of Albarn releases in the world, and besides,
    his omnipresence neutralizes any mystique that might kindle interest in how a Blur song is born.  Indeed,
    he's already recorded such a wealth of great material that no mystique remains, leaving no real reason for
    anyone-- including the most dedicated fan-- to seek out these poorly produced musical shreds.</p></div>"|99.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/99-democrazy/|3.2|Jedediah Gilchrist

I only ask because it seems fairly obvious that Echo &amp; The Bunnymen were a band christened during a period of impaired judgment. I can see it sounding funny on a drunk Saturday evening, but to seriously go through with it and start releasing albums under the name The Bunnymen (Echo was their drum machine) is just beyond reason, not only because it's a silly name, but because it's a name that engenders skepticism immediately when you say it. I can't count the number of times I've found myself saying, ""No, seriously, they're really quite good once you get past the name,"" to someone unfamiliar with their work. And the fact is, they really were a good band in their day (and actually still are in their reconstituted form today), but it's hard to find anyone who really takes them all that seriously.</p>
<p>Granted, there are reasons aside from their moniker that people might shy away from Echo &amp; The Bunnymen. Ian McCulloch's (melo)dramatic, psychedelic crooner vocals and frequent forays into quasi-religious lyrical imagery are something you just have to accept without overthinking it, but the fact is that this band made that kind of stuff sound great. The Liverpool quartet created an absolutely huge sound on record to match their frontman's flair for grandiosity, and they bore it to you on the backs of bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete DeFreitas, a rhythm section whose sheer power and imagination is chronically overlooked.</p>
<p>Listening back to the band's five original albums on Rhino's excellently remastered reissue series in an age when rhythm is returning to the fore of the underground, it's hard not to notice just how charged and visceral some of these records were. The epitome is ""Back of Love"", from 1983's <i>Porcupine</i>, an album that initially wasn't even released stateside, but in hindsight proves to be the band's definitive statement. ""Back of Love"" is simply the astonishing highlight of the group's career, featuring frenetic drumming, laser-focused basswork and Will Sergeant's choppy, heavily delayed guitar chords. The way the music drops out of the treble range and yields to a deep, miles-thick synthesizer groan behind McCulloch's frantically shouted chorus is disorienting and breathtaking-- it's an anthem for adrenal glands.</p>
<p><i>Porcupine</i> was loaded with songs like that, unfolding with the cascading stomp of ""The Cutter"", one of the band's best singles with its weird, elastic synthesizer melodies. While it showcases some of The Bunnymen's most aggressively rhythmic material, though, <i>Porcupine</i> also houses its share of strange, abstract material such as the title track and ""My White Devil"", songs that lurch on Spartan rhythms and mix disparate textures like Spanish guitar and cravenly artificial synthesizer, a fact that's led many to inaccurately characterize the album as the band's ""difficult"" record, something it's really not.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not as straightforward as its two predecessors, 1980's <i>Crocodiles</i> and 1981's <i>Heaven Up Here</i>. The Bunnymen hit the ground running, and their debut album is a stunning statement of purpose, with McCulloch already in full dramatic swing and the band at their most straightforward-- any band that uses as much reverb as this one is hard to label ""raw,"" but ""Pride"" and ""Do It Clean"" nonetheless hit hard, and ""Rescue"", with Sergeant's massive opening riff, manages to turn a chorus that should sound like a plea into a rallying cry. <i>Heaven Up Here</i> ranges more widely, and makes motions toward the slightly funkier band that turned up on <i>Porcupine</i> on the aptly titled ""Show of Strength"" and ""With a Hip"", while also stretching out their theatrical side on the slow-burning, flute-laden ""All My Colours"" (also frequently referred to as ""Zimbo"" for McCulloch's weird, droning nonsense refrain).</p>
<p>The Bunnymen mellowed to a degree for their fourth album, the widely acclaimed <i>Ocean Rain</i>, but all it did was cause them to get weirder. The album is stuffed with queasy midtempo tracks and bizarre orchestration, but it's by no means impenetrable. The strangest song, ""Yo Yo Man"" limps through skewed verses, building to McCulloch's refrain, ""I'm the yo yo man/ Always up and down,"" which triggers a startling interjection by vigorously bowed strings, percussion and Sergeant's spastic guitar. Most of the album is considerably less warped, but a chilly, haunted ambience settles over the whole recording like a fine dust.</p>
<p>The creative strain of recording <i>Ocean Rain</i> took a lot out of the band, and it took them three years to deliver a follow-up, in the form of their self-titled record, which is as odd a collision of commercial sensibility and inescapable weirdness as you're likely to find. The band's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out when they splattered the hook-heavy reverb bomb ""Lips Like Sugar"" all over American college radio, but the backward guitar solo on ""Lost and Found"" is more representative of the album as a whole. The sunnier production watered the band's sound down a bit, but they still managed to turn out ""All in Your Mind"", a throbbing beast of a pop song swimming in twitching guitar and aggressive synth bass, and god, that is so obviously Ray Manzarek of The Doors playing organ on ""Bedbugs and Ballyhoo"" that you don't even need the liners to clue you in-- it works almost purely on improbability.</p>
<p>The folks at Rhino have done an admirable job of expanding each album to include relevant bonus material, trucking out standout B-sides ""Fuel"" and ""Angels &amp; Devils"" and some bone-crushing early live tracks, but they've also somehow managed to leave off ""The Puppet"" completely, and non-album singles ""Never Stop"" and ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"" are represented in atypical versions, which smacks of needless obscurantism. Still, these albums deserved another look, and the reissues offer a good one. If you've never heard The Bunnymen before, their career overview, <i>Songs to Learn &amp; Sing</i>, is still the best introduction, but you can't go too wrong diving right into <i>Porcupine</i>. Either way, The Bunnymen are a band worth exploring-- you know, once you get past the name.</p></div>"|11727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11727-crocodiles-heaven-up-here-porcupine-ocean-rain-echo-the-bunnymen/|8.2|Joe Tangari

Ian McCulloch's (melo)dramatic, psychedelic crooner vocals and frequent forays into quasi-religious lyrical imagery are something you just have to accept without overthinking it, but the fact is that this band made that kind of stuff sound great. The Liverpool quartet created an absolutely huge sound on record to match their frontman's flair for grandiosity, and they bore it to you on the backs of bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete DeFreitas, a rhythm section whose sheer power and imagination is chronically overlooked.</p>
<p>Listening back to the band's five original albums on Rhino's excellently remastered reissue series in an age when rhythm is returning to the fore of the underground, it's hard not to notice just how charged and visceral some of these records were. The epitome is ""Back of Love"", from 1983's <i>Porcupine</i>, an album that initially wasn't even released stateside, but in hindsight proves to be the band's definitive statement. ""Back of Love"" is simply the astonishing highlight of the group's career, featuring frenetic drumming, laser-focused basswork and Will Sergeant's choppy, heavily delayed guitar chords. The way the music drops out of the treble range and yields to a deep, miles-thick synthesizer groan behind McCulloch's frantically shouted chorus is disorienting and breathtaking-- it's an anthem for adrenal glands.</p>
<p><i>Porcupine</i> was loaded with songs like that, unfolding with the cascading stomp of ""The Cutter"", one of the band's best singles with its weird, elastic synthesizer melodies. While it showcases some of The Bunnymen's most aggressively rhythmic material, though, <i>Porcupine</i> also houses its share of strange, abstract material such as the title track and ""My White Devil"", songs that lurch on Spartan rhythms and mix disparate textures like Spanish guitar and cravenly artificial synthesizer, a fact that's led many to inaccurately characterize the album as the band's ""difficult"" record, something it's really not.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not as straightforward as its two predecessors, 1980's <i>Crocodiles</i> and 1981's <i>Heaven Up Here</i>. The Bunnymen hit the ground running, and their debut album is a stunning statement of purpose, with McCulloch already in full dramatic swing and the band at their most straightforward-- any band that uses as much reverb as this one is hard to label ""raw,"" but ""Pride"" and ""Do It Clean"" nonetheless hit hard, and ""Rescue"", with Sergeant's massive opening riff, manages to turn a chorus that should sound like a plea into a rallying cry. <i>Heaven Up Here</i> ranges more widely, and makes motions toward the slightly funkier band that turned up on <i>Porcupine</i> on the aptly titled ""Show of Strength"" and ""With a Hip"", while also stretching out their theatrical side on the slow-burning, flute-laden ""All My Colours"" (also frequently referred to as ""Zimbo"" for McCulloch's weird, droning nonsense refrain).</p>
<p>The Bunnymen mellowed to a degree for their fourth album, the widely acclaimed <i>Ocean Rain</i>, but all it did was cause them to get weirder. The album is stuffed with queasy midtempo tracks and bizarre orchestration, but it's by no means impenetrable. The strangest song, ""Yo Yo Man"" limps through skewed verses, building to McCulloch's refrain, ""I'm the yo yo man/ Always up and down,"" which triggers a startling interjection by vigorously bowed strings, percussion and Sergeant's spastic guitar. Most of the album is considerably less warped, but a chilly, haunted ambience settles over the whole recording like a fine dust.</p>
<p>The creative strain of recording <i>Ocean Rain</i> took a lot out of the band, and it took them three years to deliver a follow-up, in the form of their self-titled record, which is as odd a collision of commercial sensibility and inescapable weirdness as you're likely to find. The band's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out when they splattered the hook-heavy reverb bomb ""Lips Like Sugar"" all over American college radio, but the backward guitar solo on ""Lost and Found"" is more representative of the album as a whole. The sunnier production watered the band's sound down a bit, but they still managed to turn out ""All in Your Mind"", a throbbing beast of a pop song swimming in twitching guitar and aggressive synth bass, and god, that is so obviously Ray Manzarek of The Doors playing organ on ""Bedbugs and Ballyhoo"" that you don't even need the liners to clue you in-- it works almost purely on improbability.</p>
<p>The folks at Rhino have done an admirable job of expanding each album to include relevant bonus material, trucking out standout B-sides ""Fuel"" and ""Angels &amp; Devils"" and some bone-crushing early live tracks, but they've also somehow managed to leave off ""The Puppet"" completely, and non-album singles ""Never Stop"" and ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"" are represented in atypical versions, which smacks of needless obscurantism. Still, these albums deserved another look, and the reissues offer a good one. If you've never heard The Bunnymen before, their career overview, <i>Songs to Learn &amp; Sing</i>, is still the best introduction, but you can't go too wrong diving right into <i>Porcupine</i>. Either way, The Bunnymen are a band worth exploring-- you know, once you get past the name.</p></div>"|11727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11727-crocodiles-heaven-up-here-porcupine-ocean-rain-echo-the-bunnymen/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    what Will Oldham was up to, even a decade after having first been mystified by his music.  Brashly
    assuming the seasick music I'd heard that night (courtesy of ""Prince"" and ""Cockfighter,"" aka Matt Sweeney)
    to be a taster for his soundtrack work for British director Jason Massot's documentary about sailors in the
    bustling Rotterdam seaport.  The newswire quoted me blabbering expertly on ""songs about spanking, donkeys
    (but not spanking donkeys), and allusions to creatures such as the 'Super Wolf' and 'Panther Girl'.""  I'd
    asserted that there couldn't <i>possibly</i> be more songs about sailors and the sea.</p><p>
    
    Was I ever wrong.  Not only were the dozen songs I'd heard completely new, but none of them referenced
    the soundtrack for <i>Seafarers</i> at all, save the fashion sense of the sardine-packed Williamsburg
    crowd itself.  Sailor is the new Camo: Will-fully-induced scurvy, scruffy pirate beards, ironic bicep-tual
    hula girl tats, moth-riddled wooly peacoats, salty squints, and crooked seamen caps are replacing Radar
    hats, olive-green fatigues, boutique-bought dogtags, and $100 paratrooper pants at a frightening pace.
    Again, Oldham surfs ahead of the Zeitgeist, much as he did by anticipating skillet-licking necrofolkia
    with <i>There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You</i> and <i>Days in the Wake</i>.</p><p>
    
    Like Oldham's previous seafaring soundtrack work, these four songs, dedicated to rough-hewn human flotsam
    from Sweden, Polynesia, Croatia and Nigeria, are instrumental-- Oldham, brother Paul and David Bird carving
    out four different variations on a melancholic theme.  Not quite sea shanties, the gently finger-flicked
    notes sway to and fro, creaking like frayed ropes and salt-cracked lips on a stilled day, destinationless,
    and surrounded by the infinite waters.  Each character bobs and pitches on the slight fluctuations of
    shimmering saline, their movements imperceptible yet in motion.  The order of notes is uncertain and
    always changing, leaving me to wonder if the characters are but <i>Abyss</i>-like apparitions raised
    from the sea itself.</p><p>
    
    That said, the little nuances of the Oldhams' and Bird's playing are what keep the notes afloat on the
    despondent, drunken music bed, and their soft focus makes for more return listens than Oldham's past scores
    for <i>The Broken Giant</i> or <i>Slitch</i>.  The musicians enter in about a minute apart on ""Sapele"",
    setting up slight ripples between each others' notes while open strings and tube-warmed amps buzz towards
    the horizon, accompanying protagonist ""Lars"".  The smallest of sounds, such as the wheezing of air organ
    and ungrounded fuzz bubble up on ""Emmanuel"" and shine as beacons, their minimal gestures conveying the sad
    depths that lie beneath the sailors' brutish exteriors.  Could Will Oldham be the next Jean Genet, using
    the fragile-feminine to trace the savage-masculine, or does this just reinforce that incidental music is
    the next post-rock?</p></div>"|5977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5977-seafarers-music-ep/|8.0|Andy Beta

    smoking cigarettes in front of his Bristol home.  Their conversations quickly turned to collaboration, and
    within a few years time, Topley-Bird was not only the sweetly vocal foil to the blunted chaos of Tricky's
    still superb <i>Maxinquaye</i>, she was the mother of his daughter.  As the pair's romantic relationship
    and creative synergy disintegrated over the ensuing years, the release of her own solo record seemed
    inevitable.  And yet, even as Bristol's trip-hop gave way to Morcheeba's slip-slop, Topley-Bird remained
    out of the picture.</p><p>
    
    So how odd that she would return in 2003, eight years removed from <i>Maxinquaye</i>, with a record that
    mostly sounds, well, four years too late.  <i>Quixotic</i> is a lot of things, but, in engaging in exactly
    the kind of non-committal genre-hopping and saccharine candy-kissing that practically defined post-Bristol
    also-rans like Mono, Hooverphonic and Morcheeba, it's mostly just dated.</p><p>
    
    Topley-Bird's eagerness to distance herself from the billowing dope smoke of those early Tricky benchmarks
    is evident within <i>Quixotic</i>'s first two minutes.  We're eased in via ""Intro""-- a swinging a cappella
    track that's more <i>O Brother</i> than <i>Pre-Millennium</i>-- before Josh Homme and Mark Lanegan show up
    to draw some lumbering stoner guitar shapes on the diluted rock exercise ""Need One"".  With its clumsy
    riffola and arrhythmic overproduction, ""Need One"" conjures up the precise strain of the Hollywood
    rock/electronica hybrid that was perfect for end credits in movies about things like cyberpunks and
    stolen identities, but nowhere else.</p><p>
    
    The Morcheeba similarities rear their head again on ""Anything"", a supple acoustic ballad that gives way to
    a jumble of slide guitars, quivering synth bits and widescreen beats before collapsing in a hush of polite
    reverb.  With its shadowy melody and lovely key change, ""Anything"" is by no stretch a terrible song, but
    it's difficult to listen to without feeling like you've heard it before.  ""Soul Food"", with its warm Rhodes
    keyboards, library music string pieces and old soul accoutrements, is arguably even more derivative, yet
    thanks to its rolling arrangements and Topley-Bird's gloriously unhurried delivery, it's handily the album's
    standout track.</p><p>
    
    Things get patchier from here on out.  The bluesy, emaciated drone of ""Lullaby"", the awful space-rock whoosh
    of ""I Still Feel"", and the frankly inexplicable punk thrash of ""I Wanna Be There"" all seem to exist as
    afterthoughts.  There are other highlights, mainly in the form of the shuddering drum workout of ""Ragga""
    and the tousled Sunday morning sway of ""Lying"", but even those feel like small victories in the context of
    this disappointing aesthetic misfire.</p><p>
    
    As ever, Topley-Bird's voice continues to be a strange and beautiful thing, but it's admittedly less strange
    and less beautiful when framed against this hopelessly warmed over setting.  Although I can't quite figure
    out what she could've done to produce the distance and the renewal she so obviously requires, I remain
    fairly certain that making <i>Even Bigger Calm</i> is probably not the way out.  Of Bristol, a typecasting
    quandary, or anywhere.</p></div>"|8255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8255-quixotic/|5.9|Mark Pytlik

    flesh on a balding, middle-aged man.  Its ten songs retread the same ground covered on <i>All This Sounds
    Gas</i>, but where those songs sounded like a rehash of Scott Kannberg's contribution to Pavement (which
    wasn't so bad), <i>Monsoon</i> reminds us why he contributed his own material so infrequently.  Without
    Pavement's alchemy, Preston School of Industry lacks those inimitable aspects of amateurism, nuance and
    play.  Where Pavement rooftop-gambled in musical crapshoots, Kannberg's solo routine plays it close to
    the vest, folding when the stakes get high.  And this game's being played for penny candy.</p><p>
    Kannberg has functioned as Pavement's Jimmy Carter since their breakup in '99, crafting a legacy for the
    band while his role in the band itself becomes less clear.  He shepherded Lance Bangs' <i>Slow Century</i>
    past Stephen Malkmus' disinterest; he's also the primary force behind a forthcoming <i>Crooked Rain</i>
    reissue.  Kannberg's role as an archivist and a true friend to fans remains one of unvarnished good will,
    and for that we should be grateful.  But this album sounds like it was recorded and released as a favor
    from someone at the label.  Truth is, the lighter that ignited <i>All This Sounds Gas</i> is long out of
    butane.</p><p>
    The record begins harmlessly enough, for better or worse.  ""The Furnace Sun"" would be right at home on Old
    97's <i>Fight Songs</i>-- it seems that all of Kannberg's guitars are stuck on twang settings.  His reaching
    vocal on ""Walk of a Gurl"" sounds like a Counting Crows outtake.  ""Caught in the Rain"" is an innocuous pop
    ditty, but would've been better with a piña colada.  ""Line It Up"" begins with the same sexy-voiced nonsense
    that found its way onto <i>All This Sounds Gas</i>, except this time it's truly nonsense instead of ""we
    know that you like us"" repeated ad nauseum.  Kannberg's voice renders every song nearly indistinguishable,
    each one a faceless victim laid out on the slab in this musical morgue.  Not even Wilco can save him on
    the collaborative ""Get Your Crayons Out"".</p><p>
    If <i>All This Sounds Gas</i> was Spiral Stairs aping George Harrison, then is <i>Monsoon</i> his <i>Ocean
    Rain</i>?  Or does it speak volumes about his ego, like Matador's Louis XIV, ""Apres moi, le deluge!""  If
    anything, this album proves at least two old adages: ""When it rains, it pours"" and ""Fool me once, shame on
    you; fool me twice, shame on me.""  And I'm so easily fooled.</p></div>"|6463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6463-monsoon/|5.0|JT Ramsay

In <em>Lynch on Lynch</em>, he told Chris Rodley, ""Whenever you
    can build sheds, you've got it made.  As soon as you capture some space and design how the shape of it is,
    mood starts occurring, light starts playing on the wall, and just to see it happening is unbelievable!""  I
    remember another interview with Lynch where he talked about his love of forgotten spaces, places like
    utility closets, the area beneath a flight of stairs in an industrial building, and so on.  What's
    interesting about the unexamined corners Lynch describes is that they have an ambience that comes from
    the most basic elements.  Walls, floor and light combine to create a feeling, instantly.</p><p>
    
    Something similar happens with sound.  The way ductwork in an old building groans, the buzz of florescent
    lights, the rattle of a loose shutter, plumbing gurgling somewhere a few floors away.  When I'm in a
    certain state of mind, I can fixate on these sounds, what filmmakers call ""room tone,"" and let my mind
    wander.  Swedish sound artist B.J. Nilsen, who also records as Hazard, apparently lives inside the sonic
    details of our everyday lives.  Previous releases include <i>Land</i>, <i>Wind</i>, and <i>Wood</i>, all
    of which include, in part, processed recordings of the things described.  Nilsen performed at the Vienna
    Opera House at a Touch event curated by Christian Fennesz (on a bill that [drool] included Fennesz and
    Philip Jeck), and <i>Live at Konzerthaus, Vienna 06_12_03</i> is a recording of his set.</p><p>
    
    The single 38-minute piece begins outdoors, with field recordings of thunder folded in on themselves, so
    the crashes and sub-bass rumbles happen with man-made frequency.  Gradually, an industrial palette rises
    and overtakes the natural sounds.  Nilsen is a whiz with atmosphere, creating held tones that blend
    perfectly with whatever ambient sound happens to meet them.  I listened to this set at a medium level in
    my apartment, and it was difficult to tell where the recording left off and the world around me began.  It
    was like my living space (which was admittedly a bit noisier than usual-- with the warm weather came more
    sound from the street) was engaged in a duet with Nilsen.  The bus offered an even more interesting effect,
    and the grind of the coach engine slipped perfectly inside the music's whisper and hum.</p><p>
    
    Rest assured, though, that <i>Live at Konzerthaus, Vienna 06_12_03</i> is fantastic on its own at high
    volume, when nothing else but its rapturous drones can be heard.  Field recordings come and go-- sounds of
    wind, buzzing bees, that sort of thing-- but the soul of the record is the subtle purr of vibrating metal.
    Gradually, the sound field becomes more dense and the textures more insistent.  High-end static starts to
    creep in around the 20-minute mark, and the music develops a disorienting, psychedelic swirl.  Over the
    last seven minutes, Nilsen erects a wall of pipe organ drone, pulled from material used to create ""Breathe"",
    his contribution to the Touch compilation <i>Spire: Organ Works Past, Present &amp; Future</i>. It's an
    appropriate ending to an intense ride.</p></div>"|5888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5888-live-at-konzerthaus-vienna-06_12_03/|8.2|Mark Richardson

Even as I flinch writing something so ridden with cliché, its annoyingly
    enduring truth rips my good intentions to shreds.  This is a by-product of clarity, of waking up, and a
    built-in mantra for growing up, just like you probably heard your mom say when the ice cream melted or you
    got caught with pot under your bed.  It's just a stupid part of life, like all the other clichés, but to
    see it in action is still traumatic.</p><p>
    I can almost guarantee that Tom Jenkinson is still living to piss off lots of people-- isn't there another
    tired axiom about a rose by another other name?  The thing that gets me about him is that, as a musician,
    he's obviously got the talent and muse to do pretty much whatever he wants.  Witness him playing jazz drums
    over a stuttered breakbeat, filling in all the open spaces with bass riffs I could swear were piped in from
    a Brand X album.  But at the end of the day, for Squarepusher and every other musical idiot savant, the
    power of people (and their ears) reigns supreme.  When I say all good things come to an end, I'm referring
    to the notion that we should be impressed by his facility or pissed that he bailed on that U.S. tour.</p><p>
<i>Ultravisitor</i> is Squarepusher's sixth or seventh album (depending on how you consider <i>Do You Know
    Squarepusher</i>-- personally, I don't), and succeeds in surprising ways.  It's nothing terribly ""new,"" in
    so far as the basic elements of his palette are concerned.  He is still infatuated with atmospheric fusion
    instrumentals, abstract variations on drum-n-bass and now even more in love with his own live drumming.
    Yet, he's a good drummer; perhaps a tad faceless in the grand scheme of jazz-funk, but certainly competent,
    and often genuinely interesting.  And if that were <i>Ultravisitor</i>'s only highlight, Jenkinson would
    have fallen on bad times.  Luckily, it's not: Practically tattooed across every track is the sense that
    he's ""matured"" as both a performer and composer.  I know that sounds lame, especially when describing
    someone with a history of obscenity, irresponsibility and junkie tendencies.  I think it's true, though,
    and far be it from me to knock good music just because I'm tired of the sideshow behind it.</p><p>
    In some ways, <i>Ultravisitor</i> is the only Squarepusher album you need to know about.  It contains
    instances of every idea, texture or beat he's presented until now, and unlike recent releases <i>Do You
    Know Squarepusher</i> or <i>Go Plastic</i>, little of it sounds stale.  In this respect, the record is
    most similar to <i>Selection Sixteen</i>, though hardly sounding like a collection of leftovers as that
    album had.  In fact, I'd go so far to say he sounds inspired here.  More than on any record since <i>Music
    Is Rotted One Note</i>, <i>Ultravisitor</i> makes the case that not only does nobody else sound like
    Squarepusher, but that few (if anyone) are capable of even a second-rate impersonation.</p><p>
    This album, however, is too long; there are scattered moments that seem redundant in the face of Jenkinson's
    own catalog, if not that of new-schoolers like Prefuse 73 or Hrvatski; his improvisations tend to meander,
    and seem more the work of someone much more in love with himself than his audience.  And somehow, none of
    that diminishes <i>Ultravisitor</i>'s accomplishments, chief among them being that it updates the template
    of the popular virtuoso.  This is Squarepusher's ""Flight of the Bumblebee"".</p><p>
    At almost 80 minutes, <i>Ultravisitor</i> contains too much music to really hold together as a cohesive
    statement-- if that isn't a seasoned rule of rock, then it certainly applies to Squarepusher.  The title
    track is a deft, yet intensely melodic slice of drum-n-electro-pop, similar in spirit to his lone actual-pop
    foray ""My Red Hot Car"", but filtered through a much shorter attention span, even as it's nearly twice as
    long.  The bassline still seems tangentially related to dub and the melody similarly a distant cousin to
    some Chick Corea line from the early 70s.  In the hands of anyone else, or even the same person in other
    instances, it should add up to a disorganized, wanky mess.  To my ears, it sounds like classic instrumental
    pop.  Other tunes, like ""Circlewave"" and the relatively gentle ""Iambic 9 Poetry"" (not to be confused with
    <i>Budakhan Mindphone</i>'s ""Iambic 5 Poetry""), take this concept and jazz it up or tone it down, respectively.
    In every case, no matter if Squarepusher programs drum tracks or plays them himself, theme and variation
    are the keys, again following the frequently beaten path of the virtuoso.</p><p>
    And speaking of classical stuff, how about those guitar and bass solos?  Unsurprisingly, the more Jenkinson
    manages to insert recurring thematic ideas into his cadenzas, the more interesting they are.  ""I Fulcrum""
    is an extended bass solo colored in wavering, dissonant feedback, and, like several other songs on the album,
    it features piped-in crowd noise.  It begins as a dark, minor-key figure somewhat reminiscent of Michael
    Henderson's ""Willie Nelson"" figure from Miles Davis' <i>Tribute to Jack Johnson</i>, though the deft,
    harmonized patterns that emerge are purely of Jenkinson's design.  The brief guitar piece ""Andrei"" hardly
    sounds like it could come from the same person, and in fact would work wonders played at the library as
    reading music.  (And I mean that as a compliment.)  Contrarily, ""Every Day I Love"" just seems aimless and
    boring.  Plus it's called ""Every Day I Love"".</p><p>
    The best argument for <i>Ultravisitor</i> is not that it's impressive so much as that it's interesting.
    Like Aphex Twin, Squarepusher exists in a sphere that, for many non-diehard fans, has to put up double the
    cash to reap the same rewards as it did before folks already <i>knew</i> what to expect.  The album isn't
    a drastic stylistic shift-- though the warped noise-hop of ""50 Cycles"" suggests Squarepusher might be trying
    to create a new genre-- but rather, an almost perfectly realized example of how to pull off beat-driven
    instrumental electronic music without seeming either too abstract, or too hopelessly lost in 1997.  I'll
    leave the light on in the hopes he gets a handle on the guitar solos and the running time next album.</p></div>"|7450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7450-ultravisitor/|7.9|Dominique Leone

I know it's off-putting, and I know we critics hand out these
    laudations for any trifle or speck that obstructs our paths on the way to the Pitchfork vending machine.
    But this time I mean it: If you don't know Ennio Morricone beyond <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i>
    soundtrack, your life is a sham, your friends are holograms, and your soul is a barren wasteland where
    maggots greedily feast upon heartlessness and willed ignorance.  This is not to say Morricone's 1960s
    spaghetti-Western scores were anything other than indispensable space-capsule epics compressed into noble
    vistas and griseous beards.  However, towards the early 1970s, Morricone realized it was time to put down
    his pistols, cast off his spurs, and stop terrorizing the Black Maiden's children in the Texan Graveyard of
    Doom or squinting at the mud-lined faces of lawless AWOL Mexican warriors.</p><p>
    
    So, he jetsetted to a strobe-lit land of swinging Eurodisco chandeliers, Twiggy impersonators with lime-green
    skirts, sophisticated black glasses, bottles of Chardonnay, and a mad acid party with the Ambassador of
    Morocco in his opulent tie-dyed mansion.  <i>Mondo Morricone: The Trilogy</i> charts this later mood.  If
    you don't believe me, ask the Amazonian Italian vixen on the cover of the first volume of this three-disc
    box which collects the previously released <i>Mondo Morricone</i>, <i>More Mondo Morricone</i>, and <i>Molto
    Mondo Morricone</i>.</p><p>
    
    Morricone's Western scores were galloping military warcalls and pacing anticipation, perhaps some regret for
    killing innocent townspeople.  On <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i> or <i>Navajo Joe</i>, the electric guitar reigns
    like a fascist over the characters' heads, the aural equivalent of spectacular and intimidating brick beasts
    sliding down from the sky.  The music on this box is from ""quieter"" Italian horror flicks and melodramas.
    It's still as dazzling and ceaseless as the Westerns, but its weight spreads in another direction. The
    Western scores are generally insurmountable pinnacles of agonizing or resigned cries, rushing along until
    they sweep you away in a gush of violins; the <i>Mondo Morricone</i> pieces sprawl out before you, clear
    a path, and let you come into them at your own pace.</p><p>
    
    Not that Morricone is making it difficult for you to make the leap.  The first piece, ""La Lucertola"" bleeds
    wilting clarinets into increasingly silent chimes.  A tremolo of epic Western guitar fades in and out, some
    sort of space blender is turned on, and the rhythm is soft, skittering bossa nova punctuated by go-go harpsichord
    flourishes.  But much of the effect is due to Morricone's sly use of that film score rarity, the human voice.
    The vocals on ""Le Foto Proibite di Una Signora per Bene"" are opera versions of Marianne Faithfull or Gal
    Costa, launching into ineffable tones that should tear down your house but never seem anything other than
    comforting-- and all with a Sinatra-in-Sin-City strut.  ""Doricamente"" features a chorus of precocious Beach
    Boys wannabes crying themselves to sleep atop a spy theme guitar as sopping and fashionable as hair gel.
    ""La Bambola"" hits arrhythmic folk until it scatters into the softest, most beguiling ye-ye la-la-la tune
    to hit <i>The Top of the Pops Christmas Special</i>.</p><p>
    
    And although you feel bad for getting off on it, there are songs that are clearly only suitable to play at
    Caligula's next birthday bash: ""Sospiri da Una Radio Lontana"" is either a whipping or an orgasm, depending
    on your temperament.  A lilting flute tries to undermine the lasciviousness, but to no avail.  It's so
    sensual that by the end of the song, your skin will be lacerated by fingernails as you try to take off
    your clothes.  ""Voce Seconda"" has so little air; the vocal track is basically nothing but gasping.  The
    reverbed guitars barely have enough space to be strummed.</p><p>
    
    Somehow, Morricone also made time for the most gratuitously groovy garage hits of the decade, mashing
    chromatic scales off of wah-wahing keyboards amidst fleets of neon drumrolls.  Sometimes, as on ""Citta
    Violenta"", there are no flashes of hope or levity at all: Grimy brass lows, some Mafiosi Faust begins
    intrepidly walking to his doom, and the fists start flying.</p><p>
    
    The best, of course, is when these genres merge into the more traditional compositions: ""Belinda May"" opens
    with a music box twinkle, befuddled voices, shuddering percussion that could be spur-rotations or Brazilian
    percussion, and a melody that realizes it's never going to break into the Bubsy Berkeley bigtime promised
    by its first few moments.  And on ""La Cugina"", free jazz noir dislocates itself, pops into pneumatic tubes,
    and emerges, reinvigorated, in some huffing funk make-out music belied by an impossibly chaste female voice.
    It's like sexing up a mockingbird-- a daydream for some bird watchers and an abhorrent, bestial perversion
    for everyone else.  But the most perplexing and victorious is ""Rodeo"", a piece that begins with the jarring
    and ghoulish smacking of corpses and gets thrown by a massive funk shakedown into a bunch of tinny xylophones,
    like the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of call-waiting Muzak.</p><p>
    
    The third volume is not nearly as innovative or diverse as the first two, but that's certainly no reason to
    avoid the set, or even the volume.  The simple fact is that unless you enjoy searching for full soundtracks
    to one-week-only 1972 Italian pulp movies, this summation of Morricone's fashionable spy themes, bossa nova
    anthems, and all sorts of inspired genre-splicing is as satisfying as this whole ""entire century of music""
    thing gets.  The best song, the nine-minute ""Come Maddalena"", might be the most subtly experimental, even
    enlightening, song I've ever heard, slapping cool jazz drumming, droning church organs, ornate harpsichord,
    and the sound of playing children falling off a roof with a powerful, accessible, stirring chorus.  I just
    listened to it as I typed that sentence and, right now, I want nothing more than to take a bullet to the
    head: I can't imagine my life getting any better.  The last time total beatitude was this cheap, you had
    to petition royalty to sail to the West Indies to go and pick it up.  Make the right choice.</p></div>"|5569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5569-mondo-morricone-the-trilogy/|9.7|Alex Linhardt

Monday morning and you've skipped lectures     to fumble through the discount racks in your local record store.  Across the shop floor, there's a pair of     pallid, corduroy-clad indie kids, one of them clutching a copy of <i>Magic and Medicine</i>.</p>
<p>""I like The Coral,"" he says, reciting his best music journo impersonation: ""They're like Love's Arthur Lee     singing sea shanties with the Beefheart band while The Cramps play pirates together.""</p>
<p>""Oh, well, in that case,"" his friend snaps back, just within earshot of the Stereolab fan whose eye he's     trying to catch, ""you can't have heard anything by The Cramps.""</p>
<p>Influence-spotting is one of the best-loved pastimes of the armchair music fan; reel off a dozen inspirations     behind The Unicorns' album and watch jaws drop at your obsessive, nerd-like knowledge of all things psych-pop     (hell, sometimes you might even be right).  Indeed, it's true that almost all new music can be sourced back     to a few solitary giants who trod their paths before anyone else.  But there comes a point where you have     to step back and wonder whether such records are an inspired synthesis of the strange and beautiful, or     simply the bored shrug of artists without any ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It seems the jury is still out on The Coral.  Though their self-titled debut was a schizophonic monster of     noise, blues and Beatle-delic pop, effects peddles and stoner rock, it was lacking in substance and cohesion,     and sounded more like a gang of kids on a school trip discovering what they could do in a recording studio     than a creative tour-de-force.  Furthermore, its songs were not the white-knuckle, feedback-fuelled stomps     they were hyped as, but merely stitched-together fragments of ideas, upon which frontman James Skelly sketched     some rough melodic framework.  Still, where that album disappointed in its application, it at least astounded     with its audacity.  On <i>Magic &amp; Medicine</i>, the band's frenetic freakout leanings have been stripped away     in favor of a more humble approach, placing subtlety and songwriting above the sounds being produced.  It all     sounds far less interesting.</p>
<p>Opening track ""In the Forest"" sets the slowed-down tone instantly-- all antiquated organ chords and ghostly     vocals-- before the cloyingly kooky maraca-shaking and spaghetti-Western guitars of ""Don't Think You're the     First"" make you worry that maybe the band's increased attention span has smothered the smashed frontierism     and drug-injected vitality of the band's debut.</p>
<p>To the band's credit, it's not all downtrodden disappointment.  ""Pass It On"" is the kind of condensed, country-flecked     pop that their debut had dreamt of; ""Careless Hands"" caresses the legacy of Love with its flamenco flourishes     and tempo changes; and ""Leizah"" is a heartbound brood of naked 60s pop that avoids hand-wringing earnestness     through the realization that the song's main muse probably doesn't even exist.  In fact, much of the record     relies on the power of its narrator, as James Skelley's sideways scouse croon sounds both brash and beautiful,     drunken and emotive, with lyrics (such as on the buoyant summer-strut of ""Bill McCai"") that can be stark,     surreal and affecting all at the same time.</p>

Monday morning and you've skipped lectures     to fumble through the discount racks in your local record store.  Across the shop floor, there's a pair of     pallid, corduroy-clad indie kids, one of them clutching a copy of <i>Magic and Medicine</i>.</p>
<p>""I like The Coral,"" he says, reciting his best music journo impersonation: ""They're like Love's Arthur Lee     singing sea shanties with the Beefheart band while The Cramps play pirates together.""</p>
<p>""Oh, well, in that case,"" his friend snaps back, just within earshot of the Stereolab fan whose eye he's     trying to catch, ""you can't have heard anything by The Cramps.""</p>
<p>Influence-spotting is one of the best-loved pastimes of the armchair music fan; reel off a dozen inspirations     behind The Unicorns' album and watch jaws drop at your obsessive, nerd-like knowledge of all things psych-pop     (hell, sometimes you might even be right).  Indeed, it's true that almost all new music can be sourced back     to a few solitary giants who trod their paths before anyone else.  But there comes a point where you have     to step back and wonder whether such records are an inspired synthesis of the strange and beautiful, or     simply the bored shrug of artists without any ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It seems the jury is still out on The Coral.  Though their self-titled debut was a schizophonic monster of     noise, blues and Beatle-delic pop, effects peddles and stoner rock, it was lacking in substance and cohesion,     and sounded more like a gang of kids on a school trip discovering what they could do in a recording studio     than a creative tour-de-force.  Furthermore, its songs were not the white-knuckle, feedback-fuelled stomps     they were hyped as, but merely stitched-together fragments of ideas, upon which frontman James Skelly sketched     some rough melodic framework.  Still, where that album disappointed in its application, it at least astounded     with its audacity.  On <i>Magic &amp; Medicine</i>, the band's frenetic freakout leanings have been stripped away     in favor of a more humble approach, placing subtlety and songwriting above the sounds being produced.  It all     sounds far less interesting.</p>
<p>Opening track ""In the Forest"" sets the slowed-down tone instantly-- all antiquated organ chords and ghostly     vocals-- before the cloyingly kooky maraca-shaking and spaghetti-Western guitars of ""Don't Think You're the     First"" make you worry that maybe the band's increased attention span has smothered the smashed frontierism     and drug-injected vitality of the band's debut.</p>
<p>To the band's credit, it's not all downtrodden disappointment.  ""Pass It On"" is the kind of condensed, country-flecked     pop that their debut had dreamt of; ""Careless Hands"" caresses the legacy of Love with its flamenco flourishes     and tempo changes; and ""Leizah"" is a heartbound brood of naked 60s pop that avoids hand-wringing earnestness     through the realization that the song's main muse probably doesn't even exist.  In fact, much of the record     relies on the power of its narrator, as James Skelley's sideways scouse croon sounds both brash and beautiful,     drunken and emotive, with lyrics (such as on the buoyant summer-strut of ""Bill McCai"") that can be stark,     surreal and affecting all at the same time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the concessions gained by <i>Magic &amp; Medicine</i> are virtually obliterated by the rushed     monstrosity of its companion piece.  Issued in the UK as a limited edition release to fill the void until     their third full-length, <i>Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker</i> is a flatulent, irrelevant, self-indulgent     attempt at recapturing the hotwired spontaneity of their debut through a dirge of sub-par psychedelia and     try-hard freakouts (such as the frankly appalling ""Auntie's Operation"" and ""I Forgot My Name"").

    &gt;From now on, I'll call you by your proper name.  It's the best way to keep track of you.</p><p>
    
    Pinpointing Pajo has always been my problem.  When explaining your musical lineage to quasi-compelled
    pals, I'm tempted to scribble flowcharts and draw convoluted figures on oversized sheets of graph paper:
    thick, black lines are scrawled from Slint to Tortoise to Zwan; little blue streaks shoot from M to M
    Is the Thirteenth Letter to Ariel M to Papa M; yellow stripes stretch from Mogwai to Matmos; with Will
    Oldham projects always in red, and written in cursive.  Instead, I talk it through with sharp, pointed
    hand gestures and lots of squinting.  Usually, my target stops listening, or fiddles with a cigarette,
    or just thinks that I'm being weird, and then I get nervous and tacit and play crowd-pleasing Justin
    Timberlake tracks on my stereo until everyone dances and forgets what we were talking about.</p><p>
    
    Because David, your elusiveness is exhausting.  I spent a night in Louisville once, bowling with my
    friends: I felt haunted and started looking everywhere for you, nervously scanning the aluminum ball
    racks for scrappy tufts of black hair, thinking maybe you were crouching there, lurking quietly behind
    the rows of orange and purple nine-pound balls.  I checked the brown plastic tables for your initials,
    pushing aside scratched pitchers of beer, making sure I had accurately and completely inspected all
    writable ground for potential evidence.  I typed ""Pajo"" into the scoring computer.  Later, I thought
    maybe you would stop by the Steak and Shake for a strawberry sundae or cheese fries.  I stirred a cup
    of coffee with my index finger, ate a sugar packet, and scanned every single booth: There were no signs.
    The next morning, I sat mutely in the backseat of a car pointed towards New York City.</p><p>
<i>Hole of Burning Alms</i> helps, David.  All these instrumental singles and B-sides make your sonic
    trajectory clearer and easier to organize-- when taken together, they chug hard like your career, shifting
    chronologically from Slint-ish guitar surges to acoustic country hymns to traveling beats to scummy rock
    songs.  Besides, everybody knows that you like singles and EPs better than albums.  I get it: Albums are
    too self-contained, too complicated, too heady.  Here you are in bits and pieces.  And none of it sounds
    the same.</p><p>
    
    ""Napoleon"" is post-Slint/pre-Pajo-as-vocalist and defiantly haunting, heavy, throbbing, and perpetually
    somersaulting between quiet parts and loud parts.  And David, even though you recorded the song in your
    basement, it sounds enormous and monumental, like the whole neighborhood must have bowed, bent and quaked
    every time you crumpled into a chord.  There are other people playing, too: bass and drums and an extra
    guitar.  (They are nice.)  Remember when you said that ""Wedding Song No. 3"" was the first and last
    multi-tracked recording that you ever did with a live band, and you sounded so unhappy about it?  From
    the reversed guitars at the top and the heavy, plodding chords, I think ""Wedding"" is actually vaguely
    celestial, all that sound spraying out in one big wave, consistent and thick and glittery.</p><p>
    
    But in collecting all these pieces of scattered material from throughout your career, you're perhaps
    sharing too much.  I get that ""Xmas 1997"" was an audio holiday card for Drag City, and therefore sort
    of private and giggly, but why does it sound so lifeless?  I can hear you on the piano and in some of
    the froggier croaking sounds; the strings and drum machines are chilly, though, like going shopping for
    presents in a bad mall.  I mean, it's pretty, but that basic fade-out is just not like you, David!  Still,
    I wholeheartedly appreciate the absurdity of your sunshine-and-flowers cover of ""Turn, Turn, Turn"", mostly
    because it's a completely insane 16 minutes long, has guitar solos, and seems to backhandedly feature
    someone hitting a saucepan in the background.  Plus, you know that we know the words, and you let us
    sing along instead of stepping up and whispering all the verses yourself.</p><p>
    
    Before I go, I should tell you: When I first wrote to Drag City asking for a promo to review, I called it
    <i>House of Burning Alms</i> and never heard back from them.  I still feel bad about that, David, because
    my name is mispronounced all the time and it usually makes me a little sad.</p><p>
    
    Yours,<br/></p></div>"|6162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6162-hole-of-burning-alms/|7.6|Amanda Petrusich

    Markie has been hip-hop's own loveable mad genius for over two decades now.  However, while the Biz's
    recorded output over the course of the past two years has resulted in little more than two unremarkable
    singles (""Studda Step,"" ""Turn the Party Out""), and guest spots for nostalgia-happy idealists like the
    Beastie Boys, it's fair to say that hip-hop listeners across the map have missed him.  Unfortunately,
    <i>Weekend Warrior</i> is not the triumphant, ten-years-in-the-making comeback album fans have been
    anticipating, though its stripped-down, party-flavored production and Biz's trademark lackadaisical flow
    make it a respectable extension to the string of albums he cut for the Cold Chillin' label in the 1980s
    that made him a cult legend.</p><p>
    
    While virtually every article regarding the Diabolical Biz paints him as hip-hop's resident ""underdog,""
    it's important to note that he is so by his own consent.  It's no coincidence that his most successful
    and career-defining moment (1989's anti-Hallmark ballad ""Just a Friend"") cast him as an affable, if too
    average, guy who more likely spent Friday nights alone in front of the television than out in the club.
    But it's precisely this illusion of stupefying averageness that has made Biz Markie one of hip-hop's
    most treasured and wholly original emcees.  In a genre that often takes itself too seriously (the murders
    of Scott La Rock, Biggie, 2pac, Big L, etc.) and wildly dualistic stereotypes (Benz or backpack), Biz
    Markie's easygoing persona seems to exist outside all popular hip-hop caricatures: What other emcee would
    go topless for their album art or dress up in costumes ranging from a Native American Indian Chief to a
    Samurai to a Sumo Wrestler?  (Note that Har Mar Superstar counts as neither ""hip-hop"" nor ""an emcee"".)</p><p>
    
    Of course, while Biz Markie may be one of hip-hop's most heartfelt and idiosyncratic B-boys, his albums
    have always proven to be scattershot affairs, serving up both utter brilliance and stupidity in disappointingly
    equal amounts-- and <i>Weekend Warrior</i> is no different.  Predictably, whenever Biz sticks to what he
    knows best (namely: reminiscing about rap, reminiscing about hotties, and reminiscing about Chinese food),
    the material lands on that more ""brilliant"" end of the spectrum.  For instance, Mark the 45 King laces the
    show-stealing ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"" with syrupy piano chords and looping string swells (a la <i>The
    Blueprint</i>), while Biz smoothly brings the listener back to a time when he was ""the size of Jay-Z,"" and
    ""Ra was still with Eric B.""  The minimalist party vibe of ""Tear Shit Up"" (featuring cuts from fellow
    old-schooler Jazzy Jeff) and ""Do Your Things"" (featuring an ambiguous cameo from P. Diddy) work equally
    well, and each no doubt will leave listeners longing for the pre-Jakob the Jeweler days, when all you
    needed to look fly was a gold chain.</p><p>
    
    On ""Chinese Food"", over typically Ritalin-deprived J-Zone production, Biz re-writes the Black Rob hit
    ""Whoa"", transforming it into an ode to his favorite take-out food.  After hearing Biz's proud mantra on
    this song's hook (""Four chicken wings with chicken fried rice, that's good/ Beef and broccoli with a little
    white rice, that's good!""), citing Biz for not being as virtuosic an emcee as, say Big Daddy Kane, would
    seem to verge on laughable.</p><p>
    
    The most surprising aspect of <i>Weekend Warrior</i>, though, is that amongst the album's glut of shameless
    stabs at radio-play and outdated would-be party anthems, there remains one incredibly solid streamlined
    record.  Still, since tracks as inspired as the butter-smooth, Kev Brown-produced ""Get Down"" are made to
    rub shoulders with sterile, Nelly-miming pap like ""EI YA"", <i>Weekend Warrior</i> can prove an incredibly
    frustrating listen.  Biz has never sounded so ridiculous (in a bad way) as he does rhyming on a synth-heavy
    dancehall track trading lines with the likes of Dancehall phenom, Elephant Man-- it's so bad, it's of little
    surprise that the track serves as the album's first ""single.""  But in the end, Biz Markie's jester-like
    presence overshadows his creative shortcomings; he is one of hip-hop's greatest auteurs, even if he only
    has one true classic to show for it.</p></div>"|5568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5568-weekend-warrior/|6.4|Hartley Goldstein

    of key, just a complete mess.  The crowd-- late twenty-somethings mostly there to see headliner Nada Surf
    play that one song they do-- was at a loss, too, caught between rants of insobriety and deep Langley
    School-ish sympathies: Lerche is young and clearly nervous, and I probably should stop being an asshole
    and maybe try being kind and supportive.  Slowly everything clicked though, and Lerche commanded a degree
    of vocal control and rubato that rivaled Ted Leo solo performances.  And now the crowd was at a <i>complete</i>
    loss.  Lerche's kitschy youth appeal had earned their sympathy, yet now they actually liked what he was
    playing.</p><p>
<i>""It might be the most laidback album of lush pop I've ever heard.""</i><br/>
            --Rob Mitchum on Lerche's debut LP, <i>Faces Down</i></p><p>
    
    It's true, and perhaps <i>Faces Down</i> was unoffensive to a fault.  Lerche's songs were a bit, as Mitchum
    went on to say, ""EZ-indie.""  Lerche knows the right buttons to push when he wants to charm us, which is
    great, but perhaps not as impressive or interesting if we discern the mechanism behind the charm: subconsciously,
    we are not in awe of Lerche's skill as a songwriter, but simply rejoice in the melodies themselves.  Says
    Lerche himself, half-proud, half-ashamed, ""The tunes on <i>Faces Down</i> poured out of me... beyond my
    control.""</p><p>
    
    Lerche is, if anything, much more in control on <i>Two Way Monologue</i>.  This is not to say the songs are
    any less natural or charming-- melodies undoubtedly poured out of him, but Lerche has much more of a hand
    in crafting these melodies into truly sophisticated pop songs.  (Keep in mind that he'd written many of the
    tracks on <i>Faces Down</i> when he was just 16.)  Lerche is consistently experimenting with alternate chord
    voicings and more complex song structures, not to mention broadening the scope of his production ethic.
    Nevertheless, he refuses to sacrifice the integrity of his melodies.  With five more years on him, he's
    also cut much of the sugary and predictable melodrama, and his lyrical tendencies, with often charming
    flubbed English phraseology, have matured considerably.  As a whole, then, the songs are less immediately
    gratifying than those on <i>Faces Down</i>, but any demand made by <i>Two Way Monologue</i> betrays the
    extent to which Lerche has grown as a songwriter.  If the listener isn't eventually caught in swoons, at
    the least he will respect the degree of Lerche's refined artifice.</p><p>
    
    Nick Drake's influence seems to play a larger role here than on Lerche's last LP.  After ""Love You"", a
    baroque recast of <i>Faces Down</i>'s ""Things You Call Fate"", Lerche begins ""Track You Down"" in falsetto,
    accompanied by his own strums, which, for all his solo concert appearances, he has done so rarely on his
    recordings.  Even lyrically, Lerche touches upon Drake's celestial territory: ""Down came the sky/ And all
    you did was blink,"" and perhaps a more explicit confrontation, ""So why am I writing to the moon?""  The song
    showcases the latitude of <i>Two Way Monologue</i>'s production styles, which spans the delicate voice/guitar
    balance to the massive swells of straightforward, studio-slick chamber-pop to track stuffing reminiscent of
    Beck's <i>Midnite Vultures</i>.</p><p>
    
    On other songs, Lerche's struggle with his natural inclinations, and his wish to make his songs more
    interesting, becomes clearer.  The sparsely accompanied ""On the Tower"", ""Days That Are Over"", and ""Counter
    Spark"" all start with verses as straightforward as those on <i>Faces Down</i>, but find their maturity in
    some intensely dense and beautiful bridges, rich with alternately voiced chords and swells of strings and
    background vocals.  ""Counter Spark"" itself sports a B-section of ""ba-ba-ba bah-ba"" that subtly pokes fun
    at Lerche's melody on ""You Know So Well"".</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Lerche situates himself in two distinct but equally rich 60s rock ballad traditions.  Perhaps in
    light of all the <i>Smile</i> talk, songs like ""Wet Ground"" recall Beach Boys barbershop harmonies and
    tongue-in-cheek inflections (e.g. ""alar-Ming, dar-Ling"").  Meanwhile, the strings and florid instrumentation
    of ""It's Over""-- not to mention the restrained balladic tone of Lerche as he hits and holds his highest
    recorded note in beautiful falsetto-- situate the song in the shadow of <i>Abbey Road</i>-era Beatles.
    Admittedly, these aren't Lerche's sophistications so much as they are Lerche appropriating the sophistications
    of his new touchstones.  Still, Lerche attempts them and is to a great extent successful in his own right,
    never appearing a simple mouthpiece of his muses.</p><p>
    
    Lerche's true accomplishment on <i>Two Way Monologue</i> comes with the title track.  It's the album's
    longest, and encapsulates his stage presence, his songwriting ability, the progress he's made since <i>Faces
    Down</i>, and the wide variety of production he's employed on <i>Two Way Monologue</i>.  The track begins
    nervously as a solo acoustic song, before instruments gradually begin to fill in the empty space until it's
    stuffed with distinct acoustic and electric guitar lines, baritone saxophone hits, and synth hooks of
    various vintage and vocode.  At this point, Lerche could retire the ""Two Way Monologue"" as just another
    great pop song; but at about the 3:30 mark, as the song retreats into a quiet outro, an acoustic piano and
    guitar refuse to halt their vamp, and work up enough energy to explode back into the chorus once more, making
    for the album's most exciting transition.</p><p>
    
    At once a compliment and a criticism, <i>Two Way Monologue</i> may be too dense for one sitting.  It engages
    in the kind of pop overload that characterized <i>Faces Down</i>, though here, it's the melody as well as
    Lerche's ideas that overwhelm the listener.  Malapropisms forgiven (""When tears are pretzels pouring down
    each time/ The sweetness is returning/ At times when you appreciate that you survived""-- what?), Lerche's
    lyrics are flat but never distracting.  In the end, though, <i>Two Way Monologue</i> bears witness to the
    growth of an already talented young songwriter for whom the title ""talented young songwriter"" seems quite
    inadequate.</p></div>"|4744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4744-two-way-monologue/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

    who churned expressly for open-mouthed adolescents: Like sniffing glue or dying your hair four shades of
    magenta, discovering The Who is an action best indulged before the age of eighteen.  Consequently, anyone
    who spent the better part of high school strapped into headphones memorizing <i>Who's Next</i> probably
    felt a little green when bassist John Entwistle died unexpectedly in a Vegas hotel room in June of 2002.
    Music consumed during adolescence automatically assumes a kind of epic significance, having wiggled its
    way into swelling, nubile hearts, seeping deep into growing bones, forging a gummy, undeviating bond--
    be it teenage idealism or thick-headed naiveté, that kind of total assimilation never happens again, or
    at least not in the same stupid, beautiful way.  The Anomoanon's boisterous tribute to John Entwistle
    seems like the logical expression of that appreciation, whether a product of the band's own affection or
    simply a reflection of universal, seeping Entwistle love; either way, <i>Portrait</i> provides a scrappy,
    glowing homage to one of rock's greatest players.</p><p>
<i>Portrait of Entwistle</i> is the fourth installation in Western Vinyl's <i>Portrait Series</i>, a
    collection that works on a spectacular, albeit crazily ambitious, conceit: Each artist produces or procures
    a visual portrait (a photo, line drawing, painting, etc.), and then records two or more songs inspired by
    the subject of that picture (past contributors include Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Papa M, Appendix Out, and
    Kohn, and new work is forthcoming from The Dirty Three's Mick Turner and Robert Lippok of To Rococo Rot).
    With three originals and a cover of ""Heaven and Hell"", the fifth track off Entwistle's first solo record,
    1971's <i>Smash Your Head Against the Wall</i>, <i>Portrait of Entwistle</i> is a comprehensive,
    brooding representation of both the record's spectral, bleeding sleeve-art (check a blurry, vein-addled
    skull topped with rock-ready devil horns) and the wispy, squinting spirit of Entwistle himself.</p><p>
    The Anomoanon is anchored by Ned Oldham, whose walloping, pointy voice is so Oldham it tickles, and he's
    supported here by an expectedly massive (and mostly familiar) crew: other-brother Paul Oldham, Aram Stith,
    Jason Stith, Dave Heumann, Jack Carneal, Mike Portera, Tony Bailey, and Willy MacNeal.  Opening with
    Entwistle's ""Heaven and Hell"", a prodding, bottom-heavy rocker as good as anything Townshend ever scripted,
    the track morbidly wonders, ""Why can't we have eternal life/ And never die?""  Aram Stith's half-muted,
    perfectly sloppy soloing scribbles throughout, aptly resurrecting the kicky spirit of Entwistle's solo
    work, and showcasing Anomoanon's penchant for anti-folk noise.</p><p>
    Layered over dark, distorted crashes, ""Cherries"" features lyrics snatched from a poem by C.M. Barker, who
    wrote about fairies for the whimsical depression-babies of the late 1920s.  The choice to echo Barker's
    scented kid-sentiments is hilariously unsurprising for Anomoanon, considering 1999's full-length homage to
    Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>. ""Two Eyes Wild"" is rollicking country-folk, as
    infatuated with Neil Young as it is with Entwistle proper, falling out in a coil of wild feedback.  And
    finally, closer ""John Entwistle"" is a long, loping quasi-ballad told from Entwistle's point of view (""I
    don't do what Peter did/ I don't do what Roger did/ I don't do what Moony did/ I don't do what the others
    did""), haunted by yawning slide, pointed acoustic plucks, and general Ned-as-Entwistle vocal creepiness--
    until the entire band somersaults into a tinny ""I Can See for Miles""-ish crash, and The Who are reborn as
    clanging Tennessee teenagers.  With the bass quivering loud up front.</p></div>"|203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/203-portrait-of-entwistle-ep/|8.2|Amanda Petrusich

His songs celebrate the sensual matter of life, and rarely fall back upon narrative clichés like simple depression or heartbreak in the conventional sense.  Like Whitman's poetry, Elvrum's lyrics are often as elementary as a child's jejune rambling, and yet, in their simplicity, they're sturdy, sophisticated, and poignantly inquisitive.  And unlike many of today's indie gurus, Phil isn't a gimmick: Despite epic songs that extend to multiple tracks and varying ""parts"", and a challenging concept album that attempted to conquer the galaxy, Elvrum's quavering emotionality never seems less than genuine.</p><p>  Of course, if you're not a sucker for sentimentally pregnant music, The Microphones might be lost on you: Once, after hearing ""Solar System"", <em>Mt. Eerie</em>'s fleeting 3½ minute retreat to pop clarity, a friend of mine remarked, ""Anybody can do that.""  I'm afraid not.  Maybe it was my fault for playing him the song out of context, but to me, after the 17-minute percussive hysteria that precedes it, Mirah's gentle repetition of the line, ""I know you're out there,"" seems among the most serene pleasures on Earth.</p><p>  On The Microphones' website last year, Elvrum solicited fans in Norway who might be willing to board him for the sunless winter.  When he found a taker, he packed up his things and went, intending to work and write in seclusion.  Given this kind of unpredictable tendency, the release of <em>Live in Japan, February 19th, 21st, and 22nd, 2003</em> isn't surprising-- especially considering The Microphones' long legacy of rarities, B-sides and Beck-like fakeout releases that seem to shun ""proper follow-up"" status.  Still, a big part of The Microphones' music is that it inhabits a dark nether of studio wizardry; to strip away Elvrum's sound-transforming production is to only view half of the picture.</p><p>  Discounting winsome covers of ""Silent Night"" and ""My Favorite Things"", which elicit some of the liveliest crowd responses, <em>Live in Japan</em> consists of entirely new material, but the album sounds only vaguely like The Microphones we've come to know and love through a deluge of extraordinary studio releases.  Elvrum's brittle voice and songwriting is as moving as ever, but represented live, these new songs wear thin and fail to carry the emotional weight they likely would have if set amongst the field-recorded effects, cavernous drum sounds and late-night radio buzz of The Microphones' transportive studio projects. Additionally, where many live albums sound more organic than their studio counterparts, the inverse is true here.  It's not that <em>Live in Japan</em> isn't intimate; it's that practically nothing could match the intimacy we've come to expect from records like <em>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water</em> and <em>The Glow, Pt. 2</em>.</p><p>  This aside, what differentiates <em>Live in Japan</em> from The Microphones' previous work is the emergence of a subtle blues bent; songs like ""After N. Young"", ""I Love You So Much!"", and ""Thanksgiving"" hint at a more conventional direction.  But despite Elvrum's reported social monasticism, these songs remain paradoxically confessional, as reflected in lines like, ""As you can see/ Having descended the hill/ I still look like me/ I still howl like Phil/ And forever will,"" and in heartened cries like, ""I want my own wind to blow.""  In these confessions, the point of this record becomes clear: to separate ""Phil"" from ""The Microphones.""</p><p>  That, of course, is a separation not many fans will take kindly to, as most still consider The Microphones a solo studio project with a revolving-door policy not unlike Robert Pollard's Guided by Voices.  Nonetheless, this beguiling division hints that Elvrum has refocused his artistic vision on new vistas.  Given this, and that these songs originated over a year ago-- since which time the band has broken temporarily asunder and reconstituted with an amended name-- it's uncertain whether this material will ever undergo the studio wringer.  And even if it does, there's no telling whether Elvrum is determined to branch off his sound in some unforeseen direction.  Regardless, he ought to consider giving these songs <em>some</em> kind of studio treatment, as they would seem to generate another astonishing LP.</p><p> </p></div>"|5272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5272-live-in-japan/|6.1|Sam Ubl

    mood of the evening is just about right to pull out the Powerbook and play a few finger-picked ditties
    around the fire.  At least, that's how I imagine how it would be camping with Greg Davis.  Having dabbled
    in the past with classical composition, electroacoustic sound-processing, hip-hop and boom-bap, et cetera,
    Davis hit upon his sound with his Carpark debut, <i>Arbor</i>.  Drawing on the gentler sounds of acoustic
    folk, the instruments and warm notes were gently nudged into more random (or else more carefully considered)
    sound compositions, the process never overshadowing the trajectory of melody.  He's grown nimble enough in
    his approach to pull out the computer and make it sound like anything but.</p><p>
    
    As the nomenclature would attest, the move has been made from singular tree to the more holistic Woods, as
    Davis has grown increasingly concerned with the arc of the album as a whole.  ""Red Barn Road"" opens like the
    mouths of an amateur barbershop quartet for a half-minute, foreshadowing the voices to come.  For ""Brocade
    (Rewoven)"", he takes the finger-picked strings and stretches them to resemble barren branches in a snow-covered
    cloister, slowly moving the trunks about and blurring the spaces in between as a kick-drum trudges about in
    evenly-paced steps.  Seemingly sparse from the outside, once among the trees, they reveal a nuanced density
    of sound that you can get lost in.  ""Improved Dreaming"" could be a Nobukazu Takemura campfire tale, all
    bird chirps and music boxes scattered so as to sync up with a woodland walk, the boots cracking wood and
    crunching snow in the surrounding silence.  The Moondog-like step of ""Shoes &amp; Socks"" gives way to gentle
    manipulations, the handclaps flickering about like shadows as the flame crackles and a slowly plucked guitar
    resonates in the ever-shifting dark.</p><p>
    
    The voices return midway through the disc for ""At My Window"", one of Brian Wilson's songs from 1970's
    underappreciated <i>Sunflower</i>, which, although thematically appropriate, falls flat, as Davis can't
    quite approximate the harmonies that the Beach Boys pulled off so effortlessly.  While his voice is lacking
    here, the middle break billows into a keen arrangement not far removed from Jim O'Rourke's pop fantasias
    circa <i>Bad Timing</i> or <i>Eureka</i>.  That influence also shines through on the title track, as the
    finger-picked figures get surrounded by circuses of piano, brass, clarinet, pedal steel, and upbeat handclaps,
    while subtle electronic textures shift about underneath it all.</p><p>
    
    Davis closes with a cover of The Incredible String Band's ""Air"", but again fails to properly pull off the
    vocals.  With the solemn harmonium and choir-like backing, all I see is the Budweiser Clydesdales tromping
    through the fresh powder.  When he's not so concerned with blatantly showing his pop pedigree, and instead
    allows the instrumentation to breathe and retain its dreamy and bucolic lilt, <i>Curling Pond Woods</i> is
    a fine twining of the natural patterns that can occur at once, out on a walk through the countryside and
    inside the head.</p></div>"|2189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2189-curling-pond-woods/|7.8|Andy Beta

First, DJ Koze's <i>All People Is My Friends</i>
    is probably the least essential mix CD ever released on Kompakt.  Second, that's a meaningless statement.
    Over the past few years, Michael Mayer's Cologne-based label has been as consistently rewarding as any in
    the world, and even its relatively weaker output still carries recommendations.  The bar set by mixes such
    as Mayer's <i>Immer</i> or Triple R's <i>Friends</i> is so high that to say a subsequent record doesn't
    clear that mark leaves only the faintest hint of its relative quality.</p><p>
    To be fair, even if <i>All People Is My Friends</i> weren't a less satisfactory listen than most of those
    others, the comparison is also a bit faulty because this record embraces a different aesthetic than most
    Kompakt mixes.  As the title indicates, DJ Koze casts a wider net than most, eschewing tech-house for large
    swathes of his set and including outsider music, folk-pop, ambient, and beatless noodling.  In that sense,
    it skirts closest to Tobias Thomas' <i>Smallville</i>, although whereas that panoramic mix unfolded with
    grace and elegance, Koze casts himself adrift, wandering a zig-zag path with some abrupt tempo and style
    changes, exemplified with a wink and a nod perhaps by his early inclusion of the Langley Schools Music
    Project's sparse reading of ""The Long and Winding Road"".</p><p>
    What often seems like a scattershot selection of records is infused with senses of nostalgia and comfort.
    That gooey familiarity is manifested in both Koze's inclusion of well-known electro tracks from Mr. Oizo
    and Smith N Hack and selections from tech-house pioneers such as Thomas Brinkmann, Isolée, and Jan Jelinek
    (in this case, avec The Exposures).  Even more curious, Koze explores elements of music's permeation into
    both pop culture and our everyday lives.  So Mr. Oizo nicks his song title from Indeep, a bit of ""Personal
    Jesus"" finds its way into The Christians and Konrad Sprenger's ""I Was Yours"", the Langley Schools Music
    Project covers 60s pop, and Koze's set itself closes with a (probably) drunken singalong of Frankie Valli's
    ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"".  These referential nods and out-of-leftfield recordings illustrate the
    feedback loop on which pop music feeds-- particularly in a club context, in which the dialogue between
    performer and patron is both immediate and two-way.</p><p>
    Koze takes a bit of time to get a proper foothold, but once an underwhelming beginning fades further in
    the rearview, there's a lot to like.  Highlights from Isoleé and Jelinek should be well known to tech-house
    listeners by now, but among the lesser-known tracks, there are at least three real gems: Fabrice Lig's
    ""Meet U in Brooklyn"", Jackmate's ""80sc 7seq"", and Matthew Jonson's ""Typerope"", each of which are among the
    deepest and most vivacious tracks on the mix.  Because DJ Koze's own productions are often hard-charging,
    it's a slight shock that, on the whole, the mix is so delicate-- even his own contribution, ""Geklöppel B2""
    is arid and spacious-- but if this record is full of anything, it's surprises.</p></div>"|2542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2542-all-people-is-my-friends/|6.6|Scott Plagenhoef

    career reinventing himself.  Starting out as a militant slacker on his debut, he soon shifted to such
    personas as Slayer of Wack Emcees, Horrible Beatmaking Weirdo, Rappin' Nerd, and most recently, Absent
    Indie Rap Luminary.  With such a storied history, you'd expect a greatest hits collection to actually
    include his greatest hits.  When the fine print is read, though, something quickly becomes evident:
    He only released two albums on Elektra, neither of them being perfect.</p><p>
<i>I Wish My Brother George Was Here</i> and <i>No Need for Alarm</i> were far from bad records, but they
    were clearly two sides of a coin.  The former fell short because failed to show his true personality and
    displayed too many of his younger and more ignorant opinions (""Dark skinned girls are better than light
    skinned""), though the latter succeeded on focusing on his rhyme skills and vocal quirks.  This collection,
    unfortunately, focuses on B-sides and remixes, making it more of a completist's release than a greatest
    hits collection.  Some are good (""Burnt"", ""Wrongplace (Casual Remix)""), some are bad (the ridiculously
    corny <i>Judgment Night</i> soundtrack amalgam with Dinosaur Jr. ""Missing Link""), but the realization that
    the only great album tracks from his early days are ""Mistadobalina"", ""Dr. Bombay"", ""Wack MC's"" and ""Catch
    a Bad One"" is disheartening.</p><p>
    
    This being an Elektra-only hits collection means that his best work from <i>Deltron 3030</i>, the obscure
    Japanese import masterpiece <i>Future Development</i>, and even <i>Both Sides of the Brain</i> go unrepresented.
    Given this, the exclusion of Elektra tracks like ""The Wacky World of Rapid Transit"", ""Boo Boo Heads"" and
    ""No Need for Alarm"" is inexcusable.</p><p>
    
    The biggest win on this piece is doubtlessly ""Eye Examination"", one of Del's all-time best performances.
    Rocking over a chugging guitar and drum tradeoff, a psychedelic backdrop falls around Del, who details his
    mentality and lifestyle choices better than anywhere else in his catalog: ""I never had real friends 'til
    now/ I never had to steal ends 'cause that's foul/ I walk the streets with the baseball bat, feelin' secure/
    But I try not to incite fights, that's immature.""  It's one of my favorite B-sides of all-time, and helps
    save this compilation from total irrelevance.</p><p>
    
    What this label-sanctioned, contract-fulfilling release proves is that Del came into his own near the middle
    of his career (<i>Third Eye Vision</i>, <i>Future Development</i>, <i>Deltron 3030</i>).  Still, without the
    powerful straight-rap from the majority of <i>No Need for Alarm</i>, this Elektra-only greatest hits package
    fails on its own concept.</p></div>"|2541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2541-the-best-of-del-tha-funkee-homosapien-the-elektra-years-b-boy-handbook/|6.3|Rollie Pemberton

Once a four-piece, then
    a duo, the band's current lineup consists of original vocalist/guitarist Adam Miller, new bassist/vocalist
    Nat Sahlstrom, and Ron Avila of Get Hustle and Holy Molar as the temporary, very capable drummer.  The
    trio's monological chiseling awakens subtleties that went missing from the more obviously engineered
    post-punk tropes on last year's <i>Chrome Rats Vs. Basement Rutz</i>, showcasing an insistent, wonderfully
    slovenly atmosphere, daredevil percussion, and a keen melodic sensibility.</p><p>
    Of course, their arty dirge and pseudo dub has a ton of precursors.  For starters, the shrapnel convolutions
    bring to mind The Grifters' <i>So Happy Together</i> (especially the silt-heavy bass) and the programmed
    moments taste like dingy, damaged Suicide.  Likewise, the slow-motion urgency and overall compositional
    looseness is similar (enough) to Pussy Galore's asphyxiated garage door shouts (sans Einstürzende Neubauten
    foundation) and the grubby warp-speed of Royal Trux's <i>Twin Infinitives</i>.  <i>Plaster Hounds</i> isn't
    as off-the-map as these ""classics"", but it's fun, nonetheless, because it moves interestingly, and within
    entropy, it locates nice flourishes like high-speed electro drums over gloomy distorted bass, pitter-pat
    junkyard crunk dodging phased and/or slinky guitar and basslines, and wiry shakers darting beneath ringing
    guitar.</p><p>
    Certain songs feel like ciphers or pretty exercises in reoccurrence; others centered around these same tight
    repetitions burst into jagged melody: ""Chalk Dust (Holy Water)"" is Mark E. Smith sludgecore, ""Monarch""
    lactates Arthur Doyle dub, and the pulsations and guitar announcements of ""Ice Hatchets"" nod at Sun City
    Girls' <i>Torch of the Mystics</i> interlocutions and Pussy Galore's ""Revolution Summer"".  Just as often,
    the niceties occur on a verbal level: The strut of ""Surrogate"" has a trill hidden in its somber that can't
    help but remind me of <i>Bee Thousand</i>, and ""Garden""'s steady bass circled by angry guitars, makes a
    nice link to the last record, Dhalgren-style: ""In the garden I licked a chrome rat/ A shiny tailbone/ And
    a poached beak/ Amidst the debris/ I almost tripped on a prodigious mime/ Acting gestures to/ The prince
    of the palace/ Of divinity.""</p><p>
    Really, though, I'm mostly glad Gang of Four are losing grip on the minds of our musical youths.  And I'm
    even happier that Chromatics, along with Liars, have finally discovered the Silver Apples.  <i>Plaster
    Hounds</i> even includes a nicely turned, unassuming cover of 1968's ""Program"".  Though it lacks the
    wonderfully manic intro sample and continual weaving of second-level Books-styled radio noise, thanks to
    Avila, the percussive spirit of Simeon and Taylor remains.</p><p>
    Whatever its precursors and wherever it's going, <i>Plaster Hounds</i> spouts muffled, often miffed
    rock 'n' roll with fine collagist tendencies, bringing to mind a musty the Lower East Side squat with
    some kid pissing on my shoe.  Surpassing standard faux-broke-ass hep, this is a comfortingly collapsible
    record that manages more often than not to locate the correct note, feel, or rhythmic variation.  And at
    long last, in the year 2004, Seattle plays host to a compelling new form of grunge.</p></div>"|1457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1457-plaster-hounds/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

Or perhaps you will know them
    because Spoon's Britt Daniel produced their debut EP.  Either way, the five guys who constitute Austin's
    I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness (including a couple past members of Windsor for the Derby and Paul
    Newman) are obviously adept at cultivating attention-- and it turns out that they actually merit some, too,
    if this five-song starter kit is any indication.</p><p>
    
    Daniel may be the big name on this marquee, but his presence is basically incidental, as he does his best
    to naturally capture the band doing their thing; reverb is about the most drastic addition he makes.
    Initially, listening to the band just do their thing without any attendant bells and whistles threatens
    overwhelming boredom-- they've strangely sequenced the absolute least engaging song at the beginning the
    EP.  ""We're Still the Weaker Sex"" isn't a bad song, per se, but if Nelson had opened with a bow shot like
    this he probably would have lost at Trafalgar.  The vocals are buried under clean, start/stop electric
    guitars, and though the music builds nicely as the drums pick up on the guitar rhythms and the band slides
    into a slippery faux-jazz groove, the melody never really builds with it, and the song fails to stick as a
    result, though the acceleration for the spiraling guitar outro is pretty exhilarating.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, it's nothing but broadsides of tightly constructed, Factory-brand indie rock, and soon enough,
    your battleship is sunk by the slow build and nagging guitars of ""The Less You See"", a Slint-lite swoon
    that climaxes with an airy bridge instead of a blistering pileup.  The band hold their aces for the last
    two spots on the disc, though, unloading with the spiky disco stomp of ""When You Go Out"" on track four and
    proving why we should be paying attention.  The detached, everyman harmonies sink into the band's best
    melody while the guitars scour the stratosphere with insistently droning lines that seem to ricochet off
    the open hi-hats.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Your Worst Is the Best"" drives home the fact that the band are at their best and most memorable
    when the vocals are performed in tandem, and the chiming guitars and electric piano of the first few
    verses create a crystalline, womb-like effect.  The song dissipates into a keyboard ether, leaving behind
    thoughts of Big Things to come for the quintet.  <i>I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness</i> already have
    the sound of a pink and grey counterpart to Interpol's red and black, and the Spoon connection feels
    logical, given the band's penchant for pop with a bite and a new wave edge.  If they can deliver on their
    promise, we'll soon know them for a lot more than their name.</p></div>"|4150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4150-i-love-you-but-ive-chosen-darkness-ep/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Few
    bands even attempt it, and those who do are mostly found in hardcore and prog-rock, which is all but
    predicated on senseless scale masturbation.  One of the very few bands in the past decade who built a
    successful discography on this formula is The Dismemberment Plan, who had a lot more going for them than
    just their rhythmic chicanery.  +/- are indie's current masters of meter, and may one day inherit the
    Plan's crown as champions of the pop periphery, if only they sandpaper their edges and stick to their
    guns.</p><p>
    
    On 2002's <i>Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut</i>, +/- employed glitchy samples, then common only in IDM,
    and electro-pop.  They were, in fact, progenitors of the sound that would, for better or worse, come to
    be termed ""lap-pop.""  James Baluyut's lullaby vocals and an array of dreamy synth pads helped smooth the
    stuttering a bit, but the sound was unquestionably loop-driven.  At times, their compositions were so
    choppy and repetitive that they sounded as if they were woven together by a Garage Band maestro, yet
    always retained human character.  The band also understood that, in some situations, the pale, robotic
    sound of a drum machine better accompanies a song than a less exacting, more colorful human performance.
    Chris Deaner gladly took a backseat throughout most of <i>Self-Titled</i>, only to emerge at the most
    opportune moments.</p><p>
<i>You Are Here</i> is a much more ambitious effort than its precursor.  It's evident that +/- are attempting
    to branch out stylistically while simultaneously condensing their sound.  The results, however, aren't always
    fruitful, as the band's incessant genre-hopping frequently sounds stilted.  Only on ""She's Got Your Eyes"",
    a tasteful odd-time samba, do they master a niche experiment.  Deaner's agile drumming offers a nice
    counterpoint to the one-bar guitar loop upon which the song is structured, while Baluyut delivers the line,
    ""I've got ways to make you pay,"" more benevolently than would seem appropriate for a song about a man
    abandoning his pregnant girlfriend.</p><p>
    
    When the band relaxes into a wider, 4/4 time channel, they often succumb to prosaism.  ""Summer Dress 1""
    is a blithely strummed ditty that sounds as if it was torn straight from Chris Carraba's <i>How to Be a
    Sissy Bitch Handbook</i>, while ""Trapped Under Ice Floes (Redux)"" dangles not far from emo mediocrity.
    But fortunately, a more mature set of influences shines through on <i>You Are Here</i>'s best numbers.
    On the sinuous opening track ""Ventriloquist"", Baluyut evokes Michael Stipe's nasal crooning when he sings,
    ""I'm riding in a car/ Please don't take this exit/ And please don't drop me just yet.""  Other songs recall
    Joy Division and Depeche Mode, as Baluyut's brittle voice tiptoes to center stage with only a spare backing
    of guitars and drum loops.  ""Surprise"", another standout, is a nocturnal rumination that would feel right
    at home among The The's standard fare.</p><p>
    
    If anything holds <i>You Are Here back</i> from realizing the promise hinted at on +/-'s debut, it's the
    band's relentless modesty.  While I can think of a hundred bands for whom it would be a welcome attribute,
    +/- are often frustratingly retiring, suppressing their prodigious rhythmic and melodic talents in favor of
    something more straightforward.  Many of the songs here aspire to almost radio-friendly levels of
    accessibility and shamelessly exhaust easy pop cliches.  Still, a few tracks manage to recapture the pop
    bliss the band achieved by doing it their way on <i>Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut</i>.  If only for the
    endless promise of that record is <i>You Are Here</i> somewhat of a letdown, like untold albums from bands
    who choose to loiter on the cusp of something bigger and can't quite make that breakthrough step to
    greatness.</p></div>"|6356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6356-you-are-here/|7.6|Sam Ubl

    dust in record store used bins.  The truth is not that most of these lonely relics of rock and roll were
    arbiters of cultural shame, so awful that no one could possibly want to listen to them, but that they simply
    ride the middle ground between abysmal and worthwhile so well that their existence is simply not worth
    noting.  Following in this infamous line of harmless stereo-friendly pap comes Mark Duplass' stab at 80s
    nostalgia (as channeled through the influence of Spoon, Elvis Costello, and The Get-Up Kids) with his
    band's self-titled debut as Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!</p><p>
    
    Reportedly named for the Tom Hanks driven cult flop, <i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i>, Mark Duplass started
    VISE!! after he was diagnosed with severe tendonitis in both of his arms, forcing him to trade in his years
    of guitar playing and take up the organ.  However, while the circumstances of his band's fruition prove to
    be somewhat out of the ordinary, the music on this self-titled debut is anything but unpredictable.</p><p>
    
    Despite that Volcano's idiosyncratic line-up is constituted by a Casio organ, a guitar, and a double bass
    drum, and that Duplass had been enrolled in music composition classes around the time of forming the band,
    the album sounds remarkably trapped in the conventionally adolescent and nostalgic-obsessed garments of
    emo.  In fact, for all intents and purposes, Volcano sound like a less estrogen-infused version of Polyvinyl's
    other organ-centric outfit, Mates of State.  The album's opener ""2nd Gun"" bounces along on a bed of cheap
    Moog chords and telecaster sheen, while Duplass drawls out painfully clumsy lines like, ""I miss you, Kate,
    and that shit hurts.""  A line like this should be delivered with a wry bitterness, or a quick wit, not
    dripping with so much Hallmark heartache and banality that it could carry a scene from <i>The O.C.</i>
    ""2nd Gun"", however, is a mild offender compared with the high school stalker ode ""New Brad"", which features
    the album's most prosaic lyrics in lines like, ""I'm standing in your driveway but you're not home yet/ I've
    been waiting here since last night.../ Your window wasn't open like you promised.</p><p>
    
    However, many a great song has featured utterly imbecilic lyrics, and Volcano are more than capable of
    kicking out some prime cheese when it counts.  Both ""In Green"" and ""Fisticuffs"", while completely inane,
    showcase memorable enough anthem-lite melodies; although having these songs frustratingly stuck in your
    head is as close as recorded sound gets to the baffling power that <i>The Real World/Road Rules Challenge</i>
    has over my Tivo.</p><p>
    
    The real problem with Volcano, though, is not only the fact that they aren't really doing anything inventive
    with their music, but that the music itself is utterly forgettable.  There's not a single moment of genuine
    un-sentimental or mature emotion (or at least a scenario that hasn't previously appeared in a John Hughes
    film), and the glut of sixteen tracks seem to pass by in a glaze-eyed hum of 80s nostalgia of Casio watches,
    Delorians and aerobics.  Of course, for a band that seems so obsessed with the trappings of adolescence in
    the Reagan era, what could be a more fitting place for nostalgia than the used bin?</p></div>"|8523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8523-volcano-im-still-excited/|5.5|Hartley Goldstein

    clamoring for more of <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i>'s antagonistic
    punk-funk.  After winning enough early praise to make most lesser bands blush and acquiesce to the demands
    of a fanbase craving more of the same, Liars hinted that they were not in the business of catering to
    expectations.  You want the battery (acid)-powered post-punk that drove all the Williamsburg hipsters wild
    in 2001?  You want the brittle aggression of their debut?  Well, you'll get wind-up toy funeral dirges and
    oblique, numbing sound collages, and you'll like it!  ...Or leave it.  It seems Liars don't much care
    either way.</p><p>
    
    Liars know why their debut won them instant acclaim.  It's no accident that <i>They Were Wrong So We
    Drowned</i> bears so little resemblance to their debut.  Circumstance plays a part-- the old want-ad rhythm
    section hightailed it prior to recording, leaving longtime associate Julian Gross to take over on drums--
    but more importantly, to Liars, they've beaten dance-punk at its own game and are ready to move on.  So
    maybe masochism is a better way to describe what's going on here-- what else could cause a band to willfully
    alienate their supporters?  Independent music isn't exactly the easiest racket in town, after all, even if
    you're blessed with almost instant celebrity (relatively speaking).  But to walk away from your clearest,
    most accessible shot at success, to dare any fairweather trend-riders to keep listening after the wave has
    crested-- well, you have to be more than ready for a backlash; you need to want to savor it.</p><p>
    
    If I'm treating a lukewarm reception for this album among Liars fans as a foregone conclusion, forgive me;
    the fact is, <i>We Were Wrong</i> is such an entirely different creature than <i>They Threw Us All in a
    Trench</i> that I envision widespread strife caused by its polarizing force, street-team members fighting
    turf wars, brother against brother.  I envision the faithful losing faith, while simultaneously, former
    detractors, uh, tracting by the dozens in response to such a reversal.  Older tracks like ""Everyday Is a
    Child with Teeth"" only hint at the screeching atonality, or the formlessness, of ""If You're a Wizard, Then
    Why Do You Wear Glasses"", or the overwhelming boredom of ""Read the Book That Wrote Itself"".  These tracks
    aren't so much unwelcome as they are completely, utterly baffling in context.  Nothing Liars have done in
    the past will provide listeners with an adequate transition to these anti-songs.</p><p>
    
    For better or worse, though, nebulous, arrhythmic atmospherics comprise a significant portion of the album.
    When Liars remove the formal structure of songs and descend into carnival experimentalism, they do so not
    with the precision of intent, but with a punk vibe-- the sound of people attacking instruments with a
    desire to play that far outstrips any overt talent.  Though the band has challenged listeners with this
    album, their intent doesn't seem as much like a desire to overtly alienate their audience as to embrace
    their artistic freedom.</p><p>
    
    Contrary to what some have claimed, <i>They Were Wrong</i> <i>is</i> listenable, and intentionally so: the
    band frequently finds ways to successfully straddle the fence between form and noise (""They Don't Want
    Your Corn They Want Your Kids"", and the brain-stealing chant of ""Broken Witch"", among others), though most
    of the time, it's admittedly impenetrable and alienating.  I'll be honest: I count myself among those turned
    off by the shift of focus.  But isn't Liars' obvious intention not to pander to their fans' expectations--
    even when it results in abrasive, half-formed lab disasters-- deserving of respect?  Even laudable?</p><p>
    
    They can be commended, to a degree, but ""there's no talent to obscurity"" as your old pal Chris Ott once
    said; when it comes to music, it's not hard to not be popular.  A lot of this experimentation is simply
    in the name of narrative-- a rumination on the nature of witchcraft and the sordid politics surrounding
    the Salem witch trials-- which makes the decision to show preference to such intensely esoteric structures
    even more questionable.  Although a little S&amp;M; makes a good backdrop for the twisted subject matter of
    black magick and bedevilment, etc., Angus Andrews' vocals and lyrics are, as a constant, a complete
    non-factor.  As such, the ""concept"" isn't any more apparent than the songwriting, conveying more in mood
    and implication than any substance.  So as it stands, Liars mostly abandon their jittery dance blasts to
    highly mixed effect, to tell a tale that just gets lost in their deep, dark woods.</p><p>
    
    But they don't even totally see that through-- the album is undercut, so to speak, by two songs capable of
    going toe-to-toe with anything Liars have done to date.  ""We Fenced Other Houses with the Bones of Our Own""
    is nothing but nervous electronics and the steady, dooming pulse of a bass drum counting down the moments
    until ""kingdom come"" amidst a steady chant that echoes the numbing opening verse of ""Grown Men Don't Just
    Fall in the River, Just Like That"", before sliding cleanly into ""They Don't Want Your Corn"".  It only paves
    the way for the eventual, epic assault of ""Hold Hands and It Will Happen Anyway""; as the denouement to this
    story arc, the ritual concludes, the Earth splits, cracks, and erupts with hellfire and the rotten scent
    of sulfur as, for one brief moment, Liars summon up some of the (immensely entertaining) demons that
    infested their first album.  The remarkable cacophony is fantastic as a stand-alone song, and does its
    part to bolster the minor sense of story, but only weakens the album as a whole by confronting its flaws
    head-on.  In the end, the flash-in-the-pan excellence of that track sums up <i>They Were Wrong</i> perfectly:
    An entire album of exposition is not justified by one moment of revelation, but if nothing else, I can
    respect their intentions.</p></div>"|4765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4765-they-were-wrong-so-we-drowned/|6.3|Eric Carr

I'm sitting still, listening for meaning in every nuance of her voice.
    It's reminiscent of sitting by a woman on the subway and making up a life together without even meeting
    her eye.  For five stops, I haven't even turned the page of my book for fear of disturbing us.  I'm trying
    to find a way to set my hand next to hers, or even just to hear her breathe.</p><p>
    Susanna Wallumrød doesn't grab you immediately: Her voice is attractive, but it's cool and pure.  She
    sings in English, but her Norwegian accent hints reedlike through the edges, and so do the feelings she
    evokes, as subtle as a catch her voice.  Her sound here spans from the whimsical and dreamy, to torch
    songs-- like her pleas to a rival on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"", or the cool lust of ""Sweet Devil""-- but
    her tone makes her intentions inscrutable, and even a sad whisper won't tell you what she's really
    thinking.</p><p>
    Wallumrød is backed by keyboardist Morten Qvenild, who's as careful with the mood as a waiter with a trayful
    of crystal.  Rune Grammofon is increasingly home to artists who have mastered small strokes, which suits
    Qvenild: While the electronic spritzes and near-beats on ""Friend"" or ""Sweet Devil"" recall Björk's work
    with Matmos, the keyboard line on ""Baby"" is pared to the bone, and the spaces between the words start to
    sound like a void.</p><p>
    The ""magical"" side of the orchestra comes out in a few flashes of color, like the sudden eruption on Leonard
    Bernstein's ""Who Am I"".  But Qvenild always stops short of exuberance, and in the tight ambience, he remains
    an orchestra-in-a-suitcase.  It's easy to wonder what Wallumrød could do over bigger or more varied arrangements.
    But they made the trade-off to get that intimacy, which draws you in so close that it should be uncomfortable.</p><p>
    On a record this moody, the ambience can carry too much of the weight.  This is a gripping record but not
    a great one: A few of Wallumrød's originals could have been replaced with covers.  But they've written at
    least one flawless ballad, titled ""Believer"".  When this appeared on recent compilations, the naked melody
    and pure voice sounded almost quizzically bare.  But when embedded at the center of this album, it's a
    staggering anti-anthem, as Wallumrød justifies a break-up with a single line: ""You are a believer, I am
    not."" And there isn't one extra syllable to ease the blow.</p></div>"|7734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7734-list-of-lights-and-buoys/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    desperately to be Important than the Manic Street Preachers.  You can tell from every album they ever
    released, every photo they ever posed for, every line of lyrics they ever penned, that these guys wanted
    to change the lives and minds of millions and enter into rock's history books as nothing short of legends.
    From day one, they wore their politics (indeterminate though they sometimes were) on their sleeves and
    spoke only in Statements-- they're the kind of band who almost certainly come up with the titles for their
    songs before the songs are written (""If You Tolerate This, Your Children Will Be Next"", anyone?), driven
    by ideas and philosophical concepts more than raw inspiration or restless creativity.</p><p>
    
    The band has managed to squeeze six albums out of that approach, which in itself tells you something.  Back
    when they were just four unknowns in heavy eye shadow and feather boas with slogans scrawled on their
    clothes, they famously had the audacity (or was it marketing savvy?) to proclaim that they would make the
    greatest rock album ever and then split-- neither of which panned out, of course.  Their debut, <i>Generation
    Terrorists</i>, walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so
    obviously patterned after The Clash's <i>London Calling</i> that it was actually kind of cute.  They did
    add a chapter to rock folklore, however, after releasing their best record (1994's tormented <i>The Holy
    Bible</i>), when lyricist Richey Edwards-- suffering from anorexia, alcoholism and a pattern of self-abuse
    that culminated in him carving ""4REAL"" in his arm with a razor blade during an interview with Steve Lamacq
    as a manner of addressing critics who doubted the band's conviction-- disappeared, never to be seen again.</p><p>
    
    Their three albums since his disappearance have been no less grand in purpose and certainly no less serious,
    though they've made more concessions to pop as the years have progressed.  Now, after a decade and a half of
    making some of the most stridently earnest music you can spend money on, Manic Street Preachers have released
    <i>Lipstick Traces: A Secret History</i>, which compiles 20 B-sides.  The album not only references critic
    Greil Marcus in its title, but also quotes him on the inner sleeve: ""What appealed to me most were its gaps
    and those moments when the story that has lost its voice somehow recovers it.""  That's a pretty damn
    pretentious mission statement for an odds 'n' sods collection, but if you've followed the band for any
    appreciable amount of time, you've come to expect this kind of grandiose contextualizing by now.</p><p>
    
    Though one might be tempted to think that, like most bands, the B-side is where the Manics stretch out and
    try new things-- maybe even lighten up for a joke or two-- this turns out not to be the case.  Unlike a
    fair portion of their UK comrades in the 1990s (Blur and Suede come to mind), the band didn't relegate
    many of their best moments to second-class status on their singles, so what you've essentially got here
    is leftovers-- songs that didn't make the albums, but that still reach for nothing less than changing the
    world.  Just check out titles like ""Prologue to History"", ""Socialist Serenade"", ""Democracy Coma"", or ""We
    Her Majesty's Prisoners"", and you'll get the basic idea.  ""Prologue to History"" is one of the band's better
    flips, a propulsive slice of piano punk that showcases the band's talents, and Sean Moore's unbelievable
    and underappreciated drumming, in particular.</p><p>
    
    There are a couple of surprises hiding in the sprawling nonchronological tracklist, such as the surprisingly
    strong Bacharach pastiche ""Horses Under Starlight"", replete with gooey euphonium, cornet and big ""bah-bah""
    harmonies, and the understated, synth-coated ""Dead Trees and Traffic Islands"", a song that could have fit
    snugly on 1996's excellent <i>Everything Must Go</i>, the band's first post-Edwards album.  Guitarist/vocalist
    James Dean Bradfield (his real given name, by the way) is given a little more room to solo than usual on
    ""Valley Boy"" and proves he can tear it up with the best of them.  His vocals have always been one of the
    band's greatest assets, too-- not many people could spin such strongly melodic material out of lyrics about
    debt reduction and stuffed with lines like, ""Ceremonial rape machine/ Life won't corrupt you,"" as he does
    on ""We Her Majesty's Prisoners"".</p><p>
    
    Early pressings of <i>Lipstick Traces</i> also come with a disc of covers the band have performed at various
    points in their career, something that really ought to be more interesting than it is.  The problem here,
    really, is that they just take it all too seriously.  Their version of Chuck Berry's ""Rock and Roll Music""
    is so comically earnest it kills the song's inherent energy, and their take on Camper Van Beethoven's ""Take
    the Skinheads Bowling"" doesn't fare much better.  One of the few songs they really try to interpret and
    make their own, Nirvana's ""Been a Son"", is recast on acoustic slide guitar and winds up sounding totally
    flat, especially compared to the original.  The group does score a minor coup with a shimmering acoustic
    cover of Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"", though, and their ultra-faithful live run through The Clash's ""Train in
    Vain"" borders on charismatic, but this disc is strictly for the fans who've tattooed ""4REAL"" on their
    forearms and kept Karl Marx quotations pinned to their concert tees.</p><p>
    
    And that may very well go for the entire compilation.  It's hard to see anyone who doesn't already own all
    six of the band's LPs getting any kind of long-term enjoyment from this set, but those who do will find it
    engaging, even if nothing on it comes close to ""A Design for Life"" or ""Mausoleum"".  As retrospectives go,
    <i>Lipstick Traces</i> is reasonably comprehensive (it seems pretty unlikely anyone will be crying over
    the fact that, say, ""Montana/Autumn/78"" isn't included), though it might have been nice to see the band's
    debut EP, <i>New Art Riot</i>, and non-album A-sides ""Motown Junk"" and ""The Masses Against the Classes""
    compiled in one place for posterity.  Manic Street Preachers never conquered the world like they wanted
    to, but it's been a good enough ride that I don't begrudge them for trying, and this compilation, flawed
    though it is, is sure to please those who'd always hoped they would succeed.</p></div>"|5073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5073-lipstick-traces-a-secret-history-of-manic-street-preachers/|6.3|Joe Tangari

What are you doing with
    all that space?  Well, in the case of a drone artist like Daniel Mensch, each half-hour slab meticulously
    dissects a narrow world of sound, offering the kind of slight changes over time that stand in for theme
    and variation.  Mensch's long lines develop and tweak the central sonic idea, guiding the listener along
    a narrowly defined emotional path.  Then there are the jams.  Acid Mothers Temple's Kawabata Makoto took
    part in a pair of two-track, hour-long discs last year (Tsurubami's <i>Gekkyukekkaichi</i> and Rebel Powers'
    <i>Not One Star Will Stand the Night</i>) that were pure, deep space exploration, a chance for copasetic
    instrumentalists to lock arms and flap into the cosmos.  This sort of trip is bound to take a while.</p><p>
    
    Rob Mazurek's <i>Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein</i> takes another approach, stitching together a number
    of discrete sections, each with their own character and mood, into loosely connected patchwork pieces that
    go on for a while.  Here, Chicago Underground Trio and Brokeback member Mazurek puts down his trumpet and
    steps away from anything resembling jazz to work solely with computer and electronics.  Mego is a regular
    outlet when the younger set of the Chicago avant-garde wants to step out and try something more abstract
    and digital, and <i>Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein</i> is a <em>very</em> Mego record.</p><p>
    
    Mazurek mixes field recordings, primitive sound machines, and loads of computer-generated sound into pieces
    that seem a bit like travelogues.  ""Body Parts (Spectral White)"", which runs for 37 minutes, reminds me a
    bit of KLF's <i>Chill Out</i> the way it seems to roam from place to place without really going anywhere.
    Sounds streams past-- hissing pipes, whispery drones, aquatic gurgles, metallic scrapes-- and then, for a
    minute or two, there will be a lyrical keyboard passage with an ambient gloss that seems pulled from a
    record of twee bedroom IDM.  There are a few nice little instrumental songs buried in this lengthy passage
    of meandering (but often interesting enough) noise, and a lot of silence, too.  Either minute-long stretches
    are too quiet to be heard or there's just the sound of the furniture.  There's loads of dynamic range, which
    perhaps exists to keep the listener tethered to the sound.  During patches of boredom, however, it's easy
    to lose track of what's happening.</p><p>
    
    ""Electric Eels (In Half Light)"" has a different vibe, darker and ultimately a hell of a lot louder.  Mazurek
    evidently spent a fair amount of time with a DAT capturing the sound of industry, because all sorts of
    chugging machines can be found here, mixing with his comparatively tiny, computer-generated squall.  The
    track wanders through several levels of blackened, spark-lit snapshots of the factory floor and then
    eventually hits a noisy state of bliss, with its final eight minutes given over to a punishing high-end
    howl of distortion.</p><p>
    
    Listening to ""Electric Eels (In Half Light)"" yesterday, I had the odd revelation that this kind of track is
    actually much more effective in a live setting, where the volume can be controlled and there's no choice
    but to immerse yourself completely in the sound.  It's an impressively textured harmonic squall, but the
    desire to reach for the stop button can be too great, especially when you've been sitting with the record
    for almost an hour.  <i>Sweet and Vicious Like Frankenstein</i> is likewise more of an ""event"" record,
    rather than something to reach for with any regularity.  It's occasionally dull but has a few great moments
    and some impressive dynamic shifts.  Still, an hour of your life is a lot to ask.</p></div>"|5169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5169-sweet-and-vicious-like-frankenstein/|5.8|Mark Richardson

The ""chrome""
    tips us off to their penchant towards flash, veneer and the artificially formal, while the ""romeo"" lets us
    know that real lovermen lurk behind the curtain, and that it's their human fingers tweaking out this analog
    bling.  The word's not necessarily coincidental proximity to ""Cameo"" also helps locate them as spiritual
    contemporaries to the electro-funk of the 80s.  Some of this aesthetic sounds familar, sure, but as grade-A
    pastiche artists, Chromeo wear familiarity well.</p><p>
    
    Consisting of lifelong friends Dave 1 and P-Thugg, Chromeo was formed at the behest of Turbo Recordings head
    Tiga, who was already a fan of their work within local hip-hop circles and wanted to hear them try something
    electronic.  The liquid funk workout of ""You're So Gangsta"" followed.  Featuring a rubbery keyboard lead, a
    coattails-to-the-wind saxophone solo and an accompanying remix from Playgroup's Trevor Jackson, the single
    fell perfectly in sync with the burgeoning <i>Vice City</i>-inspired 8-bit revival.</p><p>
<i>She's in Control</i>, the duo's ensuing full-length, is an 80s-plundering scrapbook of talk boxes,
    gloopy synths and digital funk that, for all its contrivances, proves Dave 1 and P-Thugg to be extremely
    keen-eared dilettantes.  From the slightly unpolished quality of the recording to its carefully gated
    drums, the album doesn't simply appropriate the plasticky elements of the decade so much as it marinates
    in them.</p><p>
    
    Were its hooks not as strong, <i>She's in Control</i> would probably come across as mechanical and calculated,
    but its many bright spots elevate it above being just a shrewdly timed exercise in cultural re-appropriation.
    The punchy ""Me and My Man"" opens the record with a slap-funk bassline and a flurry of canned beats, while
    P-Thugg heads the haters off at the pass through heavily treated vocals (""You think it's irony/ I wish you'd
    try to see/ That I need someone to set me free"") before being drowned out by a barrage of percussion.  Even
    better is the album standout ""Needy Girl"", a bright-lights-big-city cruiser that's equal parts Hall &amp; Oates
    and Mantronix.  The aforementioned ""You're So Gangsta"" makes an appearance, as does the rubbery funk of
    ""Destination: Overdrive"", which houses a glorious instrumental hook and features an impressively gaudy
    abuse of the vocoder.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, things do drag a bit during the latter half (especially on the aimless ""Mercury Tears"", which
    grinds itself into the ground with an ill-advised guitar motif), but even most of Chromeo's misfirings have
    something interesting behind them.  Opulent in all the right ways, <i>She's in Control</i> has the good
    sense to wear its gimmick proudly.</p></div>"|1754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1754-shes-in-control/|7.3|Mark Pytlik

    or the Beta Band ones, or, in some painful instances, the Counting Crows ones.  The Wales-now-Liverpool-based
    band should be flattered, though: Their debut long-player, <i>Messy Century</i>, for all its thinly veiled
    similarities to these bands (Mountaineers' disguise is often no more than bedroom synthesizer manipulations
    or some lo-fi laptop haze), also often approaches some of their better influences' levels of songwriting
    sophistication.</p><p>
    
    With the exception of opening track ""Ripen"", which swaggers in all self-satisfied but with nothing notable
    to justify the smirk, pretty much every song on <i>Messy Century has one or two inventive moments before
    Mountaineers take skewed recourse to tried indie-psych formulas.  ""Sewing"" employs a smart cut-up acoustic
    guitar stutter before launching into vocoded Adam Duritz melodrama.  The wildly interesting syncopated drum
    and bass backbeat (though not drum-n-bass) of ""Want to Write You"", in union with lead singer Tomas Kelar's
    poignant downspun melody, is complete bliss until one catches wind of the teenage lyricism and the sweep of
    a painfully emotive chorus.  The first half of ""I Gotta Sing"" is irresistible-- Kelar spins a melody inverse
    to the one of ""Want to Write You"", but equally catchy, atop a simple choked acoustic strum, warm strings,
    and a tasteful dose of blips and whiffs, before the drums enter and obliterate the song's charming internal
    pulse.</i></p><p>
    
    The moments that stick out all seem to partake in some subtle, non-disruptive use of sampling, and, while
    not approaching the electro-acoustic psychedelia of, say, Manitoba's <i>Up in Flames</i>, the nearly
    undetectable integration of laptop-based microloops and guitar stutters on <i>Messy Century</i> is a
    characteristic that, if more fleshed out, might help Mountaineers distinguish themselves from the genre's
    muses.</p><p>
    
    Motives are unclear as to why Mountaineers so shamelessly mimicking <i>Kid A</i>-era Radiohead balladry on
    ""It's Solid"", and it's equally confusing why, in ""Apart from This"", the trio takes such an honest stab at
    house music, a decision which results in little more than a Daft Punk parody.  That said, Mountaineers
    redeem themselves manifold with two songs that are simply fantastic, regardless of however many influences
    inform them.  ""Belgique Limb"" enters with a dark bitch-brew prelude, then spends time in vague Flaming Lips
    territory before delivering a sudden swell of sputtered guitar strums and passionate but off-kilter melody
    in cross-panned chorus.  Whistling, jangly guitars, and the quirky shuffling beat of ""UK Theatre"" evoke the
    Mountaineers' namesake nearly perfectly, and seem to hint at some folk update the band intended.  More
    importantly, the song proves that Mountaineers are capable of avoiding the dangerous ""regular old folk but
    with computer noises"" rut into which many acts have stumbled.  Especially in a genre that often succeeds
    for its honesty and lack of ornament-- electronic or otherwise-- <i>Messy Century</i> manages to keep
    songwriting as its focus, but to find the space within for tasteful and often compelling experimentation.</p></div>"|5567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5567-messy-century/|7.3|Nick Sylvester

More appropriately, what if they held a horror movie
    lasting about an hour too long and people started walking out in the middle?  Or, what if the movie itself
    was okay but the end credits took up a quarter of the entire running time and didn't actually tell us
    anything about what just happened?  What, then, would reasonable ticket buyers do, especially had they
    just been held as a captive audience to creepy midnight autopsies and ""surgical sound specimens from the
    museum of skin?""  Oh, and there's no intermission.  In fact, there are no <i>scenes</i>, rather one long,
    painful odyssey into the world of demented surgeons, graveyard theft and flatliner dynamics.</p><p>
<i>Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa</i>, Fantômas' third album of gothic, carnival goon horror-metal, suffers at the hands
    of its own density and impenetrable ambience.  Chiefly, I'm beginning to think Mike Patton (like John Zorn)
    is convinced that his version of ""atmosphere"" is a lot more gripping than it really is.  His band's latest
    opus into would-be horror soundtracks might well sound perfect if stretched under a low-budget, high-gore
    Mark Borchardt film detailing the various indecencies of highly unnecessary anatomical experimentation, but
    on its own tends to drag.  And I'm not just talking about the final 20 minutes of vinyl end-groove, but a
    sense throughout that, despite an impressive mixture of black textures and depresso-sludge, all these scary
    moments should add up to more than tedious noir-moods and the occasional flash of visceral thrill.</p><p>
    The album is comprised of but one track and will invariably work its most magic when you can afford to
    listen, uninterrupted, alone in a dark and stormy place (or as the background score for <i>Silent Hill</i>).
    It begins with a vinyl crackle and the soft ping of a distant music box.  And suddenly-- Patton coos and
    guitar and drums bash something awful!  Gasp!  Then, as the music box returns and Patton once again uses
    his breathy falsetto to summon girly demons from the dank beyond, a Benedictine choir enters with a morose
    serenade.  A ghastly wind comes from the east and overtakes their moan before... a shriek!  All hell breaks
    loose for a few seconds, and afterwards only a church organ remains to (dis)comfort you.  After a brief
    voluntary, the whole band enters on what sounds like a Morricone death march, as Patton doubles a melody
    with twang guitar and mandolin, accompanied by a jittery tambourine.  This section leads to the most
    interesting on the CD, as handclaps, percussion and Patton's ever-changing vocals perform something like
    a voodoo ritual, akin to Zorn's ""Sex Magick"" from <i>IAO</i>.  Furthermore, Dave Lombardo's furious snare
    pounding lends a much needed intensity.</p><p>
    So while <i>Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa</i> is filled with great blocks of sound, it too often loses sight of direction.
    Were there images to accompany the music, perhaps its pacing might not seem quite so turgid.  The eerily
    gorgeous, piano-led melody about ten minutes in is vastly overwhelmed by the girth of sound around it,
    and is long forgotten by the time I make it all the way through the record.  Other moments, like the nifty
    hi-hat and pitter-patter vocals a half hour into the album, could have been excellent songs unto themselves
    were they fleshed out a little.</p><p>
<i>Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa</i> might have been given extra life were the individual sections indexed, and I could
    go back to the coolest moments, or program a Fantômas-redux album all my own.  Since the band favor long
    stretches of minimal activity interrupted by jarring, metallic transitions, it's hard to consider this a
    very good ""ambient"" record.  Nor is it an interesting soundtrack, without much in the way of ""story"" other
    than the admittedly impressive artwork in the CD insert.  There are more than enough ideas here for a truly
    scary record, but as it stands, <i>Del\xECrivm Cord\xECa</i> works best as particularly damaged, gloomy background
    music, and little else.</p></div>"|2989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2989-delirivm-cordia/|5.9|Dominique Leone

    easy grins and nice cheekbones: see the benign-but-pleasant cooing of James Taylor, David Gray, and Joseph
    Arthur, or check the sudden and fantastic popularity of neo-powerhouse/Blue Note savior Norah Jones.
    What's most perplexing about these artists is not necessarily the relative blankness of their drowsy,
    silk-soft pop/rock/jazz-- it's the constant, undying ubiquity of it.  Keith Harris, writing in the
    <i>Seattle Weekly</i> last week, pointed out how, in 2002, Norah Jones provided an improbable (but
    obviously valuable) antidote to the bizarre flamboyance of American entertainment-- that her appeal is
    inextricably linked to the casual tedium of her work.  So is there a valid role in contemporary America
    for dozy-but-decent background music?  The Autumn Defense openly suggests that, yes, congenial sincerity
    and sharp, glowing guitars are perfectly sufficient, more than enough to keep everybody warm and distracted.
    And in a way, they're completely right.</p><p>
    
    John Stirratt has played bass for Wilco since the band's inception in 1994, and anybody who caught even a
    few key scenes of <i>I Am Trying to Break Your Heart</i> gets that, by now, Stirratt might require an
    independent (read: non-Jeff Tweedy supervised) side project to release his personal artistic steam.  The
    Autumn Defense has provided Stirratt that opportunity for the last three years, allowing him to pair with
    multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone and to crank out some docile, glowing country-folk.</p><p>
<i>Circles</i>, the band's second full-length, boasts a few familiar guests-- Tweedy makes an appearance,
    adding subtle guitar figures to ""Why I'm Like This"", and Andrew Bird scrapes his violin on ""The Answer""--
    and Stirratt and Sansone have been joined by new bandmates Brad Jones (bass, organ) and Greg Wiz (drums,
    percussion).  Still, The Autumn Defense's plumped-up roster hasn't necessarily bred a thicker sound: Most of <i>Circles</i>
    is spare, golden and peaceable.  Unsurprisingly, the record was recorded during a long, mulish Nashville
    winter, and <i>Circles</i> aptly reflects an immediate and careful self-insulation, with each warm, wispy
    strand of sentimental folk coiling and fading like steam from a teacup.</p><p>
    
    Softer and less psych-heavy than its predecessor, 2001's <i>The Green Hour</i>, <i>Circles</i> is a slow,
    loving tribute to early 70s songwriters, swinging from Gene Clark-ish country to Big Star pop, keeping
    the scene as pretty and as polished as possible.  The only problem is that it's difficult to tell exactly
    when <i>Circles</i> stops sounding like clean, earnest alt-country and starts to sound an awful lot like
    Air Supply.  On occasion, the record even goes so far as to echo, in spirit, the syrupy promises and
    honeyed whispers of The Carpenters (see the ""I would die/ If I thought anyone would hurt you/ Yes, and
    I would cry/ To think anyone could do something like that"" of the near-unbearable ""Written in the Snow"").</p><p>
    
    Stirratt's vocals are high and sweet, sprinkled with just enough salt to blend easily into his band's
    cymbal-tapping and gentle strumming, and very few of these songs attempt to wiggle out of their self-imposed
    restraints, settling, instead, into deep, satisfying lulls.  Subsequently, listening to <i>Circles</i> is
    not entirely dissimilar to falling asleep in front of a fireplace, feet half-dangling out from under an
    orange afghan, a partially eaten oatmeal cookie resting on a napkin: The entire scene seethes with warm,
    quiet comfort, and your eyelids have no choice but to get progressively heavier, inching together until
    you can't quite see straight.  Sleep seems imminent.  And then you realize that it's actually only 6:00
    PM.</p></div>"|378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/378-circles/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

Discuss humble beginnings making beats in bedroom, car accident in October 2002 that nearly killed him.  Consider rise to fame: Currently has three singles in the Top 20 (""Slow Jamz"", ""You Don't Know My Name"", ""Through the Wire"") bearing his name. Compare/contrast rise of hip-hop artist/producers with singer/songwriter movement of 1970s; Is Kanye West Neil Young or Neil Diamond?</p><p> <u>Week 2: Chitown, What's Going On?</u>  Discuss the failure of Chicago to produce a bona fide hip-hop star despite possessing more than enough fertile neighborhoods of racial segregation and socioeconomic difficulty.  Uncover reasons why Common and West needed to move NYC-wards to attain widespread success.</p><p> <u>Week 3: First Nigga with a Benz and a Backpack.</u>  Analyze the fast-disappearing line between mainstream and underground hip-hop, as personified by <em>College Dropout</em>'s guest appearances, and West's personal rap style.  Compare/contrast to analogous rock divisions, in regards to how rock collaborations of similar caliber (Nickelback ft. Xiu Xiu?) would be greeted with indignant horror by fans.</p><p> <u>Week 4: School Spirit.</u>  Engage the anti-education themes of <em>College Dropout</em>'s songs and skits, discussing why this particular message is greatly emphasized by West.  Acknowledge the groaner irony of discussing an album's anti-intellectualism in syllabus form.</p><p>  So many extracurricular angles, so little time; so let's just suffice it to say that <em>College Dropout</em> is the first great hip-hop album of the still pre-pubescent 2004.  Runner-up in its first week on the <em>Billboard</em> album charts only to Ravi Shankar's jazz-waif kid, the record is poised to be a huge coming-out party for one of the top producers working today, possibly even winning him the Outkast Triple Crown of acceptance from pop radio, hip-hop purists, and reactionary rock critics.  Frequently delayed, retooled, overdubbed, teased on the mixtape circuit, overloaded with skits and guest stars, and dispersed in multiple misleading forms over the Internet, the retail version finally takes the form of a flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album.</p><p>  In a way, it's strange that West would be the first of the current producer bumper crop to find such success with his own name on the spine, with The Neptunes and Timbaland having colonized the charttops for a much longer period of time, and with much more adventurous and characteristic sounds.  West's style is far less future-vision, as he typically reworks old records with the playfulness of a kid enthralled by playing 33s at 45.  You can write it off as a safer or less original approach, but the sugar-high soul technique tends to be an addictive substance in West's hands, as anyone who's had the hook from ""H to the Izzo"" stuck in their head for a week or eight can attest.</p><p>  But Kanye's success through the studio glass is more drawn from his surprising abilities as an MC: He possesses a sizable amount of his Rocafella boss' charisma while hiding his occasional technical shortcomings with his gift for comedic timing.  Mixtape downloaders have known this for a while, thanks to his whip-smart verses on ""Heavy Hitters"" and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", but <em>College Dropout</em> brings a new evidence file, whether he's probing creative tax accounting on ""We Don't Care"" or puncturing the air bag of designer materialism in ""All Fall Down"".  And when words fail, Kanye can always fall back on his day job, camouflaging even less-inspired lyrical moments with affably absurd beat constructions like the vocoder/strings/handclaps amalgamation that carries ""The New Workout Plan"" past its lyrical juvenilia.</p><p>  One begins to wish there were even <em>more</em> examples of Kanye's mic-work, as the album is also laden with distracting guest appearance speed-bumps-- spots that safety-net the album's bottom line but dilute the spotlight on its lead performer.  Strangely, the biggest names fare the worst, with Jay-Z already sounding groggy from retirement on ""Never Let Me Down"" and Ludacris sounding groggy from something less legal on the hook to ""Breathe In Breathe Out"".  The small names of Kanye's Chicago crew fail to impress as well, with GLC and Consequence's laconic verses deflating the menace of working-class lament ""Spaceship"".</p><p>  As a result, the mid-level MCs steer around the flank to steal the show, particularly on the quietly tense ""Get 'Em High"" where Kanye coaxes Talib Kweli into lightening up and fellow Southsider Common into getting serious.  Chart-topper ""Slow Jamz"" appears in a slightly longer (and slightly weaker) form featuring overkill Jamie Foxx and depleted Twista, but if you haven't reached your quota yet, it remains the best getting-it-on song ever written about getting-it-on songs.  The ferocious ""Two Words"" up-ramps a Mandrill sample into an ominous choir and violin-fed war cry flexibly savage enough to allow Mos Def to spit about his politics, Kanye about his Grammys, and Freeway about Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Steven Seagal.</p><p>  That ""Two Words"" is sequestered (along with the chock-full-of-clever ""Through the Wire"") behind a painful stretch of three clunker skits in four tracks (with the song island, ""School Spirit"", one of the album's weakest) shows that Kanye hasn't quite soaked in the lesson of the Jay-Z album that made his reputation: less skits = longer shelf life.  Fortunately, listeners can take the editing into their own hands in this age of the iPod, also axing the once-interesting, twice-tiresome biography speech that fills out the 12-minute ""Last Call"".  Deleting the skits also cuts down on the strange logic of the album's anti-college stance-- someone should tell West that not everyone on the street has the ability and/or luck to make a living in the music biz.  (Full disclosure: Your reviewer may be biased by the fact that he'll probably be spending his lifetime in the Ivory Tower.)</p><p>  Bloated tracklist, guest star overload, lyrical paradoxes: It all might sound a bit critical for an 8+ album, but <em>College Dropout</em>'s flaws tend to only help make Kanye West all the more personable as an artist.  With the fat playlist trimmed, the album lays down a sky-high standard for hip-hop challengers in '04, featuring enough singles in reserve to fill out the calendar year.  Ideal weather conditions of Chicago's rap void, producer name-dropping, and mainstream/underground bleedover may have handled the advance work for Kanye West's arrival, but <em>College Dropout</em> doesn't muff the kick.</p><p> </p></div>"|8767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/|8.2|Rob Mitchum

    themepark where patrons enact their John Wayne dreams in harmless shootouts against mechanized cowboys-- at
    least until James Brolin and Richard Benjamin come along, whereupon the computer systems that control the
    androids malfunction and start killing people.  31 years later, Ontario supergroup Valley of the Giants
    claim that early entry into the Crichton canon as the inspiration behind their new release on the burgeoning
    Arts &amp; Crafts label.  Unfortunately, like the movie, <i>Westworld</i> the album aims for Clint Eastwood but
    hits nearer <i>Blazing Saddles</i>-- except it's not a joke.  The Giants mean serious business: If you
    thought prog-rock was the most titillating genre since fusion jazz, wait until you hear <i>themed</i>
    prog-rock!</p><p>
    
    As the song titles indicate, this album borrows the essence of Crichton camp and injects it into a
    fictionalized world based loosely around the Old West.  Thankfully, the album bears little resemblance to
    its inspiration, other than that it aspires to epic proportions and falls flat.  Valley of the Giants arch
    back to when men wore spurs and met at high noon to exchange bullets, but fail to capture the suspense
    inherent in the world they interpolate.</p><p>
    
    Valley of the Giants comprise a cross-section of the hip-as-shit Canadian instrumental and experimental pop
    scene.  Anthony Seck of Shalabi Effect and Sophie Trudeau of Godspeed You! Black Emperor claim to have
    brainstormed <i>Westworld</i> in (what else?) an old Ontario farmhouse in the dead of winter.  Soon after,
    Brendan Canning (Broken Social Scene), Charles Spearin (Do Make Say Think), Deidre Smith (Strawberry), and
    Raoul Tanguey joined them on a runaway train to concept album hell.</p><p>
    
    If anything holds <i>Westworld</i> back, it's the thematic mandates of a concept album.  Much of the music
    is palatable, but the western theme is a malady, as the record's lazy tremolo guitars move at roughly the
    pace of tumbleweed.  The album's eight songs tend to hover around the eight- or nine-minute mark, with the
    laborious ""Waiting to Catch a Bullet"" clocking in at an even ten.  Sophie Trudeau's influence is at once
    the album's greatest asset and detractor: Like Godspeed, Valley of the Giants are lost in the ozone and
    take their sweet time getting from place to place-- when there actually is a destination-- but along the
    way they experiment with lush, atmospheric sounds that at least make the trip endurable.</p><p>
    
    On ""Whaling Tale"", however, the band drops the Stetsons and waxes piscine to produce its most intriguing
    song.  The track features a gently pulsating synthesizer under a spare, reverberating guitar melody, and
    is punctuated by the sporadic ebb and flow of a stuttering drum beat.  On top of the milieu, in wonted
    Godspeed fashion, an old man recalls a bizarre and oddly moving story of how a penguin is gobbled up by
    a killer whale.  The song is a sure spoiler for a happy mood, and an awkward fit on this otherwise
    ineffectual album, and exemplifies what these talented musicians could accomplish if they only dropped
    their obsession with a world that's tricky to portray in any form of modern music without sounding cheeky.</p><p>
<i>Westworld</i> seems like the type of album with which its musicians would be quite satisfied: It
    accomplishes most of what it attempts to do in deliberate and virtuosic fashion.  The crisp production
    is an unnecessary aid to the deft musicianship, which shows more discipline than most solo-afflicted
    prog-rock.  However, like The Mars Volta's <i>Deloused in the Comatorium</i>, it suffers the gravest of
    musical illnesses: lackluster content.  The songs on <i>Westworld</i>, put simply, just aren't very
    provocative.  Spiraling acoustic guitars lack the dramatic buildup and restraint needed to make their
    prominent figures interesting, while their driving, amplified counterparts would serve well as a soundtrack
    for an enraged motorcyclist.  Prog-rock is not and never will be ""hip""; the members of Valley of the Giants
    should stick to their roots, and not try to supplant them with indulgent experiments.</p></div>"|8522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8522-westworld/|5.0|Sam Ubl

    wit, that ""there was only one thing more dystopic and frightening than [Company Flow]; I believe it was
    called the Zaire dictatorship.""  First of all, maybe a certain international publication should learn some
    grammar rules.  Secondly, it turns out the Zaire dictatorship has inadvertently inflamed some of the best
    hip-hop of the last decade.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Rough Guide</i> series has never been particularly relevant (unless one considers classical compositions
    from feudal Beijing in tune with today's <i>Billboard</i> heatseekers).  How they'll ever manage to convince
    enough geriatric socialites to purchase a compilation focusing on what will eventually be the hippest genre
    in the Rocafella world is one for the ages.  In case you've forgotten, the last significant encounter with
    African rap was Dead Prez's description of the continent as ""camouflage fatigues and dashikis, somewhere
    between NWA and PE,"" which makes Africa sound less like a diverse and gigantic continent and more like an
    army surplus store.</p><p>
    
    The problem, of course, is that in the era this compilation charts (1989-2000), portions of Africa actually
    were a QuarterMaster Supply Store.  Adding innumerable cases of an inexorably deadly disease to the poverty,
    rampant carnage, and natural disasters didn't exactly help matters.  Coming to this compilation from a
    culture where the most pressing social issue is Ludacris' right to sell Pepsi is like walking straight into
    The Garden of Progressive Socialism.  The parties on this disc are not based on bling or bounce, but on
    stifling child abuse, AIDS and civil war.</p><p>
    
    This is not most people's definition of a raging block party.  And the artists here are well aware of how
    difficult it is to instill enlightening, even revolutionary, sentiments into svelte, mellow jazz and calypso
    samples.  The opener, ""Right Here in Front of You"", opens with frond eaves whispering over crystal percussion,
    abating brass patches, and lulling clicks and hums.  But the chorus might as well be off <i>It Takes a Nation
    of Millions</i> and the lyrics assail everything from gun control laws to carbon dioxide and dodecahedron-haters
    amongst such elliptical sense-jumbles as, ""Mainstream, can I piss in a puddle/ Then represent a bug like a
    kiss in a cuddle?""  Let's see the mainstream get out of that one.  Ghana's Reggie Rockstone injects ""Eye Mo
    De Anna"" with cracking planks of Fela samples, but litters it with apocalyptic catastro-tympanis and clinically
    insane mutterings about Pope John Paul and Columbus.  Mozambique's Mabulu lounges in a disconcerting marrabenta
    shanty before a young upstart with a gruff, cavernous cry goes Groucho all over the senior citizen cruise
    ship.  Oh, and it was recorded in the middle of the worst flood since Noah.  Kanye West's jaw has nothing
    to complain about now.</p><p>
    
    Things tend to encroach upon hardcore rap deep within the second side, where even the softest song pledges
    that ""my Babylon eats suckas for breakfast.""  Cape Town's Prophets of Da City is a sustained basement rumble
    that creeps through drowning alto to reach a flow that uncannily resembles Del tha Funkee Homosapien as it
    reels off an inner city hit list with an idolatry so ironic it's almost imperceptible at times.  Similarly,
    we might as well just call off the race and proclaim Kalamashaka's ""Ni Wakati"" the apex of globe-hop or
    Diaspora-rap or whatever we call these sorts of things.  Like all great political rap intros, a Malcolm X
    sample manifests a Mafiosi Mancini riff clouded by rasping, stultified Swahili, like Mobb Deep with severe
    lung damage.  ""Msimu Kwa Msimu"" is all rattling violin histrionics severed by absorbed synths and dire
    handclaps, and, like all great pop songs, I have absolutely no idea what the lyrics mean.  This raises the
    question of whether it's simply ignorant to listen to rap performed in obscure languages that have essentially
    no decipherable cognates.  Put it like this: Pee Froiss' ""Djalgaty"" is regrettably the African version of
    ""Make 'Em Say Ugh"", but no one will even remember the beat because the lunatic lyricists are running a
    scorched-earth campaign through everyone's brains in the Wolof dialect.</p><p>
    
    As this is a ""rap and rap-inspired"" comp, a few songs coast in on good faith, shutting down any momentum and
    failing to really serve as primers to these other permutations of African ""rap.""  While it would be heresy
    to denounce Manu Dibango (of African Jazz fame), his contribution is the definition of anonymous ""world
    music,"" with harmless, desensitized flute and sax solos falling asleep to one another.  Unless you're making
    out or on a family road trip (or some combination of the two), there's no reason to twiddle your thumbs
    through eight minutes of this.</p><p>
    
    Those jokers at <i>Rough Guide</i> shouldn't be blamed for these lapses, though.  They're trying to summarize
    an entire continent of music and that's simply too daunting for one album.  Necessarily, many luminaries and
    trendsetters from dozens of countries were neglected.  If there was a North American version of this, it
    would include K-Ci &amp; Jojo, Cannibal Ox, and ""Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)"", and it would be enough of a
    disaster to hit an 8.2 on the Richter scale.  In contrast, the genius of this album is that it locates the
    subtle differences while retaining a motivated sense of cohesiveness which is impressive when you're dealing
    with all of Africa.</p></div>"|2038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2038-the-rough-guide-to-african-rap/|7.6|Alex Linhardt

After Alan Licht ranked it     in his Minimalist Top Ten, that tape-- a ferocious wail titled <i>You Are My Everlovin'</i>, which slashed     like Tony Conrad and Eck Robertson in a straight-razor fight-- finally made it to the CD age.  From that     point onward, numerous other Flynt releases have appeared, documenting a powerful and prolific artist, and     revealing a moonshine and meth to his madness.</p>
<p>Following two excellent explorations of Flynt's obsession with the demented drone behind mountain music on     his <i>Back Porch Hillbilly Blues</i> series, the Locust label digs up dead weathermen from the basement     tapes for their fifth release by the man, documenting a (lone?) rehearsal from 1966.  Though he's more     renowned these days for his bow-pulling and unfettered dancing, he'd just learned guitar by way of the     Velvets' Lou Reed at the time of <i>I Don't Wanna</i>, and was rolling tape with a drummer/sculptor named     Walter De Maria.  Soon forgoing the crackling thunder of the drums, De Maria would go on to gain international     fame with his <i>Lightning Field</i> sculpture in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Whether you hear his strumming patterns as inept or outsider, goony or genius, Henry Flynt sucks in all     aspects of time for his sound.  He gets that chilling thwack of Dock Boggs' bailing-wire blues from the     20s, the Fugs-frenzy and Godz-idiocy of the Lower East Side in the mid-60s, and anticipates Bob Log III's     90s catgut caterwauling.  The sneer and stumble that constitute protest songs like ""Uncle Sam Do"" and     ""Goodby Wall St."" tremble outside of time.  De Maria, far from the cleanliness of the gallery scene,     pounds and splats in the muck, his ideas of dumped garbage can as snare drum still heard in the trashy     thud of Gibson Brothers, Pussy Galore, and the In the Red label's entire catalog.</p>
<p>With the shuffling rhythm of ""Sky Turned Red"" or the almost-competent keyboards and bass that join in for     ""Corona Del Mar"", you could mistake the duo's basement space for a juke joint, just as the stomp of     ""Missionary Stew"" would pass as a Junior Kimbrough tune, were he backing up The Cramps' Lux Interior.     Over some wiggling squalls of saxophone on ""Jumping"", Flynt strums out clumps of surf-reverb that suggest     more than just a single idea of protest.  Closer ""Dreams Away"" is even further out, a spindizzy solo on     guitar that fidgets and twists before speeding into a blur of white light-- meaning it's quintessential     Flynt.</p></div>"|3288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3288-i-dont-wanna/|7.4|Andy Beta

It's hard to argue with that: The
    Dresden Dolls call themselves ""Brechtian punk,"" meaning they blend the heavy-handedness of punk with the
    overwrought drama of cabaret.  That makes it sound hideously, guiltily entertaining-- which is what I
    expected before hearing the record.</p><p>
    
    If you've never seen their stage show, you can still get an eyeful from this album's black-and-white liner
    photos, which show the duo swooning or flopped like cast-off goth toys.  As a performance artist-- before
    we knew what she could do to a piano-- Amanda Palmer used to pose as an eight-foot-tall ""living statue""
    outside Harvard Square, dressed as in a thrift store bridal gown, blowing kisses or handing out roses for
    dollars.  Clearly she doesn't shy from the spotlight.  Behind her, drummer Brian Viglione looks to be the
    strong silent type: With his matching outfit and stern Jonathan Rhys-Meyers cheekbones, you'd expect to
    see him holding Palmer's bags at the fetish fair.  But Viglione's both precise and tremendous as he
    locksteps behind Palmer, and his battery of percussion tics accentuate her lyrics.</p><p>
    
    As much as they namecheck Brecht, this album-- the Dolls' proper debut, following the out-of-print primer
    <i>A Is for Accident</i>-- runs the gamut from theatrical to poppy, from oldies to showtunes.  Remember
    that piano and drums were all that Jerry Lee Lewis needed to record ""Great Balls of Fire"", and the Dolls
    can match that frenzy.  The world is full of songs about depression, but isn't it a relief to hear someone
    act manic for a change-- as on ""Girl Anachronism"", where Palmer pummels the keys like her skirt's on fire
    while Viglione clatters like a drawerful of razor blades?  Palmer's voice drips and chills through the
    damaged-little-girl songs, but she can also melt into confessionals with melodic melancholy, like Tori
    Amos' punky younger sister.</p><p>
    
    But the roles Palmer plays are even more intriguing.  Sometimes she paints her characters cartoonishly broad,
    like the sinister little girl on ""Missed Me"" or the ""I sound hurt because I am hurt"" acting-out of ""Girl
    Anachronistic""; other songs use the illusions more subtly.  On ""Coin Operated Boy"" she describes the plastic
    boyfriend that gives her ""love without complications,"" and the twist comes when she admits that she can't
    love a real boy because <em>she's</em> too difficult to be with.  The stilted puppet-music shifts to an aching
    bridge that almost swirls her down the drain, until she stops, ties her strings back on and decides to act
    fake again.</p><p>
    
    As clever as the Dolls may be, they know they won't last if they're typecast as the band that writes catchy
    songs about hermaphrodites and self-mutilation; and you can hear them move to steadier terrain, with the
    conventional message (and torrential music) of ""Truce"", a song about a mature emotional compromise.  But
    the listener still has to decide whether to believe the whole act: Are they out for self-pity?  Is the whole
    act just a spectacle, like a young angst freak show?  Or do they know how to make entertainment from misery,
    to purge evil and waltz on its carcass?  Maybe I'm just sucked in by the voice, but I vote for the latter.
    And if it takes them a lot of broad strokes to do it, well, that's probably what punk-cabaret is all about.</p></div>"|2452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2452-dresden-dolls/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

    Infinite is pretty big, I know, but every time I think things have turned into a cul de sac and it's all
    just regurgitation, someone springs something fresh on me and suddenly I can see the roads stretching in
    every direction again, just waiting to be traveled.  Given the constant proliferation of new technologies
    and the shear breadth of possible sounds and combinations, both natural and electronic, it stands to reason
    that there will always be something that hasn't been tried.  There may not be another sea change in music
    the way there was in the late 60s (although one could argue that hip-hop is as revolutionary), but from
    where I stand, several decades after rock's initial evolutionary explosion, I can't possibly see it
    stagnating completely.</p><p>
    
    The more music I listen to, the more likely this possibility seems, and as long as there are albums like
    The Cansecos' self-titled debut out there waiting to be heard, I'm not changing my theory a bit.  I don't
    know what's caused this sudden run of creativity in Toronto, but ingenuity seems to run in the blood of
    the musicians there, from collectives like Broken Social Scene and Do Make Say Think to loners like Manitoba
    and The Russian Futurists.  The Cansecos fit somewhere in between all that stuff; the work of sometime
    filmmaker Bill Halliday (no relation to the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Roy) and Upper Class label head
    Gareth Jones (not the guy who produced Clinic's <i>Internal Wrangler</i>) is decidedly rooted in solid,
    straightforward melody, and branches from those roots into strange and distinctive sonic territory, a
    whirring mix of the obsolete and the absolutely modern.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the excellent mission statement ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" with off-handed,
    double-tracked vocals over acoustic guitar and spare drum programming.  The beats ramp up to the chorus,
    building to a dancefloor frenzy and then back down for the next verse.  Those relaxed, even vocals are the
    core of every song, and though Jones and Halliday aren't going to share poet laureate honors for Ontario
    any time soon, they spin some interesting verses, such as Jones' ""Business hopes religion chokes the life
    out of religious folks/ So we all can safely consume/ And make those dollars and cents,"" from ""In Bloom"",
    a song awash in harp samples and swishing ambience.  The watery echo and soft-hued keyboard of ""This Girl
    and This Boy"" create a Spector epic in miniature, a Wall of Sound that's more return-to-the-womb than
    wrecking crew, but nonetheless overwhelming.</p><p>
    
    There are plenty of BBC Radiophonic Workshop synths winding and warbling their way through the textures
    The Cansecos create-- ""This Small Disaster"" even borders on microtonalism with its buzzing, wavering
    patches-- and much of what the duo does parallels the work of Dan Snaith's Manitoba in terms of dynamics
    and sonics, respectively.  This album was recorded between 2000 and 2002, and as such it's difficult to
    pinpoint exactly what they were taking in; regardless, they've made such a complete and accessible whole
    out of it that they can call the sound their own.  With luck, it'll take less than two whole years for The
    Cansecos to dream up a follow-up to this incredibly promising debut, but even if it does, this album pushes
    just a little further in pop's great infinite, and definitely deserves to be heard.</p></div>"|1753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1753-the-cansecos/|8.2|Joe Tangari

    called Funkadelic music.  If you try to sit on air, you're gonna fall, I bet you.  And man, I was in a
    place called Keeprunning, Mississippi onetime, and I heard something on my way.  Sounded a little something
    like raw funk to me, so I slowed down and took a listen.  And this is all I could hear: Soul is a ham hock

    that replaced the rain since I met you.  Do you feel the fire in your veins?  I can't free my mind.  I'm

    Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time, for y'all have knocked her up.  I was not offended.  I read
    an old quotation in a book just yesterday that said, ""Gonna reap just what you sow.""  Can you get to that?
    You can shake it to the east, shake it to the west but GOOD GOD HIT IT AND QUIT IT.  And if in our tears
    we don't learn to share with our brothers, you know that hate is gonna keep on multiplying.  Your maggot

    Eeny, meeny, miney mo, catch a junkie by the toe.  If he hollers, let him go.  If he don't, do the loose
    booty.  Snorting his New York dope, went into a nod.  Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet snorting some
    THC.  Along came a spider, slid down beside her and said, ""What's in the bag, bitch?""  Skin it back and
    monkey it.  I don't know but I've been told that dog's a man best friend.  And I call my baby pussy, spell
    it P-U-S-S-Y.  And the animal instinct in me makes me want to defend me.  It makes me want to live when
    it's time to die.  I believe in god.  She's the devil, and I like it.  When she comes, I'll be there to

    wrong with making her call me ""daddy?""  I said, ""All looks are not alike and all holes are not a crack.""
    She said, ""No compute.""  But I could tell she was interested.  Everybody is gonna come play in the nappy
    dugout this time, so please don't judge me too strong.  Lord knows I meant no wrong.</p><p>
    
    Who is this bitch?  Thumbing her way to Savannah, she's been cooped up too long.  She promised to do all
    kind of freaky things to me.  I said, ""Be my dog, and I will be your tree and you can pee on me.""  They
    call it mental masturbation.  I want to help you use what you got.  Even if you don't dig it, it don't
    mean it's not the thing to do.  If you don't feel it right now, that don't mean someday it'll turn you
    out.  You really shouldn't ought to fight it.  Reality can be a stiff sometimes.  Think right, and you
    can fly.  Shit, goddamn, GET OFF YOUR ASS AND JAM!  Remember, the kingdom of heaven is within.</p><p>
    
    Pleasure's the motivation for the human race.  Everything starts and ends with sex and appeal.  There's a

    what's going down in you?  Wouldn't you rather fly than die?  Good god.  Look out, here I come, right back

    pull off without landing in snoresville.  In that vein, Stockholm, Sweden's Tape succeeds where other
    ""folktronica"" acts noodle themselves into a corner or fall prey to an over-determined laptop.  On <i>Milieu</i>,
    the trio's second album, the compositions are carefully and emotionally layered, a midnight Fahey/Parch
    pantomime against a rusted silo.</p><p>
    
    Birthed patiently by lamplight, <i>Milieu</i>'s unspoken landscape is inhabited by a sleepytime progression
    of percussive washes, analog whirls, acoustic arpeggios.  Beneath it, there's a sense that the ever-present
    vibraphone and glockenspiel are tapping out a secret language.  It follows the tone set by its successor,
    <i>Opera</i>, but the nocturnal rumbles are more tuneful with less static downstrokes.  Overall, there are
    more flourishes to rustle the upper branches: Andreas and Johan Berthling and Tomas Hallonsten blend
    acoustic instruments, electronics and field recordings in a way that shows the stitching but isn't collagist.
    It's the barroom mope of Tom Waits' <i>Closing Time</i> re-approached by Tortoise.</p><p>
    
    Or perhaps it's just easy listening.  The tracks are brief and contain enough spaciousness to allow
    counterpoint and rhythmic variance, but also solid melodies and even hooks.  Some kindred spirits are
    Cincinnati-based Joshua Treble, Tim Hecker, Talk Talk, a less avant Gastr del Sol, or an ultra-concise
    Fennesz.  The closest approximation for me, however, is The Books, though Tape show more restraint and
    are apt to stick to a single voice rather than to pour all the samples on the table.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""Oak Player"", a gentle folk recital with vibraphone, guitar arpeggios, bells, flutters,
    brushed cymbal taps and rides, synth notes, chimes, and maybe a harmonium, among other things.  I once saw
    a guy in a tuxedo play an orchestra of variously filled water glasses, and this comes close to eliciting
    similarly understated awe.  There isn't much to it, but what's there is done skillfully.  It's the kind of
    compositional purity that people often mar with sappy vocal samples or clips, and here they continue the
    firefly minuet without puncturing the spell.  For me, it's a late Spring night on a roof in the suburbs--
    catching the honeysuckle smell of an overgrown lot across the street-- listening to the street lights turn
    off and on and off.  Buds, birds and unopened flowers emerging from a cardboard box.</p><p>
    
    ""Sponge Charms"" continues treading between melancholia, nostalgia and joviality.  Horns, keyboard, and
    guitar are backed by a tableau of static and loosening cables that drift through the same soporific ring
    of the first track: tiny toys walking in twos, cricket cut-ups, the aquatic-evoking sounds of a tape
    rewinding, New Years noise makers muffled beneath a foot of snow and ice and performed as accompaniment
    to a waltz.  The track empties out with the sweeping sounds of dried weeds, sand, pine needles, underwater
    monsters-- a small-scale take on Nurse With Wound's <i>Salt Marie Celeste</i>, but in a cedar pond. There's
    a definite sense of submersion.</p><p>
    
    Otherwise, I love the sloppiness of the synthesizer on ""Golden Twig"": The garish highs and lows mop over
    the lapsteel and vibe as accented flutters move between speakers like insects escaping a net, butterflies
    losing their maps, someone choreographing a bug light.  And on ""Switchboard Fog"", the album's strongest
    track (and its closer), you can feel another sort of agglomeration, a ragtag orchestra of tired hobos
    building to a rousing crescendo of piano, accordion, synthesizer, and violin and finally getting it right:
    One note at a time leaps to an ecstatically lilting, jam-packed ending.  It's actually heartbreaking, like
    the finale of some tear-jerk film.</p><p>
    
    A number of these eight tracks create similar epiphanies, like you're bearing witness to a colt being born
    in some stable somewhere-- all damp and new and creaky on its legs, looking left and right and figuring
    what this new container involves, if escape's a possibility.  It can be unwise to make effusive claims for
    tiny music, but by allowing the space for this sort of interpretation, Tape's creation also increases in
    size. These Swedes never come forward to say much about who they are or what they're doing; they allow the
    music to amble with charmed grace, leaving it to you to provide the picture.</p></div>"|7938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7938-milieu/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

    which is a probably just a generous allusion to the fact that Saville and Ryan have acquired an acoustic
    guitar and a glockenspiel in the interim.  Certainly, many of the predominant textures in Isan's music
    have become more organic with this release, but their songs still float by as ever, in a pleasant but
    amorphous mist of brightly struck notes that hang together for brief seconds before evaporating from memory.</p><p>
    
    The sheer volume of notes that percolate through <i>Meet Next Life</i> might insinuate it to be a melodic
    record, but the truth is that by tinting the room with its persistence of texture, it functions more like
    ambient music than anything else.  Relying on things like wood blocks and winding watches for rhythms,
    Isan don't seem to pay much mind to the low end of the frequency spectrum.  Just as with ambient, there's
    a bias here towards the middle and upper frequency registers-- anything to make the music swirl and hover.</p><p>
    
    And so it does, almost relentlessly.  The songs pass into each other without fanfare or much in the way of
    differentiation.  Aside from the breezy, guitar-aided opener ""Birds Over Barges"", the insistent chug of
    ""Iron Eyes"" and the miniature waltz of ""Sat73"", <i>Meet Next Life</i> feels transitional, incidental and
    affectedly dainty-- like the intermission music between acts of a stage production being put on by
    Playmobil toys.</p><p>
    
    The last five years have already yielded more than enough records that sound like the precious machinations
    of a miniature cuckoo clock, and surely Isan have been responsible for their fair share of those.  But as
    this particular chapter of laptop electronica passes on, suffocated by a bubblegum pink avalanche of similarly
    superfluous records, one can't help but think that Isan need nothing short of a massive Notwist-shaped
    U-turn to veer out of the self-parody zone.</p><p>
    
    Well, that and possibly a secondhand harpsichord.  Harpsichords never hurt anyone.</p></div>"|4149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4149-meet-next-life/|5.1|Mark Pytlik

    in 1996 to birth his requisite side project, the scraggly-but-earnest 20 Miles.  Having convinced brother
    Donovan to spend four hours crouched in a studio, cranking out boorish, slappy blues-rock for the In the
    Red label (the session yielded a triple seven-inch package later that year), Bauer stumbled, unassumingly,
    into an entirely new musical pursuit: 20 Miles mixes American roots with scrappy blues rambling, fusing
    bar-band rock with ample rockabilly rolls.  Shuffling through a variety of players (no two 20 Miles records
    boast quite the same lineup-- 2002's <i>Keep It Coming</i> was recorded in Bauer's New York apartment, with
    cameos from friends and neighbors), Bauer also secured himself an artistic outlet that is, shockingly, far
    more stable than his previous outfit.  The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's discography is notoriously mottled,
    and 20 Miles is Bauer's golden opportunity to wail consistent.</p><p>
    
    Each of <i>Life Doesn't Rhyme</i>'s eleven tracks are strikingly coherent, near-infallible in their dogged
    composure.  Accessible and clear, the album is easily 20 Miles' most sophisticated record to date, a
    superlative Bauer earned by sheepishly abandoning all the goofy, bleeding jubilance that made JSBX so
    hopelessly scattered.  Now, Bauer's guitar shoots swiftly through his band's basic roots-rock, establishing
    prominence while still eschewing loping solos; Bauer's vocals, clean and wobbly, humbly offer quiet,
    plaintive observations (""My dirty laundry tops the list of my confusion"").</p><p>
    
    Written in just eighteen days and recorded at London's lovingly archaic Toe Rag studios (on some presumably
    ancient gear), <i>Life Doesn't Rhyme</i> is still gloriously loose, far closer to the Delta blues in spirit
    than in sound: Musically, there's not too much here (beyond the obvious rock citations) to compare to Bauer's
    stubbly Fat Possum labelmates, but he's still tapped into the prickly honesty of classic blues yowlers--
    nothing here is overwrought or unfelt.</p><p>
    
    The moping ""Gypsy Babe"" feels like swallowing a mugful of molasses, a slow, meandering love song layered
    over organ, bass, and drums-- thick and dripping, the track is also stubbornly subdued, Bauer's vocals
    barely rising and falling with the melody.  ""Drown the Whole World"" opens with backwards guitar-swishing,
    Bauer's voice bouncing overhead; ""Ship Is Sinking Fast"" folds in piano and bold vocal confessions, a
    throbbing bassline backing up questions like, ""Who's gonna be the judge?  Who's gonna be the hangman?""</p><p>
    
    Depending on how you like your blues (and in a post-Stripes rock landscape, we should all have a preference),
    20 Miles will either be a curious footnote to or a welcome antidote from Bauer's work with the Blues Explosion.
    Solidly written and powerfully played, <i>Life Doesn't Rhyme</i> is an unflinching slice of American rock.</p></div>"|8254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8254-life-doesnt-rhyme/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

Subtraction is supposed to be about
    deduction, isn't it? Musically, one would think it would whittle away elements of a sound and reduce sonic possibilities. Yet by turning down the bombast and thrust of house, producers
    have been able to explore the space between its rhythm and melody and revel in the push and pull of placing delicate, avant-glitch alongside oft-direct melodies and regimented beats.
    The result is that microhouse has been one of the more durable, inclusive sounds of the past few years.</p><p>
    On Tobias Thomas' mix <i>Smallville</i>, he illuminates microhouse's gentle shading by artfully constructing a mix that goes from a whisper to, not a scream but certainly a clamor,
    without any neck snapping. <i>Smallville</i> is Tobias Thomas' second mix for Kompakt, following 2000's <i>Für Dich</i>, which featured Wolfgang Voight (Gas), Lali Puna, Vladislav
    Delay (Luomo), and Crane A.K, among others. This time the mix is far from primarily Cologne-based, or even a purely German sound: <i>Smallville</i> includes producers from upwards
    of six countries.</p><p>
    There are few actual Kompakt releases here-- and not everything is even proper microhouse-- but they all share the label and sound's basic aesthetic. The diversity of the record ranges
    from Dntel's hushed vocals and acoustic-electronic shuffle to the tasteful, understated four-on-the-floor of Cologne ""supergroup"" Forever Sweet (Voight, Thomas, and Michael Mayer). Taken
    as individual tracks they could seem disparate and unsettling, but under Thomas' skilled hand the mix gradually unfolds like a sunrise.</p><p>
    Rather than treat the genre as microbic, Thomas takes a microscope to it, highlighting the nuance of these tracks by allowing them to subtlety build on one another. Dntel opens the set with
    ""Season"", a fragile, yawning acoustic-electronic gem. The spirit of Dntel's genre-blending is made more explicit when it feeds into a delicate mashup of Kaito's pillowy, beatless ambient-trance
    pearl ""Release Your Body"" and the vocals of Erlend Øye's ""Ghost Train"", a track from the Kings of Convenience singer's debut that was originally produced by Metro Area's Morgan Geist.</p><p>
    Much of the rest of the record's first half is a blend of click-house and the soothing washes of sound found on the Pop Ambient series. Here the delicate skips of Andres Ilar's ""Onehow"" and
    the glitch-dub of Sten's ""Asami"" peak with the album's psuedo-centerpiece, Jan Jelinek's ""Tendency"".  Jelinek's first single released under his own name, ""Tendency"" was also
    featured on <i>Loop-finding-jazz-records</i>. Here Jelinek's trademark pops and cuts act as a revolving door, fluidly separating the focus on texture and atmosphere of the first
    half of the record from the bass and rhythm of its second side.</p><p>
    As arranged by Thomas, the mix's other producers seem to take ""Tendency"" as a starting point and either bury deeper into Jelinek's enveloping sound or step back and click their heels
    over increasingly pronounced rhythms. Those more traditional house sounds pepper the second half of <i>Smallville</i>, which includes more melodic, 4/4 structures, as evidence by
    tracks from artists on more hyperkinetic labels as Shitkatapult (Sami Koivikko), Tresor (Aril Brikha), and
    Bpitch Control (Feadz).</p><p>
    Thomas indicates that he had a specific intent in mind when he created the record, calling <i>Smallville</i> a ""musical try to compare the structures of living in small communities with the
    restrictions and possibilities of the dance community."" Hey, that's super. There really isn't much to clue the listener in on that information here-- instead the wide range of sounds allows a
    wide range of listener responses. What is clear, however, is that this is a dance mix arranged for doing the standing still, crafted as for solitary moments. It's a record that starts with brittle
    bedsit intimacy and, once its hooks unfold, just might soundtrack a solo bounce around your room.</p></div>"|8023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8023-smallville/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

Between
    their 45th Jon Langford release and doling out Graham Parker's latest to the minuscule number who still
    give a shit, Rob and Nan occasionally treat us to something worth listening to, as sometime Lambchop
    collaborator and WPA Ballclub leader Paul Burch's latest offering proves.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of five records, Burch has continuously reminded listeners that he's carefully studied his
    Johnny Cash, George Jones, Hank Sr., et al.  <i>Fool for Love</i> does not stray at all from his formula,
    and most of the tracks here would not sound at all out of place if inserted randomly into 2000's Merge
    release <i>Blue Notes</i>.  While there's no song as sublime as that album's ""Isolda"" (still a mix CD winner),
    this record's push and pull between boom-chicka-boom twangers and high lonesome balladry is essentially
    without an outright weak moment.</p><p>
    
    Burch's lyrical prowess could certainly never be confused with the Elvis Costellos of the world, but the
    focus implied by the record's title is maintained to a strength. The narrator of ""Bad Girl That She Used
    to Be"" effectively evokes the hapless sucker that falls for some dirty slut only to delude himself that
    his love has redeemed her from her days of getting triple-teamed by some Theta Chis. (I mean, who hasn't been
    through something similar?  Well, I mean, I haven't, but this friend of mine...)  In ""Call My Name"", the
    shy-guy hides his ""face behind a Belgian Chimay"" as an understated pedal steel whines his tale.  And while
    ""Sparks Fly Out"" is a touch obvious, Burch's halting vocal delivery is worthy of the album's only
    falling-in rather than -out-of-love song.</p><p>
    
    While the first half of the record has its winners (the opener ""Lovesick Blues Boy"" and the aforementioned
    ""Bad Girl"" come to mind), ""Fool for Love"" surges in the second half. ""Moments of Weakness"" and especially
    ""Like Railroad Steel"" use traditional instrumentation to hit Sun Records-style highs. ""Steel"" and closer
    ""My Last Match"" are heavy on the simile and metaphor, but each are in keeping with the theme.  And when the
    narrator of ""Match"" uses that spark to ""leave this building burning,"" one can only hope that he's used the
    flames to light a Camel as well.</p><p>
    
    Let's be straight: There are really no surprises here.  And if you're the sort of listener that agrees with
    the 5.9 afforded <i>Blue Notes</i> here at Pitchfork upon its release, there's certainly nothing on Burch's
    latest that would change your mind.  That being said, February, with its endless gray and holiday for lovers,
    is the perfect month to pop open a Chimay and drink along with the parade of sad and lonely losers that Paul
    Burch and various members of the Ballclub introduce us to on this eminently enjoyable release.</p></div>"|1021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1021-fool-for-love/|7.0|Chris Drabick

Some albums cannot be fully experienced
    save a complete discontinuation of the outside world.  The inner retreat of headphone listening sheds light
    on a group's true colors; the makeup rubs off, and leaves us to discover all the flaws and inconsistencies
    in the music's resplendent left/right asymmetry.  What on speakers sounds like an extension of a refrigerator's
    hum may upon closer inspection be revealed as a delicate, pulsating harmony that draws together an otherwise
    lifeless song.  Ambient noises, effects and other tricks are also often lost by stereo speakers' capricious
    playback tendencies.  For such intricate and subtle records, only headphones paint a just portrait, and
    while they limit themselves to a narrow environment, their payoff can be duly satisfying.</p><p>
<i>You Forgot It in People</i>, the album that brought Broken Social Scene due prestige last spring, wasn't
    one of those albums.  Though it sounded just as great in the isolation of Prestige Series Grados, the record
    was a bona fide speaker blaster, full of craggy, overdriven guitar lines and unabashed vocals.  It pulled
    few punches and refused to drown its populism in reverb or overblown production.  Part of its appeal was its
    vulnerability: the diversity of musical styles and songwriting voices, the unashamedly tuneless vocals on
    songs like ""Looks Just Like the Sun"".  Yet somehow, all its elements came together perfectly to create a
    work of accidental genius.  So it may come as a shock for fans of that record to discover that Broken Social
    Scene premiered as just another of Canada's many instrumental post-rock bands.  Their debut album, <i>Feel
    Good Lost</i>, features only two separate instances of distorted guitars or impassioned vocals (the raspy
    strumming on ""Love and Mathematics"" and the sober murmuring on ""Passport Radio"", respectively)-- which seems
    like a great disappointment until you get up close and personal with the record, and realize just how greatly
    it informed its successor.</p><p>
<i>Feel Good Lost</i> is the sort of album that does lend itself to intimate listening, and while not nearly
    as inventive or as well-rounded a statement as <i>You Forgot It in People</i>, it owns its fair share of
    dazzling moments.  The similarity between the two records has more to do with their spirit than with their
    sound: <i>Feel Good Lost</i> isn't a rock album, but the band affects the same cogitating melancholia that
    made <i>You Forgot It in People</i> so intimate-- in fact, that record's bittersweet warmth is even more
    prominent here.</p><p>
    A sense of historical influence permeates the recording, creating a pleasant sense of familiarity.  The
    tangled, chorused guitars of ""Guilty Cubicles"" evoke Durutti Column at their ethereal best, while a track
    like ""Stomach Song"" possesses a blasé cheerfulness that stretches back to Nico-era Velvet Underground.
    ""Stomach Song"", in particular, feels affable, featuring a mumbled, repetitive soliloquy, delivered by a
    breathy female voice over a loop of jumbled talking that at times sounds like an unlikely precursor to
    The Books' patented crowd-sampling.  Some newer influences have also wrestled their way into the mix:
    ""Passport Radio"", with its quavering strings and heart-pulse bassdrum, conjures Sigur Rós circa <i>Agaetis
    Byrjun</i>.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Broken Social Scene's few attempts to step outside the narrow coordinates of <i>Feel Good
    Lost</i>'s overarching vibe don't always yield successful results-- which is surprising, given how skillfully
    <i>You Forgot It in People</i> navigated the pop strata.  Part of the problem is that the band seems too
    attached to the things it does well.  The record maintains a laser-like focus that runs through all twelve
    songs.  Any and all detours are taken with noticeable wariness, such as ""Prison Province"", a spare, two-minute
    porno-esque guitar track that left me slightly bemused, as did the percussion on ""Last Place"", which wouldn't
    sound out of place in a Lexus commercial.  The song is the album's longest, and at over eight minutes of
    thin, repetitive drones, it's by far the least engaging track in Broken Social Scene's catalog.</p><p>
<i>Feel Good Lost</i> is balanced nicely, however, by various embellishments which help break the occasional
    monotony, and even hint at the more confident band that produced last year's paramount orch-pop opus: A
    harmonica breathes life into the feeble ""Blues for Uncle Gibb""; rustic strings add a fragile touch of
    broke-down sadness to ""Mossbreaker""; diced drum loops drive the otherwise subdued ""Love and Mathematics"".
    <i>Feel Good Lost</i> may inhabit a much smaller plot of land than its successor, but the ground on which
    it rests has been just as thoroughly reared and cultivated.</p></div>"|953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/953-feel-good-lost/|7.5|Sam Ubl

Rather than obfuscating songs with grating noise and ostensibly atypical structures, Stewart challenges the most fundamental conventions of musical expression and honesty with an intensity that's often been misread as parody, irony or cheap theatrics.  Thus, while Xiu Xiu's music has continued to gain support in recent years, it's rare to hear a recommendation that isn't qualified with some sort of hesitant apology for the band's atypical instrumentation and over-the-top delivery.</p><p>  Well, all that can end right now.  After showing tremendous musical growth on last year's <em>A Promise</em>, Stewart has come frighteningly close to producing his masterwork-- an album that's as accessible as it is unconventionally affecting.  On <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>, Stewart plays with dissonance without succumbing to it, contorting electronic drones, drum machine beats and his own haunting tenor into a propulsive and elegant record.  The songs are often tremendously dense, but the combinations and contrast Stewart teases out of the mix are always immediate and striking.  Indeed, the quality of the melodic and instrumental interplay here is right up there with many more straightforward pop bands, but Stewart manages to use it to an entirely different end.  Detached from the safety and set form of traditional pop music, <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> is an album bursting with tension, tenderness, pain, and restraint-- concepts that have informed Xiu Xiu's music from the beginning, but which the band has never so deftly expressed.</p><p>  ""Crank Heart"" immediately establishes <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> as both accessible and deeply layered. Perfectly balancing melody, energy and chaos, the song sounds as if it's ready to blow apart at any minute, held together only by a hauntingly present force of will.  The tension increases on the album's title track, which appeared last year on a split EP with the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up.  This new version foregoes the spooky atmospherics and whirring spaceship sounds of the EP version in lieu of a chilling, almost self-punishing restraint.</p><p>  This restraint is often shaken by an underlying intensity, best conveyed on ""I Luv the Valley OH!"", quite possibly the finest single track Xiu Xiu has ever released.  ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" is an immediately accessible song, but also a profoundly subversive one.  Mimicking traditional pop forms while simultaneously defiling them, the intrinsic discomfort of ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" comes through in both its structure and its articulation.  The song's titular scream provides the frozen emotional centerpiece for a feverish and insistent dirge, and a rare moment of absolute release amidst an album often marked by a chilling sense of emotional confinement.</p><p>  Only once does <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> threaten to descend into absolute cacophony.  On the harrowing ""Support Our Troops (Black Angels OH!)"", Stewart tackles politics with characteristic intensity.  Rather than hiding behind tried-and-true anti-war sloganeering, Stewart delves into the troubling psychology of war.  Whether or not the sentiments expressed here are ""correct"" is entirely moot-- what's striking about the song is not so much its direct political implications, but the overwhelming and sincere sense of human terror that permeates it.</p><p>  Part of what makes this record so powerful, though, is the fact that this darkness often lifts.  On ""Clowne Towne"", Stewart sings, ""Your true self has become weak, alone, and annoying/ A true ridiculous dumbass,"" in an oddly sweet combination of fondness and frustration that fits perfectly into a disarmingly catchy song. ""Little Panda McElroy"", which first appeared on the same split EP as ""Fabulous Muscles"", remains one of the most poignant and complicated love songs I've ever heard.  With lyrics like, ""I can stop wanting to kill myself.../ Because of you,"" this is about as far from your typical, rote and sterile love song as you can get.  This version offers an even more moving musical exploration, as Stewart's breathy voice is subsumed by pulsing electronic drones into a single, insistent beat.</p><p>  Though there are many notable high points to <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>, its overwhelming consistency is what cements its place as Xiu Xiu's finest.  The album does not contain a single hiccup or yawn-- no extraneous noise, no potentially offputting histrionics, no throwaways and no dull moments.  <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>, like the best of Xiu Xiu's catalog, is challenging not because it's particularly dissonant or noisy, but rather because it addresses you in a manner that's categorically different from what you've come to expect from any kind of music-- pop, experimental or otherwise.  With <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>, Jamie Stewart continues to explore and expand this mode of address, and in doing so has made an album that is profound, innovative, and absolutely vital.</p><p> </p></div>"|8826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8826-fabulous-muscles/|9.0|Matt LeMay

Back in the day, those
    comfortable with his modern classical accomplishments were baffled by his acetates of loopy leftfield
    disco.  Likewise, lovers of these dance tracks were confounded by their beatless, beatific recasting
    on <i>World of Echo</i>.  And then there were listeners astounded by the intimacy of his voice and cello
    work, stymied by both the pop songs and the classical works, all spinning in a vicious cycle of artistic
    assumptions.</p><p>
    
    Smug with the presumption that I could accept all of his work, here comes the first release from the label
    now responsible for the Herculean task of gleaning the contents of hundreds of hours' worth of unreleased
    music from Arthur's tape archives.  Culled from an unreleased album from 1985 called <i>Corn</i> and another
    slated for release on Rough Trade but never solidified, <i>Calling Out of Context</i>'s twelve tracks are
    unlike anything I've ever heard from the man.</p><p>
    
    Consider the immediately striking ""The Platform on the Ocean""; gone is the personal, arm-hair rubbed dub of
    cello, the atom-heart palpitations of layered drum skins, the murmuring, translucent voice in the chilly
    discofloor of space.  In its stead is the rigorous drive of programmed drums and a heavily distorted cello
    that fuzzes like The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, chopping up the surface of the song.  Arthur's killer whalesong
    voice, often a lone entity, bobs in multi-tracked rounds like schools of jellyfish on the unplumbed depths.
    He sings about seeing the fish beneath him, yet he also hears the steam room churn behind him, and it makes
    for seven minutes of cycling pop strained between the pull of fluid motion and a more mechanistic push.</p><p>
    
    I'm so used to hearing Russell be ahead of his time (the cover even shows him anticipating hipster style
    with a crooked trucker's cap!), that I'm surprised to find these twelve pop songs are simply of his time.
    While long-time collaborator Mustafa Sidahmed provides a good deal of percussion, he bolsters the beats with
    drum machines that would sound more familiar on a Mantronix track or Patti LaBelle comeback. The keyboard
    intro to ""That's Us/Wild Combination"" could pass for a Mike Post theme song, but while the production is
    shiny at points, there's just enough of that innate, anachronistic ability of Arthur's that-- though it
    marred his career during his lifetime-- has guaranteed critical resurrection ever since his passing in
    1992.</p><p>
    
    With all these cheesy earmarks of an era, Arthur makes it seem unfamiliar: synth-pop in an alternate reality.
    ""I Like You!"" takes simple sentiment and slices it with tin-canned handclaps, serrated cello, and ancient
    arcade game bleeps.  ""Calling All Kids"" takes a digital keychain and sets it as a destabilizing sound effect
    throughout the song, robotically intoning that ""grown-ups are crazy.""  Despite the factory presets that date
    ""Arm Around You"", Arthur's watery vocals convey that endearing, universal gesture of touching a lover's face
    yet never quite overcoming the space in-between.  A poignant koan reiterates throughout the song: ""All alone
    and right next to you/ What I'm doing in a fine, this fine stretch of time.""  As the title track runs on,
    the comforting cello and percussion rises up between the drum machine hits, and Arthur echoes through the
    space, conjuring both the Iowa fields of his youth and the Indian Ocean.  There's that axis of intimacy and
    unrecoverable distance, of the tangible and ethereal, dealing with the hardware that makes music and the
    soft machines that do, too, inseparable no matter what song form gets explored.</p><p>
    
    The disc proves Russell to be a changeling artist whose only parallel might be Miles Davis, constantly
    placing his individual sound in new contexts, constantly searching.  But whereas Miles' explorations-- from
    cool nonets and electric washes to on-the-one funk and Cyndi Lauper-- came over a forty year period, Arthur
    did it all at once; the genres undifferentiated in his mind and compacted into the infinity of a single

    label's confidence in the record's profitability, marketability, or general accessibility.  That said,
    <i>Bravehearted</i> was snuck into the week before CD production ceases for Christmas holidays.  Why
    would this happen?  I mean, Nas is on <i>five tracks</i>.  Seriously!  He made <i>Illmatic</i>!  His name
    is on the cover <i>three</i> times.  Surely, this is practically a Nas EP, right?!  And one of the
    Bravehearts is Nas' brother.  But if you think of things in the comedic perspective, Chris Rock and Eddie
    Murphy's brothers are both comedians, too.  Therefore, <i>Bravehearted</i> is effectively the Comedy Central
    special where Mike Rock gets to talk about his brother on TV.</p><p>
    
    In the simplest of terms, Bravehearts sound and rap like Nas.  Except, along with a general lack of charisma
    and a dearth of ridiculous statements, the artists here rap as if they don't know the mic is on, or, at the
    very least, have never actually rapped on record before.  This is bedroom hip-hop with production values and
    Nas saying things he would never say if he didn't already know no one would ever buy the album.</p><p>
    
    In an example of what I call ""dancing like nobody's watching,"" Nas completely loses it on the title track,
    a surprisingly enjoyable bare-bones boom-bap number by Jungle, with flailing horns and cipher-styled vocal
    adlibs.  Mr. Jones goes to Washington, not to talk to the president or transform into a gun (as is his
    custom), but to fornicate with ""horny white nuns"" and ""black dyke ones,"" while ""dressed like Bush.""  And
    then he lets loose the ""You thought Nas kept his ignorance to interviews?"" couplet of 2003: ""I'm Jewish
    like Sammy Davis Jr./ Holding a Louis suitcase with Colin Powell chopped in pieces.""</p><p>
    
    But seriously, if anything, Nas is the reason you might steal this off the Internet, as the short bus
    lyricism of the Bravehearts knows no end.  At one point, Jungle brings about knowledge beyond his years:
    ""I broke a nigga back with a baseball bat/ I crack your fucking skull, you'll need a body bag/ Your family's
    mad and sad, I'LL BE GLAD.""  Worst of all are the choruses that range from the vaguely homoerotic all-male
    singalong of ""Sensations"" (""I get a sensation when you suck my dick/ And you lick my balls"") to the
    girl-on-leash misogyny of ""I Wanna"" (""Baby, I wanna fuck/ I'll be your down-ass slut/ You know I like it
    rough/ You can do it in my butt"").</p><p>
    
    Production-wise, <i>Bravehearted</i> is a consistent style clash that sometimes proves effective but
    ultimately fails.  The tribal ambience and classically raw drum loop (same used on ""Five Man Army""
    by Massive Attack) of ""I Will"" and dark song to the siren assault of Lil Jon's ""Quick to Back Down"" win
    big and distract from the obvious lack of talent on display.  But beats like the Casio cascade and soft
    drums of ""Twilight"" and the harsh harpsichords and sub-Cameo synth whistle of ""Cash Flow"" make you wonder
    if anyone could ever listen to this album without skipping a cut.  Situations where this album might be
    played in rapid succession appear to me in night terrors.  Cult meeting, bumping ""Buss My Gun (For the One
    I Love)"".  I wake up with a start.  Bomb shelter soundtrack of ""Situations"".  Cold sweat.  Nazi death march,
    loud speakers blast ""Sensations"".  My girlfriend leaves me because of my restless sleep.  Fuck you,
    Bravehearts.</p><p>
    
    With skits that are pure mid-90s self-aggrandizing (one involving a confusing anal sex soap opera), the
    most inane choruses ever, awkward flows, uninspired beats and Nas phoning in any number of ""cred-heightening""
    verses, <i>Bravehearted</i> consistently sputters like a broken lawnmower or a shot down WWII warplane...
    fuck.  The dreams are coming back.</p></div>"|1101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1101-bravehearted/|2.5|Rollie Pemberton

From underground promotional vehicles to hobbyist
    experiments for props at local watering holes, the concept of backing familiar voices with unexpected
    surroundings had been all but lost to simpler production clinics with high profile guests.  That is, until
    Danger Mouse (best known for his work with Jemini and Sage Francis) turned a color inference into an
    underground phenomenon with his bootleg conceptual assault, <i>The Grey Album</i>, a remix album that
    pairs the vocals of Jay-Z's <i>Black Album</i> with The Beatles' legendary <i>White Album</i>.</p><p>
    
    By the most basic rules of the homemade remix, the record works: The vocals are on beat, pauses are natural,
    and the background always works thematically with the lyrics.  In these more technical areas, the record
    effectively succeeds.  But the most exciting part of any remix project is hearing whether or not the producer
    can save your least favorite songs, and this is clearly where DM shines.  ""Moment of Clarity"" was the kind
    of awkwardly misplaced synthetic emotion expected from posthumous Tupac records.  Here, however, it's a
    stomping guitar monster, with John Lennon's chopped vocals croaking like one of its victims.  And while
    the original ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" sounded like Timbo going through the motions (if he decided to morph
    into The Neptunes for a day), Danger Mouse's rendition is like Prefuse 73 meeting David Banner, arguing
    chops over handclaps and eventually finding middle ground through a second strangulation of Mr. Lennon.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it isn't all so progressive.  Similar to the fates of ""December 4th"" and ""Change Clothes"", ""What
    More Can I Say"" works on the tone it develops, but ultimately ends up too simple to hold attention.  ""My
    1st Song"" is enjoyable for the harsh drums that DM tracks and the closing statements that have Jay-Z doing
    the Charleston over ""Cry Baby Cry"".  Of course, Shawn Carter's elastic speed-rap is near impossible to
    capture, as evidenced by the distracting guitar-crashing effect which closes off every few couplets.  Most
    glaringly, no remix attempt is made on ""The Threat"", arguably Jay-Z's hardest performance on <i>The Black
    Album</i>, while ""Lucifer"" is sacrificed at the altar of conceptualism: DM simply inverts a couple Jigga
    vocals, chops up vocals and pianos, and inserts a bass riff and orchestral bits from ""I'm So Tired"" and
    ""Revolution 9"".</p><p>
    
    Though DM's takes are obviously more rock-centric than the original Jay-Z tracks, they still manage to be
    undeniably in tune with the spirit of hip-hop.  ""PSA"" is turned from a menacing spin on a Black Moon
    standard to woodland crunk with rings of Robin Hood flute, acoustic finger flicking and truncated outbursts
    from George Harrison.  And ""99 Problems"" turns the obvious rock nod into a slightly more pronounced clinic
    in ""Helter Skelter"" headbanging, with panning walls of guitar sound and a chugging main riff that, in this
    context, reminds me of Kool Keith's ""I'm Destructive"".</p><p>
    
    Danger Mouse was recently issued a cease-and-desist by EMI regarding this project's Beatle-sampling.  While
    he insists the record was intended only as a promotional item, 3,000 copies are already in circulation, and
    one can't help but feel the loom of a forthcoming lawsuit.  So the question now is, was the creative payoff
    of this project worth the possibilities of this potential worst-case-scenario?  Well: While <i>The Grey
    Album</i> is truly one of the more interesting pirate mashups ever done, it ultimately fails at the hands
    of perfectionism with several pieces sounding rushed to beat some other knucklehead to his clever idea.
    Additionally, the missing songs and occasionally poor tracking means the project take a few hits.  Still,
    it's stronger than it ought to be given the disparity between the two artists, and as far as raw experimentation
    goes, it further proves DM as a wildly imaginative producer.  Even taken out of the context of listenability,
    <i>The Grey Album</i> will end up the trivia answer we'll always love to submit.</p></div>"|2540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2540-the-grey-album/|7.7|Rollie Pemberton

The historical analogue to     software-based music seems to be classical composition, where the graphic score was ultimately the     piece.  Computer music is bookish work toiled over during late nights in dingy bedrooms, and the heat     of the moment can't even withstand the wispy breeze of the ventilator fan.  I may never get used to     the idea of ""jamming"" with a wireless mouse.</p>
<p>Still, interesting stuff is happening.  How much laptop improv is actually generated on the leading edge     of ""now"" I may never know, but plenty of good records have been released as such.  <i>Soundchambers</i> developed out of improvisation and one of three players, Ekkehard Ehlers, is on the 1s and 0s.  Joseph     Suchy joins him on guitar, and Franz Hautzinger is on trumpet.  It's a diverse bunch.  Ehlers has a strong     sense of composition and a great ear for texture, he's also prolific as hell and seems to basically     reinvent himself with each new project.  Suchy may be the ultimate Cologne insider, the guy who knows     everybody and has had a hand in at least one release by every label in Germany.  He producers, mixes and     masters, and plays guitar in an odd style without clear reference points.  Franz Hautzinger is a university     prof and regular on the European improv circuit.</p>
<p>On <i>Soundchambers</i>, this crew of German abstractionists locks together to form a constantly shifting     musical triangle.  Each of these five tracks is continually in flux, as Ehlers switches between melodic     plinks and subterranean noise (his sources are piano samples by Adam Butler [aka Vert] and recordings of     boiler rooms), Suchy transmits his far-flung psychedelia, and Hautzinger adds an earthy moan.  It's like     watching an amoebic blob expanding and contracting on a glass slide.</p>
<p>The first track (no titles) begins like a field recording, with Ehlers providing buzzes and chirps, and     then develops into the kind of music that seems to sprout up from the ground.  Ehlers' and Suchy lock     together to form a thick, wet atmosphere and then the few held notes of Hautzinger's pitch-black trumpet     sound like they should be bouncing through a shadowy valley somewhere.  If Miles Davis' version of     ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" really roused a great bullfighter back from retirement, Hautzinger's haunting     tone would send him back under the covers until the nightmare is over.  Another track starts with some     clarion trumpet, gradually becomes consumed in machine racket, and then returns five minutes later for     a wonderfully lyrical trumpet and guitar duet, where Hautzinger and Suchy team up like Jim Hall and Chet     Baker beamed in through a wormhole.  The pieces are constantly changing but each has a thematic center.</p>
<p>For all its sputtering noises and relentless sense of movement, <i>Soundchambers</i> is surprisingly     accessible.  Perhaps because the sound so frequently veers from the familiar (backward guitar, piano,     trumpet) to the foreign and back again, the album never fades into the background or becomes fatiguing.     An excellent record that's loud like nature with enough structure to appeal to non-musicians.</p></div>"|2692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2692-soundchambers/|7.8|Mark Richardson

    Recently, Ugly Casanova and The Postal Service have served their artists as leftfield career highlights
    while fans anxious awaited new material from their full-time bands.  2004 isn't yet two months old, and
    the label has already unleashed yet another unexpected slice of side project ingenuity with Rilo Kiley
    guitarist (and sometime vocalist and songwriter) Blake Sennett's collaboration-heavy debut as The Elected.
    Sennett, thankfully, is worthy of the endeavor.  His originals with Rilo Kiley have always alluded to an
    infatuation with the breathy tenor and fragile melodies of Elliott Smith, but also manage to bring in a
    healthy, Byrdsian Rickenbacker sparkle that's allowed for some of Rilo Kiley's most earnest (if
    oft-overlooked) material.</p><p>
    
    Despite the shamefully lame album art, <i>Me First</i> proves to be a remarkably consistent and memorable
    listen.  Each of Sennett's songs overflows with fragments of hyper-specific details like dates and place
    names, which lends an uneasy and illusory intimate quality to the album.  On the record's opener, ""7
    September 2003"", the title signifies the date on which the conversation documented in the song takes
    place; later, the listener learns that it's also fifteen days before the narrator's birthday.  This kind
    of unabashedly meta pandering, trademarked by the likes of Conor Oberst, usually only leads to solipsistic
    levels of melodrama, but the specificity of each number here seems to fuel Sennett's piercingly dry humor
    instead.  On album highlight ""Greetings in Braille"" (on which Jenny Lewis makes a rather ambiguous guest
    appearance), Sennett coos such biting confessional bits of dialogue as, ""If you see me down at the liquor
    store, please don't tell my dad/ And if you see my dad down at the liquor store, please don't tell me
    anything at all.""</p><p>
    
    Sennett is aided here by a rotating cast of indie rock royalty-- from producer Mike Mogis, who lends his
    characteristic production work, to Jimmy Tamborello's sonic flourishes, to guest vocalist Orenda Fink of
    Azure Ray, to fellow Sennett's Rilo Kiley cohorts Jenny Lewis and Jason Boesel.  Fortunately, the restraint
    of each lends <i>Me First</i> an unexpectedly refined quality: Rather than announcing their presence with
    a grandiose flair, the artists are content to garnish these tracks with subtle nuances.  ""A Time for Emily""
    is an all-too-brief burst of horn-accented piano pop set to a minimal bossa nova beat and skittering drum
    programming, while the rousing denouement ""Don't Blow It"" sees Rhodes keyboard and mercurial synth melodies
    giving way to a Saddle Creek style singalong courtesy of The Mogis Choral Ensemble.  It's revealing that a
    line addressed to Elliott Smith tops Sennett's thank-yous in this album's liner notes, but if <i>Me First</i>
    fails to quite live up to the promise of its influences, it still stands as a warm-hearted soundtrack to
    reminiscing on the kind of music with which you grew up.</p></div>"|2901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2901-me-first/|8.0|Hartley Goldstein

    7-inches in their life probably won't find much to dislike about Gift of Gab's solo recording, <i>4th
    Dimensional Rocketships Going Up</i>.  It's everyone else that Gab will be fighting hard to win over.</p><p>
    
    Like 2001's studious <i>Blazing Arrow</i>, this sturdily constructed debut locates itself at a very specific
    place in hip-hop, a place that derives its identity almost entirely from what it is not.  Reverant, nostalgic
    and brutally po-faced, Gab's hip-hop is meant for a specific mode of consumption-- to reassure and reinforce
    in the face of the muggy, undignified backwater that mainstream hip-hop has become.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, whenever you define your aesthetic in strict opposition to someone else's, you slam the door
    on a million possibilities, and <i>4th Dimensional</i> too often feels shut out.  Duty-bound and mature,
    it's the sound of Gab's personal war being waged in some faraway place where things like jokes and bump and
    playfulness and ambiguity are regarded as unnecessary detours on the road to hip-hop nirvana.</p><p>
    
    None of this is an indictment so much as it is another way of suggesting that since there are things you
    almost definitely won't get from a Gab record, what he's willing to give you needs to be good enough to
    compensate.  <i>4th Dimensional</i> opens well in this regard, with the harp-tinged opener ""The Ride of
    Your Life"", striking just the right balance between a candlelit, new-agey vibe and Gab's motorik flow.  It's
    even alright when he smears his introductory verse with metaphysical palaver about ""dimensions of a positive
    invention"" and ""the infinite provocative"" because, hey, somehow it feels good, it fits.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't take long for ugly stepsister ""Rat Race"" to break the spell.  Built around a farting tuba line
    and containing the opening couplet, ""All the bull stops here, I'm a matador/ Here to introduce a new rap
    catagore,"" it's a cringeworthy little thing that, back-to-back with ""The Ride of Your Life"", forecasts the
    album's inconsistency.  For every honeyed glimmer of a track like ""Way of the Light"", there's a drab funk
    cutup like ""Real MCs""; for every ""Just Because"", a ""Flashback"".  And so it goes.</p><p>
    
    Much of this unevenness has to do with the production, which is supplied here by relative newcomers Jake
    One and Vitamin D.  At their best, the backing these producers provide is still only good as an obvious
    homage to something else; half the time you can't help but be overcome by a sneaking suspicion that they're
    trying to out-Xcel each other.  Even the tracks you imagine they think are hot are actually dutifully
    restrained, afraid to bump too hard or with too much cut.  That might be interesting if there were some
    juxtaposition between their stubborn politeness and Gab's lyrical content, but his flows flow with the
    same caveats-- an often boring technical precision and a hamfisted deference to moralizing and finger-wagging.</p><p>
    
    I'd have loved to have seen Gab take on a completely different persona here, or at least to indulge himself
    and step away from the Blackalicious schema a little more than he has.  But even on his own terms, <i>4th
    Dimensional Rocketships Going Up</i> feels a little too smoothed over and sedated; like <i>Nia</i>, three
    dimensions removed.</p></div>"|3633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3633-4th-dimensional-rocketships-going-up/|5.9|Mark Pytlik

Zev Love X is not MF Doom.  Or so he would have had us
    believe for the last half-decade.</p><p>
    
    Last year, hip-hop paragon MF Doom (aka Daniel Dumile) completely flipped his pancakes and released three
    albums under divergent personas: <i>Take Me to Your Leader</i> as King Geedorah, <i>Vaudeville Villain</i>
    as Viktor Vaughn, and another installment in his <i>Special Herbs</i> series as Metal Fingers himself.
    The move brought him his greatest success to date, and cemented his position at the forefront of underground
    hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Before the masked man terrorized the undieground with raspy rhymes and hallucinogenic beats, of course,
    he <i>was</i> Zev Love X, and he represented Five-Percenters and bouncy black power sophisticates with the
    underappreciated collective K.M.D.  It wasn't meant to last: After just one album, his brother and bandmate
    DJ Subroc was struck by a car and killed, and the band's subsequent album was shelved by Elektra Records.
    Zev reappeared underground in 1997, after nearly five years in hibernation, and has since come correct
    with an array of records invoking and sampling everything from Stevie Wonder to 1950s monster movies.</p><p>
    
    In anticipation of K.M.D.'s upcoming reunion, Nature Sounds has cobbled together this best-of collection
    featuring much of the trio's out-of-print material.  Of course, the disc amounts to little more than a
    refresher course for the K.M.D.-impaired, considering the group only released two proper albums.  The
    first, 1991's <i>Mr. Hood</i> was a sprightly bit of <i>Sesame Street</i>-sampling brilliance that built
    a narrative around the album's ignorant namesake; the second was mired in controversy for much of the last
    decade: 1993's <i>Black Bastards</i>, whose cover featured a Sambo-like cartoon character being lynched,
    was put on hold by Elektra, and didn't see official release until 2001 on the Sub Verse label.  To this
    day, Doom believes Elektra's motives went beyond the cover art, noting the more aggressive nature of the
    album as a possible reason for postponement.</p><p>
    
    So this compilation has been hashed together, somewhat lazily, in hopes of reigniting some interest for
    the nearly forgotten Long Island crew.  Both album's best tracks are lifted and placed in chronological
    order, without any apparent rhyme or reason, save a few Busta Rhymes-featured remixes at the album's end.
    Even the liner notes are slapdash, with snapshots of scribbled notebooks scattered throughout.  There are
    no credits or thank yous, just written-in chaos, which is apropos of K.M.D.'s sound, but unfortunate for a
    greatest hits compilation-- especially one whose subject's history is so notorious.</p><p>
    
    The good news is that virtually every track is a standout, from the rolling piano bump of ""Humrush"" to the
    wildly original ""What a Nigga Know"".  ""Nitty Gritty"", however, showcases hip-hop's Five Percent godfathers,
    Brand Nubian, and exemplifies how they were always better at this type of thing.  Zev, Subroc and Onyx were
    capable and energetic MCs, but lacked the charisma and flow control of Sadat X or Grand Pu.  Most of the
    beats here are self-produced, and the raw sound, while intentionally grimy, exposes less than up-to-date
    technology in the studio.  Even now, MF Doom is prone to taping samples off his VCR.</p><p>
    
    The more incendiary diatribes from <i>Black Bastards</i> are smarter and more focused.  By shedding their
    animated jester-characters, the trio's rhymes punched through the paper-thin walls of alcoholism (""Sweet
    Premium Wine""), drug abuse (""Stop Smokin' That Shit"") and womanizing (""Plumskinz"") without succumbing to
    the pedantic or pretentious tendencies of some of their contemporaries.</p><p>
    
    What's most appealing than this release, though, is that it provides the opportunity to hear a more
    helium-voiced Doom as a young and hungry MC, less deluded by death and drugs and more driven by racism
    and poverty.  His evolution into a gruff rapper's rapper would have been hard to envision given some of
    his goofier appearances here.  It should be interesting to see what the schizophrenic genius cooks up
    for K.M.D.'s forthcoming <i>Mental Illness</i>.  Until then, this shoddily assembled set should tide you
    over.</p></div>"|4571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4571-the-best-of-kmd/|7.2|Sean Fennessey

Me either.  For all its populist strains-- metal
    can be all things to all people; party music, headfuck therapy music, protest music, even background
    music-- this is a genre which simply isn't ""pop.""  And that's no judgment against metal (or pop), just one
    of its most important characteristics.  I didn't grow up listening to this stuff.  I didn't really even
    have a good idea of what it was until junior high.  I thought Mötley Crüe and Twisted Sister were metal.
    In some stupid way, they were-- at least to fourth graders in Denton, Texas-- but it wasn't until puberty
    that I realized there was a whole other world of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King Diamond,

    aesthetics.  Metal is better than music.  It can be a surrogate for every job you don't get, every girl
    who ignores you-- or it can just be the noise you put on when you're bored.  Even as a fledgling college
    music student, I could find stuff on <i>Reign in Blood</i> to show my teachers and say, ""See, no matter
    what kind of stuff you tell me, I know there are guys doing it better, harder, faster.""  Because of its
    power, metal fans tend to be diehard, as would I be had I discovered the next best thing to getting high
    and getting laid.  I won't claim to be a metal expert, but ever since that awakening, it's always been
    music close to my heart in one way or another.</p><p>
    No surprise, then, to see the last remaining Gen-X ""icon"" stick up for all that's right and hard in the
    world with Probot.  Dave Grohl, possessing arguably the most successful post-Cultural Signpost career
    outside Wings and Bush, Jr., is hardly a hero of mine-- as Cheap Trick would-be's go, Foo Fighters lose
    out to Weezer by a long shot-- but I can't fault him for his principles.  Rather than let his P2 battles
    with Jack Black suffice for keeping it real, he went out and made an album with a lot of the same metallic
    royalty who confused me so all those years ago.  More than that, he made a <i>decent</i> record, one that
    might betray his lack of metal songwriting chops, but also his utter sincerity about playing this music
    for anyone within earshot.</p><p>
    The story goes that Grohl got ex-Zwan/Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney to help him track down a bunch of
    legendary vocalists to perform on a record featuring songs he wrote in a metal mood.  The pair laid the
    tracks down, but an all-star cast supplied the rants, featuring the likes of Motörhead's Lemmy, King
    Diamond, Lee Dorrian (onetime Napalm Death and current Cathedral vocalist), Max Cavalera (Sepultura),
    Cronos (Venom), Mike Dean (Corrosion of Conformity), Snake (Voivod), Wino (of underrated Saint Vitus,
    and Obsessed), Kurt Brecht (DRI), Eric Wagner (Trouble), and Tom Warrior (of legendary Swiss band Celtic
    Frost).  Metal fans awaited the outcome of this CD with baited breath, and many were skeptical.  However,
    Grohl and company made good on at least one aspect of Probot: They translated a love of metal into a valid
    creative statement.  A lot of it jams to high hell, too.</p><p>
    The best idea Probot put forth on their self-titled debut (though I doubt we'll ever see another record by
    the ""band"") is the track sequencing; the four best songs are the first four.  ""Centuries of Sin"" begins as
    Benedictine cathedral drone before exploding into D-tuned riff mayhem and Cronos' ragged description of a
    ""survivor, warrior prince, psychopath making difference.""  Grohl drums with typically thrashy aggression,
    though I would argue he hasn't quite crossed over into the realm of great metal drumming yet.  Still,
    Cronos completely sells this song, and I have no problems jamming it whenever the need for noise arises.
    Likewise, the incredible ""Red War"" and ""Access Babylon"", featuring Cavalera and Dean, respectively, fly by
    with the royal pound of the best hardcore-laced doom-metal.  Cavalera's performance in particular should
    be given some kind of cameo-of-the-year award as it not only owns the song, but also almost single-handedly
    makes Grohl seem completely believable as a metal bandleader.  Failing that, he gets points for his
    Motörhead-soundalike ""Shake Your Blood"" with Lemmy.</p><p>
    The most disappointing aspect of Probot is that many of the songs sound more like Foo Fighters turned to
    eleven than actual metal.  ""The Emerald Law"" (with Wino) not only could have been Foo product, but a
    hard-edged Nirvana B-side.  It's not a bad song, per se, just a tad less intense than what preceded it.
    Likewise, the near-anthemic ""My Tortured Soul"", featuring Wagner, sounds like the best possible result
    of Grohl's traditional hard rock songwriting meeting up with a vocalist who isn't afraid to sing sans
    doubling effects.  It also sounds a hell of a lot like Soundgarden, which shouldn't be surprising since
    Kim Thayil shows up later to play a guitar solo.  And speaking of that, the King Diamond-fronted ""Sweet
    Dreams"" is probably the least interesting track on the CD, not so much because it seems to go on forever
    without ever really mustering up much grandeur (or better, any good riffs), but that KD sounds like he's
    doing a bad Billy Corgan impression most of the time instead of his trademark hyena wail.</p><p>
    Probot will not go down in the annals of metal as a great band.  As tributes go, the spirit is willing
    but the execution is a bit weak on about half the tracks.  So even though you might approach this record
    with an open mind, something tells me the best tracks will be ripped for future mix fodder and the CD
    eventually left somewhere in the sell-back pile.  Jack Black makes a hidden appearance at the end that
    should sum up everything you need to know about the band's ""authenticity"".  But for once in metal, that
    really isn't the point.  Probot gets by on unabashed hero-worship,  raw enthusiasm and the lucky coincidence
    of having a few pretty damn fine tunes.  And really, when you have the those, what else matters?</p></div>"|6536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6536-probot/|7.0|Dominique Leone

For worse, the atrocious <i>Discovery</i> remix project, <i>Daft Club</i>, found the release it never should     have earlier this year, and instantly became the frontrunner for 2004's most dire audio abortion.  For (much)     better, the French duo debuted <i>Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem</i> at the in-Cannes     film festival Quinzaine des Realisateurs in May 2003.  The duo had worked for two years on the film with     Leiji Matsumoto, one of Japan's most celebrated manga and anime artists, and the result was an animated     musical with <i>Discovery</i> as its score, which mixed ""science-fiction with the decadent world of     show-business, limousines with spaceships.""  It was finally released on DVD in December.</p>
<p>Like Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i>, the music for <i>Discovery</i> and the storyline for <i>Interstella 5555</i> were conceived simultaneously.  The videos for ""One More Time"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", which     had both seen a fair bit of MTV rotation around the time of the album's release, were not simply clever     vignettes for the songs, nor was <i>Discovery</i> purely a film score-- in fact, <i>Interstella 5555</i> makes clear the degree to which each influenced the shape of the other.  Ultimately, Daft Punk intended     <i>Discovery</i> to be heard in the context of <i>Interstella 5555</i>, and it's no wonder: Matsumoto's     animation enlivens some of the less formidable tracks, and the details of scenes in <i>Interstella 5555</i> often are inspired by the music itself.</p>
<p>The project was an ambitious undertaking for both Daft Punk and Matsumoto, who were forced to communicate     through a bilingual friend.  For the uninformed, it's worth noting how enormous an accomplishment it was     that Daft Punk were able to enlist Matsumoto.  The 66 year-old, who was awarded the Japanese Cultural Award     in 2001 for outstanding national contribution (Matsumoto is responsible for 25 years of film productions,     including <i>Galaxy Express 999</i>, <i>Arcadia</i>, and <i>Star Blazers</i>, which, after <i>Akira</i>,     are some of the country's most revered anime), legitimates <i>Interstella 5555</i> as a serious anime film,     replete with subtle intertextual references to other series and Matsumoto's own work.  Each of <i>Interstella     5555</i>'s character betrays the different styles of animation Matsumoto has taken up throughout his career,     and Stella, the female guitarist and lead heroine, is practically a scarless Emeraldas.</p>
<p>Scenes follow the sequence and corresponding moods of <i>Discovery</i>'s original tracklist; the opening     concert scene of ""One More Time"" boasts lush <i>Jem</i>-rock colors and, more interestingly, what seems to     be Matsumoto's first bout with animating characters who speak English.  The words themselves do not     correspond perfectly to how they're mouthed, lending a certain vulnerability to the characters that stays     with them throughout the musical.  Matsumoto does not have any of the Crescendolls speak thereafter, and     since the track sequencing has more or less been determined, the burden is on him to communicate the story     entirely through his animation and its interaction with the music as it changes tenor.  His facility reveals     itself right away, as the band is kidnapped to the moody second track <i>Aerodynamic</i>, and perhaps most     perfectly during ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", as the band is systematically dismantled, reprocessed,     and spit out onto Earth as The Crescendolls.  For the song, Matsumoto chooses to highlight the simple     mechanics of the factory machines operating on the band, offering a formidable interpretation of the     song's robotic lyrics and commercial implications.</p>
<p>The record industry and its stereotypical abuse of the artist comprises the main topos of <i>Interstella     5555</i>, and indeed the main antagonist, Earl de Darkwood, is a perfectly stodgy, heartless profiteer who     cares less about supporting music and artists than racking up enough gold album awards to-- so the plot     goes-- conquer the entire universe.  That said, it would be rash to accuse Daft Punk of biting the Virgin     hand that feeds it, or to say that <i>Interstella 5555</i> exists purely as a careful subversion of the     record industry's supposedly shifty practices.  If anything, the film is a sensational execution of a     relevant stereotype; Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto are less concerned with making some cultural critique     than they are with telling a story.</p>
<p>How well Matsumoto is able to overcome the lack of dialogue is truly fascinating, as he instead relies on     his ability to craft extremely nuanced body language for the characters.  The Crescendolls' entire career     on Earth happens without a smile; Stella is always on the verge of tears; when Darkwood forces Stella to     shake the hand of a fan (she is reluctant, of course, since is being forced to make physical contact with     an entirely alien species), the frame becomes still, and she stares at her own hand in utter despair.     Countless moments find Matsumoto exhibiting levels of artistic consideration on par with some of his best     work.  Moreover, his delicate use of humor keeps the film from a tempting degree of melodrama that Matsumoto     knows when to restrain and when to let loose.  Put simply, <i>Interstella 5555</i> is both fine anime and     the ultimate context for its more-than-soundtrack <i>Discovery</i>.  Taken as a whole, it's the fantastic     culmination of years of artistic dedication.</p></div>"|2136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2136-interstella-5555-the-5tory-of-the-5ecret-5tar-5ystem/|8.0|Nick Sylvester

    last twenty-five years, the genre has been kicked over, dismantled and reinvented so many times that the
    term itself has devolved into little more than a hip euphemism for ""obnoxious.""  In 2004, dubbing a band
    ""punk"" and walking away is, essentially, a completely meaningless exercise.  There are a handful of
    constants-- hammering drums, loud guitars, shouting-- but the spiky essence of punk music is as vague as
    ever, having been long reduced to a series of cheap indicators (see black pleather jackets) and empty
    buzzwords.</p><p>
    Challenger, a trio born from hardcore bouncers Milemarker, seem stubbornly preoccupied with recapturing the
    piss and stomp of late-80s punk torchbearers (The Minutemen, Black Flag, Hüsker Dü), and their debut,
    <i>Give People What They Want in Lethal Doses</i>, somehow ended up sounding just as hollow and unlikely
    as the idea of quasi-authentic nu-punk tearing up the new millennium-- and just as cynical as The Kinks
    record of the sorta-same name.  The problem isn't that Challenger's players (Milemarker's Dave Laney and
    Al Burian alternating on guitar, bass, and vocals, with Timothy Remis on drums) aren't insanely energetic,
    or that they're not wholeheartedly selling their hot-footed power chords, it's that their entire founding
    principle seems so painfully, tediously borrowed; in sticking to that ever-nebulous true-punk formula,
    they've abandoned their only shot at capturing an original, non-nostalgia laced sound.</p><p>
    Most of <i>Give People What They Want</i> is fairly textbook.  Opener and highlight ""Input the Output""
    pits teamed-up shouting matches against harrowing guitar solos and wildman drumming; ""Unemployment"" twists
    the same formula into a more dynamic shape, with Laney and Burian's throaty yelps bouncing off each other,
    vocal lines battling with guitar solos for total noise supremacy.  Challenger seem confident in the weight
    of their assault (and rightfully so), but that comfort ultimately leads to monotony: Not too many of these
    tracks are especially discernable from each other.  Which is fine, when you're just thrashing around your
    apartment in big boots-- but it's not so promising when you sit down to weigh the respective heft of
    Challenger's own brand of punk rock.</p><p>
    Challenger may punch up their songs with some exhilarating vocal harmonies and unexpected structural shifts,
    but in the end, they never really transcend their own love/appreciation for their legendary influences-- a
    choice which prevents them from making a sizable dent in the ever-flexing history of punk.</p></div>"|1752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1752-give-people-what-they-want-in-lethal-doses/|5.6|Amanda Petrusich

Which is often
    true: To maintain any kind of consistency over the course of two full discs is a difficult undertaking.
    But, as with so many other things, Lambchop, Nashville's finest genreless collective, have managed to turn
    this unspoken rule firmly on its head, by releasing two separate LPs that by all rights should be one
    double album.  <i>Aw C'mon</i> and <i>No You C'mon</i>, released on the same day a la Tom Waits' <i>Alice</i>
    and <i>Blood Money</i>, each sprang from the same sessions and writing project, and don't differ from each
    other in any meaningful way-- in fact, they feel more complete together than they do apart.</p><p>
    
    The story goes that Lambchop ringmaster Kurt Wagner challenged himself to write a song a day for several
    months, and then chose the cream of the crop for these records-- and a fine cream it is (although one does
    have to wonder how this strategy led to the inclusion of six instrumentals).  It doesn't seem out of the
    question that Wagner may have chosen this simultaneous-double-release strategy simply for the fun of
    titling one in response to the other, and in an odd way, that naming convention works: <i>No You C'mon</i>
    feels like an escalation of the aesthetic of <i>Aw C'mon</i>, pushing just a little harder out of its creaky
    ballad box than its companion.  Both records, however, feel like a logical progression away from the limited
    range of the band's last full-length, 2002's <i>Is a Woman</i>, an album whose icy, monotone piano balladry
    and spit-shine polish paled in comparison to the band's impressive back catalog of aggressively eclectic,
    wonderfully strange country/soul/noise/jazz/etc albums and EPs.</p><p>
    
    Most of the tempos aren't much quicker this time around-- only the instrumentals break much of a rhythmic
    sweat-- but the arrangements are a lot more varied, and the huge, fourteen-piece band (that's not even
    counting the string section) feels more engaged as an ensemble.  <i>Aw C'mon</i> works best when the sun
    is down, when the elaborately arranged strings and downbeat R&amp;B; of songs like ""Nothing but a Blur from a
    Bullet Train"" and ""Steve McQueen"" have their best chance to slowly unfurl and fill in the quiet of the
    night.  ""Women Help to Create the Kind of Men They Despise"" sounds like it was recorded after beer #9,
    beginning as a sickly lounge tune and spilling further into leftfield from there, ultimately arriving at
    a Zappa-worthy choral bit just before staggering to a close.  ""I Haven't Heard a Word I've Said"" is a
    tangle of wobbly, wah-drenched guitar, Wagner's ragged vocals and some smatterings of piano and other
    barely noticeable instrumentation.</p><p>
<i>No You C'mon</i> initially promises to be the sunnier half of the pair, opening with the brisk instrumental
    ""Sunrise"", which, apart from a great string arrangement, also features a breathtaking pedal steel solo, one
    of the few appearances the instrument makes on either disc.  But it's back into the guts of the nighttime
    from there, and the band goes much deeper into darkness this time around, flirting with their edgier days
    on a few of the ballads, and diving headlong into breakneck noiserock on ""Nothing Adventurous Please"".  The
    guitars are muddy and abundant, spewing forth sheets of distortion to challenge Wagner's surprisingly snappy
    melody-- the song is actually reminiscent of some of Lambchop's earliest demos.  Wagner sticks to his
    trademark mumble for the rest of the album, though, allowing the impassive guitars on ""Low Ambition"" and
    the swirling strings of ""There's Still Time"" to do most of the musical talking.</p><p>
    
    An hour and a half after the first disc began, ""The Producer"" closes things with a rousing instrumental
    full of melodic piano, twangy guitars and breezy rhythms, essentially bringing things full circle, and it's
    clear that Lambchop have regained some of the form they once had.  Certainly, they've rediscovered their
    broad range and proud, sleeve-worn strangeness, and it shows in subtle ways, from the Brazilian shuffle of
    ""The Gusher"" to the alternate universe country doo-wop of ""Shang a Dang Dang"".  To say one of these albums
    is better than the other is basically beside the point-- anyone who buys one will certainly want the other,
    and both are fairly comparable as far as quality is concerned, anyway.  There are better routes into this
    band's strange world-- namely <i>Thriller</i>, <i>How I Quit Smoking</i>, <i>What Another Man Spills</i>
    and <i>Hank</i>-- but <i>Aw C'mon</i> and <i>No You C'mon</i> are each worthy albums in their own right and
    deserve to be heard.  Welcome back, Lambchop.</p></div>"|4660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4660-aw-cmon-no-you-cmon/|7.4|Joe Tangari

It was
    the breakthrough success for the three artists who spearheaded it, but it built on a series of low-budget
    and bedroom projects-- like rappers Why? and Doseone's Greenthink project, Dose's murmuring Slowdeath, or
    producer and DJ Odd Nosdam's Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist-- where obtuse verses spilled out like ripped-up
    paper scraps over hazy, droning vinyl, overheard conversations or snippets from TV, on CDs that were
    fragmented into at least forty tracks apiece.</p><p>
    The cLOUDDEAD project extended those methods; sharp humor and surreal images leavened the album's odd
    shapelessness, and the band even managed to eke out a few cogent concert pieces for their tour.  But the
    way they stitched the record together was even more interesting: The songs run together at the drop of an
    attention span, and the band combined them as intuitively as a found sound artist creating order out of
    tossed-off materials.  It had an unfinished feel fed by the two years that they worked on it, at dorms and
    parents' houses, and even through their relocation from Cincinnati to the Bay Area.  It was an album about
    a process, not an outcome.</p><p>
    The cLOUDDEAD record hit, as much as records like that ever do, and the Anticon collective-- of which Why?,
    Doseone and Odd Nosdam are founding members-- made waves beyond the underground hip-hop community with which
    it feuded.  (And to be clear once again, the group never claimed this project was ""hip-hop,"" although the
    controversy from purists has done nothing but make people think harder about their work.)  So as they
    finally release their follow-up, <i>Ten</i>, we know more about the artists, and they've grown more into
    their styles.</p><p>
    You can identify the two frontmen at the start of ""Pop Song"": Why?'s the one gently singing, ""Elvis, what
    happened?"" while Dose chants, ""The wooden man and his splintering self.""  Why?'s excellent <i>Oaklandazulasylum</i>
    revealed a rap-based artist who wants to write songs and strum a guitar, making him one of very few artists
    trying to cross over from hip-hop to indie rock.  Doseone has worked with producer Jel under the name
    Themselves, and he also came into his own as a performer on his album with Circle, where partner Boom Bip's
    production challenged the sometimes self-absorbed intricacies of his lyrics.</p><p>
    Completing the trio is Odd Nosdam, who produced half the tracks (Why? handled the rest) and played electronic
    drums.  Nosdam demonstrates his deft taste in ambient vinyl and oompah beats, with a couple kitschy samples
    mixed in; on his tracks, the most static sounds can buzz and excite-- like the smoggy ""Rifle Eyes"", where
    the crackling noise seems to come from something more sinister than just old vinyl.</p><p>
<i>Ten</i> is half as long as the band's debut and much more focused; each performer shows improved range and
    sharper talents.  And yet, it's still a mixed bag.  If several of the songs are fantastic, the album is more
    stilted and less intriguing.  Take the lyrics, which are so refined that they sometimes become too arch to
    flow, like they've been pinned down in a display case.  The precise and verb-free imagery works on ""Dead
    Dogs Two"" or ""Rifle Eyes""-- for example, Why? declaiming, ""A single long-stemmed rose resting between two
    mounted antlers""-- but it gets distracting on other songs, especially for Doseone, who chops his inimitable
    flow into pieces; ""The Velvet Ant"" runs more like a set of mantras than a song.  cLOUDDEAD have also never
    been strong with lyrics that have literal meaning, and <i>Ten</i>'s themes about the gun industry or the
    music business lose power when they become too clear: take the list of predictable victims of gun violence
    on ""Son of a Gun"".  (Though any lyric that puts Malcolm X and Mahatma Gandhi and Tupac and Biggie in the
    same list has a certain sly appeal.)  By contrast, the gory, context-free imagery of ""Dead Dogs Two"" is
    sublime.</p><p>
    The production on <i>Ten</i> is strong, although you can tell that cLOUDDEAD is more a special project
    than a working band when the heavier tracks rub almost disconcertingly against jerky and whimsical ones.
    ""The Teen Keen Skip"" starts with a sample of that new cliché, a children's record, but it gets better from
    there: the young boy in the sample is cut off at a ""Whu-- "" that's repeated in a loop.  (They also throw
    in a solo on power drill.)  The moodier half is also effective, and if the instrumental ""3 Twenty"" comes
    off too blank-faced, ""Rifle Eyes"" is deeply ominous, sharpening the rapid-fire lyrics even as it swells
    and moans like a slow-motion sideswiping.</p><p>
    But it's telling that where cLOUDDEAD's debut worked like a collage, the strongest moments on <i>Ten</i>
    involve a sustain: sustained organ tones, long throbbing noises, stretches where the words trail off.  The
    best moments are the surest, when the three performers come into perfect alignment, like on ""Dead Dogs Two"",
    where Why? and Dose float over the whomping beats and swap the mike to the point of alternating by the word.
    The record even ends with a long, electric drone, as if their ideas have crunched together and the differences
    in their styles have dissolved.  But it also paves over the free flow of ideas that made their last work so
    absorbing, and so experimental.  Unquestionably, cLOUDDEAD have arrived.  But next time, we might want to
    spend more time watching them get there.</p></div>"|1518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1518-ten/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

Disco started as Miami club music; green started as blue and yellow; Out Hud     started out as a band of hardcore kids.  Though it's tempting to romanticize those early days, before     everything got big and complicated, they're very often best left to good memories and the comfortable     buffer of time.  Partially because everyone grows up and out of their various inspirations, and because     we're prone to learning from our mistakes, beginnings seem at once thrilling, disastrous and raw.  In the     some cases, inspiration carries us through rough spots, but usually, the best stuff pours out when we     realize what the hell is going on and can do something about it.  But then, there's also much to be said     for ignorance, bliss and beginner's luck.</p>
<p>Out Hud and !!! began as two Sacramento-based bands having backgrounds in hardcore punk but also interested     in experimenting with their own weird, white funk.  The two shared members (Tyler Pope and vocalist Nik     Offer), so it's no surprise they should begin and hit their strides at approximately the same times.  In     2003, each were recipients of praise transcending the usual trendy underground lauding that goes on every     year for relatively unknown bands; even when ""dancepunk"" was supposed to be taking the indie nation by     storm, Out Hud and !!! presented music heard and loved by all manner of folks otherwise unimpressed by     hipster cred.  The bands had released music long before they relocated from Cali to NYC and before this     whole angular dance craze was supposed to have begun, but were probably surprises to most of their fans     over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>In 1998, Out Hud and !!! released a split single on Gold Standard Labs (GSL), and the following year, they     released a split 12-inch EP containing the single and remixes.  And, as is so often the case, their beginnings     reveal slightly larval forms of what garnered them attention in later years.  Chiefly, the music on the CD     reissue of this split EP is of modest-fidelity, inspired and amateurish in the way every new idea is amateurish.     And yes, it most certainly predicts a day when punks will trade their apathy for j's, and lead sweaty crowds     through all-night grinding sessions.  If the music isn't as accomplished as it is on later releases like <i>Me     and Giuliani</i> or <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i>, it's hardly without its charms.</p>
<p>!!!'s ""Instinct"" is a lengthy punk-funk stomp, and the better of the record's two original sides.  It begins     with slashed, chicken-scratched guitar.  Soon afterwards skittish disco drums and a funky dub line enter,     sending no mixed signals about exactly what the agenda is here.  Offer's breathy mutterings act more as     rhythmic color than melodic device, and when the horns come in on the next verse, the band works up an     impressive swirl of near-feverish skank-beat and phased trance.  ""Instinct"" isn't anywhere near the ""pop""     song that ""Giuliani"" was, but nor is it unsuitable for a party.  Dare I say: it ""jams"" in places.</p>
<p>Out Hud's three pieces (titled ""jgne"", ""jgdg"", and ""jgxtc"") sound more the work of a ""project"" than a band,     and also sound like they began life as adventures on four-track.  The first begins with the mini-pound of a     Casio disco preset, and features more funk rhythm guitar given the quick-delay treatment just like all the     old punks used to do after they'd heard dub in the late 70s.  In a way, Out Hud's songs are actually more     reminiscent of the first wave of dancepunks than !!!'s, but their execution is also a lot more ragged here.     ""jgdg"" is a variation on the same groove, featuring Molly Schinct's cello and a little abrasive guitar     skronk and feedback to offset the ambience, while ""jgxtc"" is almost a purely rhythmic exercise in drum     machine chaos.  So, as beginnings go, this split EP is nice and not terribly ambitious, but there are     sparks here, and fans should enjoy the history lesson.</p></div>"|1765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1765-split-ep/|6.0|Dominique Leone

It was stuff my then-band had been working
    on in my scant, single-mic'd bedroom.  We weren't a bedroom pop outfit by any stretch; back then we played
    dour, emotionally apoplexed emocore.  And what we played weren't quite songs, per se: There were chords,
    and some faint attempts at melodies, but that was about all you could make out underneath the tumescent
    basslines and audible flying shards of metal from my cymbal crashes.  Still, Mr. Rotello put his blistered
    ear to speaker and carefully considered our laughable concoctions.  When it was over, he declared, ""I think
    you guys need a piano.""</p><p>
    
    I like to kid myself and think that if we'd taken his advice, stayed together, and learned to play our
    instruments, like, really well, we might today sound akin to 90 Day Men, whose piano-driven compositions
    resonate with Biblical intensity.  The fact is, no one does: 90 Day Men are one of the most original bands
    underground, and their instrumental competency offers something for high school freshman everywhere to
    admire.  The band has been labeled everything from prog rock to ""hardcore pop,"" but so far no one's been
    able to pigeonhole their sound successfully-- and actually, I think it would be doing the band a disservice
    to shoo them into any genre or subgenre just yet.</p><p>
<i>Panda Park</i>, the band's third full-length release in four years, updates a sound that was already
    intriguing and distinctive on <i>To Everybody</i> and the pompously titled <i>(It (Is) It) Critical Band</i>.
    By now, the Men have earned the right to sound as pretentious as they did on their debut album, but opt
    instead for a more honed approach.  At a modest 32 minutes, <i>Panda Park</i> is like a French dinner: a
    tight package of intensely rich compositions, best taken one forkful at a time, accompanied by a gracious
    interlude to help cleanse the palette and, of course, a decadent finale.  But where the band's earlier
    material was dreary to a point of being downright oppressive, <i>Panda Park</i> utilizes lighter textures
    to help brighten the milieu.  ""Chronological Disorder"" and ""When Your Luck Runs Out"" contain sufficient
    helpings of electronic sugar, making the songs blithely enjoyable, and at times even a bit (gasp!) uplifting.</p><p>
    
    A naive conception commonly held is that instrumental skill must always upend a song's integrity by
    superseding everything that makes music meaningful to us.  90 Day Men seem as if they're on a mission
    to erase that fallacy.  But before calling compositionally intricate songs such as ""Even Time Ghost Can't
    Stop Wagner"" prog-rock, be aware of the implications.  These guys aren't Queensryche: every 32nd note and
    oddly syncopated melody feels meaningful and integral to the overall piece.</p><p>
    
    As for the piano, its presence fits right in to the clamorous mix.  Like Menomena on last year's <i>I Am the
    Fun Blame Monster</i>, 90 Day Men gracefully interweave high-volume electronics and acoustic elements.  Andy
    Lansangan's listful keyboard and piano parts often serve as the driving melodic element.  In the grandiose
    chorus of ""Chronological Disorder"", an ideal side-one closer, he and Case team up for their best ""November
    Rain"" impersonation-- which actually isn't such a bad thing: Like all the bold ideas on <i>Panda Park</i>,
    the move is pulled off tastefully and with just the right restraint.  Case's arena rock caterwauling is
    reserved for a few well-placed choruses, which is symbolic of the huge strides 90 Day Men have made with
    this album.  The band have finally mastered the monstrous proportions of their diffuse talents and arranged
    them in ways that are wholly satisfying and distinctly unique.</p></div>"|5808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5808-panda-park/|8.0|Sam Ubl

Maybe it's not even a physical location,
    but a state of mind that blocks out movement and noise everywhere.  I guess it's a pretty noisy world, and
    isolation doesn't seem like such a lonely word when you're cornered by the frenzied and fucked up on all
    sides: Buddhists meditate, and from what I can tell-- my exposure limited to a haggard David Carradine
    roaming the Old West-- they seem like pretty levelheaded people.  Transcendence: to rise above and beyond,
    and into a world of equilibrium where all is perfect, natural and without dissonance.  Ahhh.</p><p>
    
    But then again, without anything to brush up against, I'd probably explode into a boundless ball of mush.
    Especially in music, it seems friction and strife are absolute necessities to produce anything interesting.
    That doesn't mean there has to be crazy explosions going off all the time, but until the day comes when my
    spine can take no more celebratory flailing, there has to be a tension-release involved.  Ogurusu Norihide,
    a Shinto priest and self-proclaimed ""laptop-folk"" musician, makes music with round edges, and without much
    of that tension to chew on.  His music is pretty, in a way, but in general seems a tad on the static side
    to me, opting for continuous (some might say directionless), mellow resolve at the expense of something more
    viscerally engaging.</p><p>
<i>Modern</i> is Norihide's second release, on which he further develops his mildly computer-assisted
    acoustic mood music.  It is also a rather stone-faced document in stark minimalism, with some tracks having
    much in common with contemporary avant-garde Japanese improvisers like Toshimaru Nakamura and Taku Sugimoto,
    who are working with an extreme idea of ""negative space""-- in other words, really, really quiet music.
    Norihide doesn't title any of the tracks on his CD, and that may further distance them from some folks.
    Personally, I'm just listening for something, anything, to grab hold of.</p><p>
    
    The sixth track features very spare handclaps and single, fingerpicked guitar tones in what seems like a
    take on traditional Japanese court music.  The suspension created by the guitar notes, and what seem like
    endless silences scattered everywhere within the piece, do lend a considerable tension to the music-- but
    after ten minutes, the tension loses its potency, and the end result may well conjure impatience rather
    than real interest.  Likewise, track four features only soft sine tones, and while arguably the most
    relaxing track on the disc, isn't really the kind of thing I'd put on to chill out to.  Again, he's
    superficially related to the onkyo (experimental Japanese electronic improv) scene, but tends to either
    emphasize an almost transparent mix of sounds, or run very sparse ideas too long.</p><p>
    
    I wonder if Norihide might not sound better as a straight acoustic folk performer, without the aid of his
    gear.  Track seven is a gorgeous ballad featuring only two guitars, and extremely minimal effects.  The
    vibe is delicate but not passive; the melodies are sweet and it captures a mood similar to Richard Youngs'
    non-psych-out folk music (and Norihide seems a lot more Jagjaguwar than Carpark to me, in general). Maybe
    that means I like <i>Modern</i> best when it isn't, when the music seems less an awkward electronic fusion
    and more a simple, perfect meditation.</p></div>"|5833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5833-modern/|5.3|Dominique Leone

    selling Volkswagens, but there's been a disproportionate amount of interest lately surrounding the enigmatic
    canon of folk music from the late 60s and early 70s.  As reverently packaged reissues from treasured
    shoulda-been folk legends like Karen Dalton, Jackson C. Frank, Dando Shaft, Linda Perhacs and established
    revivalist heroes such as Bert Jansch and Pentangle, Fred Neil, John Fahey, and Fairport Convention seemed
    to take up increasing amount of space in my CD changer, a slew of indie-bred legionnaires (Devendra Banhart,
    Iron &amp; Wine, Animal Collective, Sufjan Stevens, Currituck Co, etc) seemed hard at work setting out to
    passionately revive the folk revival in their own wildly idiosyncratic ways.</p><p>
    
    For anyone who's seen so much as the album insert for any of these treasured older records, it makes sense
    that the indie community would fall head over heels for the Folk aesthetic; Bert Jansch looks like Stephen
    Malkmus' more literal twin, while Fairport Convention, covered in all things involving facial hair, Converse
    and corduroy, bear an uncanny resemblance to the incestuous communal trappings of the indie-royalty of
    Elephant 6.  The postmodern landscape successfully tread by the likes of the White Stripes, The Strokes,
    The Rapture, and (The) Ryan Adams has arguably put a price-tag on the bourgeois ""cleverness"" of miming
    critical approved ""tastes"" from lost eras; a renewed interest in folk music's reliance on song rather than
    sound seems only natural.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Greg Weeks' steady stream of neo-folk records (culminating in 2001's landmark <i>Awake Like
    Sleep</i> and 2003's more esoteric, <i>Slightly West</i>) has been supplying listeners with a lush blend
    of psych-charged melancholia (a la Nico) and kaleidoscopic drones while always retaining beautifully
    baroque melodies as their focal point.  However, it's his work with Espers, an expanding folk collective
    which also includes members Meg Baird and Brook Sietinsons, that accounts for some of his most accomplished
    work to date.</p><p>
    
    While some of Weeks' past recordings seemed bogged down in his penchant for drone, on <i>Espers</i>, Meg
    Baird's breathy vocals and Brooke Sietinsons' embellishments of finger cymbals, chimes, and harmonica add
    substantial depth to the hum.  The album's sublime opener, ""Flowery Noontide"", bares testament to this;
    the track is a fingerpicked acoustic pageant, where Baird's lilting alto floats atop a din of interweaving
    flutes and somber string lines, while the ominous ring of an autoharp and chimes channel Donovan at his
    best.  On ""Meadow"", Weeks' understated vocals and eerie lyrical imagery of ""our willingness to die"" are
    made all the more striking by Meg Baird's contrasting lullaby-like harmonies.</p><p>
<i>Espers</i> is populated with enough folk garnishes to resurrect the recorder from out of its natural
    habitat in elementary school music classrooms, but the record's seamless melding of traditional elements
    with modern sonic touches and beautiful, close-mic'd production is what provides its unique flavor.  The
    album's eight tracks are centered around an ominous, 8+ minute-long, minor-key psych-folk paean to
    darkness.  The track begins with a tranquil call-and-response vocal suite between Weeks and Baird.  At
    roughly the four-minute mark, a procession of acoustic guitar chords gives way to a blissful free-folk
    rampage of wailing, distortion-soaked bowed-guitars, Ornette Coleman-miming flutes, and scrambling hot
    acid leads.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, on songs like ""Riding"" and ""Meadow"", the harmony-centric British folk form meets equally
    unpredictable treatments.  Taking a cue from kindred avant-folk spirit Richard Youngs' later work, these
    numbers make space for portentous electro-trimmings like the crazed otherworldly drone of a tone generator
    and freeform electric guitar work.  Indeed, with this album, Espers have brought to life a monument of
    understatement: an album which manages to embrace its influences while simultaneously eclipsing them.</p></div>"|2899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2899-espers/|8.4|Hartley Goldstein

    the raw black metal wing of San Francisco's Jewelled Antler Collective.  Eking out an acoustic Melvins
    dust-storm force-fed <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, Smolken, a Polish exile named for the grave digger in
    Corman's <i>The Undead</i>, inhabits the wilds of Texas, masterminding miasmatic atmospherics that
    initiate buried-alive claustrophobia as well as the beauty of a backlit spider-web.  Accompanied here by
    Birdtree/Thuja/Blithe Sons favorite son Glenn Donaldson on splintered acoustic guitar and sundry stringed
    things, our dark-blooded hero whispers and rages from Rilke and A.A. Milne to Baudelaire and Hilaire
    Belloc and back.  More <i>Paris Spleen</i> than <i>Pooh Corner</i>, when Smolken steps to the mic (which
    I imagine dangling just-so from a cragged tree branch), he conjures the lonesomest strains of folk,
    cabaret, and sung poetry.</p><p>
    
    His treatment of the poems can be mesmerizing.  In some cases, accents are placed at odd or unforeseen
    moments, while others are read audio-book straight.  His dusky rendition of Rainer Maria Rilke's ""The
    Kings of the World are Growing Old"", for example, follows the original text word-for-word, albeit with
    a strange, lupine hiss in the background.  Others are twisted around with brambles (unless he's using
    cut-up translations I haven't located).  ""Beacons ~ Rubens, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Michaelangelo, Puget,
    Watteau, Delacroix"" offers an elliptical take on the last three stanzas of Baudelaire's ""Beacons"".  Smolken
    doubles his voice, initiating his own call-and-response between clipped fanaticism and drawn-out, dry
    throated whispers.  His high-flung subject: ""These, Oh Lord, are the benedictions.  The tears, the
    ecstasies, the blasphemies, the cries of 'Te Deum.'""</p><p>
    
    With Smolken going off in the forefront, Donaldson's left to his own devices.  And though it isn't clear
    who plays what, the array of sounds are subtle and wonderfully textured.  There's an upright bass, I think,
    as well mandolin, banjo, bells and percussion.  Structurally, choruses are avoided and besides the acoustic
    punctuation marks that jump from nowhere, there are zero build-ups: the endless skies above a plain, wisps
    of pale that hover inches above a cedar lake.  It's all beautifully codified: One might have more background
    than another and perhaps another goes into different sorts of convulsions, but for the most, the pitch
    remains within the unplugged zone of bands like Badgerlore or Darkthrone.  If you're more interested in
    Dark Raven Choir's equally enjoyable noise strain, you'll need to look elsewhere (I recommend the upcoming
    3"" CDR, <i>Sturmfuckinglieder</i>, which features seismic, totally harsh covers of Leonard Cohen, Garnet
    Rogers, and Townes Van Zandt).</p><p>
    
    Though words prove essential, there are a couple instrumentals.  A squeaky cover of ""Streets of Laredo""
    whips up Woven Hand burning in a Gypsy fire with a lonesome, warping violin.  ""Piano Practice - Impatience
    for a Reality"" is a protracted set of random, dramatic plucks and bowed strings wound large through gaps
    of dead space bottomed out with the minutest rattling of Morton Feldman's bones.  (Anyone interested in
    creepy ambiance and/or the eccentric appropriation of found materials, do yourself a favor and mix
    this with Liars' upcoming witch-hunt, <i>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</i>.  Now get a walkman, wander
    the country at night, and have yourself a really fine Walpurgisnacht.)</p><p>
    
    For those familiar with Smolken, this new full-length won't surprise.  What makes <i>Wine, Women and Wolves</i>
    special, beside the great title, is that it's the first non-CDR release aside from compilation appearances.
    Therefore, it ought to be easier to track down than, say, <i>Eaten by Wolves</i>, released in an edition of
    7, or the equally out-of-print <i>Lesbian Corpse Wolves</i>, limited to a whopping 30 copies.  For the new
    fans I should warn you now that most of Dead Raven Choir's extensive back catalogue-- 25+ releases since
    1998-- is already out of print.  With someone this productive, though, there's of course hope for the future.
    (As we go to print, there are four releases scheduled for 2004: <i>Goating Shapelessness Theatrical Wolves</i>,
    <i>Death to Dead Wolves</i>, <i>Cooking with Wolves</i>, and the anomalously non-wolf title, <i>Dead Raven
    Choir and Never Presence Forever - Rozrywa Szwy Ciszy</i>).  And, hey, becoming a collector at this stage
    of the game seems an admirably obscurantist activity.</p><p>
<i>Wine, Women and Wolves</i> isn't the most exciting of listens, and it won't get you out on the dance
    floor, but like a good horror film, the atmosphere's so finely intense, that even the most mundane creak
    of a door or a cat's innocent mew proves startling enough to make you scream like the feckless sissy you
    are, really.</p></div>"|2539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2539-wine-women-and-wolves/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

    1971 film <i>Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</i>, Melvin Van Peebles also made contributions to literature
    with <i>La Permission</i>, Broadway with his score for <i>Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death</i>, and
    theatre with his own <i>Don't Play Us Cheap</i>.  So, when not starring in and producing independent features,
    painting, writing plays and books about trading futures, or else making a soundtrack with some unknown band
    known as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, he was concurrently cutting proto-rap tracks along the lines of Gil Scott-Heron
    and The Last Poets and releasing LPs on A&amp;M; and Stax.</p><p>
    
    Originally issued by Atlantic Records in 1974, Van Peebles' third album takes truth in advertising to its
    excruciating extreme, as he really <i>can't</i> sing on any of these eight songs.  Wince as his warble rafts
    out from the manholes like tone-deaf Dr. John gris smoke or Ol' Dirty Bastard's hustler uncle, and realize
    its potency: forcing poetry through like Leonard Cohen with Thunderbird breath, Melvin's intent clench of
    voice stinks like cigar smoke, obnoxious and burning on tracks like ""A Birth Certificate Ain't Nothing but
    a Death Warrant Anyway"" as hookers chirp back from across 110th Street that you got to ""get it, get it.""
    And yet, the world-weary breath of Van Peebles also knows the hard-earned truth, enough to croak to you
    from across ""So Many Bars"" that: ""Between a woman's breast is the thickest thorns you can ever lay your
    head on.""</p><p>
    
    Is it worth wading through the viscous chocolate pudding that he drools like Bill Cosby?  When he's coughing
    up razor blade lines like, ""If the Lord's eye is on the sparrow, what's wrong with Big Brother watching you?""
    while telethon femme robots coo ""Save the Watergate 500,"" the answer is yes.  As he steps out of the time of
    Nixon and into the fog of war (and misinformation) to deliver a verse like: ""Sure we lost a couple of soldiers
    and they raised a tax or two/ Yeah, maybe there was a promise broken and that law and order rallying call
    don't seem as shiny as it used to/ But come on and rally round the flag, y'all,"" it's plain that it takes
    the ugliest of voices and darkest of humors to survive and render the horror of truth, either personal or
    political.</p><p>
    
    Not quite the iconoclast in the recorded medium, though, the arrangements by Harold Wheeler draw too heavily
    upon the standard production sound of the day.  Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" gets recast with a Richard
    Pryor ""Wino vs. Junkie"" opening bit, twinkling steel drums, and overwrought female choruses.  But it all
    comes together on the sappy, stringy, cloyingly sweet tale, ""Eyes on the Rabbit"", which utilizes Melvin's
    syrupy Elmer Fudd baritone to greatest effect: Melvin realizes he misses his old girlfriend, a
    preschool teacher, as he humbly cuts out paper rabbits and glues on the eyes.  Leave it to the
    actor/writer/director to nail the cheesy sentiment in such as a way as to make you misty-eyed.</p></div>"|8521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8521-what-the-you-mean-i-cant-sing/|6.9|Andy Beta

""Peace, love, and empathy"" has been
    replaced by ""more peace, more love, and ornate orchestral pop music.""  Lately, here in the northeast,
    where it's been too cold to safely eat, sleep and write about music, I've felt glad to be a fan of these
    groups and not a member.  Few things could deter me from producing transcendent avant-garde opuses; living
    in a farmhouse with no heat during subzero nights is one of them.  Luckily, there are those who brave it,
    like New York-based conglomerate Stars Like Fleas, whose 21 members lurked stealthily under the indie
    radar in 2003.</p><p>
    
    I first heard <i>Sun Lights Down on the Fence</i> after an accident involving week-old pot roast gravy, in
    which I ruined a pair of suede shoes and what had been a perfectly good night at the theater.  After scrubbing
    my kitchen floor and all the cabinets that had been splattered, I was too worked up to sleep, so I retreated
    into my headphones and tried to ignore the lingering odor.  The smell of gravy took two days to lift, by
    which time I had thoroughly examined the wily 70-minute landscape of <i>Sun Lights Down on the Fence</i>.
    Unfortunately, my relationship with this engaging and relentlessly subtle album will be forever marred by
    an association with putrid pan juices, but it speaks to the band's merit that I was still able to derive
    such pleasure from it under those circumstances.</p><p>
    
    Aside from sporting a member for every A.D. century, the Stars Like Fleas lineup is duly impressive for its
    jaw-dropping genealogy: <i>Sun Lights Down on the Fence</i> received contributions from bands as diverse as
    Out Hud, Mercury Rev, Papa M, No-Neck Blues Band, and At the Drive-In, to name just a few.  The group was
    founded in 1998 by Austin music-scene veterans Shannon Fields (producer and multi-instrumentalist) and
    vocalist Montgomery Knott (who formerly collaborated with Stars of the Lid).  2000's <i>Took the Ass for a
    Drive</i> saw New York-only release on the now-defunct Shimmy-Disc and is currently unavailable.</p><p>
<i>Sun Lights Down on the Fence</i> is the fruit of two years' labor, and a ruthless attention to detail
    is apparent throughout.  Many of the songs saunter by, content to linger in a particularly comfortable spot
    for minutes at a time.  ""On a Generous Day"", the album's generously sized centerpiece, evokes Talk Talk in
    its slow evolution and subtle movements.  Montgomery Knott's vocal delivery borrows directly from Mark
    Hollis, but his arrangements are much busier: Where Hollis placed curt crescendos and one-liners sporadically
    and perfectly throughout his songs, Knott drags a lazy legato out for minutes at a time.  His vocal sheets
    are seemingly interminable and often mar otherwise pristine instrumental passages, sometimes plummeting into
    defenseless gratuity.  Over the staggering denouement of ""On a Generous Day"", he sings, ""Bending over you
    lightly/ Hard on/ In your ass.""  The song is a pained lament to a lost sexual relationship, but the words
    sully what is conveyed beautifully and articulately through the music alone.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, Knott's voice serves just fine as textural element, often blending delicately into the instrumental
    mix.  The Dust Bowl melodies are scarce and fragile.  Flutes, saxophones, clarinets, trumpets and bassoons
    share the spotlight and take frequent solos that, like the vocals, often ramble aimlessly.  Songs occasionally
    break out into well-placed free jazz trances, which offer welcome relief from the sometimes cloying vocals.
    The album avoids the cheese-factor inherent in most electro-free jazz these days, which is typically performed
    by indie musicians who are, by nature, awkward and soulless.  Some of the more amorphous sections are among
    the album's best moments.</p><p>
<i>Sun Lights Down on the Fence</i>'s most impressive quality is its balancing of carefully arranged electronic
    sounds with improvisational acoustic performances.  As on The Books' stunning <i>The Lemon of Pink</i>, there
    are two types of virtuosity present: sonic manipulation and instrumental prowess.  Songs dive through wormholes
    of thought without inhibition, but pass through intact and neatly polished.  The improvised sections are
    tasteful and restrained, and at times feel quite intentional: Songs such as ""Isabel of Lilac"" and ""Third
    Night, Wisconsin"" are precognitive glimpses into the workings of the subconscious mind.  Fields and Knott
    take the immensity of musicians and concentrate their disparate ideas into one intimate and wonderfully
    realized statement.  It's hard to tell whether this record is the cerebral read-out of its entire populous
    lineup, or of two very complex minds, but the finished result is intimate and utterly beautiful.</p></div>"|7733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7733-sun-lights-down-on-the-fence/|8.2|Sam Ubl

<p>Wake up, slightly dazed and out of it, and just like every other morning for the last eight months of     unemployment, it begins the same way.  Tie on the robe, fumble for the coffee mug, the ketchup-y Bloody     Mary, and the initial pipe pull, and clumsily drop the needle onto the crackly, burnt first side of the     record that remains glued on my turntable, waiting for those same ""Chopsticks""-esque piano notes that bang     singer Harry Nilsson out of his slumber for ""Gotta Get Up"", the opening song on 1971's <i>Schmilsson</i>.     He's still in his robe too, out of focus, unshaven, a hash pipe in his fingers.  Harry wakes up, weary, but     rouses quickly, showers, resigned to being late for the day's meetings.  He's already mourning the salad     days and wasted nights slowly slipping away to the high-fiber diet and working late.  As the music hall     accordion and tuba breathe in the evening's hiccupy bubbles and the bass bumps along with lines about a     sailor's conjugal visits, we're back in the swing times of the early 70s, where the 60s' residual good     times hid, trying to stay high and jovial even as the highs got slightly more complicated and expensive.</p>
<p>Long considered the ""American Beatle"" by The Beatles themselves (and John Lennon's drinking buddy during     his year-long ""Lost Weekend""), Harry Nilsson originally reflected them in his quirky, knowledgeable pop     (and was a rumored Paul McCartney replacement) before scoring a Grammy for his delirious version of folkie     Fred Neil's ""Everybody's Talking"" that loped throughout <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>.  As the clime of pop     hardened into rock, and groups like The Beatles dissolved, Nilsson teamed up with producer Richard Perry     to bolster both of their careers.  Moving the party over to London, and drawing on a pool of players that     would have hands on rock landmarks of the era like <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, <i>Layla and Assorted Love     Songs</i>, <i>Tumbleweed Connection</i>, <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>, and <i>Transformer</i>,     Nilsson's rock record <i>Schmilsson</i> is easily the most loveable scamp of the bunch.  Its success was     the watershed (and all the subsequent washing out that word implies) of his career.</p>
<p>As spins run into the thousands for me now, new little sonorities appear in the song craft. I'll always love     the way he paved over the sub-Lennon scream of Badfinger's chorus on ""Without You"", beyond the simplistic     resignation of the original and into a cathartic, climactic release.  (The Spanish version included ""Si No     Estas Tu"" as a bonus track-- the song's more Romantic lingua showcases the true force of Nilsson's     operatic reading as he tremors and holds the notes.)  The pounding, detuned-bass rocker ""Jump into the Fire""     and the similarly belted and horn-blasted ""Down"" define Nilsson's harder take on this particular album (the     former could still burn up dancefloors), although his stab at the golden oldie ""Let the Good Times Roll""     humorously weaves about, drunk on its own Bacchanalian clank of keys.</p>
<p>My new favorites took awhile to come to the fore.  One is the incredibly human-- if somewhat George     Harrison-esque-- commuter meditation on ""Driving Along"". ""The Moonbeam Song"" is succinctly perfect, with     a visual aesthetic worthy of Taoist poets: moonbeams light on train tracks, windowpanes, weather vanes,     and the eye of the beholder himself.  Its sweetest line is about ""a fence with bits of crap along its     bottom, blown by a windbeam,"" and as Herbie Flowers' bass slides between the luminescent clouds of mellotron,     Harry catches all of the Beach Boys in his Brandy Alexander'd croon.  Closer ""I'll Never Leave"" is sumptuous     and bittersweet: a farewell to Harry Nilsson's baroque pop past with producer George Tipton.  Over an aching     vocal performance, Tipton swaddles Nilsson all in bells, oboes, glockenspiels, blurted brass, pizzicato'd     violins, and xylophones, bidding an elongated adieu to pop's previously ornate design.</p>
<p>Tipton also provides the orchestration for the added demo of ""Gotta Get Up"", a shiny remainder of baroque     tendencies that has our man keeping the song at a bubblegum level, sidestepping the album's more ""blue""     themes.  The soap opera twinkling of the demo version of ""The Moonbeam Song"" reveals its beauty from the     start.  Weirdest of the bunch is the throwaway, ""Lamaze"". Banged out on piano and with a grandiose burst     of Franco-babble about contractions and moving the left and right leg, Nilsson's joker smile flashes for     an instant, a goofy, eclectic streak that riddled other parts of his catalog, like the follow-up, <i>Son     of Schmilsson</i>.  Aiming for the heart and the top of the pops, though, Nilsson's <i>Schmilsson</i>, in     its shuffling, slightly askew, and idiosyncratic way, hit it all perfectly, and this ridiculously overdue     reissue still makes my day.</p></div>"|5887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5887-nilsson-schmilsson/|9.4|Andy Beta

    Sweetheart</i> could have been stupendous: check Courtney charging out of a Hollywood compound, flaming
    guitar slung low around a bare neck, shoulders suddenly and miraculously freed from the impossible weight
    of addiction and trauma, stuffing her solo debut in the mouths of her most vocal detractors and proving
    relevance against all odds.  It could have been perfectly majestic, glorious, stupefying.  Instead,
    <i>America's Sweetheart</i> is exactly what you thought it would be: collapsible, frantic and depressingly
    repulsive.</p><p>
    
    Most music fans are curiously well-acquainted with Courtney Love's battle scars, and capable of name-checking
    the formative circumstances for each dull, yellowing bruise.  Half the post-Kurt barbs lodged at her were
    either painfully sexist, dumbfoundingly naive, or both-- and while it's easy to argue that Love wholeheartedly
    encouraged her own pigeonholing, the resulting avalanche of whore/addict punchlines also completely fucked
    up her chances at having her records judged on their artistic merits alone.  No matter whom you end up
    blaming for it (see Love's grievous, unapologetic attention-grubbing, or a press historically perplexed by
    women with guitars), Love's sloppy public persona has long superceded her music.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, this kind of filter is as boring as it is superfluous: arguing over whether or not Love's
    empowerment-heavy punk posturing was compromised by a team of plastic surgeons and Versace-fitters is
    interesting only as it relates to her lyrical agenda; bickering about the songwriting credits on Hole
    records (Kurt Cobain? Billy Corgan? Michael Stipe?) is relevant only in terms of how you finally decide
    to judge the respective heft of a collaborative effort.</p><p>
    
    Because in the end, journalists and fans have always been more than happy to swallow the goofy, satisfying
    sleaze of hair metal bands and poorly-aging cockrockers, but a drug-addled, sexually aggressive woman still
    grosses everybody out.  And while including a discussion of Courtney's personal life in a conversation about
    her music may have become unfortunately inevitable, it's also totally unnecessary.  <i>America's Sweetheart</i>
    comes complete with enough unforgivable flaws to nobly arm anyone even remotely interested in a vicious
    attack.  It's finally safe to ignore Courtney's ridiculous magazine antics; this record is a far more
    embarrassing and desperate spectacle than shedding an overpriced shirt for a British photographer or
    bickering with Dave Grohl.</p><p>
    
    At its best, <i>America's Sweetheart</i> sounds helplessly marred, as if it's been completely and preemptively
    exhausted by several named (""an eight ball isn't love"") and unnamed sources.  Being that Love is often an
    overtly confessional (verging on solipsistic) songwriter, the sludge of her recreational activities comes
    to bear pretty heavily on her songs, both lyrically and vocally.  Love's once-powerful pipes have been
    scratched raw, the low, rumbly growls of yesteryear giving way to a thin, disembodied screech.  No matter
    how many filters her yelps are re-routed through, or how blushingly blatant her lyrics remain, Love's new
    anti-range is incapable of conveying any of the clenched-fist fury her fans have come to expect.  Sometimes
    Love sounds harried and overwhelming, nuance-free and overstretched (""All the Drugs""); other times, her
    voice is so heavily treated that it becomes essentially unrecognizable (see the anonymous sing-sounds of
    ""Sunset Strip"").  Opener and lead single ""Mono"" is prefaced by a series of ""Hey!"" screams that sound so
    unpleasantly inhuman (they resurface before the otherwise non-specific Strokes-homage ""But Julian, I'm
    a Little Bit Older Than You"") that it's hard not to bend your ears away from your speakers in knee-jerk
    self-defense.</p><p>
    
    While it's unfair to directly compare Courtney's solo work with Hole's shifty discography, <i>America's
    Sweetheart</i> demonstrates a fairly monstrous decline in both quality and conviction.  The record is caked
    in thick, indiscriminate guitar goo and peppered with quasi-confrontational lyrics (""I got pills for my
    coochie/ Coz baby I'm sore""), but it ultimately fails to recapture the convincingly bratty swagger of
    Love's tipsy past, while retaining all the dated grunge crunch.  No matter how many times she hollers
    gabba gabba hey, <i>America's Sweetheart</i> is still insanely one-dimensional and oddly anti-punk (see
    also the ""find legal downloads... save the music!"" dogma of the liner notes).  Half the tracks are imminently
    forgettable (especially the early-90s buzz of ""Uncool"", ""I'll Do Anything"" and ""Life Without God""), while
    the others either grate (""Zeplin Song"") or seem vaguely desperate in their grasps at relevance (two
    mentions of Eminem?).</p><p>
    
    Having exhausted either the patience or the songwriting skills of her contemporaries, Love opted to mine
    the resources of generations below and beyond, enlisting Elton John lyricist Bernie Taupin and Xtina/Pink
    hitmaker Linda Perry (credited as a co-writer on nine of the record's twelve tracks) to act as collaborators.
    What's weird is that their presence is almost impossible to note-- some of these tracks take half-hearted
    swipes at pop palatability (""Never Gonna Be the Same""), but very few come close to achieving any kind of
    accessibility.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, the title of <i>America's Sweetheart</i> isn't just cute, it's caustic.  Courtney Love is only
    now coming to terms with the hyper-reality of being Courtney Love: drug-addicted, flailing artists are rightly
    tragic, but America still, for assorted reasons, finds Love annoying.  <i>America's Sweetheart</i> is both
    a response to and a reflection of that collective distaste, inadvertently perpetuating Courtney-mythology
    while simultaneously half-smirking at it.  In the end, it's the partially cooked anger here that's most
    compelling: In the future, Love's tragic flaws may be her only shot at redemption.</p></div>"|4889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4889-americas-sweetheart/|4.0|Amanda Petrusich

    I'll admit that the first time I heard them, I thought they were just an exceptionally drunk Irish trad
    group.  But listening more closely, I heard the sounds of defiance and ethnic exultation in Shane's lyrics
    about getting drunk, wandering around town drunk, going to church drunk, and getting blown into little tiny
    pieces in the Battle of Gallipolli.  The Pogues were so punk they didn't need overdriven guitar, breakneck
    drumming or discontented lyrics.  They, like The Clash, knew that punk was an approach, not a template, and
    that it found its best expression in Beat-like joy and darkness.</p><p>
    
    Now that The Pogues are no more (or maybe they still are, but without Shane there's hardly any point), the
    world needs The Klezmatics more than ever.  Nerdy where The Pogues were scruffy, and stoned where they were
    drunk, The Klezmatics are the uncontested rulers of the current Jewish Alternative Movement/Radical Jewish
    Culture/Scare Your Grandparents scene.  Sure, John Zorn releases more records in a month than The Klezmatics
    do in a decade, but the 'Matics do a much better job of fusing the traditional with the radical-- side
    project Hasidic New Wave reworked a Dead Kennedys chestnut as ""Giuliani Uber Alles"", but The Klezmatics
    would not be out of place playing a Long Island bar mitzvah.</p><p>
    
    And now they've released <i>Rise Up!</i>, a record plagued by delays.  Is it worth the wait?  Probably.
    It's certainly not as out-there as their last couple of albums, but that might be because we know to
    expect the unexpected from this crew.  It's certainly a more mellow ride than <i>Possessed</i> or <i>Jews
    with Horns</i>, and maybe that makes <i>Rise Up!</i> as utterly bizarre as Mr. Bungle's Brian Wilson
    tribute, <i>California</i>.</p><p>
    
    The immediate standout, ""I Ain't Afraid"", is also the only one sung mostly in English.  Beginning with a
    Sousa-meets-Peter Tosh drumbeat, it quickly becomes a defiant declaration of religious independence.  Lorin
    Sklamberg tells us that he's not afraid of God, but rather ""what you do in the name of your God.""  For a
    supposedly religious band (my local record shop files klezmer music in the back of the Christian section),
    this is a 95 Theses moment.  Sklamberg and his gospel-flavored backup singers implore their listeners to
    ""rise up"" against the ""ones who say they know it"" before they ""impose it on you.""  The lyrics alternate
    between English and Yiddish, just to make sure that all of their target audience understands the message
    exactly.  Blam.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the record is less gripping.  ""Tepel"" is a fast freylech with a nifty a cappella intro by
    Sklamberg, followed by an overcaffeinated faux-children's chorus.  ""Bulgars #2 (Tantsn un Shpringen)"" is
    a traditional dance tune with a driving beat and a couple of great breakdowns.  And yes, it's a bit odd to
    use the word ""breakdowns"" to describe a klezmer tune, but I don't think anyone will mind. ""Barikadn
    (Barricades)"", which samples a 1948 recording by Shmerke Kaczerginsky, is a ballad of a workers' revolution
    (""Fathers, mothers, children, too/ Are building barricades/ Detachments march along the streets/ Workers on
    parade"") set over a free-jazz folk dance tune.  The Yiddish lyrics make the song sound like something my
    grandmother would enjoy, but the lyrics sound primed for an (International) Noise Conspiracy record.  The
    punk community has yet to embrace The Klezmatics the way it did The Pogues, and I'm guessing it has something
    to do with their lack of pop immediacy or heroin habits (and their dopey sense of humor doesn't help, either).
    Still, <i>Rise Up!</i> is as welcoming as it is challenging, and a welcome addition to their forward-looking,
    tradition-shattering oeuvre.</p></div>"|4570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4570-rise-up/|8.0|J. Wasserman

After ten     years making music, first in Number One Cup, later in Chicago's brilliant, aggressively experimental Fire     Show, and now on his own as Resplendent, he writes that he's grown tired of playing the game of promotion     and jumping through the music industry's hoops, and as a result, his series of numbered, tin-encased EPs     isn't selling at all.  He hits on a sad truism of really any line of business: It's almost impossible to     succeed if you don't play the game at least a little.  But in a sense, you could say he's never really     played the game the way it's supposed to be played; at every stage of his career, Lenzi has made or been     a part of making music that broached no compromises with anyone.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like he's ready to start changing his ways now, either, as all three of his solo EPs have     steadfastly walked unbeaten paths away from his older work, all the while sharing with his past a seeming     addiction to change and exploration.  While his first EP, last summer's <i>In a Wilderness</i>, struck in     a sort of lo-fi hip-hop direction with detours into dark-forest IDM and demon-approved lullabies (okay, it     was all over the place) with appropriately mixed results, the two that have followed it, <i>Wings Beneath     the Sills</i> and <i>Casket City Wolves</i>, are minor masterworks of sometimes breathtaking beauty and     startling creativity.  Whereas <i>In a Wilderness</i> seemed to strive for invention, its counterparts are     effortlessly new sounding, almost inevitable in their off-handed innovation.</p>
<p><i>Wings Beneath the Sills</i> opens with an unsettling combination of steel drums and flute, which comprise     nearly the entire arrangement of ""Resolution Time"", apart from Lenzi's low-key vocal.  Oddly, the song's     chord structures and melody (partially nicked from The Clash, but only just) lend it an old-school R&amp;B;     feel-- it's consonant, eerie, familiar, and alien all at once.  The disc is filled with fractured percussion:     ""Luminescent Exultant Chariot"" is constituted entirely by sputtering drum cutups, minimal, rounded synth     tones and Lenzi's solemn sing/speak.  Those rounded synths help shape the static core of ""Nape of Neck     Hints"", giving Lenzi's plaintive vocals (played backward for one verse) something to cling to and helping     to create the prettiest squall of noise I've ever heard, while ""Sleeptalking in the Natatorium"" raises the     hair on your neck with its grotesquely gorgeous wash of sound-- it's pastoral and yet mechanical, like     Boards of Canada with razor edges.</p>
<p><i>Casket City Wolves</i> builds on the textural blueprint of <i>Wings</i>, with greater rhythmic variety     and an ear toward more traditional songcraft.  ""Judas Priest Cul de Sac"" is nudged along by a keyboard     bassline and junk percussion courtesy of Califone's Ben Massarella and Chicago session man Joe Adamik,     while Lenzi's vocal melody casts hooks across it all-- it's a pop song, basically, but the jittery texture     and oddball arrangement turn it completely on its head.  ""Rise the Sun (On Cassette Mountain)"" swings from     sung/spoke verses to catchy choruses complete with descending, sing-songy bass countermelodies that are     perversely sunny next to Lenzi pleading ""don't take your shit out on me.""</p>
<p>According to his site, Lenzi is now working on a Resplendent full-length, and the mind reels trying to     imagine what he's got cooking up in the studio.  The signature sound he's forged has almost limitless     potential to expand and incorporate essentially whatever threads might be hanging nearby, and his minimalist     approach is devastating almost by default.  As the closing tones of ""Dreamer's Dub"" evaporate into the     ether to end <i>Casket City Wolves</i>, it intentionally leaves you hanging, wanting more.  Whatever     follows is almost sure to be amazing.</p></div>"|11817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11817-wings-beneath-the-sillscasket-city-wolves/|8.4|Joe Tangari

I didn't dress
    funny or drink Pabst Blue Ribbon (unless I was at the Empty Bottle, and only then because it was $1.00) or
    any other such affectation adopted by roots rock weirdos.  But the Old 97s, Whiskeytown, Richard Buckner,
    et al., were the focus of my taste and time.  If you're like me, then you consider 1997 to be ""The Year
    Y' allternative Broke.""  Between <i>Too Far to Care</i>, <i>Stranger's Almanac</i> and <i>Devotion &amp; Doubt</i>
    in my CD changer rested <i>24 Hours a Day</i> by The Bottle Rockets, which I considered to be one of the
    finest albums released in that heady year.  The (let's face it, clock-stoppingly ugly) boys from Festus,
    Missouri peaked on that well-written, witty and ridiculously catchy record.</p><p>
    
    Brian Henneman's songwriting, of course, has always tended toward the obvious, but any simple-mindedness
    seemed to belie the underlying small-town tunefulness and universality of theme that songs such as ""1000
    Dollar Car"" and ""When I Was Dumb"" made good on.  The high points of their earlier records were almost
    always smarter than a cursory listen would indicate, and the great songs far outnumbered the mediocre
    ones for a short time.  But even the casual observer could sense trouble in the late 90s, when the band
    released back-to-back pedestrian efforts between 1999's ""Brand New Year"" and 2001's Bloodshot-issued
    <i>Songs of Sahm</i>, an album's worth of Doug Sahm covers.  Even the usually able production of Eric
    Ambel couldn't save the rote ""Year"", which sandwiched losers like ""The Bar's on Fire"" between alternate
    versions of the winning title track.  And a covers record, no matter how worthy the subject, always speaks
    to the songwriting well running dry, which obviously Henneman's had.</p><p>
    
    With all of this in mind, my optimism ran high that, after an extended layoff, the band could at least
    conjure the spirit of their earlier winning streak.  How disappointing to find that, after an early
    highlight (""Lucky Break"", which was done better as ""Welfare Music"" on <i>The Brooklyn Side</i>), ""Blue Sky""
    descends into an utterly boring sloppy mess.  Perhaps most tellingly, the album's only other worthy track,
    ""I Don't Wanna Go Back"", isn't written by Henneman at all.  By the time <i>Blue Sky</i> slumps to ""Pretty
    Little Annie"", a somewhat disturbing tale of voyeuristic borderline pedophilia that lifts the riff from
    Sahm's ""She's About a Mover"" note-for-note, I just get frustrated.  What's happened here?  I mean, I <i>never</i>
    expected experimentation or growth from these guys, but surely, a listenable record is not too much to ask
    for.  Going through the motions is usually reserved for aging stars playing out the string for legions of
    fans eager for any new output from their old favorite, not a group hungrily clinging to a record contract
    and lugging gear from gig to gig to pay the bills.</p><p>
    
    Put simply, <i>Blue Sky</i> is a heartbreaker, and not the Ryan Adams kind.  As evidenced by any number of
    90s hits compilations, nostalgia moves faster all the time; at least some basic recycling would have allowed
    me to re-engage with their music the way I once did, and maybe even relive some of the better moments I've
    had while their music played out in the background.  <i>Blue Sky</i> fails to even approximate that sound.
    Rather, it's their bleakest and most humbled record to date: They've lost all hope, and so have I.</p></div>"|1100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1100-blue-sky/|3.0|Chris Drabick

         --Danny Furious of The Avengers, on opening for the Sex Pistols at the
    Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, Jan. 14, 1978</p><p>
    It was the best of punk, it was the worst of punk; it was December 1977, the winter of nearly everyone's
    discontent, but it had been a banner year for angry young men on a handful of continents.  All you
    disenfranchised modern malcontents, you grew up too damn late.  Even Lester Bangs, the most vociferously
    jerky of all knee-jerk misanthropes, was predicting great things; he'd just published a three-part treatise
    on egalitarianism, the new democracy of music, and the frailties of human nature in <i>NME</i> masquerading humbly as an observer's tour diary with the Clash.  The Ramones were finally bringing the Bowery to Britain,
    and the few, nascent battle-cries of the MC5, The Stooges, and the New York Dolls from a few years back
    were now being echoed by thousands of new voices.  None, of course, screamed louder than the Sex Pistols,
    though; with some careful management, in just over a year, the Pistols had enjoyed more controversy and
    notoriety than most other punk acts combined.  For better or worse, they were the public face of punk, a
    voice for all the restless rejects shouting down all comers, and they were on a collision course with the
    southern United States.</p><p>
    By December 30th, 1977, the Sex Pistols didn't even have visas; less than three weeks later, after a brutal
    reception throughout America's heartland, John Lydon sat dejected on the stage of the Winterland Ballroom
    and famously asked, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""  With his last words as Johnny Rotten, he
    cast off the fetid mantle of punk's figurehead, and the most notorious punk band of the era had hung it up;
    with Goliath slain, so died the ""big story"" of punk.  Most of the press dried up, casual, rubbernecked
    gawkers looked for another car wreck, and inside of five years, the punk journalists had burnt out, the
    punk heroes had blown up, and punk footnotes like The Avengers had simply faded away.  Punk rock,
    bang-to-bust, a flicker of revolutionary greatness smothered by <i>de rigeur</i> rebellion, and all neatly
    summed up in a tumultuous microcosmic two-month tumble.  Conventional wisdom is often simplistic like that.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Rhino's overwhelmingly comprehensive four-disc love letter to the heart and soul of punk music
    isn't particularly conventional.  While punk remained a mostly well-kept (and easily documented) secret
    prior to the Sex Pistols' spectacular collapse, the aftermath of the punk explosion was a shambles.  That
    the Pistols are conspicuously absent on <i>No Thanks!</i> might be the doing of a petulant Lydon (presumably
    irked that Rhino pulled a stateside release of a Sex Pistols box a few years back), but fitting nonetheless.
    Fine.  Fuck 'em.  Of all the admirable successes of <i>No Thanks!</i>, the finest is surely the deliberateness
    with which it unearths so many of the also-rans long-since buried in the Pistols' wake.  With barely a track
    to spare for The Clash, The Ramones, or The Fall, they're barely an afterthought here.  <i>No Thanks!</i>
    isn't about  ""essential""; it's ""scope,"" pure magnitude.  Deadbeats and dilettantes, glammed progenitors and goth
    poseurs, the revered and the reviled.  This isn't just ""punk,"" this is everything that was boiling beneath
    the surface, the whole of the late-70s underground brought to light.</p><p>
    The Motors will never, ever be spoken of in the same regard as Richard Hell.  Or The Damned.  Or even
    Generation X (Billy Idol was the Diamond Dave of punk rock, after all).  Ditto for the Glen Matlock's
    Rich Kids, 999, The Vibrators, Subway Sect, and half of the other bands that grace this stage, and that's
    the collection's charm; every Englishman or Yankee to ever hold a guitar, let alone learn to play one (how
    else can you explain The Adverts?) gets at least an act, maybe two.  The diversity contained here is
    staggering, but the disparity of sound is nullified by the unity of motivations; whether out of sincerity or fashionability, everyone's got a grudge to bear.  No matter what form it
    takes, the underlying theme is simple dissatisfaction; no one was playing because he or she was happy
    (except maybe Devo-- who knows what they wanted?).  Something, <i>anything</i>, needed to change, but all
    any of these people were empowered to do was play music.  Punk was fundamentally unfocused rage, a loaded
    gun aimed at any institution-- politics, clothing, loneliness, provinciality, music itself-- too societally entrenched
    to get out of the way.  The tactics aren't always smart, and rarely pretty, but the execution is brilliant,
    and Rhino has released the ultimate document.</p><p>
    Large-scale entropy demands order, though, if only to maintain the physical form of the discs themselves.
    To that end, Rhino offers two minimal criteria: Every track included must come from label-distributed
    singles released during the 70s.  The 70s was a singles-driven decade, for certain; some pulse-stopping
    LPs emerged from bands that went on to dominate the canon, but many of the other bands had the half-life
    of a mayfly-- they were lucky to even make it through a 45 before splintering.  With a fraction of the
    media saturation we have today, bands fought for recognition on the radio waves, or <i>Top of the Pops</i>,
    or with the pocketbooks of the working poor-- three minutes were all they had to make a name for themselves.
    And surely, chronology must factor in, so, sure, why not draw the line at the close of the 70s?</p><p>
    [Beware: the pointless whining of a perfectionist follows, but only out of my all-consuming love.]</p><p>
    Here's why.  Arbitrary guidelines made out of necessity are for sissies; reap your bastard rewards:  No
    Crass-- ridiculously, sincerely radical, no one epitomized agit-punk better.  No Anti-Nowhere League--
    they drove around in a van spray-painted with ""We're the Anti-Nowhere League and you're not""; a completely
    laughable bunch of buffoons, but for sheer, mindless disposability, ""We Are the League"" isn't so far removed
    from The Vibrators' ""Baby Baby"".  Plus, Elvis Costello liked them.  No Angelic Upstarts-- see Crass; skinheads
    against racism.  No Misfits-- for the 28 minutes of <i>Static Age</i>, The Misfits were as perfectly hopeless
    as the best the West Coast had to offer, schlock horror and all.  No Birthday Party-- same reason, but Nick
    the Stripper &amp; Co. are Aussies.  No Rocket From the Tombs-- sure, why include the first voice of Cleveland
    punk, the group that spawned both The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu (who are naturally present)?  No MC5!-- ""Rock
    &amp; roll, drugs, and fucking in the streets"" was printed on their freakin' business cards.  No Lou Reed-- I
    heard he shot anti-freeze and lived, dudes.  There's more.  And yet we're left with Devo.  That doesn't
    even touch on multiple questionable song choices; ""Final Solution"" is a poor man's alternative to ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo""
    (and that was a single!), but I'm about to get carried away.  Let common sense dictate some choices, guys;
    this compilation is so close.</p><p>
    But even if not absolutely perfect (and could any compilation really be?), compilations don't come more
    <i>essential</i> than this; it is required listening for anyone new to punk, and unquestionably the best
    primer on this music in existence.  Rhino does away with any pretense of chronology to great effect;
    vital, fiery sermons spar with tense, calculated cool, and with one-hits back-to-back with the classics,
    virtually every track commands attention.  Middleman-ing between Richard Hell's perversely jubilant ""Love
    Comes in Spurts"" and the primally willful, snot-nosed ignorance of The Dead Boys' classic ""Sonic Reducer"",
    even the (still living) Boys' ""First Time"" sounds like a hit.  Each disc is an untouchable mix, varied
    enough that five consecutive hours of listening isn't out of reach, but Rhino have outdone themselves even
    here, in case you can't afford that time commitment.  Subtle as it is, disc one flirts precariously with becoming a full-fledged classics compilation,
    between opening with ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" and ""White Riot"", followed in short order by The Damned's blistering
    ""Neat Neat Neat"", The Jam, Pere Ubu, and Jonathan Richman's hypnotic ode to midnight radio at a thousand
    miles an hour, ""Roadrunner"".</p><p>
    The proud, preening showcase taken by disc one is welcome as a one-shot primer, but in the end, nothing but old news,
    and just as compelling as the less-well-traveled discs two and three.  Disc four, however, is the true masterpiece;
    coming close to exposing the splintered force of punk near the end of the decade, frail and faltering against
    the ropes before succumbing fully to new wave and post-punk, it takes an angle not often seen.  With early
    idealism and bravado stripped aside, bands were slowly falling out of step.  Talking Heads and Elvis Costello's
    ""Radio, Radio"" carefully tread the path to commercial success that Blondie recklessly followed before them;
    ""Boys Don't Cry"" famously hints at The Cure's forthcoming, beautiful pop romanticism.  Gang of Four ride
    Andy Gill's shattered guitar lines all the way to name-drop superstardom; ""Adult Books"" is X's impression
    of Talking Heads before they leave the limitations of West Coast punk behind for the Dead Kennedys to flog.  These
    are the epilogues to a story stretched out over the three prior discs, and provides easily the most
    memorable individual moments of this compilation.</p><p>
    The last notes heard as <i>No Thanks!</i> closes out the decade are Joy Division's, with an air of obvious
    finality, but Johnny Thunders' ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"" is more poignant.  Thunders' life
    mirrors the larger story of punk as presented here in a way the Sex Pistols never can.  From his untouchable
    beginnings with the New York Dolls, he was a catalyst of the breaking New York scene, but he was helpless,
    naïve and vain-- he fractured the Dolls because he wanted the spotlight.  Although he went on to headline
    with The Heartbreakers, he toiled only to mixed success in a sea of bands he helped inspire.  A growing
    heroin habit eventually dissolved any vestige of stability, and The Heartbreakers, too, buckled under the
    pressure.  For his remaining years, Johnny solo was a joke; not falling off the stage marked a successful performance.
    Shooting up in his hands and feet because other veins had collapsed, playing for cash in hand to get smack
    after the show-- he tried to clean up, but like so many tragic figures, it seems, he was too late.  Johnny Thunders
    died in 1991, long after the punk rock he fostered had disappeared, but he wrote ""Memory"" in 1978; like
    him, its greatness had passed, but it would be a long time fading away.  ""It doesn't pay to try/ All the
    smart boys know why,"" and when he sings it with his innocent, put-upon inflection, one thing is certain:
    He was too dumb not to give it his best shot, and smart enough to realize it.  We're better off that he-- and the rest of them-- did try, at least; I can't think of a more
    appropriate conclusion.</p></div>"|1969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1969-no-thanks-the-70s-punk-rebellion/|10.0|Eric Carr

    1. The DFA's James Murphy produced this album.  My bet is that Murphy's presence is the primary reason, if
    not the only reason, that Temporary Residence has re-released Evergreen's 1996 self-titled opus. Murphy is
    relevant, the DFA is untouchable, and here we are, for better or worse, in the Pasiphaean throes of
    disco-punk, whose only worthwhile examples have been the ones in which Murphy himself has been directly
    involved.  That said, Evergreen are not disco-punk.  Their album is not some proto-DFA, proto-""HOJL"",
    Ur-dancerock underground classic (although I'm willing to entertain the possibility that those who say
    otherwise are simply very imaginative dancers), and if hi-hat cymbals open at all during a song, check
    your speakers before you wind your neck.</p><p>
    
    2a. Britt Walford, who percussed most notably in Kentucky bands Squirrel Bait, Slint, and The Breeders, is
    Evergreen's drummer and keyboardist.  The operative word here is Slint, precisely because of how telling--
    and dare I say, how inexhaustibly fun-- the game of rock-and-roll connect-the-dots becomes when Slint and
    post-Slint splinter bands are its playthings.  Yet even I, who at the slight downward turn of a mid-90s
    volume knob, haphazardly cry out ""Slint! Slint!"" as if the band invented dynamics, can hardly forge
    half-baked synapses between <i>Spiderland</i> and Walford's effort (though moments on ""Solar System"",
    ""New York City"" and, I guess, ""Klark Kent"" might have a chance with more time).  Perhaps there's a reason
    Evergreen aren't mentioned as often in the same breath as, say, The For Carnation or Pajo M, who betray
    their Slint roots more ostensibly.</p><p>
    
    2b. Listen, if anything, Evergreen are just solid sorta-garage rockers-- less energetic though more colorful
    than The Stooges; reminiscent of Fugazi's overall timbre but not nearly as trigonometric; nearly as dark as
    the Pixies' most opaque moments, but never approaching their expectations of melody.  Evergreen recorded
    13 songs in toto (11 from their original LP on Hi-Ball and two bonus non-Murphy recordings), a few of which
    are pretty good.  It just might be a bit overblown to put Evergreen in the credmonger's favorite room, the
    nymphaeum of criminally overlooked albums.  It's not the curiously adolescent marriage some of us expected
    between the DFA's dancefloor sensibilities and an emotionally charged, possibly Slinty sound, but <i>Evergreen</i>,
    taken for the sloppy 90s rock romp it actually is, certainly proves itself worthy of re-release.</p><p>
    
    2c. Fight me about it, take me to town, etc., but garage-rock is
    garage-rock. ""Pants Off"" is equal parts 'Stripes, Hendrix, and Stooges
    blues ""ballad,"" with very little to differentiate itself from those acts.
    Hendrix aside, if anything Evergreen seems to possess musicians who are
    more technically proficient, and since Murphy's production refuses to push
    all channels to the front of the mix, the album's depth of sound mirrors
    the depth of Evergreen's compositions in earnest. This works to the band's
    advantage on songs like opener ""Fairline"", whose fresh drum-led intro with
    gritty guitar catcalls vividly recalls the opening moments of Miles Davis'
    ""Right Off"" on <i>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</i>, and also in parts like the
    second half of ""Klark Kent"", a glassy-eyed outro where single-line guitar
    parts converge from deep within the mix into a swooning maelstrom. The
    downside is that it presents straightforward and unilateral rockers like
    ""Whip Cream Bottle"" as a little more airy than they were likely intended,
    and as a result, the band sacrifices immediacy for more texture than is
    probably needed.</p><p>
    
    2d. ""New York City"" is nothing new but still fantastic, a simple instrumental built around an off-kilter,
    two-chord guitar riff and a steady low bass punch.  I admit I like this song because we can see Murphy's
    role and Slint's possible influence on Evergreen most clearly.  As the track progresses, low-level squeaks
    and squirms are left unfiltered to pass into the mix, and Walford's drumming ebbs back and forth with
    metallic complexity, the other parts barely changing up their acts at all.  By the next track, ""Coyote"",
    Evergreen return to their sophisto-garage tendencies, which, while not the sound I most appreciate on the
    album, is pretty much fine, too.</p></div>"|2898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2898-evergreen/|7.4|Nick Sylvester

The reason you're reading this has a lot less to do with Twista than with
    super-producer/rapper/genius purveyor of chipmunk soul Kanye West.  I know because I'm here for the
    same reason.  The album's first single is the inescapable ""Slow Jamz"", produced by and featuring fellow
    Chi-town native Kanye along with comedian Jamie Foxx on the R&amp;B-loving; hook.  This Luther Vandross-ripping
    soulfest has somehow placed Twista's third solo album at the top of this week's <i>Billboard</i> charts.
    Which is incredible on a few fronts.  First and foremost, Twista is the ugliest man in hip-hop.  Just peep
    the album cover: Dude's an acne-riddled Rescue Ranger.  Second, after more than a year of delays, it's the
    Road Runner-rapping MC's first album in nearly five years.</p><p>
    
    This aside, Twista (formerly Tung Twista) sports perhaps the most dexterous flow since mid-90s Busta, and
    on ""Slow Jamz"", he wraps his voice around a supremely accelerated Burt Bacharach-penned sample.  Unfortunately,
    based on the immediately quotable couplet, ""Got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a
    dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson,"" Kanye outshines him completely.</p><p>
    
    While Twista could rely solely on his ridiculous verbal agility on posse cuts like Memphis Bleek's classic
    ""Is That Your Bitch?"", he hasn't got it in him to sustain an entire album.  And if <i>Kamikaze</i> isn't an
    absolute abomination, its scope quickly reveals itself as limited: three songs about female ass (including
    the hilarious ""Badunkadunk"" and the R. Kelly event ""So Sexy""), a sequel to a song no one's heard (""Still
    Feels So Good"") and another about rims (""Like a 24"", featuring T.I., who also has a single about rims in
    rotation right now-- sadly, his are only 22's).  Topics like these have been drained of what little juice
    they might have had by, among others, the nefarious Nelly.</p><p>
    
    Aside from ""Slow Jamz"", Kanye's production appears twice more, on ""One Last Time"", and later, on ""Overnight
    Celebrity"", which outdoes his previous crate-digging by jacking Lenny Williams' 70s Motown hit ""'Cause I
    Love You"".  Bombastic strings, heart-rattling urgency, and Twista's sharpest punchlines make it the star
    of the record.  Elsewhere, the vaguely uplifting (but ultimately perfunctory) ""Hope"" fills Twista's
    ""sensitive thug"" prerequisite.  Granted, any rap song that gives a hopeful shoutout to Christopher Reeve's
    ability to walk is going to seem strangely off-putting.  Thankfully, Cee-Lo's shimmering chorus saves this
    borderline piffle.</p><p>
    
    On the strip-club anthem ""Sunshine"", Twista nearly pisses all over what little respect he's gathered to
    date, sampling Bill Withers' luminescent ""Lovely Day"".  Good thing The Gap already raped the beauty of
    that song.  ""Drinks"" compares fine ladies to-- naturally-- alcoholic beverages while Toxic, who produces
    nearly half the album, provides the best Dr. Dre-impersonation you'll hear this side of Scott Storch.
    <i>Kamikaze</i> ends with one last Roc-A-Fella posse cut, ""Art &amp; Life"".  The song, laced with a beat
    worthy of an NBA introduction ceremony, features strong verses from Freeway, Memphis Bleek and Young
    Chris, until Twista swoops in to smoke to whatever's left of the ominous beat.  Obviously, Twista's
    not breaking down any walls with his wordplay on <i>Kamikaze</i>, but along the way he kicks over a few
    garbage cans while letting Kanye West, Toxic and the rest of his production crew move some crowds and
    elevate their status, one slow jam at a time.</p></div>"|8253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8253-kamikaze/|6.4|Sean Fennessey

I don't claim to have     the most bizarre profession on staff, but my capacity as a curator of the Special Exhibits Gallery for the     Kansas State Historical Society gives me a lot of time to think about history's trajectory.  Amongst the     thousands of dissertations, portfolios and anthologies that slide across my desk claiming to classify epochs     and develop new historical methodologies and schemas, there's one thesis I don't believe I've ever heard     proposed in any of these texts: The 60s were fucking nuts. Like seriously.</p>
<p>The historian Alice Echols claims that the culmination of the 60s occurred at the infamous Rainbow Ricochet     soiree on May 8, 1967.  And indeed, it's difficult to combat any party (let alone that epic bacchanal) that     found Timothy Leary, Otis Redding, Abbie Hoffman, Betty Friedan, Stanley Kubrick, Twinkle and the newly     appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd hovering (literally, according to some eyewitnesses)     around a punch bowl that packed enough wallop to send eleven attendees home in body bags.  The sheer     wackiness must have been astonishing, righteous, revolutionary and filled with enough permanent brain     atrophy to run for prime minister.  Any lingering devotees of the 1980s still insisting that ""well, um,     that Frehley's Comet album was pretty crazy for too, uh, often as well"" better pack up their belongings     and go home.  Fuckin' illiterates.  Learn to read.</p>
<p>And yet, there was an even more momentous day in the marshmallow-sky twirling unicorn massacre we call the     1960s.  In March 1967, The Red Crayola walked into the studio and spent a day making one of the most     visionary album of the year, <i>The Parable of Arable Land</i>.  It's a band that has no idea how to play     its instruments.  In fact, they don't even know what instruments are, or if the guitarist has the ability     to remain conscious long enough to play whatever it is a ""note"" might be.  Shattered psalms, wobbling     percussion courtesy of poet Frederick Barthelme, patently overused echo chambers, and the clumsiest     staircase bassline in garage history smashes into a bunch of clopping machine men as Mayo Thompson croons     out the only serious line in his entire career: ""I have in my pocket a hurricane fighter plane.""</p>
<p>And that's just one of the actual songs.  The ""free-form freakouts"" are about as fervidly psychotic as     anything in any genre.  This is a band that was paid ten dollars to stop a performance in Berkeley.  If     Berkeley's not having it, you know you're in for rough sledding.  (Think amplified ""Revolution 9"" or the     more scandalous Sun City Girls' field recordings.)  Kazoos, tribal race riots, steamrolled radios, irate     circus barkers, distressed toddlers, and spy themes assail each other over crackling soda pop.  And then     there's those oscillations and extravagant mouthfuls of static that are so heavy you may as well tattoo     fake PCP lips onto your skull and shoot yourself in the legs because you thought the act of shooting a gun     was the object chocolate worship goalosphere itself.  And in the middle, Thompson hollers out ""Woo-hoo!""     like he actually thinks he's rocking out.  He is mistaken; this is not a rockin' trip.  It's a mind-milkshake     where everyone's friends are dead in abscesses of lunatic incompetence at an epic pitch of stoner rock doom.     How could it possibly get any more chaotic?  Oh... I don't know.  How about if you put Roky Erickson on an     organ and told him to pretend he didn't have any hands?  Yes, that does the trick nicely.</p>
<p>A year later and a drummer short, Thompson recruited Tommy Smith to make something their label, International     Artists, might actually accept after the botched release of <i>Coconut Hotel</i>.  This is not to say <i>God     Bless the Red Krayola</i> is particularly accessible.  First of all, they spell their name incorrectly.  This     may seem like a feeble move, perhaps even stupid, but let us recall that misspelling is #1 on the     making-crazy-music-for-its-own-sake to-do list.  For all the laudations heaped upon the Krayola by the punk     and post-punk crowds, it might as well be bootleg Einstürzende Neubauten at its grimiest atonality and     infuritating double integral time signatures: ""The Shirt"" and ""The Jewels of Madonna"" are vicious gorges     brimming with abrasive wire-cutting, pop-gun propulsion, and whimpering, receding vocals.</p>

The     catchiest song might be the lost-love reverie of ""Victory Garden"", except the protagonist is Hitler patched     onto what we'll have to call an ""angular bop jam band"" simply to get out of it intact.  ""Ravi Shankar:     Parachutist"" is delivered with such convulsive sincerity, the lengthy interruption by a flickering middle     school choir's scales seems both disingenuous and ravenously insane.

I don't claim to have     the most bizarre profession on staff, but my capacity as a curator of the Special Exhibits Gallery for the     Kansas State Historical Society gives me a lot of time to think about history's trajectory.  Amongst the     thousands of dissertations, portfolios and anthologies that slide across my desk claiming to classify epochs     and develop new historical methodologies and schemas, there's one thesis I don't believe I've ever heard     proposed in any of these texts: The 60s were fucking nuts. Like seriously.</p>
<p>The historian Alice Echols claims that the culmination of the 60s occurred at the infamous Rainbow Ricochet     soiree on May 8, 1967.  And indeed, it's difficult to combat any party (let alone that epic bacchanal) that     found Timothy Leary, Otis Redding, Abbie Hoffman, Betty Friedan, Stanley Kubrick, Twinkle and the newly     appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd hovering (literally, according to some eyewitnesses)     around a punch bowl that packed enough wallop to send eleven attendees home in body bags.  The sheer     wackiness must have been astonishing, righteous, revolutionary and filled with enough permanent brain     atrophy to run for prime minister.  Any lingering devotees of the 1980s still insisting that ""well, um,     that Frehley's Comet album was pretty crazy for too, uh, often as well"" better pack up their belongings     and go home.  Fuckin' illiterates.  Learn to read.</p>
<p>And yet, there was an even more momentous day in the marshmallow-sky twirling unicorn massacre we call the     1960s.  In March 1967, The Red Crayola walked into the studio and spent a day making one of the most     visionary album of the year, <i>The Parable of Arable Land</i>.  It's a band that has no idea how to play     its instruments.  In fact, they don't even know what instruments are, or if the guitarist has the ability     to remain conscious long enough to play whatever it is a ""note"" might be.  Shattered psalms, wobbling     percussion courtesy of poet Frederick Barthelme, patently overused echo chambers, and the clumsiest     staircase bassline in garage history smashes into a bunch of clopping machine men as Mayo Thompson croons     out the only serious line in his entire career: ""I have in my pocket a hurricane fighter plane.""</p>
<p>And that's just one of the actual songs.  The ""free-form freakouts"" are about as fervidly psychotic as     anything in any genre.  This is a band that was paid ten dollars to stop a performance in Berkeley.  If     Berkeley's not having it, you know you're in for rough sledding.  (Think amplified ""Revolution 9"" or the     more scandalous Sun City Girls' field recordings.)  Kazoos, tribal race riots, steamrolled radios, irate     circus barkers, distressed toddlers, and spy themes assail each other over crackling soda pop.  And then     there's those oscillations and extravagant mouthfuls of static that are so heavy you may as well tattoo     fake PCP lips onto your skull and shoot yourself in the legs because you thought the act of shooting a gun     was the object chocolate worship goalosphere itself.  And in the middle, Thompson hollers out ""Woo-hoo!""     like he actually thinks he's rocking out.  He is mistaken; this is not a rockin' trip.  It's a mind-milkshake     where everyone's friends are dead in abscesses of lunatic incompetence at an epic pitch of stoner rock doom.     How could it possibly get any more chaotic?  Oh... I don't know.  How about if you put Roky Erickson on an     organ and told him to pretend he didn't have any hands?  Yes, that does the trick nicely.</p>
<p>A year later and a drummer short, Thompson recruited Tommy Smith to make something their label, International     Artists, might actually accept after the botched release of <i>Coconut Hotel</i>.  This is not to say <i>God     Bless the Red Krayola</i> is particularly accessible.  First of all, they spell their name incorrectly.  This     may seem like a feeble move, perhaps even stupid, but let us recall that misspelling is #1 on the     making-crazy-music-for-its-own-sake to-do list.  For all the laudations heaped upon the Krayola by the punk     and post-punk crowds, it might as well be bootleg Einstürzende Neubauten at its grimiest atonality and     infuritating double integral time signatures: ""The Shirt"" and ""The Jewels of Madonna"" are vicious gorges     brimming with abrasive wire-cutting, pop-gun propulsion, and whimpering, receding vocals.</p>
<p>That's not to say there aren't memorable ""songs"" here: ""Say Hello to Jamie Jones""' stark drumming and lulled     vocals are relentlessly dry and stoical, and the hilariously out-of-sync back-up singing on ""Save the House""     is the experimental rock version of call-and-response performed by stoners with Tourette's syndrome.  The     catchiest song might be the lost-love reverie of ""Victory Garden"", except the protagonist is Hitler patched     onto what we'll have to call an ""angular bop jam band"" simply to get out of it intact.  ""Ravi Shankar:     Parachutist"" is delivered with such convulsive sincerity, the lengthy interruption by a flickering middle     school choir's scales seems both disingenuous and ravenously insane.

    roughly as ""monkey tail"") through a curious field recording of mics encased in blocks of ice as they
    melted and fissured.  Although the humble label (which houses each CD in a thin card case and whose
    CD face contains concentric circles as its main design motif) excels more in documenting an intimate
    scene of unassuming folks combining acoustic instrumentation with gentle washes of electronic processes,
    the closest parallel I could draw would be to the similarly grounded Häpna label out of Sweden.</p><p>
    Aero is the double for label co-founder Koen Holtkamp and his own such explorations, and his latest release
    keeps with the modus operandi of the catalog to excellent effect.  Fellow labelmate Brendon Anderegg helps
    open the disc with a hesitant bit of banjo plucking.  The initial association might be to someone like The
    Books, but as the drone of the harmonium (or is it melodica?) swells and swallows up the sound in a dreamy
    gauze, there's little adherence to folk forms or tricky cut-editing, much less the shapes and sounds of the
    physical instrument itself.  Instead, sonic distillation is Aero's intent; the warmth of each blended element
    and how it permeates the whole is the focus.</p><p>
    Expanding out over the course of 11 minutes, ""Rises"" runs the twangs of Anderegg's guitar and what could
    be a pedal steel through the dream machine, so that they flicker past like a Kansas cornfield in the middle
    of a car nap.  The drift of the track becomes blurry but remains snug as it morphs into ""Falls"", with its
    more openly aired echoes that encase each bit of piano and guitar and give them more room to radiate.</p><p>
    Velocity finally happens to the sputtering bits of ""Rinse"", but as the increasingly unidentifiable sources
    are further reduced to abstract snaps, crackles and pops, we find ourselves plunked in the abstract spaces
    of ""Coast"", aware that the borders between each five-lettered track name are mere indicators of where we
    might be in the disc itself.  There is notable fuzz and ball of stylus fluff on ""Aug31"" and an embryonic
    fluidity to its neighboring ""Float"", but they're slight alterations in a holistic entity, fluctuating
    ratios of sound and processing pressure.  The traces of instrumentation gleaned at the start are further
    elucidated yet also freed from their encumbering sources as the disc moves along.  Aero's alembic-like
    attentions to the greater project of brining in time is not content to just dissolve it all into an
    ambient puddle.</p></div>"|425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/425-rises-and-falls/|7.6|Andy Beta

    Coppola expertly borrowed from a potent mix of ancient Japanese culture and kaleidoscopic urban Tokyo's
    American pop-culture obsession to stage one of the year's most moving films.  With an equally celebrated
    cult-status reception, the land of the samurai has embraced a number of American musical exports over the
    years, hosting a list of artists ranging from vital to virtually defunct-- among them, the sugary guitar-pop
    of Matthew Sweet.  <i>Kimi Ga Suki</i> is a requited return to form of the love affair, and sports the
    original lineup that spawned his swan song.  Originally crafted as a Japan-only release, the album has
    since deservedly been released domestically.</p><p>
    
    The time constraints placed on the production left Sweet with little room to foul up the effort with excess
    nursing or overwrought sonic-management, a problem that's sullied his most recent releases.  Opener ""Dead
    Smile""'s rousing chorus and buoyant melody molds a perfect pop anthem; simple and poignant, it represents
    everything maturated talent can and should positively yield.  Sweet's unpolluted execution even forgives
    the delivery of such second-language crafted lines (""You can't hide/ The rotten in your soul/ Cold as ice/
    Hot as burning coal"").</p><p>
    
    Most of the record plays to Sweet's strengths as a songwriter, as he spins timeless pop melodies that
    unravel with ease and retire before they grow too stale.  ""I Don't Want to Know"" and ""Love Is Gone""
    exemplify Sweet at his best; as the latter Big Star battleship-sinker overlaps crisp vocal harmonies,
    while gamboling across a simple, crestfallen acoustic framework.   Unfortunately, ""I Love You"" drags with
    a little sonic excess, but the same seed, properly nurtured, reaps its rewards in ""Spiral"" by simply
    staying shy of the two-minute mark.  Thankfully, Sweet keeps most of the songs right where they belong--
    hovering in and around three minutes.</p><p>
    
    True, there's little in the way of deftly pioneering material, but Sweet's never been one to shirk his
    influences, as his sound, both modern and classic, rests fitfully in the gray area between innovation and
    mimicry without really offering an insult to either camp.  Closer ""Through Your Eyes"" even comes off as an
    under-strung Ted Leo number, only you can't tell who influenced who, nor does it seem to matter.  It's a
    fitting end to an album that reaffirms Sweet's pop-chartering snap, not only across the sea but also amongst
    America's finest.</p></div>"|7659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7659-kimi-ga-suki/|7.3|William Morris

Jingle-jangle guitars,
    heart-on-sleeve lyrics, bouncy pop melodies, or even post-Spector/MBV washes of sound are typically the
    bricks and mortars of that sound.  Hitting the nail on the head or getting up and/or creating sounds to
    bop around the room to is fine and all, but at times, graceful tones and small gestures can be more riveting.
    The debut album by The Relict, a loose collective built around the gentle songwriting of former Clientele
    man Innes Phillips, captures that sometimes elusive hazy, textural charm.</p><p>
    Functioning more as a loose group of friends and collaborators than a full-time band, The Relict features
    vocal performances from a who's who of intelligent pop front people: The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean,
    Pipas' Lupe N\xB7\xD2ez-FerxB7ndez, Pam Berry (The Pines, Glo-Worm, Black Tambourine), and Abigail Marvell, as
    well as Phillips himself.  The Relict's debut, <i>Tomorrow Is Again</i>, is the culmination of years of
    work, featuring six tracks which appeared on the group's low-key 7"" releases over the past four years--
    ""Southern Way"" (which was recorded at the same session as The Clientele's glorious ""Reflections After Jane"" /
    ""An Hour Before the Light"" double A-side), ""Along the Avenue"", ""Held in Glass"", ""Childlike"", ""I Saw Your
    Eyes"", and ""Letters""-- as well as six previously unreleased songs.  A well-selected batch, the only largely
    regrettable omission is ""Out of Time"" which appeared on a Johnny Kane split single with Below the Sea.</p><p>
    Phillips' songwriting shares a number of qualities with MacLean's.  It's an enveloping, nuance-filled sound
    that paints pictures yet seems to present them in either different states of completion or to cast alike
    images in various shades of light.  Which isn't to say The Relict's songs sounds like sketches-- these are
    fully formed tracks, heartfelt and evocative but in a spacious, windswept way that invites the listener to
    fill in the contextual details or to attach his or her own associations.</p><p>
    The Relict are at their best when they shade closest to the woozy autumnal melancholy of The Clientele. It's
    then that Phillips' dexterity as a songwriter is best revealed and his propensity for highlighting slight
    movements in tone, mood, and pitch is most effective.  The removal of elements from typical indie pop
    structures allows him to relish in the empty space, to let a chime or chord or moment linger, compounding
    the record's faraway, 8mm feel without sacrificing its delicacy or elegance.  As a result, a track like
    ""Time Spent with You"" lingers and hovers like the memory of its titular moments and ""Held in Glass""
    perfectly balances the contradictions of its protagonists, actively seeking to interact with their world
    but still feeling trapped, restricted, and ultimately alone.</p><p>
    As with any record that seeks to sort of gently lull and woo, <i>Tomorrow Is Again</i> risks drifting from
    the speakers and never making a connection with its listener.  Pastoral and haunting, The Relict's charms
    are subtle but not slight.  The song's charms and the emotions they capture are more like a single ray
    peeking through the clouds than a bright sun-- welcome not only because they're rare and coveted, but also
    because it feels somehow as if they're potentially fleeting and fluid.  So when MacLean sings, ""I'll always
    remember your smile,"" on ""Letters"", it's either bitter or sweet-- it just depends on whether his sky is
    cloudy or not.</p></div>"|6911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6911-tomorrow-is-again/|7.3|Scott Plagenhoef

Exposition: Time and a Word</p>
<p>Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance     that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we     love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes     and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens     shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light     shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in     only a few short years).</p>
<p>Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman     staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.  When     you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were     the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early     70s.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes     won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were     fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good     People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose     Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the     first place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino     reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in     public.  Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that     feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"",     but often stumbling.</p>
<p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change</p>
<p>Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's <i>The Yes Album</i> was the record that put them on American     FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the     first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead     at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts     fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe     also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a     slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best     starting point.</p>
<p>1972's <i>Fragile</i> introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling     Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The     battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long     Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most     memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on <i>Fragile</i>,     they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've     blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack     for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars     and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast.  ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly     constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in     the city"" again.</p>
<p>The band's crowning achievement, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one     is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling,     dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture.     Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's     almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title     track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling     epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins     humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all     again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for     Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ     and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>
<p>After an extended hiatus following <i>Relayer</i>, Yes regrouped for 1977's <i>Going for the One</i>, bringing     grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since     <i>Fragile</i>.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to     the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes.  The title track, with Howe's great     steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get     the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their     hippie-mystic trappings.  However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast     the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and     side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments     and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed.  Sure, it went on a bit too     long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing <i>Going for the One</i>, Yes     took the same lineup in for 1978's <i>Tormato</i>.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated.  Primary offenders     on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"",     in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco     protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it.""  And whomever thought it was a good idea to     invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot.  Oh     right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record.  It's too bad, because relatively aggressive,     driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad,     even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p>
<p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same     lackluster manner as on <i>Tormato</i>.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace     a new era.  A Buggles era!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV     experience, joined for 1980's <i>Drama</i>, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly.     The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by     Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson.  Also, songs like ""White Car""     and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare.  However,     ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were     better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with     state-of-the-art production sheen.  Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but     lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p>
<p>On <i>Drama</i>, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's     <i>90125</i> for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for     reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart""     and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've     sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like,     ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed     practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony     Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock     guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect,     <i>90125</i>'s songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p>
<p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory</p>
<p>Yes may have disappeared commercially after <i>90125</i>, but they're still active today in varying lineups,     and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed     follow-up to <i>90125</i>, <i>Big Generator</i>, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0),     and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now     is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in     another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't     surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p></div>"|11869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/|8.1|Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari

Exposition: Time and a Word</p>
<p>Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance     that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we     love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes     and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens     shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light     shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in     only a few short years).</p>
<p>Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman     staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.  When     you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were     the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early     70s.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes     won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were     fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good     People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose     Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the     first place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino     reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in     public.  Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that     feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"",     but often stumbling.</p>
<p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change</p>
<p>Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's <i>The Yes Album</i> was the record that put them on American     FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the     first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead     at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts     fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe     also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a     slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best     starting point.</p>
<p>1972's <i>Fragile</i> introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling     Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The     battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long     Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most     memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on <i>Fragile</i>,     they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've     blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack     for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars     and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast.  ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly     constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in     the city"" again.</p>
<p>The band's crowning achievement, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one     is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling,     dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture.     Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's     almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title     track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling     epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins     humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all     again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for     Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ     and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>

Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>
<p>After an extended hiatus following <i>Relayer</i>, Yes regrouped for 1977's <i>Going for the One</i>, bringing     grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since     <i>Fragile</i>.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to     the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes.  The title track, with Howe's great     steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get     the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their     hippie-mystic trappings.  However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast     the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and     side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments     and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed.  Sure, it went on a bit too     long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing <i>Going for the One</i>, Yes     took the same lineup in for 1978's <i>Tormato</i>.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated.  Primary offenders     on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"",     in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco     protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it.""  And whomever thought it was a good idea to     invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot.  Oh     right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record.  It's too bad, because relatively aggressive,     driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad,     even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p>
<p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same     lackluster manner as on <i>Tormato</i>.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace     a new era.  A Buggles era!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV     experience, joined for 1980's <i>Drama</i>, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly.     The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by     Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson.  Also, songs like ""White Car""     and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare.  However,     ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were     better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with     state-of-the-art production sheen.  Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but     lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p>
<p>On <i>Drama</i>, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's     <i>90125</i> for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for     reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart""     and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've     sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like,     ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed     practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony     Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock     guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect,     <i>90125</i>'s songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p>
<p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory</p>
<p>Yes may have disappeared commercially after <i>90125</i>, but they're still active today in varying lineups,     and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed     follow-up to <i>90125</i>, <i>Big Generator</i>, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0),     and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now     is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in     another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't     surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p></div>"|11869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/|9.0|Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari

Exposition: Time and a Word</p>
<p>Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance     that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we     love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes     and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens     shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light     shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in     only a few short years).</p>
<p>Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman     staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.  When     you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were     the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early     70s.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes     won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were     fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good     People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose     Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the     first place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino     reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in     public.  Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that     feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"",     but often stumbling.</p>
<p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change</p>
<p>Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's <i>The Yes Album</i> was the record that put them on American     FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the     first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead     at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts     fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe     also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a     slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best     starting point.</p>
<p>1972's <i>Fragile</i> introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling     Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The     battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long     Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most     memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on <i>Fragile</i>,     they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've     blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack     for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars     and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast.  ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly     constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in     the city"" again.</p>
<p>The band's crowning achievement, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one     is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling,     dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture.     Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's     almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title     track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling     epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins     humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all     again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for     Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ     and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.

It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>
<p>After an extended hiatus following <i>Relayer</i>, Yes regrouped for 1977's <i>Going for the One</i>, bringing     grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since     <i>Fragile</i>.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to     the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes.  The title track, with Howe's great     steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get     the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their     hippie-mystic trappings.  However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast     the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and     side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments     and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed.  Sure, it went on a bit too     long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing <i>Going for the One</i>, Yes     took the same lineup in for 1978's <i>Tormato</i>.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated.  Primary offenders     on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"",     in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco     protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it.""  And whomever thought it was a good idea to     invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot.  Oh     right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record.  It's too bad, because relatively aggressive,     driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad,     even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p>
<p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same     lackluster manner as on <i>Tormato</i>.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace     a new era.  A Buggles era!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV     experience, joined for 1980's <i>Drama</i>, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly.     The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by     Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson.  Also, songs like ""White Car""     and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare.  However,     ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were     better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with     state-of-the-art production sheen.  Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but     lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p>
<p>On <i>Drama</i>, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's     <i>90125</i> for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for     reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart""     and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've     sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like,     ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed     practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony     Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock     guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect,     <i>90125</i>'s songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p>
<p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory</p>
<p>Yes may have disappeared commercially after <i>90125</i>, but they're still active today in varying lineups,     and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed     follow-up to <i>90125</i>, <i>Big Generator</i>, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0),     and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now     is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in     another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't     surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p></div>"|11869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/|5.3|Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari

Exposition: Time and a Word</p>
<p>Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance     that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we     love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes     and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens     shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light     shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in     only a few short years).</p>
<p>Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman     staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.  When     you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were     the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early     70s.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes     won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were     fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good     People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose     Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the     first place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino     reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in     public.  Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that     feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"",     but often stumbling.</p>
<p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change</p>
<p>Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's <i>The Yes Album</i> was the record that put them on American     FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the     first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead     at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts     fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe     also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a     slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best     starting point.</p>
<p>1972's <i>Fragile</i> introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling     Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The     battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long     Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most     memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on <i>Fragile</i>,     they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've     blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack     for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars     and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast.  ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly     constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in     the city"" again.</p>
<p>The band's crowning achievement, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one     is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling,     dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture.     Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's     almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title     track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling     epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins     humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all     again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for     Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ     and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale.

The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>
<p>After an extended hiatus following <i>Relayer</i>, Yes regrouped for 1977's <i>Going for the One</i>, bringing     grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since     <i>Fragile</i>.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to     the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes.  The title track, with Howe's great     steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get     the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their     hippie-mystic trappings.  However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast     the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and     side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments     and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed.  Sure, it went on a bit too     long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing <i>Going for the One</i>, Yes     took the same lineup in for 1978's <i>Tormato</i>.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated.  Primary offenders     on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"",     in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco     protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it.""  And whomever thought it was a good idea to     invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot.  Oh     right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record.  It's too bad, because relatively aggressive,     driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad,     even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p>
<p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same     lackluster manner as on <i>Tormato</i>.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace     a new era.  A Buggles era!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV     experience, joined for 1980's <i>Drama</i>, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly.     The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by     Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson.  Also, songs like ""White Car""     and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare.  However,     ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were     better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with     state-of-the-art production sheen.  Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but     lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p>
<p>On <i>Drama</i>, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's     <i>90125</i> for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for     reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart""     and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've     sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like,     ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed     practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony     Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock     guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect,     <i>90125</i>'s songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p>
<p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory</p>
<p>Yes may have disappeared commercially after <i>90125</i>, but they're still active today in varying lineups,     and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed     follow-up to <i>90125</i>, <i>Big Generator</i>, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0),     and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now     is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in     another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't     surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p></div>"|11869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/|3.8|Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari

Exposition: Time and a Word</p>
<p>Odds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance     that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we     love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes     and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70s through punk's distorting lens, and that lens     shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light     shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in     only a few short years).</p>
<p>Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman     staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.  When     you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were     the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early     70s.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes     won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were     fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to ""Roundabout"" or ""I've Seen All Good     People"" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose     Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: ""Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!""), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the     first place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino     reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in     public.  Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that     feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like ""Astral Traveler"",     but often stumbling.</p>
<p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change</p>
<p>Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's <i>The Yes Album</i> was the record that put them on American     FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the     first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead     at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts     fit nicely into that mix. The two-part ""I've Seen All Good People"" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of ""Starship Trooper"" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe     also shows off his acoustic chops on ""The Clap"", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a     slightly crisper studio version). This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best     starting point.</p>
<p>1972's <i>Fragile</i> introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling     Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was ""fragile?"" Their egos? The     battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples ""Roundabout"" and ""Long     Distance Runaround""-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most     memorably Steve Howe's ""Mood for a Day"")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on <i>Fragile</i>,     they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of ""South Side of the Sky"" might've     blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70s, and even though the band had a knack     for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars     and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast.  ""Heart of the Sunrise"" still holds up as a deftly     constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as ""I feel lost in     the city"" again.</p>
<p>The band's crowning achievement, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, contains only three lengthy ""songs,"" but each one     is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling,     dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture.     Squire's bass in the majestic ""Total Mass Retain"" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's     almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title     track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling     epics lack. ""And You and I"" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins     humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all     again, building to a huge closing climax called ""Apocalypse"", essentially laying out the blueprint for     Sigur Rós. That leaves ""Siberian Khatru"" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ     and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>

This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p>
<p>It couldn't last.  On 1974's <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i>, they simply took things too far.     Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese ""shastrick"" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash,     and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating     musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it)     squanders its few inspired moments. ""The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)"" is the most promising, opening     with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe,     but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had,     and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of ""The     Remembering (High the Memory)"", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.     It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying ""no"" to Yes for the first time in their career.     Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion.</p>
<p>Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork.     However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made <i>Relayer</i> a fan-favorite, the record is all but     unlistenable to the rest of the world.  Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of     any Yes record.  Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more     tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; ""Gates of Delirium"" is a kind of     nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by     ""Soundchaser"", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous ""cha     cha cha"" section. And ""To Be Over"" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone     once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual     listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes     hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p>
<p>After an extended hiatus following <i>Relayer</i>, Yes regrouped for 1977's <i>Going for the One</i>, bringing     grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since     <i>Fragile</i>.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to     the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes.  The title track, with Howe's great     steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, ""Get     the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,"" exposed their     hippie-mystic trappings.  However, Squire's ""Parallels"" and the Beatlesque ""Wonderous Stories"" forecast     the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and     side-length symphonettes, ""Awaken"", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments     and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed.  Sure, it went on a bit too     long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with ""progress"" in the 70s.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing <i>Going for the One</i>, Yes     took the same lineup in for 1978's <i>Tormato</i>.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated.  Primary offenders     on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid ""Don't Kill the Whale"",     in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco     protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to ""dig it.""  And whomever thought it was a good idea to     invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on ""Circus of Heaven"" should probably have been fired on the spot.  Oh     right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record.  It's too bad, because relatively aggressive,     driving numbers like ""Future Times"" and the fusion-tinged ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" weren't bad,     even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p>
<p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same     lackluster manner as on <i>Tormato</i>.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace     a new era.  A Buggles era!  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV     experience, joined for 1980's <i>Drama</i>, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly.     The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by     Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson.  Also, songs like ""White Car""     and ""Into the Lens"" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare.  However,     ""Machine Messiah"", ""Does It Really Happen?"" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of ""Tempus Fugit"" were     better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with     state-of-the-art production sheen.  Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but     lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p>
<p>On <i>Drama</i>, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's     <i>90125</i> for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for     reinventing Yes as a hit 80s pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on ""Owner of a Lonely Heart""     and the glowing a capella on ""Leave It"" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've     sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like ""It Can Happen"" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like,     ""This world I like/ We architects of life,"" or, ""Your heart is inside your head."" This line-up formed     practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony     Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80s hard rock     guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect,     <i>90125</i>'s songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p>
<p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory</p>
<p>Yes may have disappeared commercially after <i>90125</i>, but they're still active today in varying lineups,     and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed     follow-up to <i>90125</i>, <i>Big Generator</i>, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0),     and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now     is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in     another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't     surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p></div>"|11869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11869-the-yes-album-fragile-close-to-the-edge-tales-from-topographic-oceans-relayer-going-for-the-one-tormato-drama-90125/|7.8|Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari

    The claustrophobic blandness of my existence in suburban Buffalo blinded me from the legions of disaffected
    youth across the country fighting the same battles.  And not only was I cliché, in 1993 I was about ten
    years late.  I was the blueprint for privileged, melodramatic suburban youth.  Music was my oxygen.  I would
    suck comfort out of my bright yellow Sony Sports Walkman, which was host to a parade of Maxell-brand mix
    tapes that were replaced biweekly, but always held the same songs.  Sometimes they started with The Smiths,
    and usually they ended with The Cure.  My Favorite captures these memories, and serves them up with the
    synth-infused respect they deserve.  I love this music because I love everything that came before it.</p><p>
<i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i> is an unashamed love letter to 80s British new wave.  Johnny Marr's
    jangle snuggles up to New Order's electronics.  Singer/songwriter Michael Grace, Jr. wants to be an American
    Morrissey, telling tales of heartbreak from between the cinderblock walls of his dorm room.  In ""Badge"",
    he croons, ""I examine the pictures on my wall/  I am the pictures on my wall/ Then nothing.""  His songs
    tackle the mind-numbing stupidity of suburbia (the boy/girl pop-rocker ""The Suburbs Are Killing Us""),
    college crushes (""L=P""), and confessions of love though depreciated audio formats (""The Black Cassette"").
    In splitting vocal duties with Andrea Vaughn, the melodrama becomes all the more convincing-- at times, it
    borders on poignant: ""Loneliness is pornography to them, but to us it is an art.""</p><p>
<i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i> compiles three out-of-print EPs released by My Favorite since 2000,
    as well as four new tracks.  But it also includes an additional disc featuring fourteen ""controversial""
    remixes by Soviet, Flowchart, Phofo, Alexander Peris, Future Bible Heroes, Double Agent, and a host of
    others.  Somehow, My Favorite escaped the all-consuming maw of the recently defunct electro movement, but
    the majority of these remixes serve as a ""what if,"" reworking the band's songs into irreverent dance hymns
    to Casey Spooner.</p><p>
    A handful of others attempt to bring something new to the original material.  Phofo's interpretation of
    ""Le Monster"" is a bizarrely enjoyable mash-up of styles, from mambo and bossa nova to 60s French pop, while
    three artists rework ""Homeless Club Kids"".  Alexander Perls turns it into the dance anthem its title begs
    for.  Double Agent's take on is a booming miasma of drums and echoing vocals, complete with a nuclear blast
    in the middle.  However, though the electro-pop doodles of Stephin Merritt are usually a joy, the 8:22
    runtime of the Future Bible Heroes remix is nearly impenetrable, even as far as club-friendly remixes go.</p><p>
    All told, My Favorite set out to appeal to a distinct class of music fans: If you don't know every lyric
    to <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, or never patched a broken heart with <i>Disintegration</i>, you'll likely be
    mystified by the band's dreamy teenage anthems.  Those of us who fall into this category, however, will
    find it an blissful journey back into days that were anything but.</p></div>"|5528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5528-the-happiest-days-of-our-lives/|8.0|P.J. Gallagher

    in American Life</i>.  In it, Keith explores the socio-cultural motivation behind middle-of-the-night radio
    broadcasts, prodding at the occasionally curious demographics of all-night radio listeners-- think people
    in sweaters driving cars and drinking black coffee from plastic thermoses, security guards flipping through
    decks of cards, janitors pushing buckets, or insomniacs eating crackers and gnawing their fingernails.  As
    a companion, all-night radio is warm and crackly, vaguely surreal, and encoded in the way that late-night
    activities always are.  Everyone thinks just a little bit differently at night: familiar objects become
    encrypted by darkness, taking shapes that aren't their own; dimensions are expanded, images are distorted,
    and everything inadvertently and suddenly becomes really, really weird.</p><p>
    
    Thus, the meandering, blowsy psych-rock of All Night Radio.  Fronted by ex-Beachwood Sparks members Dave
    Scher and Jimi Hey, All Night Radio have successfully captured the shape-shifting, peculiar magic of
    midnight crackles and shitty speakers, freaky callers and awkward on-air personalities.  The band's
    full-length debut, <i>Spirit Stereo Frequency</i>, is, happily, just as fuzzy and unpredictable as its
    namesake suggests, with high, hissing vocals, archaic-gone-futuristic blips, pedal steel, keyboards,
    glockenspiel, and a barrage of other noisemakers helping to build a thick, spacy stretch of soft 60s
    psychedelia.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Daylight Till Dawn"" mixes Scher and Hey's gentle, lapping vocals with whiny guitar, their rousing
    chorus of ""I wanna wake up in the morning!"" tempered by a bum-bum-bum vocal breakdown and plenty of echo.
    Most of <i>Spirit Stereo Frequency</i> comes in short waves: ""We're on Our Wave"" is framed by samples of
    crashing tides and filled with sweet, Byrds-ish whispers, each vocal dose perfectly rising, cresting and
    falling, while ""Sky Bicycle (You've Been Ringing)"" is a galactic, meandering high, with tinkling melodies
    blowing up and then subsiding in a tiny cloud of pink and yellow smoke.</p><p>
    
    Much like a sleepless night, <i>Spirit Stereo Frequency</i> lags a bit in the middle, mimicking the
    inevitable dip and sag of insomnia: the initial rush of adrenaline wanes, resources are gradually exhausted,
    and, somehow, there are still plenty of empty hours to fill before daybreak.  When the moon finally sinks,
    the sun-spotted reward turns out to be well-worth your patience: closing self-anthem ""All Night Radio"" is
    a buoyant singalong, the perfect soundtrack to careening down the interstate at 4:00am or launching
    streaming blue rockets into space.</p><p>
    
    Awesomely, Scher and Hey claim to have composed these songs based on non-stop bandwidth signals from the
    sun, and caution that signal content can vary based on ""atmospheric conditions.""  It's entirely possible
    that they're right-- depending on exactly what brand of moonlight you end up dancing under, <i>Spirit
    Stereo Frequency</i> can be an empathetic buddy, an omnipresent guide, or just the perfect accompaniment
    to the most illogical of all human situations.</p></div>"|424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/424-spirit-stereo-frequency/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

More often than not,     these collections are forced by market necessities, imply the end of an era, and lead to inevitable bifurcation     between fan favorites and the label's idea of a hit.  Imagine, then, the enormity of such undertaking for a     songwriter whose shtick involves both unflagging self-admiration and utter contempt for labels, marketing,     colleagues and fans.</p>
<p>I'm talking, of course, about the UK's Luke Haines, the leader of the defunct Auteurs and, with John Moore,     the creator of the minimalist-pop project Black Box Recorder.  Evidently facing a contract obligation to     ransack his old band's four albums for a hits package, Haines found a conceptually flawless way out: He     rented out a symphony orchestra and proceeded to re-record eight of Auteurs' songs in nauseatingly grand,     mellow-gold arrangements that most definitely do not have to be heard to be believed.</p>
<p><i>Das Capital: The Songwriting Genius of Luke Haines and the Auteurs</i> is a primo Situationist stunt.     From the title on down, it concerns itself purely with the sound of money.  Fat with winds, strings,     chimes, echo chambers the size of Wembley stadium and, per liner notes, ""the greatest sax solo in the     history of popular culture,"" the album is meticulously designed to mimic fundraiser quickies like <i>The     Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Plays the Music of Oasis</i>.  There's even an overture, ingeniously hidden     before the first track (you have to hit pause and rewind well into negative numbers to play it).  The     result, needless to say, is patently and intentionally ludicrous; it could be one of the greatest jokes     ever played on a label by an artist.</p>
<p>I can't help but applaud <i>Das Capital</i>'s meta-architecture, which incorporates everything from the     cover art to the attendant interviews filled with bragging about the project's cost (press manipulation     has always been an integral part of Haines's work-- his solo debut came out the same week he called for a     ""pop strike"" from the op-ed page of <i>The Guardian</i>).  One small quibble, however, remains: The album     is unlistenable.</p>
<p>From the first notes of ""How Could I Be Wrong?"", a formerly jangly number slowed down to a stately stupor,     it becomes painfully clear that Haines' songwriting does not lend itself well to bombast.  His Auteurs     albums, especially the sophomore <i>Now I'm a Cowboy</i>, did make pleasant use of strings, but the     arrangements were never allowed to overtake the laconic lead melodies.  The gag wears off awfully soon;     what's worse, Haines-- a C+ vocalist at best-- is unable to complete it by belting his lines like Tom     Jones or dropping down into the Barry White register (the only two appropriate options, given the     arrangements).  He sings in his usual reedy voice, sounding all but lost in the swirl.  Of the eight     supposed chestnuts, only ""Baader Meinhof"" holds up, but the original-- off the 70s-terrorist-nostalgia     concept album-- was awash in Moroccan strings to begin with.  The obligatory three new songs barely     register; ""Satan Wants Me"" (""...for my mind/ To marry his daughter/ Have a child"") provides an exception     by running its humor into the ground more violently than his others.</p>
<p>As any piece of conceptual art Haines claims to despise so, <i>Das Capital</i> is primarily valuable as a     conversation catalyst.  As a piece of self-assessment, it's useless: Haines' liner notes bring to mind     Nabokov's Strong Opinions, wherein Vladimir Vladimirovich spares a couple of kind words for Joyce,     but only for Ulysses.  Haines operates in a similar mode here.  He assigns his albums short captions     (""my second masterpiece"") and stars (most get five out of five), obliterates any suggestion of collaboration     within the Auteurs, and blurbs a remix album by \xB5-Ziq thus: ""Remixes by some kid from Wimbledon for L500.     A lot of money for a teenager.  Never listened to it myself.  Went on to sell well in America.  100% of     the publishing goes to me.""</p>
<p>Paired with the deliberately subpar stuff on the album, the braggadocio becomes suffocating: What we appear     to have on our hands is a spoof of the very notion of quality.  I would never recommend a living soul to     purchase <i>Das Capital</i>.  And yet, full marks are due to Haines for making good on the hissed mission     statement from his <i>Oliver Twist Manifesto</i>: ""You better believe me when I say/ I never wanted to be     liked.""</p></div>"|370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/370-das-capital-the-songwriting-genius-of-luke-haines-the-auteurs/|5.1|Michael Idov

    select men of power, David Tibet's work is loaded with spiritualist references.  Revering innocence and
    darkness, Tibet has also worked his childhood and present relationships into the complex cosmos.  According
    to David Keenan in his excellent book, <i>England's Hidden Reverse: A Secret History of England's Esoteric
    Underground</i>, Tibet was inspired to take a personal approach to his lyricism after listening to Shirley
    Collins and reading Pascal and Kierkegaard.  As he says, ""I didn't want to be involved in anything that
    wasn't specifically dealing with one's own soul.""</p><p>
    His world is peopled with outsider artists like Louis Wain, the fantastical writings of Thomas Ligotti and
    Count Stenbock, apocalyptic literature (especially <i>Maldoror</i> and William Blake), sleepytime language
    via Joyce's <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, and musical anomalies like Arthur Doyle and Abner Jay.  Despite the
    cryptic ingredients, Tibet's path is lined with children's toys and <i>The Wicker Man</i>, Blue Öyster Cult
    and Love, Sand and Six Organs of Admittance.  Perhaps the most important (or at least visible) aspect of
    his poetics is world religion: Tibetan Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Paganism.  So, yeah, some
    approach Current 93's output like a graduate seminar.  Most, however, attack the allusions intuitively,
    smoke some cloves and fade into its atmosphere.</p><p>
    Such a rich backdrop could result in stilted stodginess, but Tibet funnels the information through punk
    roots and a great ear for off-kilter (or off-key) melody.  Before founding Current 93 in 1982,  he was
    a member of two jaggedly danceable, wonderfully chaotic industrial groups, 23 Skidoo and Psychic TV, and
    he incorporates these beginnings into his singular mix of atonal vocalizations, nursery rhymes, spoken
    word/scream, Incredible String Band pastorals, religious chants, ambient interludes and spot-on traditionals.
    A constant experimenter, too, he never left behind his more raucous early years completely, apt to unleash
    extended noise freakouts, blending the shepherd's song with the Downtown.</p><p>
    One of the strongest examples of this teeter between abstract noise and intimate soul-bearing is the epic
    <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>, a dense musical allegory released in 1992.  Its title comes from the Gnostic
    poem, <i>The Thunder: Perfect Mind</i>.  (Parts of its text are spoken and snarled by Tibet on the track
    ""Thunder Perfect Mind I"".)  Interestingly, after Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton, a collaborator on
    almost all of C93's releases, had a dream that his next release would also be <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>,
    he recorded an album of the same name and released it alongside Tibet's.  His is droning electronic pulses,
    tones, twitters-- an ever-escalating loop of frozen machine-age ominousness.</p><p>
    According to David Keenan, <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i> was originally conceived as a concept album, an
    ""apocalyptic <i>Tommy</i>,"" in Tibet's words, but he condensed its concepts into the album's opener, ""The
    Descent of Long Satan and Babylon"".  (You can unpack that one yourself.)  Now, though, the record stands
    as a haunting collection of ballads and laments.  Here, the longest and perhaps most complex piece is the
    16-plus minute ""Hitler as Kalki (SDM)"", dedicated to ""my father who fought Hitler.""  Joined by The Bevis
    Frond's Nick Saloman on psych guitar, Tibet, as Keenan put it, ""explores the terrifying idea, first put
    forward by the Hindu social Darwinist, Holocaust denier and Hitler worshipper Savitri Devi Mukherji
    ('SDM,' as Tibet refers to her in the title), that Hitler was in fact the final avatar of the Hindu God
    Vishnu, and the initiator of apocalypse.""  On it, noodles turn to frantic strumming and acid-jazz wah,
    culminating in a tripped-out, near-metal feedback solo and after total vocal histrionics, Tibet's ominous
    whispers.</p><p>
    Less sinister, ""A Sadness Song"" is melancholy 4AD ethereality.  On it, Tibet's imagery and Rose McDowall's
    background vocals fill the gaps of an existential reminiscence.  (The track shows up again as ""A Sad Sadness
    Song"", with McDowall alone intoning the tale).  Another gorgeous work (and a mind-fuck for its recipient),
    ""A Song for Douglas After He's Dead"" was written for Douglas Pierce of Death in June: harp, harmonic guitar,
    bells, violin, and McDowall spin and sigh behind maniacal incantations.  Besides the album, this reissue
    comes with all the studio outtakes and live, stripped-down variations on songs from the album-- highlighted
    by two takes of ""A Song for Douglas After He's Dead"", one hopefully called a ""rebirth.""  Another, ""They
    Return to Their Earth (For My Christ Thorn)"" is a 50s prom performed by a Celtic troupe, Tibet presiding
    over a room of nervous, angelic teens.</p><p>
<i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i> has long been regarded as an excellent place for uninitiated Current 93
    listeners to dive in to David Tibet's 40+ album discography, and though it's certainly not for everyone,
    it stands as one of the most important works of the last decade.  Those who've listened before and couldn't
    get it the first time, try again.  This is the ideal music for contacting, then communing with the most
    elusive of ghosts.</p></div>"|1750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1750-thunder-perfect-mind/|9.3|Brandon Stosuy

    turns out, realizing that the reason your train hasn't moved for three hours is because someone is
    dead throws your annoyance into perspective.</p><p>
    
    It was in this setting that I became familiar with Scott McCaughey's latest Minus 5 offering, a limited
    release called <i>I Don't Know Who I Am</i>.  Astute fans have probably already noted the parenthetical
    title, <i>Let the War Against Music Begin, Vol. 2</i>, which, for the initiated, tells most of the album's
    backstory.  These 13 songs are the leftovers from the original sessions for McCaughey's 2001 split LP
    between his now-defunct power-pop band the Young Fresh Fellows and his ongoing all-star collective The
    Minus 5 (The Minus 5 half was titled <i>Let the War Against Music Begin</i>)-- not that you'd ever guess
    they were castoffs to listen to them.  <i>I Don't Know Who I Am</i> is easily as strong as the material
    that made it onto the original album, and in a lot of cases, it's more effective.</p><p>
    
    McCaughey's Minus 5 albums have always showcased his darker, more experimental side, but this record moves
    more sharply in that direction than any of the others, including last January's <i>Down with Wilco</i>,
    focusing almost exclusively on downtempo dirges and supplanting the typical jangle with roomfuls of
    electronic keyboards.  Even so, it's a little surreal listening to a song as bitingly humorous as ""Rooting
    for the Plague"" in one ear while craning to hear a conductor quietly discuss cleaning up the rapidly
    freezing remains of some unfortunate person.</p><p>
    
    That humor is what makes even McCaughey's darkest work easy to sit through; he always seems a step ahead
    of any critic who might accuse him of miserablism, and his head is stuffed with bitterly funny stuff like
    the fantastic childhood memoir ""I Don't Want to Fuck Off Anymore"", a song that rides a bizarre banjo part
    that's played almost as if it were a sitar.  Over this weird, two-step backing, he offers lines like, ""You
    tried new ways to say it when I was twelve/ like 'leave me alone,' 'go play in traffic,' 'get lost,' and
    'go to hell,'"" making for one of the most left-field songs he's ever recorded.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include the synthstrings-coated ballad ""Queen's Head"", whose great melody is delivered
    sans-embellishment by McCaughey's thick, almost Tom Petty-ish tenor.  ""Tunnel of Lungs"" is slow-motion
    power-pop with a penchant for anatomy metaphors and some nice swelling vocal harmonies on the chorus,
    while the feedback-tinged dirge of opener ""There Is No Music"" recalls the broken-down pop of Big Star's
    <i>Third</i>.</p><p>
    
    It's entirely possible that my impression of <i>I Don't Know Who I Am</i> is irreparably colored by the
    strange circumstances under which I came to love it, but I believe it's an arresting album that deserves
    better than a limited runoff of a couple thousand discs.  McCaughey is one of those perennial also-rans
    that litter the pop landscape, a great songwriter in his own right, but seemingly destined to forever be
    overshadowed by the other work of his own collaborators (see: Wilco, Peter Buck, The Posies, High Llamas).
    And who knows?  Maybe that's the way he likes it.  With a little more pressure and scrutiny, he may not
    have had the guts to make such a subversively smart record.</p></div>"|5319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5319-i-dont-know-who-i-am-let-the-war-against-music-begin-vol-2/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Now, releasing two brand new records (<i>Come Feel Me Tremble</i>, the     soundtrack to his 2002 tour documentary, and <i>Dead Man Shake</i>, under shifty alias Grandpaboy),     Westerberg is taking one last stab at escaping his disproportionately lame destiny.  Grandly somersaulting     between styles and bouncing from name to fakename, Westerberg seems tried of being Westerberg.  And it's     awfully easy to understand why.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's not entirely Paul Westerberg's fault that most of his solo records sound formulaic to the     point of tedium-- in the early 90s, the newly defunct Replacements were shamelessly co-opted by countless     alt-rockers, with each bland, mediocre re-interpretation further deadening everybody's ears to the majestic     howls of its sloppy originator.  The Replacements were deservedly beloved, and for Westerberg, listening to     alternative radio must have occasionally felt like squinting into a funhouse mirror-- familiar and grotesque     at the same time.  Each watered-down bar band shout and canned guitar riff became a distorted version of     his own perfect, recorded truth (see also Westerberg's timely determination that longtime follower Ryan     Adams ""needs to have his teeth kicked in"").  Given all this, Grandpaboy, Westerberg's freewheeling, bluesman     pseudonym, might just be Westerberg's (gentler) way of reminding future generations that there are plenty     of other bands to rip off besides The Replacements.</p>
<p>That Westerberg convinced Epitaph subsidiary/Mississippi blues-pushers Fat Possum to release <i>Dead Man     Shake</i> is telling: Copping freely from the sludgy Chuck-Berry-by-way-of-the-Stones canon, the album sees     Westerberg abandoning his own well-imitated chops for the super-derivative, ever-repeating blues-rock     paradigm.  Snatching everything from coarse, booze-addled howls to an entirely nonsensical, not-quite-supported     moniker (even The White Stripes are more convincing public fibbers), Grandpaboy's second long-player is another     contemporary reinterpretation of gritty Delta babbling.</p>
<p>But no matter how hard Westerberg tries to bury it, Grandpaboy still screams his name.  Ramshackle, jumpy     and curiously charming, <i>Dead Man Shake</i> is full of Westerberg's trademark spastic vocals and nimble     guitar work, only now determinably fuzzed up and shrouded in Sun Records spunk.  With nine new songs and a     handful of covers (including songs by Hank Williams Sr. and John Prine), the record stumbles between styles,     but still offers more variety, kick and shameless soloing than Westerberg-as-Westerberg.  ""No Matter What     You Say"" is the record's most convincing departure: Westerberg yelps and purrs, his lazy, lustful vocals     dripping with unnamed longing while first-take guitar noodles run circles around some perfectly unsophisticated     percussion (Westerberg plays all the instruments here, including the ones he does not actually know how to     play).</p>
<p>Opener ""MPLS"" is slightly less raw, with hokey, rockabilly guitar and purely autobiographical lyrics (""On     the Mississippi River/ Born in '59."").  The song, whose title abbreviates the full name of his hometown,     Minneapolis, has a mind-numbing chorus (shocker: ""M-P-L-S"") and some goofy melodic turns, but Westerberg's     guitar playing has never been so fiery, and even the nervous cymbal crashes are somehow spot-on.  Westerberg's     closing cover of crooner-fave ""What Kind of Fool Am I?"" (see comparable interpretations by, yes, Robert     Goulet, Sammy Davis Jr. or Perry Como) is noteworthy just for the sheer scratch of the vocals-- eschewing     the kind of syrup-voiced goo that the song so stubbornly demands, Westerberg karaoke-caterwauls, his voice     off-key, cigarette-tinged and awesomely brash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Westerberg himself admits that <i>Come Feel Me Tremble</i> might as well be considered Side 3 of     last year's <i>Stereo</i>-- picking up where that album left off, <i>Come Feel Me Tremble</i> is a scrappy,     lo-fi collection of acoustic folk songs and storming rock ballads, some of which are excellent (""Wild and     Lethal"", ""Meet Me Down the Alley"") and some that are disappointingly mediocre.  ""Never Felt Like This Before""     mixes wobbly piano with Westerberg's salty vocals, and the effect is perfectly subdued; ""Knockin' Em Back""     is a perky drinking anthem, aggressive at all the right moments, shifting back and forth between giggly     acoustics and head-hitting guitar slams. Nearly every track included here (all of which were recorded in     Westerberg's basement) takes one of these two approaches, and while the juxtaposition keeps listeners awake,     the transitions aren't always entirely logical-- in the end, <i>Come Feel Me Tremble</i> suffers for its     lack of cohesion.</p>
<p>Thus, the conundrum of the stalled artist: In a bold attempt to trot away from his past, Westerberg seems     to have misplaced his future.  <i>Dead Man Shake</i> is playful, but the record never really becomes     compelling enough to rise above its ""alter-ego"" stigma; <i>Come Feel Me Tremble</i> is also nice enough,     but ultimately lacks the hyper, Westerberg-ian spark that can, when present, make his work so insanely     inviting.   If nothing else, Westerberg's quirky solo career may finally convince some of his devotees to     stop stealing his stuff and to go sniff out their own (inconsistent) sounds.</p></div>"|11864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11864-come-feel-me-tremble-dead-man-shake/|6.7|Amanda Petrusich

The Walkmen tiptoed where other bands stomp, and if they broke a few eggshells, they did so only when least expected, and in a strangely elegant manner.  Their hollow, reverberating guitars and ""cinematic"" atmosphere earned a few apt comparisons to <em>War</em>- or <em>Joshua Tree</em>-era U2-- keyboards aren't made that placid, or guitars that jangly, by accident, folks-- but this comparison still strikes me as ridiculous.  I might be more willing to accept the parallels had U2 played Christmas music in Vaudeville; I know the song's called ""The Blizzard of '96"", but the last time I heard so many bells was on a sleigh ride to grandma's house.</p><p>  The first album was a process of trial and error, with the desire to make music taking precedence over a clear goal, and even then they were impressive.  Now, exactly one infamous car commercial later, The Walkmen find themselves signed to the Jason Dill-affiliated Record Collection label, which means a distribution deal through Warner Bros, and for the first time, a kung-fu grip on their sophisticated, fragile-yet-aggressive aesthetic.  Despite the consistency of <em>Everyone</em>, it tended to drift aimlessly through pastoral passages, which were sometimes charming but just as often faceless next to highly structured compositions like the incomparable ""We've Been Had"", or ""Wake Up""; on <em>Bows and Arrows</em>, every moment feels deliberate and meaningful.</p><p>  But ""what's in it for me?"" laments Hamilton Leithauser, commiserating with a doleful church organ and trembling, sorry plinks of their now-famously ancient piano, as he opens the album.  Well, quite a lot, actually; with so much poised and in place, this is as close to a career-defining moment as any band is likely to have, but if the guys are nervous, they aren't letting on.  The easy ebb and flow of ""What's in It for Me?"" is disarmingly comfortable.  ""I came here for a good time/ Now you're tellin' me to leave/ Well, I heard you the first time,"" he sings, casually prodding that sense of resigned disappointment everyone's felt at one time or another, and simultaneously reassuring that it'll eventually pass.  Maybe the improbable and correspondingly short-lived signing of Jonathan Fire*Eater (elder project of three-out-of-five Walkmen) served as preparation for this moment on the cusp, but their confidence is overwhelming.  Their extreme lack of urgency is enthralling, and paradoxically, more of a wake-up call to listeners than any sort of chest-thumping, browbeating assault.</p><p>  The Walkmen refuse to be rushed; they have the acumen to overwhelm, but only when they're good and ready. Although the delicate sheen of more relaxed numbers like the beautifully faded bar-room regret of ""138th Street"", the supersilent ""Hang On, Siobhan"", or even the comparatively cheerful piano-tinkling of ""New Year's Eve"" is impressive, with a focus that would shame most of the interim tracks from <em>Everyone</em>, the few rock standouts are seemingly miles out of their league.  The entire record buckles from the force of ""The Rat""; guitars pound tirelessly forward, and Matt Barrick's brilliant, relentless drumming becomes truly demoniacal.  Tortured, sleepless, Leithauser screams for retribution, or even simple recognition: ""Can't you hear me when I'm calling out your name?""</p><p>  ""The Rat"" could be The Walkmen's finest moment, if they didn't immediately surpass it with ""Little House of Savages"", which most clearly demonstrates how immeasurably these guys have tightened as a band.  Paul Maroon leads with a cyclical riff as the band unloads their full inventory of aggressive histrionics into the resulting hypnotically tangled mess, like a rock 'n' roll fire sale.  I'll even concede that Leithauser's voice now actually merits, albeit rarely, an occasional allusion to Bono (if crossed with a gravel pit); when The Walkmen are in full-on assault mode, the vocal comparison doesn't seem quite so silly.</p><p>  With just these two songs, the vast refinement demonstrated on all the comparatively subdued tracks comes dangerously close to being nullified-- it's all too easy to overlook the wealth of great material in the massive shadow of just these two songs (the wistful ""Thinking of a Dream"" is energetic, but also pales in comparison), but listen closer: On such a triumphant album, The Walkmen don't succumb to filler.  Each of these songs displays a mastery of craft rarely heard, and while not all strike with the same immediacy of its two unbreakable watersheds, each quickly reveals itself as equally forcible and infectious.  Beyond this, no grandiose claims warrant stating; <em>Bows and Arrows</em> states them itself.</p><p> </p></div>"|8572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8572-bows-and-arrows/|9.2|Eric Carr

He sent us stuff, then we did     stuff, then he added the final touches.  He did a little bit more editing and production and mixed and     mastered it in Berlin.""<br/> --Triosk drummer Laurence Pike to Jasmine Critteneden, December 2003, </i>Jazzgroove</p>
<p>Call it The Postal Service II.  Triosk is an otherwise unknown Australian jazz trio that liken their     compositional approach to the loops and ""clever layering of sound"" of electronic music.  Pike's ""he"" is     Berliner Jan Jelinek, of course, easily one of the most consistent and multi-capable electronic artists     around today, and whose <i>Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records</i> Pike once heard on late-night radio and now     credits as one of the trio's primary influences.  In fact, in the past, Jelinek samples constituted Triosk's     primary sound source: live and on record, the trio play controlled improvised sets atop a collection of     loops that emanate from a nearby mini-disc; as the loops change, the trio reacts accordingly.</p>
<p>And indeed, <i>1+3+1</i> sounds like a jazz trio not playing alongside Jelinek's material, but atop it.     At most times, Triosk overpowers Jelinek's original loops to the point of near-obliteration.  Which is     somewhat ironic, I guess: On projects such as <i>Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records</i>, Jelinek nominally works     with the vinyl physicalities and actual sounds of jazz records, though no one would ever know that jazz     was the source material for his clicks and hazy dub atmospherics.</p>
<p>While it's important to an extent to meet the record on its own terms (i.e. Triosk is not simply attempting     organic covers of Jelinek tracks, but are using the loops essentially as jumping-off points for their own     compositions), Jelinek devotees, of which I am one, may be somewhat disappointed by the great absence of     audible Jelinek presence.  His minimalism is a compositional one, certainly, and Triosk masters this aspect     of Jelinek.  That said, Jelinek is not a loop composer in the vein of Philip Jeck or Ekkehard Ehlers; the     sounds Jelinek uses are themselves minimal, and the extent to which he can maintain a curious degree of     the listener's interest despite this sonic temperament bears witness to his high-horsery.  <i>1+3+1</i> is not minimalist jazz; it is loop-based jazz, influenced and produced by a minimalist composer, and then     given to a jazz trio with post-rock tendencies.</p>
<p>Of course, with post-rock tendencies comes the very real possibility of tedium via unmodified repetitions,     and Triosk falls into this rut often.  The agility of Jelinek's builds and collapses becomes apparent in     contrast, as Triosk gets caught in a loop and always seems to stay in it a minute or so too long before     making their next alteration.  Opening track ""Mis-Leader"", while benefiting slightly from the post-Triosk     Jelinek production miasma, suffers from this languor, and to a lesser extent ""On the Lake"" does as well.     The deliberate and hazy ""Munmorah"", which superficially sounds the most similar to Jelinek's ambient output,     lacks the degree of Jelinek's subtle modifications.</p>
<p>That said, there are three tracks on <i>1+3+1</i> where Triosk and Jelinek meet equally, and we finally     understand the vast potential for their alliance.  ""Track 2"" is essentially relentless free jazz run through     whatever there is of a Jelinek glitch machine.  Jelinek slices up Triosk's passionate outbursts, repackages     and resequences them across the pan and in and out of a beautifully dusty mix, and in short, there is never     a dull moment, a testament equally to Triosk's chops and to Jelinek's fanciful post-production.  ""Theme from     Trioskinek"" bears effectively less Jelinek influence, but seems to represent what the trio intended to come     of the other tracks, quickly and seamlessly moving from one loop to the next, never staying on one for too     long.  ""Vibes-Pulse"" is all build, finding its beginnings in an audible Jelinek sequence, and then focusing     on a fantastically reverbed vibraphone loop until Jelinek's stormy cloud reaches supersaturation and dissipates.     It's a shame Jelinek didn't have more to do with this record; <i>1+3+1</i>'s best moments-- when Triosk's     wider dynamic and range of possible sound meets Jelinek's agility and degree of subtlety-- are the ones that     most clearly betray his influence.</p></div>"|8251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8251-131/|7.3|Nick Sylvester

    different directions in which they've moved in such a short amount of time.  The original templates set by
    Thomas Brinkmann, Luomo, Isolée, and Matthew Herbert, among others, broke house music down to its most
    skeletal and microscopic elements.  That deconstruction of house's sometimes rigid rules freed producers
    from the demands of the dancefloor and created a lot of space in which they could weave or add any number
    of seemingly disparate styles and accents.  Now after years of healthy explorations of the house side of
    tech-house, an increasing number of artists-- including Finland's Sami Koivikko-- are marrying those
    detail-oriented impulses with more driving, traditional techno.</p><p>
    Koivikko's initial flirtations with microhouse resulted in the <i>Kut Pulatin</i> series, three subtle,
    spacious singles of increasingly intelligent minimal dub-techno.  Koivikko's profile was raised when some
    of his tracks were lifted for Kompakt mixes: ""Brythe"" is on Triple R's too-often overlooked <i>Friends</i>
    and ""Grunis"" is on Tobias Thomas' exquisite <i>Smallville</i>.</p><p>
    Koivikko has quickly followed with his debut, <i>Salmiakko</i>, which strays from the Kompakt aesthetic
    that first brought him wide attention. <i>Salmiakki</i> is the third jewel in Shitkatapult's 2003 triple
    crown, following the ambient washes of sound of Apparat's <i>Duplex</i> and the lubs and skips of Anders
    Ilar's <i>Everdom</i>.  On it, Koivikko has largely abandoned the atmospherics of his previous work for
    a more athletic sound.  Like MRI, Koivikko has adopted a more traditionalist stance.  Yet whereas those
    disco/house classicists celebrate <i>All That Glitters</i>, Koivikko does almost the complete opposite,
    dissecting the robot-funk of classic techno.</p><p>
    Of Koivikko's earliest tracks, only ""Brythe"" is included here-- and that's no bad thing, considering that
    its buoyant shimmer is still the standout in the Finnish producer's arsenal.  Elsewhere, Koivikko's work
    is downright robust.  In comparison to most of his peers, he raises the BPMs and places more emphasis on
    bass, rhythm and propulsion than he does on texture or atmosphere.  Like Sascha Funke's <i>Bravo</i> and
    Villalobos' <i>Alcachofa</i>, <i>Salmiakki</i> oscillates between private listening and more ""public""
    sounds (although it leans more heavily to the latter) and still retains more than a few pools of dub.
    The result is dubby techno-- call it mood music to cut rugs-- that's made just as attractive by its thrust
    as it is by its tone, and is highlighted by the melodic motorik of ""Kampakuta"", the I-94-meets-Autobahn
    drive of ""Materialist"", and the noirish ""Matkani"".</p><p>
    Microhouse has become so healthy so quickly that it's spawned not only a variety of styles (from the glam of
    schaffel to digital disco to the neuroromantics of <i>The Present Lover</i>) but also a legion of artists
    who are doing everything <i>but</i> following blueprints such as Herbert's ""Going Round"" or Isolée's ""Beau
    Mot Plage"".  <i>Salmiakki</i> and DJ Koze's upcoming Kompakt mix offer further indications that microhouse's
    original elements are rapidly disintegrating.  Koivikko is eating the tail of tech-house, winding through
    its brief history and starting again with a more strict genre sound; DJ Koze's mix does the opposite--
    casting such a wide mix that it risks not having an identity at all.  Koivikko's record is more effective
    but possibly more worrying.  Thus far, microhouse has been a consistently surprising sound.  Its progenitors
    have ducked and weaved rather than strayed down the dead end of traditionalism.  A potential concern
    is that if producers do pass go and end up back at the starting line they risk embracing the retro novelty
    and empty revivalism that is skillfully avoided on much as <i>Salmiakki</i>.</p></div>"|4569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4569-salmiakki/|7.1|Scott Plagenhoef

    import singles and lame movie soundtracks will be sought by only the most devoted fans, who will dutifully
    mine every last scrap of a band's recorded sound, no matter what they'll be made to pay or where they'll be
    forced to go.  So, I tend to wonder who the audience might be for an official collection of a band's
    non-album tracks-- and that's without tackling the ramifications of the MP3's rise to ubiquity.</p><p>
    
    The Manchester trio Doves, however, have a far more elusive nemesis than the MP3 threatening irrelevance
    for their B-side compilation, <i>Lost Sides</i>: themselves.  These tracks are listed as having been culled
    from the eight singles spanning their 2000 debut <i>Lost Souls</i> and 2002 follow-up <i>The Last Broadcast</i>,
    but the fact is, more than half of these songs first saw the light of day as bonus tracks on the stateside
    release of <i>Lost Souls</i> or on a bonus CD accompanying the domestic limited edition version of <i>The
    Last Broadcast</i> (which is still readily available).  Disregarding the two overtly unnecessary ""alternate""
    versions of tracks from <i>Lost Souls</i>, little of the material here is legitimately new to the group's
    stateside fans.</p><p>
    
    Releasing a collection of rarities when your entire recorded output has yielded only two full-length records
    could seem an act of putting the cart before the horse; however, the Doves thankfully exist among a legion
    of B-side crazy Brits whose alternate material is almost as strong as any of the stuff on their actual albums
    (even if some of it is pulled from those albums).  ""Darker"", for instance, is a bout of blissfully fuzzed-out
    basslines, melancholy guitar arpeggios and rolling breakbeats, while the piano-driven live staple ""Hit the
    Ground Running"" manages to mutate the Warren Zevon original into a Supergrass-influenced, pub-friendly
    rocker.  ""Valley"" is one of the finest songs in the Doves' repertoire (it was one of <i>Lost Souls</i>'
    highlights back in 2000); as frontman Jimi Goodwin sings of ""a new day,"" layers of piano chords clash with
    ricocheting guitar notes, and delayed loops of vocal harmony rounds create a pastoral chill.</p><p>
    
    Even the most inspired moments on <i>Lost Sides</i>, though, make it difficult to overlook the embarrassing
    glut of superfluous filler.  Do the Doves' fans really need a pretentious pseudo-classical version of the
    <i>Lost Souls</i> highlight ""Break Me Gently"" to introduce the proceedings?  How about a Chemical Brothers-aping
    glowstick nightmare called ""Crunch"", suited in mid-90s breakbeats and k-hole psychedelia?  Or ""Down to Sea"",
    a maudlin rewrite of <i>Lost Souls</i>' ""Sea Songs"" whose sluggish tempo and gratuitous reverb render the
    exuberant original utterly lifeless?</p><p>
    
    The most confounding aspect of the domestic release of <i>Lost Sides</i> is that it fails to include the
    UK version's bonus disc of seven remixes from the likes of Four Tet, Magnet and Echoboy.  Had Capitol
    included these previously unreleased remixes with this collection's stateside edition, it's remotely
    possible that there would be enough new material here to entice U.S. listeners.  Otherwise, for the
    most part, anyone who wants this stuff already has it.</p></div>"|2431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2431-lost-sides/|6.0|Hartley Goldstein

    at innovation.  Though the implementation of unexpected song structures and ostensibly experimental sounds
    can make music quite a bit more interesting, it can also render it sterile, flat and emotionless.  In many
    cases, the finest pop songs are those that transcend their form entirely-- songs so instinctually graceful
    that listening to them feels like a creative act in and of itself.  Indeed, the best pop songs are often
    the most difficult to discuss rationally, those indispensable not for their formal inventiveness but for
    their ability to tap directly into the intangible realm of human memory and emotion.</p><p>
    
    In the mid-to-late 90s, Athens, Georgia's Elephant Six collective established themselves as a group of
    artists with a shared interest in expressing the inexpressible through pop music.  The Olivia Tremor Control,
    fronted by singer/songwriters Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss, encapsulated both the collective's unabashed
    love for both classic pop and psychedelic music, and its sincere interest in experimental music and sounds.
    This, the band's debut album, represents their most fundamental integration of these two impulses-- never
    does the record's sonic palette seem like an afterthought to the songs, nor do the songs themselves seem
    like haphazard carriers for carefully chosen sounds.  For an album with so much going on, <i>Dusk at Cubist
    Castle</i> is strikingly holistic, its diverse elements held together by an uncanny awareness of what they
    can evoke and represent.</p><p>
    
    The Elephant Six Collective is known largely for their reverence towards classic pop music, and <i>Dusk at
    Cubist Castle</i> inevitably draws comparisons to The Beatles and Beach Boys.  But the influence of these
    seminal pop groups seems to be evident in the Olivia Tremor Control's approach as much as their aesthetic.
    One imagines Hart and Doss not simply admiring <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> and <i>Pet Sounds</i>, but utterly
    internalizing them-- appreciating them not only for specific melodies and sounds, but also for how affecting
    those melodies and sounds could be.  Though the bouncy basslines and rich vocal harmonies of <i>Dusk</i>
    often bring to mind Paul McCartney or Brian Wilson, nothing sounds like the result of shallow imitation,
    as much as reverence and profound understanding.</p><p>
    
    Nowhere is this clearer than on <i>Dusk</i>'s near-flawless first half.  ""Jumping Fences"", one of the finest
    songs ever penned by Hart and Doss, conjures an air of introspective melancholy without ever approaching
    languor.  At just under two minutes, ""Jumping Fences"" barely repeats itself at all, instead subtly building
    upon a beautiful, catchy melody with layered vocal harmonies, pianos and guitars.  ""No Growing (Exegesis)""
    follows a similar path, this time incorporating dramatic horn blasts into a climactic chorus.</p><p>
    
    The second half of <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i> is a decidedly more abstract affair, anchored by the
    10-track ""Green Typewriters"" suite.  It's here that the experimental undertones of <i>Dusk at Cubist
    Castle</i> begin to bleed through more noticeably.  The fifth ""Green Typewriters"" track is a brief,
    unsettling, rhythmically insistent drone piece that foreshadows the extended ambience of ""Green Typewriters""
    number eight.  In part nine, the first discernible vocal melody for about ten minutes simply utters ""how
    much longer can I wait,"" ushering in a majestic guitar solo that immediately plunges into a swirl of
    backwards sounds, whooshing cymbals and fuzzed-out chords.  After the final installment of ""Green
    Typewriters"", <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i> returns to a slightly more stripped-down and fragmented variation
    on its first half, finally closing with the ghost-in-the-four-track noises of ""NYC-25"", one of their most
    affecting pop songs.</p><p>
    
    Aside from granting the album an air of timelessness, <i>Dusk</i>'s saturated 4-track production always
    leaves me with the feeling that there's more to this album than can possibly be heard.  And sure enough,
    eight years after its initial release, <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i> still somehow surprises me every time
    I listen to it.  As its title suggests, there's something intensely cinematic about the record, and also
    something perpetually incomplete-- the images and ideas evoked stay with you much longer than the album
    itself.  It's the masterful translation of these images and ideas that makes <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i>
    such a unique and unforgettable record.</p></div>"|5983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5983-dusk-at-cubist-castle/|9.4|Matt LeMay

Their rhythm-heavy lineup-- a traditional drummer, an
    auxiliary percussionist, a bassist, and a warm body behind the synthesizers-- betrays this dogged
    preoccupation, as does their decided lack of proper melody, or song structure, or really anything that
    might distract from their deep 4/4 stomps.  Tussle are dub before they're trance or some equally confusing
    organic abomination, but, to put it crudely, they're able to maintain the warmth of the former without
    compromising the precision of latter.  It's an impressive ""best of both worlds"" equation that, perhaps
    despite this creative dissonance, allows Tussle to create almost completely hookless tracks that are
    memorable nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    We experience this sound fully but for too short a time on <i>Don't Stop</i>.  The twenty-two minute EP
    collects one previously released remix of ""Eye Contact"", two new songs (""Windmill"" and the title track),
    and two remixes of these new songs including a Soft Pink Truth ""disco-hijacked"" reworking of ""Windmill"".</p><p>
    
    The bassline of title track begins typically enough amidst the hi-hat swishes, only to jump suddenly from
    its lowdown self to an extremely colorful (if off-key) major third, an unexpected but delightful punchline.
    The auxiliary percussion wades in and out of chamber echo effects and trashy cowbells, eventually forcing
    the bassline to surrender completely for a few moments before the line recasts itself and beckons the
    synthesizer into the mix.  ""Windmill"" is the title track's crisper cousin, stumbling in with a string of
    vocal cutups and featuring a reserved but energetic percussion breakdown.  Percussion almost entirely
    subsumes the bassline of Tussle's own remix of ""Eye Contact"", the band hinting at it like dub Picassos,
    fragmentarily.</p><p>
    
    The Soft Pink Truth remix of ""Windmill"" centers its larger-than-dub beat atop a feisty conga solo, leaving
    the bassline intact for a time before wrenching it entirely into high-flying kaleidoscopic arpeggios and
    chopping it up so finely that by the end of the track, the bassline's sole seems purely rhythmic as well.
    The storied Stuart Argabright approximates simple tape and pitchshifting manipulations, not to mention a
    peppering of Mego-esque noise, before granting the bassline its proper entrance and subsequent de-evolutions.
    For songs so minimal to begin with, it's remarkable how well both remixers are able to mine their source
    material for energy without decimating the songs' original dub appeal.</p><p>
    
    If Tussle can be criticized for anything, it's that their songs can be extremely homogenous, both among
    the tracks and within the tracks themselves.  One can't help but bring up LCD Soundsystem's pretentious
    mix of ""Yeah"" as a benchmark for similar-sounding releases such as the <i>Don't Stop</i> EP, since the
    former's infinite depth and versatility seems to be the major point of superiority.  In a live setting,
    I can't imagine Tussle not indulging in more expansive builds and overall jumpiness, and with any luck
    they might be able to translate this restless energy more readily to their future recordings.</p></div>"|8249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8249-dont-stop-ep/|7.3|Nick Sylvester

Well, no, but at least a few of us find it a
    happy occurrence.  That, presumably, is the reason they've released, via website, a <i>triple</i> set,
    bracketed by a single live disc, and this latest release, taken from an in-studio webcast-- in addition
    to a more widely released two-disc set.  So your options are open, but let me make a case for this as the
    definitive live Ween album of the moment: Only three of these tracks appear on their prior live releases,
    and four of them have never been available on CD until now, so value's in.  And if <i>All Request Live</i>
    is not the best choice if you're looking for dirty-mindedness and sheer rockitude, it is unquestionably
    the brownest live Ween of them all.</p><p>
    
    That twistedness leads to the biggest plus/minus of the album.  Following a wonderfully psychedelic version
    of ""Happy Colored Marbles"" from 2003's <i>quebec</i> comes ""The Stallion"", Parts 1-5.  18 minutes of screaming,
    moaning, pounding and thrashing (and briefly, melodic jamming) is funnier in conception than it is in
    execution.  Admittedly, the fact that fans voted online for the first joint appearance of parts 1, 2 &amp; 3
    is great.  The addition of a new Pt. 4 is genius.  The addition of a new Pt. 5 is so wrong it's almost,
    but not quite, right.  Nonetheless, most Weenies take the approach that there's no such thing as too much
    of a good thing, and in that context, there's quite an appeal to so many variations on a theme, and the
    boys really do wring more out of it than you'd expect.  It's a prime example of their main dichotomy: a
    sense of humor so puerile that at times even Jack Black would be embarrassed, and musicianship so strong
    that you'd swear they'd been gigging since the 70s.</p><p>
    
    After this minor rut, the album provides variety in spades: a heartbroken tenor crooner alone at the
    keyboard; a two-minute boogie-bash wherein Dean demonstrates the happy medium between Eddie Van Halen's
    notes-per-second and Stevie Ray Vaughan's look-how-far-I-can-bend-this; an awesome deep-southern-fried
    slow stomp; a version of a Chinese folk dirge to a deceased mate.  This array of styles is a huge component
    of their live releases, as the albums of late have been very thematically focused.  <i>quebec</i> is the
    only recent exception, and this is a better album.</p><p>
    
    Next comes their sketch of the Mang asking Mr. Addled Whiteboy what ""pollo"" means, trailed by an unassailable
    rendition of ""ReggaeJunkieJew"".  A wild example of combined juvenility and accomplishment, it works up to a
    steady bassline that rocks, funks and calls to mind Pee Wee Herman doing his ""Tequila"" dance.  Anything with
    guitar lines so subtly shredding and lyrics including the word Matsohfarian can only be bowed before.  Again
    with the dichotomy-- two totally straight luv-u-always paeans parenthesizing a freaked and fractured
    guitar-snarl that seems to equate mononucleosis with a bad psychedelic trip.  And one of these odes-to-muse
    actually proposes, ""'Cause tried and true, I see the light in you.  Oh, can you dig in my soul?  Could you
    smell my w/hole... life?""</p><p>
    
    We've been through the tunnel of Ween, and the absolute highlight is waiting: ""Where'd the Cheese Go?"" is
    a rendition of the duo's notorious rejected <i>Pizza Hut</i> jingle that's been upped to nearly six minutes.
    It may be the best balance of idiot/savant they've accomplished to date.  The music is burbly Cars intro
    meets chicken-scratch JB's guitar, double-dating Cameo's vocoder and the ""Purple Rain"" guitar wind-up--
    and it's all anchored by a bass so fluid I barely believe it has strings.  Never mind how warped the lyrics
    are.  (I could attempt excerpts, but without the accents, it's pretty pointless.)</p><p>
    
    Ween's appeal isn't universal, and this release hews even further from the mainstream than unusual.  Good
    thing, too, as it's in the band's interest to keep their fanbase happy.  Even if they garner new devotees,
    most of them will probably be age 13, thus becoming too cool within a few years for a band so childlike.
    That leaves Ween with a fairly large fanbase old enough to know better and sharp enough not to care.  And
    that raises an interesting question-- how many die-hards actually bought this disc?  I don't think Ween
    give a shit, but it'd be nice to know how amply they're being rewarded for treating fans right in the
    course of running their own little web-label.</p></div>"|8609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8609-all-request-live/|7.7|Dan Miron

    into the crush of The Larry Tee Electroclash Attack of Two Summers Ago<font size=""-2""><sup>TM</sup></font>.
    Zoot Woman was a full-fledged member of that blitzkrieg.  Cuts from their debut, <i>Living in a Magazine</i>,
    littered the countless electro comps sandwiched between Fischerspooner centerfolds and rubber-banded onto
    the new Ladytron release.  Zoot Woman reviews were packed with so many references to other electro acts it
    was difficult to tell who was really doing what, and why we should care.</p><p>
    
    Happily, this is all over.  Electroclash is fading like a fond but embarrassing memory, like the time you
    made out with the really skanky VJ because he promised to play that Stardust video you really like.  But
    Zoot Woman is still having a go at it, and they've returned with an album that sticks close to their first
    recipe, bringing back the fun with a more polished and occasionally darker sound.  It's full of their
    familiar hooks and beats, and more of Johnny Blake's suave-yet-gruff vocals.  Think of a French Kathleen
    Turner without the weird accent.  And male.</p><p>
    
    With a throbbing bassline out front and sharper electric guitars pushed lower into the mix, <i>Zoot Woman</i>
    leads off with the first single, ""Grey Day"".  Existing in some no-man's-land between dance and rock, it
    would make a welcome addition to a Britpop dance night where the kids are used to turning medium tempo
    tracks into full-on rave anthems.  ""Taken It All"" slows things down, adds a bit of faux-70s glamour, and
    reminds us that guitars will be taking a backseat to keyboards for the remainder of the journey.</p><p>
    
    ""Hope in the Mirror"" infuses a bit of breezy pop silliness into the mix with light keyboard chords and
    stylized guitar riffs.  Clearly the one-off track in the lot, ""Snow White"" channels Elliott Smith for an
    acoustic ballad peppered with sub-glitch noises and a front-and-center drum kit.  The instrumental ""Calmer""
    weaves in horn and backwards samples and sounds like clean/smooth/calm early Beta Band.  The album ends
    with ""Half Full of Happiness"", not quite brooding but full of enough moody, flipped around backwards
    samples that something is obviously amiss.  Warning: the last two minutes drone on long enough to bring
    down the room, and should be probably skipped.</p><p>
    
    Zoot Woman isn't essential, but it is infectious.  It won't find an easy home on most dance floors, but it
    will mix in well at the beginning of the night before the lipstick is smeared and the vodka can remove nail
    polish.  So put up with one more electro reference and take Miss Kittin's advice: play it at a backyard party
    with friends, sing along in the car, or bribe the bartender at the hotel lounge to slip it in.  And karma
    sutra training would probably help, too.</p></div>"|8956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8956-zoot-woman/|7.5|PJ Gallagher

For obscure acts of the 90s finally sucking some surface air, subpar is the new par.  Those of us
    who have long pursued John Darnielle's bronze crumbs will head down to our record stores today in our
    scarves and messenger bags, expecting an opus, but we will leave nonplussed.  <i>We Shall All Be Healed</i>
    is like an ugly, hollow sports victory for a team anticipated to blow away the opposition.  If this had
    been our first game, we would never have become such huge tailgating losers.</p><p>
    And we are full-on fans. We cling to Darnielle's early cassette-only releases for reasons, we are starting
    to think, more biographical than qualitative.  We mail-ordered, awaited, and then owned everything listed
    on his Internet discography (except the annoyingly ""never released"" projects), but were reduced to eBaying
    most of our archives to pay for our divorces.  We started bands that ripped off the ""Going To __________""
    titling habit he kicked long ago, and many of our sophomore efforts contain a song called ""FM"", embarrassingly
    attributed to Darnielle due to our ignorance that he was covering Steely Dan.  We are thankful for how
    Darnielle expanded our definition of ""punk"" to contain acoustic odes to cartographers and unsexy species.
    We gather Darnielle's bootlegged covers (most recently of Suede and Neutral Milk Hotel) to survive the
    winter.  Though Darnielle now maintains a degree of prodigality, we no longer view the fattening of his
    man-and-machine ""production"" as an evil on par with Converse's selling out to Nike, even if we're still
    unsteady about its political ramifications.</p><p>
    We always love to hear Darnielle again, though he never stays gone for long.  On this album, he still
    decrees (rather than ""sings"") his lyrics with the adamancy of the virgin, as if he'd been a preoccupied
    town crier in a past life.  Producer and friend John Vanderslice may lower the vocals and distort them,
    but Darnielle thankfully still sounds as if he's reporting from some Protestant, pre-compromise utopia
    under siege.  But the only surprises <i>Healed</i> holds is that Darnielle has nothing new to teach us,
    and that the album triggers our memory of Donald Gibb's character Ogre, from that movie about the misfits
    with the same goals as the meatheads, rumbling ""Nnnerrrds!""</p><p>
<i>Healed</i> begins passionately enough, but by now we have a right to take Darnielle's consistency for
    granted: He has become that boring but dedicated partner whom we must leave because we can hear the club
    down the street, and we fear that we're missing some of the too-much that is going on.  ""Slow West Vultures""
    is an indictment of unsustainability that establishes the album's pace, tone and scope, but I don't buy any
    of it, with its ""urgency"" (the full-band Mountain Goats attempt rock to the extent that <i>The View</i>
    attempts in-depth current-events analysis), and its lyrics that go down like Maoist slogans with a sense
    of privation (except for ""get in the goddamn car""), and its Aguilera-caliber vocal shudders, and its timid
    impression of a big finish.</p><p>
    ""Palmcorder Yajna"" manages more intensity, and a great image, though Darnielle will recycle it: ""Reflective
    tape on our sweatpants.""  But the song's unjangly R.E.M.-ness never changes, sending the hungry collector
    back into his/her (okay, his) archives of Midnight Oil.  ""Linda Blair Was Born Innocent"" proves to be a
    tease of a title, and fails to analyze how her most famous film was about the church's demonization of
    female sexuality; it's a ho-hum ching-a-linger about being ""hungry for love"" and ""going downtown.""  Nora
    Danielson (who also played with Darnielle on 2001's <i>Devil in the Shortwave</i>) acquits herself on this
    song, and throughout the album, with her violinistry, but not distinctively: Except for the few seconds
    when she apes The Dirty Three, she evokes Alastair Gailbraith's earlier Goat complements.</p><p>
    ""Letter from Belgium"" and ""Your Belgian Things"" constitute the most prominent examples of Darnielle's
    trademark globalization, and they're limited to the land that hilariously tricked all of us into watching
    Marxist fantasia <i>The Smurfs</i> during the commie-blasting 80s.  The second of these songs is the more
    effective, but Darnielle's nasal-Donahue emerges intermittently, and is less digestible than in previous
    years.</p><p>
    The rest of the album wallows in similar okayness (I am forgetting the name of the critic who wrote, in
    <i>Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks</i>, that television's success rests in its ability
    to provide 24-hour partial satisfaction).  ""Mole"" is a cousin of Guided by Voices' ""I Am a Tree"", and it
    breaks from its <i>Hill Street Blues</i>-theme homage for a climax that has nothing to do with the rest of
    the song.  ""The Young Thousands"" is, you know, rousing (dig that wall of Darnielles!), and boasts one of
    the album's few soul-rending lyrics, but we fans have heard this kind of heralder before.</p><p>
    So ""Cotton"" features a decent bebop breakdown, and we hangers-on can't complain about ""Home Again Garden
    Grove""'s patented hyperharmonizing, anxious chords, and war/suicide/jellyfish imagery.  As much as we may
    be proud that Darnielle has graduated from the Crayola artwork of Shrimper to 4AD's hegemonic cursive, as
    much as we may internalize his shoulders' evocation of our mother's osteoporosis, as much as we respect
    the Vanderslicing that coheres ""Against Pollution"", <i>We Shall All Be Healed</i> is complacent, formulaic
    for a trailblazer, lapped by Destroyer, optimistic-but-joyless in that it is pessimistic-but-punchy, and
    gooped with the silly putty of vagueness and cliché.  Aw hell, this feels like narcking on a chum, but
    Darnielle has perhaps been made ironically complacent by his suspicions that humans are getting the world
    that they deserve.  Either that, or his folk has outmatured us.</p></div>"|5455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5455-we-shall-all-be-healed/|6.9|William Bowers

    trad-folk delicacy has long slipped past the ears of most Americans, despite loads of rousing recommendations
    from Brian Eno and million-star reviews from almost every Irish periodical ever.  After nearly fourteen years
    of touring (and four full-length LPs), the band has opted to release a 13-track live album, <i>Set List</i>,
    as proof of their insane stamina and hyper-dedicated following: If nothing else, the record is a hard and
    fast testament to the goofy fervor The Frames are capable of inducing in eager European crowds.</p><p>
    
    The tragic flaw of the live record is that it almost always offers an entirely compromised version of the
    genuine experience-- a watery, dull, one-dimensional representation of something that should ideally be
    transcendent.  The Frames are stellar songsmiths, and <i>Set List</i> certainly proves that they're equally
    capable live performers, but by far the most interesting aspect of this record is the foot-stomping fervor
    of their perpetually singing-along crowd.  Anyone nauseated by the prophetical leanings of Dashboard
    Confessional shows (check small clumps of skinny kids mouthing every lyric in earnest, whimpering along
    with their hands clenched into euphoric fists), or freaked out by the beer-soaked ""Bruce!"" bellows that
    send quivers through Giants Stadium whenever Springsteen plays, might be equally shocked by the enthusiasm
    of The Frames' adoring fans, who seem to be perpetually trembling with excitement.  Somehow, The Frames
    have managed to capture the sweaty, breathless communion of the live show in some oddly convincing ways.</p><p>
    
    If you can get past gaping over the hollers of the audience, <i>Set List</i> just might be compelling enough
    to encourage new listeners to check out The Frames' proper discography.  Recorded over four nights at Vicar
    Street in Dublin, <i>Set List</i> runs through the band's standards (see opener ""Revelate"" and the
    scream-along fest of ""Star Star"") and offers a single new track (seriously, how are these kids still
    singing along?), the quietly confessional, heavily falsettoed ""The Blood"".  Frontman Glen Hansard is
    always playful, leading his bandmates into bits of Marley's ""Redemption Song"" and Cash's ""Ring of Fire"",
    and offering plenty of charming between-song banter.</p><p>
    
    The Frames have long imbued their playing with a certain elasticity, each song bending and shifting like a
    pulled rubberband, and it gets easier and easier to understand how fans can become so enraptured by the
    tug: Colm Mac Con Iomaire's fiddle-playing is breathless, and Joseph Doyle's backing vocals are expert,
    lifting Hansard's vocals and guitars onto a perfect pedestal.  Alternately earnest and teasing, tracks
    like ""Stars Are Underground"" and ""Santa Maria"" prove that The Frames are actually far more than the sum of
    their recorded parts.  <i>Set List</i> is not their first live record (see 2002's flaccid <i>Breadcrumb
    Trail</i>), but it is easily their most convincing plea for your ticket-buying attention.</p></div>"|3174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3174-set-list/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

Or at least a sensible one.  I've tried for several
    train rides now and about the best I can come up with is ""A Joint Rage.""  Some others: ""A Jargon Tie,"" ""Tora
    GI Jane,"" ""Jeana Griot"" and ""A Gear Joint.""  I think it's the ""J"" that throws things off.  There are only so
    many places in a word where you can put that thing.  Adam Pierce, on the other hand, is sitting pretty.  Not
    only can you jumble up the letters in his name to get such useful not-sequiturial phrases as ""A Mad Recipe""
    and ""Acid Ampere"", you can also get ""Mice Parade"".  And as Pierce has now proven over the course of five
    albums, Mice Parade is a damn good thing.</p><p>
    
    The usual terms often get bandied about at Pierce's expense when talking about his music: post-rock, IDM,
    organica, even new age (wait! Don't hit ""back"" yet!).  But the music he makes is, for all intents and
    purposes, genreless, which likely explains why people have such a hard time defining it.  His sense of
    arrangement and typically static harmonic structures frequently lend his music an otherworldly, trancelike
    aura, but the more subtle element that so often makes it transfixing is rhythm, which is never absent for
    long.  Every carefully placed element in his arrangements somehow nudges the song forward, from obvious
    things like Pierce's impressive drumming and inconspicuous programming to more unusual elements like his
    kinetic acoustic guitar playing and always-handy synths.</p><p>
    
    Pierce's acoustic work is especially omnipresent on <i>Obrigado Saudade</i>, often forming the backbone of
    its compositions.  ""Milton Road"" rides solely on the back of his frenetic strumming, sweeping in with freezer
    blasts of overdubbed electric guitar at carefully spaced intervals.  He spends most of his time alone on
    these songs, joined by guests on fewer than half of the tracks.   In fact, he gets a full band together only
    once, for ""Mystery Brethren"", a breathtaking improvisation that gets off to a jumpy start with swirling keys
    and clouds of vibraphone riding Pierce's sizzling, repetitive drum groove.  Chris Conti's guitar is less
    percussive than Pierce's typically is, but still has that perpetual forward momentum that distinguishes
    Mice Parade.</p><p>
    
    HiM's Doug Scharin gets behind the traps for ""Out of the Freedom World"" (a titular response to Mice Parade's
    own ""Into the Freedom World"", from 2001's fantastic <i>Mokoondi</i>), laying down a typically solid foundation
    for Pierce's flights on the cheng, a Chinese harp of which he's made excellent use since first introducing
    it to his music four years ago.  It's not all instrumental pattern-building, either: Pierce lends his
    detached tenor to the driving, acoustic guitar-led ""Focus on a Roller Coaster"", lending the track an
    uncharacteristic sense of form and melody.</p><p>
    
    It seems unlikely that Mice Parade will ever make a truly amazing album-- the music is almost too consistently
    gorgeous to create any defining moments-- but so far Adam Pierce and his abettors have yet to make an album
    that falls short of worthwhile.  This is music just about anyone can enjoy, either for close listening or
    simply ambient sound, and that's perhaps where Pierce's use of an anagram of his name for his main musical
    project becomes most appropriate.  The structure of this music allows easily for the free rearrangement of
    a set group of sounds into a huge number of different patterns and textures, and the more you rearrange,
    the more interesting those patterns and textures become.</p></div>"|5260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5260-obrigado-saudade/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    in other styles: Their first few albums radiated a fair amount of early 70s AM radio sheen, while <i>Cold
    and Bouncy</i> was soaked in late 90s electronics.  Along the way they've folded in some Brazil and a
    whole lot of Brian.  With <i>Beat Maize &amp; Corn</i>, they've stripped their music down to its bare essence
    and vacuum-sealed it.  Here, High Llamas are in essential oil mode, where a few drops could be used to
    color any number of pop music styles from the last 100 years.  For good or ill, this is Sean O'Hagan at
    his purest and most minimal.</p><p>
    
    You don't often come across a modern album that sounds so damn <em>old</em>.  With the arrangements O'Hagan
    has chosen, <i>Beet Maize &amp; Corn</i> could have been played faithfully in 1850.  Though the sleeve lists
    O'Hagan on electric guitar, you never hear it.  Every other instrument is acoustic.  Most songs are built
    around his nylon-stringed strumming, with bits of piano and vibes, and then plenty horns and strings added
    for coloring.  Shakers and rim taps on a couple songs constitute the entirety of the percussion.  If there's
    even the slightest hint of ""rock"" to <i>Beet Maize &amp; Corn</i>, it's the softest variety ever played.</p><p>
    
    It's an old fogey of a record, but still timeless in its own way.  It's difficult to imagine what would
    occasion it, but if in the year 2040 I were to pull <i>Beet Maize &amp; Corn</i> from the shelf and play it
    for someone who'd never heard of High Llamas they probably wouldn't come close to guessing its age. No
    crackle, so it can't be 1935.  No lounge irony, so it can't be 1995.  Just simple melodies, not-so-simple
    harmonies, and the same strings/horns timbre that's drifted in and out of pop song fashion since the wax
    cylinder.</p><p>
    
    The tunes, though.  Goddammit, why can't they manage the tunes?  Sean O'Hagan is the best possible argument
    for melody writing being an inborn talent.  If great melodies were simply a matter of hard work, then O'Hagan
    would be at the top of the craft.  But for all his perfectly pitched arrangements and restless harmonic
    movement, we still have his drab songs sung by his dull voice.  The ""best"" songs here, like, uh, ""High on
    the Chalk"", I guess, are barely more memorable or noteworthy than the worst.  Sometimes a particular swoop
    of strings will get me, as on the painfully nostalgic ""The Click and the Fizz"", other times the background
    vocals (including contributions from the late Mary Hansen) will grate slightly, as on ""Porter Dimi"".  But
    that's about it for the ups and downs.  Mostly, <i>Beet Maize &amp; Corn</i> just hangs in the background, which
    I reckon is A-OK by Sean O'Hagan.</p></div>"|3862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3862-beet-maize-corn/|6.0|Mark Richardson

It's a fact I
    find dispiriting, yet quite the rule: Save an opportunity to score a few second's face time on the latest
    shock brand of reality television, the rewards don't justify the risk these days.  Conformity pays and
    pays well.  I take in uptown Charlotte, surveying battalions of reinforcements along Trade Street as the
    mere differentiating factors between any two brave jaywalkers are found in the silver letters of a briefcase
    monogram or the fit on a pair of pleated khakis.  There's no pageantry, no ostentation, no grandstanding--
    no damn fun.  And I'll wager now that An Albatross will never play here.  This transplanted Pennsylvanian
    is good for at least a word of warning to the band: Do not schedule us.</p><p>
    
    This banker's paradise couldn't host any of Philadelphia-bred An Albatross' wildly off kilter expositions
    of dissevered carnivalesque dementia.  Depending on when and where you catch them, you could witness
    anything from costumed sock-hopping to orgiastic food fights-- and all set to the band's sub-minute,
    licentious flurries of proletariat dance metal intoxication.</p><p>
<i>We Are the Lazer Viking</i>, the band's sophomore effort, captures eleven songs in about eight minutes.
    Ranging in length between :21 and 1:24, these brief tracks spotlight vocalist Edward B. Geida III shrieking
    his way through volatile bursts of digital meltdown and pure metalthrashing.  New to the band is a second
    keyboard player, which serves to clean up the sound a bit; his oddly inviting Farfisa melodies form the
    bedrock of most of the album, surfacing even when you don't have time enough to bob your head but twice.</p><p>
    
    The highlight might be the 1:13 of ""The Revolutionary Politics of Dance"", and (1:24 later) the :42 of ""Get
    Faster, Cry for Happy"".  Both songs blend electric grindcore bursts and wavelike synth-lulls into supremely
    rhythmic bouts of delirium.  Of the three instrumental tracks, ""J7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j"" sounds like a peek
    at the broiled labor of a steel-factory, while closer ""W7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7"" is cartoonish enough to feel
    at home on a Max Tundra album.  Oh, brave Vikings of the North, your apocalyptic unrest is valiant.  Though
    I suppose the live show of foreboding destruction is the real An Albatross experience; the record doesn't
    satisfy.  If you live in a real city, though, consider this a warning.</p></div>"|423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/423-we-are-the-lazer-viking/|6.1|William Morris

    of their attempted overview of the enigmatic New York scene cellist Arthur Russell.  If anything, there were
    many musical ""worlds"" for Iowa-born Arthur Russell, and he floated between them effortlessly in a way that,
    up until death from AIDS in 1992, no one else had.  There was the world of Indian master-musician Ali Akbar
    Khan, in which Arthur used his cello to trance-inducing effect.  There was the world where his cello shadowed
    the beat-poet Allen Ginsburg at readings, as well as the world of The Kitchen, where he premiered his peculiar
    minimal compositions while also rubbing elbows with composers like John Cage, Rhys Chatham, and Philip Glass.
    He was in the rock world, too, nearly joining the Talking Heads and forming the short-lived Flying Hearts
    with ex-Modern Lover Ernie Brooks.  He even briefly produced quirky tracks in the rap world, frustrating
    young rapper Mark Sinclair who would one day go on to make it as the meat-headed action hero Vin Diesel.</p><p>
    
    And then there was the world of disco music, where one night in 1977, a DJ saved his life.  That DJ, Nicky
    Siano, would collaborate with Arthur the following year (in a session featuring disparate musicians like
    David Byrne, Fluxus member Henry Flynt, and the Ingram Brothers) under the name of Dinosaur for the first
    12-inch disco single on the Sire label, the leftfield staple ""Kiss Me Again"".  A jubilant marriage of
    clacking castanets and bells, horns and breathless divas, Byrne's early Afrobeat guitar scratches and
    Russell's infinitely funky cello, its effect on dancefloors remains iconoclastic and ecstatic, a hot disco
    joint with little trace of <i>Saturday Night</i>'s fever.  Unfortunately, neither that track nor the
    similarly rubbery ""Tell You (Today)"" were licensed for this compilation, although both can be found on
    the crucial overview of early 80s dance weirdness, <i>Disco Not Disco</i> (which also features a superior
    mix of his Indian Ocean track, ""Tree House/School Bell"").</p><p>
    
    Despite these painful omissions, the towering high points of Arthur's extraordinary club music are finally
    gathered onto one disc, in one world.  The set opens with the disco favorite ""Go Bang #5"", as mixed by
    Francois Kevorkian.  From the drunken Don Drummond-esque trombone, weird <i>Bitches Brew</i>-style keyboard
    doodles, and crisp hi-hats cutting into the hand drums to the mingled masculine/feminine chants of ""I want
    to see all my friends at once go bang, go bang, go bang, get BANGED!!!"" its dubby pleasuredome message is
    undeniable and infectious.  Similarly lascivious is the Larry Levan mix of ""Is It All Over My Face"", whose
    lyrical meaning vacillates between that of come-on and unbridled aural beatitude on the dancefloor.  Both
    tracks embrace the seeming conflicts of simple physical release and higher levels of ecstatic pleasure and
    simply let it all go.</p><p>
    
    With long-time supporter/studio engineer Bob Blank's wife Lola and son Kenny providing the dramatized
    womanly tone and child-like chirp for 1985's ""Wax the Van"", Arthur worships the sun, mans the van, and
    sails towards it like Icarus, seeking to be up ""on the higher hill.""  Underneath all these echoing voices
    (including his own mumbles), he stretches pulsing bass, percolating congas, and an ocean of polyrhythmic
    waves into a weird dance song constantly in-flux.  When he takes to singing himself, Arthur's voice has a
    slippery, androgynous nature to it: a breathy, muffled baritone one moment, a cartoonish croon the next,
    as evident on the way-too-short Walter Gibbons mix of ""Let's Go Swimming"" (see <i>Disco Not Disco 2</i>).
    The ultra-obscure ""Pop Your Funk"" has him pulling out his own rockabilly-meets-Yello goofiness.</p><p>
    
    Two tracks are taken from the unfortunately deleted collection of songs, <i>Another Thought</i>.  ""Keeping
    Up"" features a fuzzy, incessant cello as propulsion and the backing voice of 80s trivia answer Jennifer
    Warnes (who, you might recall, was up where she belonged with Joe Cocker, and had the time of her life
    opposite a Righteous Brother on the <i>Dirty Dancing</i> soundtrack).  ""A Little Lost"" shows Arthur's
    ability to concoct a poignant, bittersweet pop song with just cello, guitar, and his echoing voice.  The
    bowed solo in the middle is astonishingly lyrical and emotionally direct, and the final few seconds of his
    double-tracked voice singing the chorus is a delight.</p><p>
    
    These songs serve as bookends for what I consider the apex of all Russell's powers and all his worlds: the
    seemingly infinite yet merely thirteen-minute ""In the Light of a Miracle"".  Merging his Buddha-infused
    minimalism with the rippling Indian percussion and sustained brass breaths of long-time collaborators
    Mustafa Ahmed and Peter Zummo, they hover over a gentle four-on-the-floor pulse of devotional bells,
    vamping Rhodes, piano and strummed guitar.  A choir of vaporous voices (including Tower of Meaning
    conductor Julius Eastman and Elodie Lauten) emerge from a cloud of holy sound, Russell's bowed cello
    shimmering like columns of white light, the sound of Paradise Garage and Nirvana itself.</p><p>
    
    As the grave nature of his illness manifests, the earlier, earthly pleasure of his disco songs become as
    caterpillars, giving way to something more beautiful and elusive.  Songs like ""Schoolbell/Treehouse"", ""Let's
    Go Swimming"" or ""Go Bang"" evolve into something ethereal and beyond rhythm.  The enchanting melodies brought
    forth in the mid-80s on <i>World of Echo</i> (to finally be reissued this year) or <i>Another Thought</i>
    are formed from his fragile, luminescent voice and cello, these two components bathed in nebulae of infinite
    echo, suggesting a space loosed from gravity's grip.  To hear the changeling voice of man and instrument
    move as one (as on ""Treehouse"") is to imagine a butterfly in flight: whimsically fluttering on bubble-gum
    beats, curlicues of noise, and petals of melody.  He reveals organic patterns scarcely glimpsed or grasped
    before taking off yet again on light-seeking flight beyond this world.  That some of that beauty is caught
    here is heavenly, indeed.</p></div>"|6907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6907-the-world-of-arthur-russell/|8.9|Andy Beta

He's got his trumpet with him and he's doing his thing, blowing
    smooth leads with an easy sense of cool that seems to come naturally.  He's backed by a couple of members
    of Spector's Wrecking Crew and they're grooving, deep in the moment.  Oh, and they're all standing knee-deep
    in the bubbling swamps of Dagobah, and there are thousands of Imperial stormtroopers engaged in an intense
    laser battle with a ragtag group of rebels all around them.  To many, this circumstance is incongruous; to
    Shalabi Effect, it's all in a day's work.  In fact, they've actually approximated this very scene I've
    described on ""Blue Sunshine"", one of a handful of tracks on their third album that incorporates unabashed
    pop in ways only a group of avant-garde tricksters like these four Quebecois noiseniks could.</p><p>
    
    It's clear from a trip through their back catalog that Shalabi Effect are no threat to the charts, but their
    particular brand of mildly psychedelic soundscaping has always managed to remain accessible relative to its
    closest counterparts, so the fact that several songs on the so-unsubtly-titled <i>Pink Abyss</i> sport
    memorable melodies and rather conventional structures shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.  It does
    represent an expansion of the band's aesthetic territory, though, and they cover the new ground well,
    perhaps even better than they address their past.</p><p>
    
    Lest I have you believing that Osama Shalabi and his associates are one step away from hiring The Matrix
    and ditching their tablas at Goodwill, I should point out that, as they draw pop convention close with one
    hand, they punish it with the other.  Just as they assault guest trumpeter Charles Spearin (Broken Social
    Scene, Do Make Say Think) with sawtooth waves and gurgling ambience on ""Blue Sunshine"", they can't keep
    their slimy hands off icy chanteuse Elizabeth Anka Vajagic's swooping, trip-hoppy delivery on ""Bright
    Guilty World"".  She swoons over brushed drums and a creeping bassline, a standard enough arrangement, but
    the song's edges are filled with ominous swells and unsettling clumps of barely subdued noise.</p><p>
    
    ""Iron &amp; Blood"" opens as squishy gothic zombie pop featuring a moaning chorus of la-la-la's and some
    disembodied piano parts, but it slowly morphs into a gradually accelerating guitar raga, ending at a
    raging clip and providing the kind of taut climax that this band once avoided.  They do still make room
    for a few pure sound collages, most notably ""Message from the Pink Abyss"", which opens the album with the
    stomach gurgles of cyborg aliens and panicked murmurs of forest nymphs, a squelching, breathing heap of
    noise that frankly isn't terribly captivating-- oddly, it feels like the most predictable track here.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Kinder Surprise"", a song that is, in many respects, the embodiment of its title, a
    gentle stream of organ and guitar cut through with bird songs that never reaches for the unsettling
    dissonance of the rest of the album.  <i>Pink Abyss</i> is something of a musical shift in gears for
    Shalabi Effect, but in the end, it actually mirrors the band's two previous albums in its very unpredictability.
    It's never quite as arresting or inscrutably powerful as <i>The Trial of St-Orange</i>, but is every bit as
    worthy and forward-looking.</p></div>"|7091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7091-pink-abyss/|7.4|Joe Tangari

He's recorded under so many aliases, it's hard to know whether his birthname
    is itself just another ruse.  Granted, Herren's never been a man of many words: all of his projects, to
    this point, have been primarily solo and instrumental-- the closest he's come to vocals are through the
    cut-up guests and female oohs that appear on his now-legendary albums as Prefuse 73.</p><p>
    When he recently put his Delarosa + Asora project out of its glitched-out agony, you could say it split in
    two: the live studio work continued under the name Savath &amp; Savalas, while the hard-cutting intricacies
    were swallowed by the Prefuse LPs.  Back in 1999, Savath &amp; Savalas's debut, <i>Folk Songs for Trains, Trees
    and Honey</i> came off not as the duo or trio that its names would suggest, but as a single source of the
    kind of warmth and thickness seldom found in hip-hop or post-rock.  With Herren on drums, bass, and keyboards
    on most tracks, it was all of a piece: slow, meaty beats overlaid with layers of bells, vibes and Rhodes for
    a wide open feel, with the occasional synthetic flourish.  The 2002 <i>Rolls and Waves</i> EP was jazzier
    and slicker, but clearly another live-but-alone project.</p><p>
    So Herren deserves admiration for taking such an extreme left turn with <i>Apropa't</i>, a spectral
    collaboration with a Barcelona singer, with songs written together in Spanish and Catalan.  True, he's
    been running the Eastern Developments label in Atlanta for years, helping friends like Kopernik and Lori
    Scacco put out just this sort of sleepy, eccentric album.  But it's still a shock to hear the planet's
    sickest beatsmith sing airy backup vocals while strumming a nylon-string guitar.  Now that the Prefuse
    persona is so well-established, of course, you'd be right to wonder what he has to lose if a side project
    like this flops; he's been touring as Prefuse straight through its release, after all.  But if you take
    him at his word, he's not dabbling.  On his now-native Barcelona: ""I'm not a tourist.  I went there for my
    soul.  What we're doing is a great expression of why I'm there.""  And about the kitsch-value of a token
    Latin project: ""We're not on some pseudo-anything.""  He even calls himself Guillermo now.</p><p>
    I need to get something off my chest.  ""On the last Prefuse record I told somebody that it was a break-up
    record,"" Herren is quoted in a recent <i>Urb</i> cover story.  ""So what happened?  Everybody asked me about
    it and I had to relive that moment over and over again.  It drove me to insanity.  So this time I swore I
    wouldn't do it, but I'm doing it.""  Readers, I may or may not be the one responsible, but early last year,
    he told me this, and I instantly spread the information all over the face of this tan-on-cream website.
    And I would do it again, happily, because the torment of rejection was scribbled all over that album for
    the world to see.  For all Herren's red herrings about ""psychedelic Spanish steez"" and the ""is what it
    is""-ness of his latest effort, <i>Apropa't</i> also fits with what he has revealed about his life last year:
    that in settling into expatriate life in Barcelona and struggling to accept the permanent absence of the
    Spanish father he never met, he happened into a slow-burning but all-consuming friendship with a Catalan
    singer named Eva Puyuelo Muns.</p><p>
    This is really her record.  She is responsible for its consistently cool, bittersweet feel, which feels like
    it could accompany a tale of star-crossed love set in the Arctic summer.  All the songs are put together
    simply-- vague hooks broken up by chronic lulls where the verses should be-- and the tracks bleed together
    as if drawn from a place where eerie music is always writing itself.  The tone is reserved and cryptic, as
    if Scott and Eva have taken some heartfelt lyrics in English and then translated them into Catalan to keep
    us from prying too deeply into their business.  The focus remains on Eva's voice, even as Herren undergirds
    it with the help of Josh Abrams, John Herndon, and John McEntire at Soma Studios in Chicago.</p><p>
    The album starts with a burst of noise that's dirtier and more restrained than the one that sparks <i>Folk
    Songs</i>.  Immediately we're in a cold, bright place: jangling chimes instead of vibes, lean driving drums
    instead of fat beats, and a mess of flutes, harmonicas and synths weaving us right out of the picture.
    ""Balcón Sin Flores"" drops a haunting lament behind a veil of twining metal reeds, and ""A La Nit"" provides
    another brief taste of trees and honey, with a warm fretless bass bending into cribbed cinematic strings.
    Halfway through this short album, however, its tracks have failed to change keys, and one gets the keen
    sense that <i>Apropa't</i> is going nowhere.  ""Ràdio Llocs Espacials"" and ""Víctima Belleza"" reinforce the
    suspicion, oddly spare lullabies with steamy pauses instead of verses.  Too late, ""Interludio 44""
    distinguishes itself with a refreshing array of pure tones, with erratic envelopes and stochastic pitch
    changes adding up to a slow harmonic drift.  Some later songs are just wordless humming, not neutral,
    but designed to somehow lure us in while at the same time warning us off.</p><p>
    This may be Herren's least accessible project to date.  Like sand, the harder you squeeze it, the more it
    slips through your fingers.  <i>Apropa't</i> fades into the walls if you listen too long.  But maybe it's
    just trying to keep some unfathomable secret.  So far, it's done a good job.</p></div>"|7008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7008-apropat/|6.9|Jascha Hoffman

I took it to the sink, attached it to the faucet, and let the water in
    until the slack in the balloon's thin, rubber walls was gone and the water occupied as much space inside as
    possible, while still allowing me to remove it from the small hydrant and tie up the end.  A full balloon
    is kind of perverse; it begs to be exploded, and if I lived two floors up, I probably would have dropped
    it to the sidewalk without a second thought.  The water has nowhere to go from within, and the tight,
    bulging skin of the ball is so reminiscent of a young woman's breast that most people are embarrassed to
    hold one.  However, the most interesting part of a full balloon is not on the outside, but its saturated
    inner vacuum of water and captive air.</p><p>
    If I could swim on the inside of this balloon, I would hardly last more than a few seconds before my head
    burst.  The pressure, already near a critical point, would be magnified every time someone handled the
    outside, shifting currents of force inside, similar to the earth's tremors in the deep sea.  The only way
    to escape the chamber is to release pressure and hope that in the minute, violent transition from the point
    of explosion to its surging release I'm not blown to bits as well.  This is the crux of high pressure: can't
    live with it, and sometimes its release causes even more damage.</p><p>
    Onkyo appeared in Japan in the late 90s, as sort of an inverse of noise music and typically Japanese extreme
    renderings of free jazz and improvisation.  Music writer Patrick Boeuf states as much during a short, interesting
    essay inside the <i>Amplify 2002</i> booklet.  He notices the tendency for intense upper register tones
    juxtaposed with silence, and I would apply their relationship to the tension and release of pressure inside
    the balloon.  Judging by the nature of its participants' performances, Onkyo (fitting under a wider umbrella
    of ""electro-acoustic improvisation"") is a study in the transition between almost unbearable pressure and tiny
    resolve.  Where silence builds considerable, tangible tension, more so when a large ensemble is able to
    sustain it for long periods, the minimal sound put forth by guitar, sampler, mixing-board-- or whatever
    Otomo Yoshihide was pounding on during his duo show with Günter Müller-- represents the tease of resolution.
    It's a tease because with Onkyo, there's never really a full release.  This is part of what makes it different
    from noise, and in fact, most other music on the planet.</p><p>
    The <i>Amplify</i> box set (seven music CDs, one DVD) documents a festival of the same name organized by the
    Erstwhile label's Jon Abbey, with assistance from Headz label owner Atsushi Sasaki, and musicians Toshimaru
    Nakamura and Taku Sugimoto.  Held over three days in Tokyo, October 2002, Amplify-- subtitled ""balance""--
    featured the best-known Japanese Onkyo performers, as well as European improvisers Müller, Keith Rowe,
    Bukhard Stangl, Thomas Lehn, Marcus Schmickler and Christof Kurzmann, who, while not following the same
    paths as the Japanese musicians, are certainly among the most respected electro acoustic improvisers today.
    In fact, it's the differing approaches of the Europeans and Japanese on <i>Amplify</i> that contributes some
    of the tension; here, that is inherently a good thing.</p><p>
    I was most fascinated by Jonas Leddington's DVD documentary feature ""balance beams,"" comprised of several
    performances, interviews, 5.1 surround sound mixes and subtle, hypnotic scenes of Tokyo street life.  As
    much as modern electronic improvisation might seem visually irrelevant, Abbey correctly points out in the
    booklet that there's no substitute for witnessing this music.  Performance highlights on the DVD include
    an incredible show by Cosmos (Sachiko M and vocalist Ami Yoshida), Otomo and Müller's show featuring the
    aforementioned pounding session and a frenetic set by Lehn and Schmickler, wherein sounds (and body
    movements) fly by faster than my eyes can process.  The final audio CD of <i>Amplify</i> contains a
    performance of seven guitar players, and Rowe's ""treatise"" with the musicians on the DVD is a humbling,
    funny peek at how up in the air this music must be, even for its major proponents.  Earlier, Rowe admits
    to having few ideas about how he will proceed even as his fingers approach his guitar at the start of a
    performance, though somehow the uncertainty surrounding this music seems perfectly appropriate.</p><p>
    The audio CDs are divided into festival shows (discs three through six), shows organized around the festival
    by Nakamura and Sugimoto (one and seven) and one new studio release by Nakamura and Müller entitled <i>Tint</i>.
    <i>Tint</i> will doubtlessly be of interest to fans of both performers, and doubles as fine case on the
    differing approaches between Onkyo and European electronic improvisation.  Nakamura's perfect sine, emitted
    from his signature no-input mixing board, hovers above Müller's more traditionally expressionist,
    laptop-assisted sounds.  In some instances, Müller actually provides a rhythmic pulse, and though his
    preference for sudden changes in tone and mood should conflict with Nakamura's relatively serene, minimal
    style, I find the result more along the lines of a summit between two colleagues; one gushing with
    enthusiasm and exotic detail, the other nodding and smiling politely.</p><p>
    Of the festival discs, my favorite performances begin with Cosmos' set at the start of disc three.  For my
    money, Sachiko M and Yoshida, along with Nakamura and Sugimoto, are the most purely representative of the
    Onkyo sound and concept.  Sachiko's sine acts as both a piercing, desperate stream of air escaping from
    the balloon, and as a thin blanket of light enveloping the entire ceiling of Cosmos' performance.  In turn,
    Yoshida is the embodiment of pressure and release, as she contracts her chest and throat muscles to form
    seemingly inhuman (and sometimes almost imperceptible) sounds.  Their track is an inspiring model of tension
    and the companionship required for an artistic duo.  Likewise, Müller and Otomo's performance on disc four
    is the work of two seasoned improvisers exploring their equipment, and one another.  I think Otomo (using
    guitar, turntable and electronics) is a better natural fit for Müller than Nakamura, if only because the
    pair seems to have similar ideas about how to fill detail into space.  Fans of atmospheric IDM along the
    lines of Fennesz or Philip Jeck would do well to listen to this duo's set.</p><p>
    AMM alum Rowe performs with frequent partner Nakamura on disc five in what is probably the greatest surprise
    for me on <i>Amplify</i>.  It's a surprise because of the consistently understated dynamics and progression
    of ideas.  I had seen the duo in Houston last year, where Rowe offered much busier (and I think less effective)
    counterpoint to Nakamura's restrained mixing board emissions.  Here, the two are content to wallow in
    pressure without the slightest hint of stress.  Contrast this with the Nakamura-Lehn duo on disc one, as
    Lehn's versatile analog synthesizer creates sounds ranging from insect calls to industrial hum to barely
    existent electro-static.  If at first Lehn's performance seems eclectic to a fault, all the more surprising
    then to witness his gradual concession to Nakamura's persistent sine in the track's second half.</p><p>
    Despite the volume of material to digest with <i>Amplify</i>, my impression is that it represents a momentary
    transition.  Utah Kawasaki (half of Astro Twin, along with Yoshida) writes in the booklet about his curiosity
    with the future of this music.  If there is a single thesis present in <i>Amplify</i>, it's that in meetings
    between Eastern and Western musicians, over the course of a single, extended event, whatever aim this small
    group of people shared will have changed slightly.  Or, it will have been refined and improved.  Even as a
    consequence of releasing pressure is that the original form loses its substance, nothing prevents new forms
    from being created, explored and eventually spawning still more.  Abbey's box set raises a signpost for the
    persistent change and transient brilliance of these musicians' work.</p></div>"|2037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2037-amplify-2002/|8.7|Dominique Leone

    to do.  However, the lack of name producers (one of the record's contributors disparagingly calls himself
    Crummie Beats) and the absence of RZA from the album credits seemingly dooms <i>The Lex Diamond Story</i>
    to mediocrity from the start.  Good news, though: Raekwon thankfully swerves around the R&amp;B; flavored
    synth-hop of his last outing here and, surprisingly, stumbles onto his own proverbial <i>Stillmatic</i>,
    a rather self-conscious and haphazardly successful attempt at recreating the sprawling criminology-laden
    glory of his landmark 1995 debut, <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>.</p><p>
    The album fittingly opens with a lackluster intro that tears a page from the RZA handbook to laughable
    effect: As a rainstorm pours in the background, we're treated to the poorly recited ""legend"" of Lex
    Diamond (Raek's ill-advised some-time alias here).  Fortunately, the rolling, percussive barrage of
    ""Pit Bull Fights"" quickly kicks in, and Rae shocks the world with a classically inspired verse.  The
    nostalgic album highlight ""All Over Again"" fares even better: Over a Kanye West-derived production of
    chipmunk-soul vocals, choppy percussion, and gushing strings from newcomer Mercury, Raekwon reminisces
    of his early days with The Wu: ""The Clan were one of the greatest/ We did platinum back in '93/ We was
    living who y'all trying to be/ RZA had a vision/ Instead of cooking coke in the kitchen/ He told the god
    hit the booth and start spittin'.""</p><p>
    Furthermore, on ""Missing Watch"", Raekwon and Ghostface recreate the classic chemistry they shared on much
    of <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>.  Even conceptually the track is brilliant; what could be more suited
    for a unselfconsciously ostentatious guy like Ghostface, the kind of guy who actually walks around wearing
    a gigantic gold-plated hawk on his arm, than a song about losing your watch that ""costs about a mansion""
    while out in a club?  Over a wailing electric guitars, Rae and Ghost frantically jar, ""DJ turn the fucking
    music off/ We got announcers we want ya/ To listen clear/ We just lost about a mansion in here/ If we don't
    get it back it's gonna be a problem/ Ain't nobody leaving alive until we find it!""</p><p>
    Unfortunately, those are just about the only highlights within this glut of pseudo-commercial, RZA-lite
    sonics.  ""Ice Cream Pt. 2"" features forgettable cameos from Method Man and Cappadonna, and an instrumental
    so unnecessarily syrupy that I was worried any minute Mariah Carey might break out on the track's hook;
    it's so awful, I even had to remind myself I enjoyed the original.  ""Robbery"" is a shameful posse cut,
    where Ice Water Inc. (Raekwon's new crew) spits inspired rhymes like, ""'Cause like the bomb, I'm waiting
    to blow up.""  ""Planet of the Apes"" is another bout of patriarchal insecurity-driven blather, where guests
    Capone and Sheek Louch run threats like, ""Me and chef spark massive murder/ Killings, I scramble anywhere,""
    and ""The Hood"" is built on the same clichéd piano melody that EZ-Elpee made famous over a decade ago (at
    least they decided to give Isaac Hayes' wildly oversampled ""Walk on By"" a rest).  In trying to recreate
    the energy of his earlier work, Raekwon's made <i>The Lex Diamond Story</i> a considerably better listen
    than its hapless predecessor, but its lack of creativity and innovation ultimately doom it to irrelevance:
    Who'd rather listen to this than <i>Cuban Linx</i>?</p></div>"|6906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6906-the-lex-diamond-story/|6.8|Hartley Goldstein

<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm.  Well, fanhood's not necessarily a pathology, though many who succumb to it end     up unduly regarding their subjects with aggression that suggests emotional reassignment.  To what degree     would you say you irrationally ""subscribe"" to Pajo's work?</p>
<p>Patient: That's just it, fakedoc!  Pajo's embarked on this somewhat regularly scheduled release-fest.  He     has his once-mighty label Drag City distribute a three-song blurt every month or so.  He calls the singles     an ""audio tour diary,"" but here's the real fuck-you-Charley about that claim: His band Zwan imploded, and     his solo outfit is not on tour!  So why these do two recent issues feature Travelocity artwork of a highway     horizon and a railroad crossing?</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee:  Hmmm.  Why do you feel the need to make sense of Pajo's career when your own life is     such a shambles?  Those Polaroids of your ""DNA collection"" in the garage were very distressing, to say the     least.  Hair, and blood...</p>
<p>Patient: ...and Cheerios.  Why oh why doesn't Pajo record under a more stealable name?  ""Papa M"" is as     peer-to-peer proof as ""The The""! When I try to download him, I get Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach"", Papa     Roach's ""M-80"", and Run DMC's ""Papa Crazy""!</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm.  Why don't you try to describe his appeal to me, an outsider?</p>
<p>Patient: Okay, on <i>Three</i> he ""covers"" the Celtic traditional ""Wild Mountain Thyme"", which you might     know from renditions by James Taylor, Glenn Frey, Marianne Faithful, Sandy Denny or Roger McGuinn.  At     least two of those people have been filmed ruminating behind the wheel of a sports car.  Just like Pajo's     sometime recording and touring partner's recasts of standards, Pajo changes key lyrics: here, ""lassie""     becomes ""sweet potato.""  At least he's finally crediting his covers, which is more than can be said for     his early vocal work.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. ""Patient draws false connections, and derives deep purposes from their connotations.     Suggestive of late-onset schizophrenia.""</p>
<p>Patient: After the strings and female backups of that opener, Pajo delivers an acoustic breakdown of Lowell     George's classic bit of Stuckey-iana, ""Truckstop Girl"", a nugget of freighter-core already revisited by The     Byrds.  Only it's not entirely acoustic.  At 3:33, a wailing-cellophane electric guitar solo kicks in!  As     any occultist can tell you, ""333"" was all over Madame Blavatsky's sketch of King Solomon's signet ring     hexagram.  Adolf Hitler planned his suicide on April 30, 1945, at precisely 3:30pm.  The White House     presented its Middle East road map to Sharon at 3:30 on April 30, 2003.  President Bush landed on the Abe     Lincoln for his ""U.S. Fatalities Not Even Halfway Accomplished"" speech at 3:33pm EST, May 1, 2003.  The     time around April 30-May 1 marks the celebration of the Pagan holiday Beltaine/May Day.  Did I mention     that this EP is Pajo's third in this series and that it contains 3 songs and comes after an EP called     <i>Three Songs</i>?  Jesus spent 33 years as a mortal and 3 days dead.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee:  Hmmm.  Please keep twaddling while I press this button which will alert the restraining     orderlies of their need to come and bum-rush you.</p>
<p>Patient: ""Who Knows"" is one of those great ""full-band"" Papa M tracks on which he accompanies himself on     vocals, keys and at least three echoey guitars.  His production is badass, especially the crisp drums,     reminiscent of those on his full-length <i>Whatever Mortal</i>'s requiem for <i>The Simpsons</i>, ""Krusty"".     This song pales, though, next to Four's equally layered ""Long May You Burn"", the sweet archness of which     recalls Will Oldham's ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", which, coincidentally, Oldham has redone for that     cave-in-to-fair-weather-fans album of favorites he made with Trashville sessionaros.  ""Burn"" might be the     best thing Pajo's lain down, but for the annoying loop of whispers.  With its imagery of snakes and fire     and family values, this one's ready to join the great apocalyptic oldies.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. What do you mean by ""apocalyptic oldies?""</p>
<p>Patient: Have you ever listened to ""Stand by Me""?  What part of ""if the sky that we look upon should tumble     and fall, and the mountains should crumble to the sea"" don't you understand?  Pajo's tune is ready to join     that classic.  Its video should consist of slo-mo shots of the roster-calls of baseballs teams that recently     lost the World Series high-fiving each other.  The song should be licensed out to a hipster dramedy on The     WB called <i>Ian's Creek</i>.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm in general.</p>
<p>Patient: The six-minute ""Local Boy Makes Good"" might be a rocker, but it's almost too confident and measured.     I am reminded by its outsized squalling Royal Truxery of how record stores display Pajo's EP sleeves in huge,     plastic box-set cartridges that won't fit inside my preventive girdle without suggesting prostate cubism.     ""Local"" sounds like Hayden or some such overheater.  The only song I haven't touted yet is ""Red Curtain"",     an imposing banjo slowdown that Folkways types will find sprinkled with the ashes of Roscoe Holcomb and     Sandy Bull, except for its gleefully anachronistic shout-out to The Modern Lovers.  And get a load of the     CD artwork!  A bird finger!  Pa-jo's not gonna take it!  No!  He's not gonna take it!</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Here, ""take"" this pill from a company protected in the Homeland Security Act     from lawsuits regarding mercury's link to autism.  If you like ""hard rock,"" you'll love ""hard science!""

See my assessments of     his EPs <a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/p/papa-m/three-songs.shtml""><i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Three Songs</span></i></a>,     <a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/p/papa-m/songs-of-mac.shtml""><i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Songs of Mac</span></i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/p/papa-m/single-one-single-two.shtml""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">first two tour     singles</span></a>.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm.  Well, fanhood's not necessarily a pathology, though many who succumb to it end     up unduly regarding their subjects with aggression that suggests emotional reassignment.  To what degree     would you say you irrationally ""subscribe"" to Pajo's work?</p>
<p>Patient: That's just it, fakedoc!  Pajo's embarked on this somewhat regularly scheduled release-fest.  He     has his once-mighty label Drag City distribute a three-song blurt every month or so.  He calls the singles     an ""audio tour diary,"" but here's the real fuck-you-Charley about that claim: His band Zwan imploded, and     his solo outfit is not on tour!  So why these do two recent issues feature Travelocity artwork of a highway     horizon and a railroad crossing?</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee:  Hmmm.  Why do you feel the need to make sense of Pajo's career when your own life is     such a shambles?  Those Polaroids of your ""DNA collection"" in the garage were very distressing, to say the     least.  Hair, and blood...</p>
<p>Patient: ...and Cheerios.  Why oh why doesn't Pajo record under a more stealable name?  ""Papa M"" is as     peer-to-peer proof as ""The The""! When I try to download him, I get Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach"", Papa     Roach's ""M-80"", and Run DMC's ""Papa Crazy""!</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm.  Why don't you try to describe his appeal to me, an outsider?</p>
<p>Patient: Okay, on <i>Three</i> he ""covers"" the Celtic traditional ""Wild Mountain Thyme"", which you might     know from renditions by James Taylor, Glenn Frey, Marianne Faithful, Sandy Denny or Roger McGuinn.  At     least two of those people have been filmed ruminating behind the wheel of a sports car.  Just like Pajo's     sometime recording and touring partner's recasts of standards, Pajo changes key lyrics: here, ""lassie""     becomes ""sweet potato.""  At least he's finally crediting his covers, which is more than can be said for     his early vocal work.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. ""Patient draws false connections, and derives deep purposes from their connotations.     Suggestive of late-onset schizophrenia.""</p>
<p>Patient: After the strings and female backups of that opener, Pajo delivers an acoustic breakdown of Lowell     George's classic bit of Stuckey-iana, ""Truckstop Girl"", a nugget of freighter-core already revisited by The     Byrds.  Only it's not entirely acoustic.  At 3:33, a wailing-cellophane electric guitar solo kicks in!  As     any occultist can tell you, ""333"" was all over Madame Blavatsky's sketch of King Solomon's signet ring     hexagram.  Adolf Hitler planned his suicide on April 30, 1945, at precisely 3:30pm.  The White House     presented its Middle East road map to Sharon at 3:30 on April 30, 2003.  President Bush landed on the Abe     Lincoln for his ""U.S. Fatalities Not Even Halfway Accomplished"" speech at 3:33pm EST, May 1, 2003.  The     time around April 30-May 1 marks the celebration of the Pagan holiday Beltaine/May Day.  Did I mention     that this EP is Pajo's third in this series and that it contains 3 songs and comes after an EP called     <i>Three Songs</i>?  Jesus spent 33 years as a mortal and 3 days dead.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee:  Hmmm.  Please keep twaddling while I press this button which will alert the restraining     orderlies of their need to come and bum-rush you.</p>
<p>Patient: ""Who Knows"" is one of those great ""full-band"" Papa M tracks on which he accompanies himself on     vocals, keys and at least three echoey guitars.  His production is badass, especially the crisp drums,     reminiscent of those on his full-length <i>Whatever Mortal</i>'s requiem for <i>The Simpsons</i>, ""Krusty"".     This song pales, though, next to Four's equally layered ""Long May You Burn"", the sweet archness of which     recalls Will Oldham's ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", which, coincidentally, Oldham has redone for that     cave-in-to-fair-weather-fans album of favorites he made with Trashville sessionaros.  ""Burn"" might be the     best thing Pajo's lain down, but for the annoying loop of whispers.  With its imagery of snakes and fire     and family values, this one's ready to join the great apocalyptic oldies.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. What do you mean by ""apocalyptic oldies?""</p>
<p>Patient: Have you ever listened to ""Stand by Me""?  What part of ""if the sky that we look upon should tumble     and fall, and the mountains should crumble to the sea"" don't you understand?  Pajo's tune is ready to join     that classic.  Its video should consist of slo-mo shots of the roster-calls of baseballs teams that recently     lost the World Series high-fiving each other.  The song should be licensed out to a hipster dramedy on The     WB called <i>Ian's Creek</i>.</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm in general.</p>
<p>Patient: The six-minute ""Local Boy Makes Good"" might be a rocker, but it's almost too confident and measured.     I am reminded by its outsized squalling Royal Truxery of how record stores display Pajo's EP sleeves in huge,     plastic box-set cartridges that won't fit inside my preventive girdle without suggesting prostate cubism.     ""Local"" sounds like Hayden or some such overheater.  The only song I haven't touted yet is ""Red Curtain"",     an imposing banjo slowdown that Folkways types will find sprinkled with the ashes of Roscoe Holcomb and     Sandy Bull, except for its gleefully anachronistic shout-out to The Modern Lovers.  And get a load of the     CD artwork!  A bird finger!  Pa-jo's not gonna take it!  No!  He's not gonna take it!</p>
<p>Campus Psych Trainee: Hmmm. Here, ""take"" this pill from a company protected in the Homeland Security Act     from lawsuits regarding mercury's link to autism.  If you like ""hard rock,"" you'll love ""hard science!""

What that means for listeners is a vast collection of material that, if you're a fan, never fails to delight. However, since the ""band"" was quickly dwarfed by their mutinous former colleagues in Amon Düül II, their reputation has tended to sag near areas suited more for slightly embarrassing little brothers and mix tapes you made in fifth grade: charming in their way, but otherwise best not brought up in conversation. The most renown Amon Düül record, <em>Psychedelic Underground</em>, is indeed semi-fascinating in small doses, but after a while, my attention always lapses and the ragged (albeit inspired) performances begin to morph into a formless, meandering goo.</p><p>
    Judging the original Amon Düül against their more musically inclined successors, or really any other band, is probably unfair. They might very well hold up as well as any other hippie commune's drum circle cuts would, and given the group's proximity to future krautrock legends should give them an edge. For this reason, 1970's <em>Para Dieswärts Düül</em> is a better yardstick by which to measure their purely musical contributions. Rather than compiling still more hazy footage from group space-outs, Amon Düül's third record (originally released on the legendary Ohr imprint) features actual songs, very much in a free-folk vein, but with English lyrics, melodies and basic rhythms nonetheless. If you're hoping for a relatively earthbound intro to the band, though, this is still pretty out there-- and truthfully, I still prefer modern groups like Charalambides to Amon Düül. Still, Repertoire's new reissue of their most easily approachable record reveals that even though they could pull together an album of songs when need be, they weren't necessarily songwriters, or even a terribly interesting group of musicians.</p><p>
    The lengthy ""Love Is Peace"", which originally filled all of the LP's first side, highlights the band's penchant for tuneless balladeering and the mileage one can wring from a single chord on captive acoustic guitars. The male vocalist (one of many musicians identified by name on the album, but not according to what they played or sang) reminds me of a more stable Damo Suzuki, though when the group harmonies enter during the ""chorus,"" the band could be any number of psychedelic nature-folk units, one part Donovan, another Tom Bombadil. At one point, everyone stops down to a series of echo-drenched guitar arpeggios that do lend the piece a spacy ambience, but can't quite make up for the ensuing seven additional minutes of stream-of-consciousness poetry jamming.
    </p><p>
    It's a shame, because the rest of the record isn't bad. Originally, the (almost) rocking ""Snow Your Thurst"" and genuinely alluring ""Paramechanische Welt"" made up the entire LP, but the reissue includes the melancholy single ""Eternal Flow"" and an alternate, electrified version of ""Welt"" entitled ""Paramechanical World"". Both ""Welt"" and ""World"" are examples of the kind of laid-back, sunny folk that works as both psychedelic mantra music and straightforward folk-pop, of the kind CSN&amp;Y modified into outright pop and took to the bank. There isn't much in the way of lyrics, but the moaning vocal melodies should be put in a time capsule as perfect examples of the deeply impassioned, disembodied floating lines that have yet to be improved upon since the Age of Aquarius. Whatever you think about the first Amon Düülers, they had flower power down pat.

    composer.  An idea is only as valid as the speed with which it can be documented and processed.  The art
    of collage and cut-up have been present for a great deal longer in the literary and visual arts world; it's
    only been with the recent advancement of computer technology and sound destroying/rebuilding software
    plugins that music has been so democratized.  The last tethers to the recording studios of yore have been
    severed, and the musician is free to draw inspiration from sources all around him-- the terrestrially
    mundane can be elevated to the celestially sublime; all it takes is imagination and familiarity with one's
    favorite software.</p><p>
    
    Nathan Michel is counted among the increasing number of these electronic alchemists.  Though somewhat
    obscured by his higher profile compatriots at Tigerbeat6, he's shown a remarkable penchant for daring yet
    highly listenable cut-and-paste.  There is, of course, the typical madcap grabs at popular music, as the
    ghosts of club funk and the knowledge/acceptance of IDM form the skeleton of Michel's abstracted
    architecture.  But what separates this recording from most of his contemporaries' efforts is his genuine
    sense of wide-eyed wonder, a childlike fascination with each new musical shape and juxtaposition that
    drifts by as the album unfolds. There's a palpable feeling of discovery on each track, as though Michel
    himself were delighted by every gurgle, pop and coo.</p><p>
    
    Recently, musicians operating within this genre have been increasingly unable to resist adding sung vocals,
    often to weak and or/embarrassing result.  Nathan Michel is again an exception; his vocals occupy the same
    relative space as any of the other delicate carnival attractions he's displayed.  I get the sense that he's
    less concerned with why he should be suggesting these moods and textures, and more appropriately with how
    they sound in context.  This golden rule, which should be the common denominator of electronic exploration,
    is often forgotten or temporarily ignored, in favor of progress and novelty.</p><p>
    
    ""Magellan Fields"" is a perfect example of the spontaneity and fearlessness this album evokes.  Slightly
    detuned acoustic guitars are cut and re-assembled (a la The Books) to form a comfortable nesting place for
    a gorgeous, unprocessed electric guitar solo.  It's a nice juxtaposition, but more importantly, it's
    refreshing to hear this familiar voice in a modern electronic recording.  The landscape is shifted, the
    redundant and conventional is suddenly made fresh again, and expectation is turned on its ear.</p><p>
    
    Electronic music is possibly on the verge of a serious progression.  The old classics are just that:
    wonderful historical landmarks in the pantheon of a music that demands progress and motion, even in
    stillness.  The tools are there, and composers like Michel are taking full advantage of them.  For those
    interested in bearing witness to such developments, <i>Dear Bicycle</i> is a gorgeous documentation of
    the real-life thrills that can occur when the rules of musical convention cease to apply.</p></div>"|5263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5263-dear-bicycle/|7.9|Casey Rea

    to every great glam, punk, and hard rock band of the 1970s.  The songs are irreproachably written and
    rhapsodically performed, and yet they remain incarcerated within the shackles of influence.  It's not even
    as clear-cut as a derivative band churning out songs not up to par with the icons they emulate; on past
    albums, Sloan has written better songs than anything The Rolling Stones have put out in 20 years.  It's
    nothing more nor less than comfort food: virile riffs, clunking drums, four-part harmonies, and disparate
    songs with lyrics that range from the exhaustive task of getting a girl to love you to the exhaustive task
    of getting a girl to love you for a slightly longer period of time.  As anyone who's ever lived through a
    reality I like to call ""perpetual pain and torture"" knows, comfort food is often valuable, even necessary.</p><p>
    
    There are a lot of accolades to shower upon a band that masters such difficult terrain.  Sloan has effectively
    perfected Pitchfork's ""7.0"" ranking starting with 1994's <i>Twice Removed</i> and continuing to the present.
    If one were grading the band's ability to sound like ""7.0"" rankings, they would receive a ""10.0"" with honors--
    a quintessentially inessential band.  They're always five or six feet from greatness, which is probably
    close enough for all but those with preternatural musicality or, alternatively, blindness.</p><p>
    
    Vastly unsurprisingly, <i>Action Pact</i> does nothing to develop or modify the plan of attack.  There has
    been a proposition put forth for some years now that Sloan is gradually and achingly achieving some sort of
    mighty unity between their four members/songwriters, as if they were unwilling participants in some evil
    incantation.  Allay your fears: They are here to kick out the jams, crush your square parents' scams, and
    get the hell out.  Nothing more.  Thus, the welcome and predictable opener, ""Gimme That"", is garage-pop
    that resists description because it has been described so many times before (in my first paragraph, for
    example).</p><p>
    
    Whether this album warrants purchase can be decided from the second song: The lyrics are, ""You
    know you're wrong,"" the excess is converted into cowbell, and the guitar snaps into a deceptively simple
    circle that can accumulate a few brief moments of melancholy amidst the glee.  For the most part, however,
    the riffs are addictively frivolous in the AC/DC/Aerosmith school of riffs with the laughable shuttle-launching
    production of prog (courtesy of Tom Rothrock).  Of course, when combined with torrents of three chords and
    the occasional drop of angst, this bears the potential of a muddled, second-rate pop-punk with crestfallen
    teenage vocals that comes to full bloom on ""Who Loves Life More?""  And then, carrying on a 70s tradition
    that's gone from Bowie to Big Star, there has to be one slower, more melodic piece about silence and aging
    as a respite from the rest of the album's rock glory.  ""The Rest of My Life"" fills this space admirably
    with its jangled, sing/speaking guitars and the ""I started thinking 'bout the rest of my life"" solemnity.</p><p>
    
    Sloan is not anyone's favorite band.  It's doubtful Sloan's mom even places them in her Top 10.  But there's
    simply no way to disrespect or disdain them.  They're like the <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i> of pop.  The car-crashing
    movie is about cars crashing and nothing else; the nostalgic jagged pop band, Sloan, is about nostalgic
    jagged pop and nothing else.  They're a band with their heart worn on their sleeves.  And even though that
    heart used to belong to a lot of celebrities from 1974, Sloan reminds us that stealing can be a badge of
    honor as well.</p></div>"|7249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7249-action-pact/|6.9|Alex Linhardt

    cultural studies professors label ""rap,"" there have always existed two predominantly opposed beat-making
    ideologies.  No, it's not an ""East coast/West coast"" thing (at least not outwardly), but for ages now, there
    has been a marked difference between the studio-slick, synth-heavy bounce of a Dr. Dre or Timbaland production
    and the crackling, sample-heavy boom-bap trademarked by producers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock, and Jay Dee--
    and in the war being fought for commercial radio supremacy on the forefront of hip-hop's Diaspora, the
    Timbalands have won by a landslide.  If it wasn't for Kanye West's soul fetishism, the future of popular
    hip-hop would seem to leave little room for beats made with simply a sampler and a drum machine (check
    Outkast's latest or Freeway's ""Flipside""), which leaves little else than nostalgia for hip-hop traditionalists.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, nostalgia's sounding alright these days: Some of last year's best hip-hop albums came from out
    of the vault (Pete Rock's unearthed work with InI and Deda, and Peanut Butter Wolf's classic collaboration
    on Charizma's doomed debut), and with <i>48 Months</i>, the latest record from Seven Heads' resident dynamic
    duo Asheru and Blue Black, it's looking like this year may be no different.  <i>48 Months</i> isn't a reissue
    per se-- much of the material included here has previously appeared in other forms, from treasured 12-inches
    to the group's 2001 debut, <i>Soon Come</i>-- but it manages a similar vibe as these two University of
    Virginia grads' reminisce on their college rhyming days.</p><p>
    
    Many of these cuts date back to the early one-off 12-inches Seven Heads would cut before they had the money
    to distribute Asheru and Blue Black full-lengths, but the bulk of consistently stunning material these guys
    recorded that failed to make the cut for <i>Soon Come</i> is almost inconceivable.  The 88 Keys-produced
    uptempo jazz-hop hoe-down ""Jamboree"" breathlessly rubs shoulders with more obscure undie-classics like the
    Djinji Brown-produced underground-manifesto-by-way-of-kettle-drum-workout ""The Music"" (sample lyric:
    ""Hip-hop will never leave its rightful rulers/ That's why I still make jams for B-boys and oldschoolers/
    While y'all be at the jewelers, I'm dropping gems"") and the Rhodes-laced ""Better"".  Furthermore, the
    record's opener, ""Mid-Atlantic"", flips the chorus of J-Live's classic ode to travel, ""A Charmed Life"",
    and drops in the midst of an Asheru production of wavering vibes notes, Rhodes chords, and that ol' Primo
    boom-bap to head-nodding results.</p><p>
    
    That said, there's little on <i>48 Months</i> that was overtly groundbreaking in its day; most of these
    tracks are burdened by the ""conscious"" idealism of the doomed, Rakwus-ignited mid-90s underground.  And
    yet, the record's predictability is precisely what makes it so moving; <i>48 Months</i> only falters when
    it attempts to appease buyers with ""previously unreleased"" club remixes like the lame-titled ""Soul Dub
    Version"" of ""Smiley"" and the uninteresting Seven Heads freestyle session with J-Live, Grap Luva and
    Sondia, ""How You Livin'?"".  These low-points notwithstanding, <i>48 Months</i> further fuels anticipation
    for Asheru's upcoming solo album, and serves as a hip-hop time capsule for an era when cats like Common
    Sense used to rap (not sing) and Mos Def wasn't the Hollywood go-to for a black male love interest and
    Andre 3000 was just 'Dre and everyone thought The Roots were crazy for playing it all live and Jay-Z only
    rhymed about ""Money, Cash, Hoes"" and Eminem was unknown even on the Detroit club circuit and...</p></div>"|422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/422-48-months/|7.6|Hartley Goldstein

    to you ten years after you discovered it.  That should be simple, but it can be hard to cut through the
    baggage that comes whenever a familiar artist wanders back in time: When someone digs up their old material,
    it's assumed to be more of a sentimental gesture than a substantial one-- unless they've got an even thinner
    gimmick in mind.</p><p>
    
    So it's hard not to get mired in expectations when you learn that the Mekons recorded <i>Punk Rock</i> after
    their 25th anniversary tour, and that it captures fifteen songs that they wrote at the band's birth (1977-81),
    but recorded-- some for the first time-- in the last couple years.  It's a relief when the Mekons ditch all
    ceremony and basically treat this as a lark; they aren't trying to get ""loud and sloppy"" again, they don't
    expect reverence when they cue up ""Never Was in a Riot"", and the mishmash of approaches to this stuff-- from
    studio to live recordings, mbira-colored ballads to raw shouting-- suggests nothing but a genuine curiosity
    for what kind of use they can beat out of these songs.</p><p>
    
    And these are fifteen of the most lumpen bashed-in songs the band ever wrote, hard knobby droppings that
    stomp and gnash in fast bursts.  Even the scope is stunted: The ""can't get ahead"" frustration of songs
    like ""32 Weeks"" reminds us that this band raged harder at the landlord than the Queen, and the live takes
    on ""Dan Dare"" and ""Fight the Cuts"" are pounded down like a poor man trying to squeeze coal into diamonds.</p><p>
    
    As for the slower tracks, ""Work All Week"" drops the angry stride of the <i>Quality of Mercy is Not Strnen</i>
    original, though its poignancy comes less from the lyrics than the weary way Jon Langford sings 'em: ""I'll
    work all week to buy a ring/ Extra hours to get real gold.""  ""Rosanne"" is even more cutting: ""If you have
    other men I will like them/ If they take you, come, I'll forgive you/ But if they take you away I will cry.""
    And although they didn't have any zombie songs to dig up for Sally Timms, she gets the next best thing: the
    axe murder story ""Chopper Squad"", where the words run out quickly but the banjo gets to wander into dissonance.</p><p>
    
    But even as <i>Punk Rock</i> shows that The Mekons have far better musicians today than when they were first
    fumbling around with Gang of Four's instruments, it also proves they're better songwriters.  The songs still
    have something to say, but now they sound like the musings of someone who never got out of his first basement
    apartment.  The Mekons are one of those rare bands that never stopped sounding ""punk,"" that never got slow,
    boring or sane: They just broadened their horizons.  And based on this evidence, it's a good thing they did.</p></div>"|5209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5209-punk-rock/|7.0|Chris Dahlen

    or the soon-to-be-reissued Dinosaur Jr).  For whatever reason, Eleventh Dream Day are still waiting to be
    slapped with a golden sticker of canonical approval, despite the necessary elements already sitting firmly
    in place (a disastrous major label tenure at Atlantic, distant boy/girl interplay, tons of distorted guitar,
    and general commercial unresponsiveness).  Until now, Eleventh Dream Day have been strangely excluded from
    the <i>120 Minutes</i> nostalgia club, which is stupid, considering the band's palpable influence and
    impressive fury.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, <i>Prairie School Freakout</i> eventually fell out of print, prompting Chicago-based indie
    Thrill Jockey to reissue the record, along with the <i>Wayne</i> EP, as a double package.  Recorded in six
    sweaty hours in a polluted Louisville swelter, <i>Prairie School Freakout</i> is a frantic, occasionally
    hysterical burst of irrepressible guitar rock that the band admits is ""pretty much live,"" save a dubbed
    bass note and some extra guitar squeal.  Picking up and moving past where the band's eponymous debut left
    off, <i>Prairie School</i> ultimately solidified EDD's mission as super-distorted Crazy Horse disciples
    with an overabundance of post-adolescent fervor.  And some insanely loud amps.</p><p>
    
    As sticky and pure as the transplanted living room on its cover, <i>Prairie School</i> opens with boiler
    ""Watching the Candles Burn"", a fiery guitar assault in possession of the greatest bad insult ever (""If
    looks could kill/ Here's looking at you""), and follows up with ""Sweet Smell"", another prickly guitar
    throwdown.  Nearly everything about <i>Prairie School Freakout</i> is unapologetic, but frontman Rick
    Rizzo and guitarist Baird Figi's ridiculous guitar solos are just so audaciously wanky that it's almost
    impossible not to stick your tongue out and air along with them.  Janet Beveridge Bean's drums (check her
    in Freakwater) and Douglas McComb's bass (check him in Tortoise, Aluminum Group and Brokeback) are both
    driven and perfectly able, although the throbbing rhythm occasionally seems like just an excuse to slather
    on more guitar.  Still, the hyper, overwhelming kinetics at work here are clearly the product of four
    reeling heads, and while <i>Prairie School Freakout</i> may not be EDD's most accomplished or comprehensive
    effort, it's certainly their most explosive.</p><p>
    
    The very best reissues create tiny glitches in our cultural timelines-- conceptually, they challenge music
    to supercede its original context, and to translate itself into an entirely new (and sometimes drastically
    different) artistic lexicon.  Obviously, nothing is ever realized within a cultural vacuum, but that doesn't
    necessarily deny records a capacity for timelessness-- the best albums can be appreciated both inside and
    outside of their founding circumstances.  <i>Prairie School Freakout</i> may be instantly recognizable as
    a holdover from the pre-grunge alt-rock rise, but it's still got plenty of ass-kicking glory left inside.
    Which, as far as legacies go, really isn't too bad.</p></div>"|2742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2742-prairie-school-freakout/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

    James Lavelle and his then-UNKLE co-conspirator/meal ticket DJ Shadow-- still ranks as one of the most
    anti-climactic and jaw-dropping disappointments of recent years.  Seemingly powered by Lavelle's own sense
    of self-satisfaction, the record pulled off an odd triple crown: it was overcooked, half-baked, and
    underdone all at the same time.  An epochal mix of atmospheric, experimental hip-hop and soul-stirring
    rock, <i>Psyence Fiction</i> was an unapologetic attempt to create an epic Statement of a record, but while
    long on star power and ambition, it came up short on little things like, oh, vitality, restraint, emotional
    resonance, and tunes.</p><p>
    
    From the go, <i>Psyence Fiction</i> was highly anticipated by writers who assumed it would produce greatness.
    Instead, they got lazy <i>Hello Nasty</i> melodies, <i>Entroducing</i>-outtake breakbeats, and guest spots
    that seemed mismatched with the project itself.  Despite Mike D's phoned-in wisp of a cameo, the biggest
    raspberries must go to the always punchable Richard Ashcroft whose ""Lonely Soul"" is so seeped in new age
    pandering and the drive to be Very, Very Important that, were compact discs not limited to 80 minutes, it
    would probably still be teasing us with false stops and pointlessly unspooling to this day.</p><p>
    
    Lavelle's decision to follow with another UNKLE record is laudable for its gumption if not its wisdom, but
    it's no surprise that, as much as the four-years-in-the-making <i>Psyence Fiction</i> was anticipated,
    <i>Never Never Land</i> was ignored (even by your pals at Pitchfork-- after all, the record was released
    in the UK more than four months ago).  After mostly handling the conceptual and marketing details of the
    first UNKLE record, Lavelle took a greater role in the musical conception of this disc.  DJ Shadow is out
    as Lavelle's right-hand man, now replaced by the largely unknown Richard File (though it might have been
    wiser, if only for publicity, to bring back the DFA's Tim Goldsworthy, an original UNKLE member from the
    pre-Shadow days).  And the new roster of guest stars-- among them, Stone Roses vocalist Ian Brown, Queens
    of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, and Massive Attack's 3D, plus uncredited appearances from Brian Eno and
    Jarvis Cocker-- doesn't have the same sort of A-list ring offered by the first record.  And yet, in spite
    (or because?) of all this, it's an improvement on the past.</p><p>
<i>Never Never Land</i> seems to address its predecessors' failure and Lavelle's own spiraling career right
    from the start, as a spoken-word sample (rather wince-inducingly) describes life as a series of peaks and
    valleys.  Lavelle's basic approach to music-making hasn't changed.  He still trades in texture and atmosphere,
    favoring sweeping strings, cinematic grandeur, a mix of pop sensibilities with downtempo music, and an
    obsession with science fiction.  The addition of File lends a more human quality to the tracks, largely
    because his hand guides a series of voices whereas <i>Psyence Fiction</i> had Shadow dealing more with a
    series of personalities or stars.  File's arid singer/songwriter approach and wistful vocals lend <i>Never
    Never Land</i> a breezy quality, but also little to pin down or ground the tracks.  Rhythm is almost completely
    replaced here by often drifting atmospherics, and of File's key contributions, only the graceful ""What Are
    You to Me?"" really shines.  When beats are central to the tracks-- as on the Joy Division-sampling paranoia
    of ""Panic Attack""-- they're oddly compelling.</p><p>
    
    Of the guests, 3D's ""Invasion"" chides Bush and Blair (a theme also hinted at on the Temptations-quoting
    ""Eye for an Eye"") but pulls too few punches, Homme's ""Safe in Mind"" is spacious but forgettable, and
    Cocker and Eno lend a couple of hands to a sleepy ambient exercise.  Oddly, Ian Brown's batty echo chamber
    ""Reign"" is appropriate spliff-casualty stuff and among the album's strongest tracks.  So <i>Never Never
    Land</i> is far from being either vindicating or enthralling.  It's sometimes paranoid, sometimes aimless
    head music.  This time, there weren't any UNKLE action figures or other branding attempts, just a quiet
    record that was quietly released and has (already) quietly slipped away.  It's just as well: Considering
    the buildup to, quality of, and career fallout following <i>Psyence Fiction</i>, anonymity may suit Lavelle.
    It at least positions him to regroup, crawl out of his valley, and aim once again for those peaks.</p></div>"|8358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8358-never-never-land/|5.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    Princeton Record Exchange, about three years after its release.  Fresh out of an SST-dosed high school
    experience, the Tokyo band's crystalline chamber folk, swirling incantations, and tendency to play and
    squat in Buddhist temples, abandoned churches and caves not only signaled my entrance into a more expansive
    musicality, it linked them on an aesthetic and spiritual level with the apocalyptic folk of one of my
    favorites, Current 93.  Besides the dream catching, the group's uncanny ability to turn new-age atmospherics
    into blistering psych transcendence linked them solidly with Magic Hour, another of my early obsessions.</p><p>
    
    And though I'm still patiently awaiting the collaboration with David Tibet (who, interestingly enough, is
    currently working on a project with psych pin-up boy Ben Chasny), I was floored in 1995 when Ghost and Magic
    Hour went on tour in the U.S. and Japan.  To my ear, both groups benefited.  On one side, the trip inspired
    the jingly acoustic-centered instrumentals, ""SunsetOne"" and ""SunsetTwo"", on Magic Hour's final opus,
    <i>Secession '96</i>.  It also planted the seeds for Ghost's 2000's full-length collaboration with ex-Magic
    Hour rhythm section, Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang on the best Damon &amp; Naomi record in some time.  For
    Ghost, Magic Hour's rock excess invaded their pristine habitat, leading to the mastery of a heavier,
    rock-monster strain of psychedelia on subsequent releases.  And nowhere is the rock more intense than on
    <i>Hypnotic Underworld</i>.</p><p>
    
    Since Ghost's inception in Tokyo in 1986, the band has released consistently solid, ambitious records; but
    on their seventh full-length, the sextet transcends all of their prior rock outings (though the beautiful
    psych-folk <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i> still stands as the best of their quieter material).  It's the first
    long player since 1999, and it combines the strongest aspects of its predecessors, resulting in an unbelievably
    beautiful mix of ethereal improvisation, blasted guitar (think Zeppelin), heady prog, Golden Earring swagger,
    Incredible String Band-styled naturalism, a gorgeous, slow-motion, circus-music cover of Syd Barrett's
    ""Dominoes - Celebration for the Gray Days"", and a melancholy take on Earth &amp; Fire's ""Hazy Paradise"".</p><p>
    
    Toying with the usual end-of-album epic, <i>Hypnotic Underworld</i> unfolds assuredly with the 23-minute
    title track.  Broken into four distinct movements, the first, ""God Took a Picture of His Illness on This
    Ground"", is a 13-minute improvisational piece recorded live in the studio. It's spare, discordant heterophony
    lined with intermittent percussion, electronic bursts, brushed or scraped strings, down-the-well percussion,
    and whinnying saxophone.  The instruments Ghost brings to this record-- contrabass, cello, mellotron, lute,
    Celtic harp, recorder, hurdy gurdy, tabla, 12-string acoustic guitar, theremin, flute, bouzouki, etc.--
    create strong, surprising musical landscapes.  The second section, ""Escaped and Lost Down in Medina"", a
    seven-minute, multi-layered piano-and-horn-driven epic (check out the tambourine in the left track) evokes
    the dense and sprawling work on 1994's live record, <i>Temple Stone</i>, as well as some anonymous 60s jazz
    freakout or fellow Japanese improvisors, Trembling Strain.  But it's the three-minute third section,
    ""Aramaic Barbarous Dawn"", that sets the tone for the remainder of the album.  Opening with near-cricket
    chirps and fabulously catchy O.D. oscillations, it tears into heavy guitar riffs and a rock-anthem chorus
    of voices before multi-instrumental vocalist Masaki Botah takes control, rising from the other voices, and
    arcing as triumphantly as Queen.  The opening suite is capped with ""Leave the World!"" a 22-second exclamation
    of death-metal drumming (cymbals, snare, hi-hat) and frantic keys.</p><p>
    
    Each of the seven remaining compositions locates an enjoyable moment, before tearing beautifully through to
    the other side: ""Piper""'s forlorn whistle launches into 70s jazz-rock and back; ""Holy High"" introduces
    pulsing Celtic psych; and the ten-minute ""Ganagmanag"" moves from flute swells downward into plucked strings
    a prog time-shift, echoed shouts, Botah's breathy count-offs, and tribal drums.  Everywhere, empty spaces
    are lined with powerful augmentations like tiny trills, subtle noise accents, repetitions, and rock flourishes.
    For instance, when the Barrett cover that closes the record whispers to an end, the band kicks into a
    stage-clearing maelstrom of manic church organ, vibrating shouts, gongs, bells, war drums, and wiry feedback.
    It's this sort of unexpected pomp and swagger, mixed with the solemn ambiance, that clearly separates
    <i>Hypnotic Underworld</i> from the tree-hugging psychedelia of yore.  Much more could be said, but it's
    more important to state plainly, in barest terms, that Ghost have emerged as one of the most formidable
    (and important) rock bands I know.  And <i>Hypnotic Underworld</i> is their rollicking masterwork.</p></div>"|3440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3440-hypnotic-underworld/|8.7|Brandon Stosuy

, which collects various remixes of material from Daft Punk's

 The poverty of language prevents me from fully recounting these horrors in my chosen medium, but they say a picture is worth 1,000 of something-or-other, so to this end, I've called on the doodling acumen of Harvard Lampoon artist Farley Katz in the hopes that he might supplement this tour of

  It gets worse.  ""Face to Face"" also gets a 90s Detroit acidhouse treatment fed through the Oakenfold ""through the matrix"" machine responsible for that mountain of $20 five-disc Ibiza trance box sets that line the entrance to Tower Records.  It's called the ""Demon Remix""-- and God is really pissed right now.

    mind's gustatory processors can't quite figure out what the hell to do with the combined meat/seafood
    taste-- I can't think of any other era in music that allowed the ""good band/bad producer"" gene to flourish
    the way 80s ""college rock"" did.  Cheap synths will always sound flat and dated in ways that not even the
    venerable Mellotron can match, and bad new-wave keyboard washes upstage the most earnest Velvets/Beatles/Byrds
    ripoffs.  Like the old saw goes, it's all in the mix.</p><p>
    
    I bought those Let's Active reissues last summer and was appalled: ""I used to listen to this unicorny shit?
    Ech.""  After similarly unsatisfying re-encounters with The Rain Parade, Three O'Clock, Thin White Rope,
    Vietnam Veterans, Robyn Hitchcock &amp; The Egyptians, early Screaming Trees, etc., I was ready to write the
    whole 80s neo-psych-cum-roots-rock movement off as a necessarily naive but ball-less forerunner of grunge,
    Terrastock, Elephant 6 and all the other genres and scenes of the 1990s in which bands figured out how to
    recreate-- a la Borges' Pierre Menard-- your basic psychedelic mindfuck.</p><p>
    
    So I wondered about my 2004 reaction to 28th Day, now reissued with almost three times as many songs as
    the original boasted.  I loved their Russ Tolman-produced EP when it came out on Enigma in 1985-- it was
    the record to put on when you were suffering a gray bout of R.E.M. or Dream Syndicate oversaturation. The
    band, based in the dinky California college burg Chico, consisted of a teenage Barbara Manning, her boyfriend
    Cole Marquis, and inanely coifed drummer Mike Cloward, none of whom (with the exception of Babs on a rare
    release or two) have wowed me much with their output in the two decades since.  Marquis, in particular, has
    seemed a lost cause-- his Downsiders most often remind me of The Hooters or The Call.</p><p>
    
    So what went wrong?  For their youth, both Manning and Marquis tapped into a timeless source of guitar/bass/drums
    rock, and even by wizened/jaded 2004 standards, this stuff <i>still</i> sounds as beautiful and rich and
    satisfying as it ever did.  Anthems of heartbreak, odes to inarticulatable sadness, paeans to the dead!
    Sandy Denny could have sung most of these tunes without breaking a Brit-folk sweat.  ""25 Pills"" and ""Pages
    Turn"" have to be a couple of the stokedest West Coast jangle-pop songs ever written.  And not enough praise
    can be given to ""Lost"", in which Barbara's perfect backing-vox lift Cole's preternaturally world-weary
    chorus to West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band heights of poesy.  And ""Holiday""!  And that tripped-out
    live cover of George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much""!  Why doesn't Barbara write songs like this anymore?
    It's flawless: verse/chorus/verse, an unrepentant fansong to all the bands she's ever loved, yet
    simultaneously totally unique and itself.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, this is what it sounds like to be young, gifted and white-- or at least, how it sounded in 1985.
    From the sound of it, 28th Day were intent on being the proverbial Best Band in the World, writing and
    playing from the collegiate perspective that says desire and true grit are all you need.  How American--
    how naive to all the squalor and decrepitude down the line-- except that, for a split second, as this CD
    testifies, they really were the best band in the world.</p></div>"|8248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8248-the-complete-recordings/|8.6|Philip Welsh

Yep, Jason Schwartzman is gone (though he did
    participate in much of the recording process), and Phantom Planet have recorded a square-one,
    hear-us-again-for-the-first-time, career-redefining rock album in his wake.  This, their self-titled
    stab at garage-rock celebrity, has forced me to shelve my arsenal of diversionary <i>Slackers 2</i>,
    ""California"" on Leno, <i>O.C.</i> soundtrack-ready, pop-by-the-numbers japes in favor of-- what a concept--
    actually telling you something you didn't already know about the record.  But first, let's get through
    the basics: legendary indie producer Dave Fridmann was enlisted for the project in a counterintuitive push
    to navigate the turbulent asteroid-fields of distortion, drive, and relentless energy Phantom Planet storm
    through here.  The guys do ease up somewhat in the second half, but the net result is a record of overwhelming
    deconstruction and newly explored territorial demarcation.</p><p>
    
    On their new self-titled LP, Phantom Planet are unapologetically retrofitted (current trends withstanding),
    distortion laced, galvanic, garage-rock ""with an edge.""  In fact, the lead single ""Big Brat"" is decidedly
    less instantly infectious than anything the band has recorded to date.  Driven by pummeling drum work and
    a distorted bassline, the track's linear progress is impeded only by a moment of tainted, chaotic reprieve
    before it summarily reemerges for a propulsive flourishing squalor.  Alex Greenwald's vocals have taken on
    an insouciant sneer, and for the most part (as on this track), his choruses rarely articulate any newfound
    sense of melody, but rather serve as a breaking point for his bleary-eyed, slurred and spat verses.   He
    sings with enough jaded conviction to convince you he's in no way affiliated-- nor even so much as interested
    in-- Oscar after-parties and <i>Paper</i>-sponsored celebrity get-togethers.</p><p>
    
    Songs such as the opener ""Happy Ending"" and the second half's obligatory pace setter ""Jabberjaw"" offer
    a churlish delivery of heavily front-mixed, unflaggingly bushwhacked drum and bass leads, behind which
    Greenwald's verses and subtle guitar melodies take temporary shelter from all the clutter, shifting only
    enough to flag down an austere rhythmic verse to chorus handoff.  ""Happy Ending"" is an example of the
    formula at its most virile, boasting a catchy guitar rhythmic breakdown, and ""Badd Business"" finds similar
    success through a ska-tinged (well, it's the ""tinged"" that saves it) bass beat and a quick lived group-shouted
    choral explosion.</p><p>
    
    The breaking point of the album is the slackened-guitar-strap, hair-in-eyes eruptive shoegaze toss-off
    ""You're Not Welcome Here"", where all strengths past and present fail to carry the track as a purebred
    rocker.  Like it or not, some off <i>The Guest</i>'s finest moments were a result of Phantom Planet's
    willingness to deliver unabashed pop melodicism, and while the scraps of this feast remain scattered
    about and buried within this new album, there are none on this track.</p><p>
    
    The second half of the album, then, showcases the worth of enlisting Fridmann.  Both ""By the Bed"" and
    ""After Hours"" retain the simple delicacy of Phantom Planet's earlier work, and though newly framed as
    subdued rockers, they deliver fine moments of relative retrospection and tepid seduction.  Greenwald's
    vocal delivery takes back the frontline on ""After Hours"", as he coolly chastises L.A.'s pretentious
    nightlife, smugly singing, ""You dress so nice/ You dress to kill/ They drop like flies, but/ Who's the
    funeral for?""  So, too, does the opening half of ""Knowitall"" ride this wave of retro-pulsed, softly spun
    revelation, before succumbing to an unfortunately predictable cathartic chase and burn flourish.  Thus,
    it unfolds; a band eschewing its strengths can both find success and disenfranchisement. Fortunately
    for Phantom Planet, this album offers a good deal more of the former, but even if it represents
    method-acting at its finest, I'm willing to suspend disbelief long enough to let the curtains fold.</p></div>"|6258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6258-phantom-planet/|7.3|William Morris

In the musty, cigarette-reeking studio of WDGC, projecting
    literally dozens of watts into the west suburban Chicago sky, a young boy palm-sweatingly broadcasts a
    phone interview with his favorite band to three or four listeners.  Struck with a speech impediment from
    talking to <i>rock stars</i>, the boy stammers out an Interview 101 question on how their latest album
    is selling.  ""We just sold our 200th copy,"" quips the bassist, ""meaning our certification has been upgraded
    from cardboard to styrofoam.""</p><p>
    
    The heavy-sweater was, of course, me; the band on the phone was, of course, the Poster Children.  As
    teenagers who care about such things tend to do, I had made the Posterkids my pet band, the group just
    obscure enough that I could appear one step ahead of my peers, accruing precious ""you mean you've never
    heard...!"" points with their anime-inspired album covers.  Not only were they my first interview (and
    close to my last-- I never did get very good at it), but the first time I moshed/crowd-surfed was at one
    of their shows (after being dropped off at the Wrigleyville Dog by my parents), and their <i>RTFM</i>
    album was the subject of my very first published record review.</p><p>
    
    This trip down memory lane isn't entirely self-indulgent, as the Poster Children themselves seem infected
    by the nostalgia bug on <i>No More Songs About Sleep and Fire</i>, their first album in four years.  After
    a 16-year career which peaked commercially halfway through with a video on <i>120 Minutes</i> and a doomed
    record deal with Sire, the Champaign quartet is in joyous regression, hearkening back to their Steve
    Albini-produced punk debut, <i>Flower Plower</i>.  It's hard not to call it a midlife crisis, with a
    new tight-bodied drummer standing in for a new tight-bodied girlfriend.</p><p>
    
    But lest my comparison has you imagining the musical equivalent of the bald guy in a Porsche, let me
    quickly state that the Posterkids sound positively ageless through <i>No More Songs about Sleep and Fire</i>,
    not having missed a flailing beat through the intervening years of decreasing tempos.  Temperance anthems
    ""Kate"" and ""The Bottle"" cruise through high-RPM states like a teenage straight-edge band, though the message
    packs more punch from musicians old enough to buy alcohol.  Political rage is manifested well in the brutally
    indignant riff of ""The Leader"", even if the megaphoned lyrics bring to mind the episode where the Simpsons
    join a cult more than a sports- and sex-obsessed State of the Union Address.</p><p>
    
    Themes of nostalgia and backwards time-travel coalesce with ""Western Springs"", appearing in the traditional
    Poster Children second-track single position.  Fond reminiscence of suburban homes, chemical green lawns
    and full refrigerators, the song highlights the chain-link interplay of brother guitarists Jim and Rick
    Valentin with bassist Rose Marshack, the group's vocation as computer programmers in Champaign's Silicon
    Cornfield leading to jittery rock made up of tiny complementary parts.  Highlight reel: Fretslide sirens
    ricochet around chanted vocals through ""Flag"", R. Valentin works his David Byrne impression on museum-punk
    ""Sugarfriend"", the group revisits their too-caffeinated-to-properly-shoegaze past with ""Shy"".</p><p>
    
    That the Poster Children have abandoned their tech-forward leanings (they were also the first band I saw
    sport a laptop on stage) to their ambient side project Salaryman is only half a shame; their binary skills
    were always better suited to CD extras anyhow, like the album-length commentary track that graces <i>No
    More Songs</i>.  And despite a slump in the middle of the album, overall it maintains surprisingly high
    quality, proving again that the Posterkids are subject to a shallower slope of diminishing returns than
    other bands of their era.  By looking back to their giddy-punk roots, the Poster Children swig from Cortez's
    water fountain, and in the meantime manage to throw this indie-jaded reviewer back to the good parts of
    being 15 again.</p></div>"|6437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6437-no-more-songs-about-sleep-and-fire/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

    unheard, any album bearing Daedelus' name.  The album's sound, largely sourced from old 78s, created
    one of the more unique sounds in IDM this decade, and worked primarily due to his clear respect for
    the material: he never aimed to displace so much as a crackle, fearing he might disrupt the musty spirit
    of the samples that attracted him to them in the first place.  It hasn't hurt that his sense of humor has
    always shone through as well, from last year's brief <i>Household</i> EP, to the quirky avant-nostalgic
    production behind the Busdriver &amp; Radioinactive's <i>The Weather</i>.</p><p>
    
    But something's happened.  Late 2003's <i>Rethinking the Weather</i>, a Daedelus-spawned remix of his
    work on the aforementioned Busdriver &amp; Radioinactive LP, was atrocious-- a lukewarm, unfocused (and
    unnecessary) compilation of reworked material that lacked both enthusiasm and creativity.  And now the
    guy's collaborated with Dublab's Frosty to schlep together a lazy, mindless and utterly tedious waste
    of plastic and good cover art titled <i>Dreams of Water Themes</i>.  I don't know what to think anymore.</p><p>
    
    If a song doesn't plan on having a compelling structure, the composer ought to attempt to make each moment
    of the song-- by variety, or some hook, or some curious sound-- compelling in its stead.  Adventure Time
    seem to disregard their only responsibility to the listener, namely, to spare him of boredom.  And this
    oversight is most obvious when their debut tracks reach their climax, as they often do, within the first
    thirty seconds of the song, then bask like half-wits for anywhere from three to four more minutes with
    nary an alteration.  In effect, one could digest the entirety of <i>Dreams of Water Themes</i> in a few
    minutes simply by clicking through each track's opening sequences and moving on to the next; this summary
    includes the four run-of-the-mill speech samples comprise their own tracks and add nothing to the album,
    except as a reminder that, if you bought this album, you totally got ripped off.</p><p>
    
    The bass, drum and bell groove of ""The Age of Aquariums"" is certainly promising, and nearly interesting
    upon a middle-eastern flute's entrance and the camp jazz vocal sample, but plateaus in energy and ideas.
    The Clouddead-meets-L.L. Cool J's ""Phenomenon"" novelty that is ""Whetting Whistles"" features the
    faux-intelligent wordsmithery of Pigeon John, who, whether he's being ironic or enacting a persona or
    doing whatever intelligent rappers think they're supposed to do, embarrasses himself with lines like,
    ""There's one thing I learned on the North Hills streets/ A man has to work if a man wants to eat.""  Final
    track, ""Rusty Anchors Wrestling Waves"", wanders for seven minutes so aimlessly that one can only conclude
    it serves as the grab bag for all the samples that Daedelus and Frosty couldn't work into other tracks.</p><p>
    
    ""Kappabashi"" is the only track on <i>Dreams of Water Themes</i> that doesn't suffer from a shameful paucity
    of ideas, and is actually quite good.  Here, the duo cooks up a distinctly 60s Blue Note feel around a
    minor third piano progression reminiscent of John Coltrane's ""Giant Steps"" that eventually settles into a
    blues with a spatter of strangely echoed vibraphone samples. Children play in the background every so often,
    and an honest trumpet drone eventually sounds in concordance with gargled strings and piccolos.</p><p>
    
    A rich and vibrant sound collage, ""Kappabashi"" not only comprised Adventure Time's most realized effort
    here, but also seemed to be the one in which both Daedelus and Frosty had much at stake emotionally. At
    the very least it's a tenderness that we know Daedelus is able to muster; hopefully this Adventure Time
    ship will dock for good.</p></div>"|420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/420-dreams-of-water-themes/|4.8|Nick Sylvester

    Phil Spector's mono-lith of radio dominance through Neil Young's nascent ""Expecting to Fly' and the Stones'
    ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", all the way up through schlocky 80s soundtracks for <i>Starman</i>
    and the cringing ""Up Where We Belong"" duet from <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>.  There's also an
    infamous early episode of <i>Cops</i> where he appears as the weird cokehead that lives up in the Hollywood
    Hills.  At the time of his passing, he was supposedly slated to work in the studio with Mercury Rev.</p><p>
    
    Originally an Internet-only release through Rhino Handmade, <i>Three Piece Suite</i> cobbles together two
    finished albums Nitzsche delivered to Reprise in the early 70s, only one of which was to ever see the
    light of the cutout bin.  <i>St. Giles Cripplegate</i> remains a confounding, confusedly hung mobile of
    muddy cattle skull and dry bones, made somewhere between Neil Young's <i>Harvest</i> (on which Jack banged
    piano as a Stray Gator and all but drowned out Neil in the delirious orchestration of ""A Man Needs a Maid""
    and ""There's a World"") and his crossover to soundtrack work like the schizophrenic <i>Performance</i> and
    1975's breathtaking <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>.</p><p>
    
    To the deaf ears it fell on from that coked-up era's ceiling (and to a confounded Reprise PR group who
    thought they were getting a hit like <i>Harvest II</i> some six scant months later), it was considered a
    ""classical"" recording.  But what does that mean, aside from the fact that, yes, the London Symphony
    Orchestra does appear in its entire 130 pints of glory?  The charts have an internal logic to them (at
    least in Nitzsche's fried-egg head), but the structure of the orchestra is abandoned in favor of neurotically
    emotional outbursts and chemically induced sensations of grandeur and paranoia.  Tailored somewhere between
    the most schizophrenic and idyllic of tones, <i>St. Giles</i> is suspended above the feigned celluloid of
    fantasies, these six pieces tendering tempestuous moods that swoon between lusty volatility and a vertiginous
    lushness.  Fervently sawed strings or delicately plucked pizzicatos hold the pieces afloat, and perhaps as
    a sort of pre-Boredoms number fuckery, track one is ""#6"", followed by ""#4 (For Mori)"" and so forth,
    concluding with the sixth movement, ""#5"".  The clashing portions of the symphony brass and strings are
    titanic indeed, and more atmospheric than your Grandpa's Boston Pops records, but the results are
    schizophrenic Strauss and delusional Debussy.</p><p>
    
    The unreleased record that makes up the second part of this disc would have been Jack's debut in the
    popular singer/songwriter vein so prevalent in So-Cal at the time.  Given his gradual shift to film work,
    it was birthed out of a collaboration with director Robert Downey during the shooting of his <i>Greaser's
    Palace</i>.  With a bit of imagining, it could be taken as a soundtrack of sorts, perhaps something with
    Warren Oates in it.  One where the faces tic and squint in the hot sun, and characters have rash outbursts
    of emotions every other minute or so.  Fans of <i>Sunflower</i>-era Beach Boys, Van Dyke Parks, Randy
    Newman, et cetera will have plenty to bask in here, lots of peculiar rays and haze, if not one of the
    weaker singing voices.  Thankfully, Nitzsche's producer sleight-of-hand shuffles the sounds rapidly, and
    random changes make sense like dream-logic.</p><p>
    
    Our man opens the album with a suite of sorts, smooth in his goodbye to ""Lower California"" before crooning
    out, ""I'm the loneliest fooool in the atmosphere,"" washing out to sea on his telltale tides of strings and
    piano.  What follows is some south of the border jalopy-holler on ""New Mexico"", but even that disappears
    after a minute or two.  Even ""Moodus Run"", a bluesy floppy-booted stomp, quickly dusts itself off with
    rubbed wineglasses, evaporating in the hot, hallucinating sun.  That cues up the peculiar entrance of a
    young John Fahey, doing a surprising session of slide work for the wasted ballad, ""Marie"".  After which,
    we arrive at the album finale, ""Number Eleven"", where the desert heat really gets to you.  The track's
    tom-tom drums and prairie ghost reeds are quickly obscured by a dust-storm drone of symphonic hallucinations.
    
    The End? More demos follow. Unlike what we imagine most demos to sound like, here it's all silk lining,
    with more bows and strings than most artists see in a lifetime.  Nitzsche sings all slurred again, drunk
    on strings, with weird odes to Carly Simon and the same blue-jean baby that Elton John would belt about
    on his own ""Tiny Dancer"". And Fahey reprises his role as the rambling guitar slinger, gracing ""Reno"" with
    his trembling slide.</p><p>
    
    While definitely not for every taste, there is enough weird, early 70s sound to beguile the adventurous,
    and what more could you ask from such a collection?  Or is it in the end a soundtrack for a lost film?  Or
    is it neither, just Jack Nitzsche somewhere strung out on the ether between Boston Pops and orch-pop, his
    suit casual enough for reclining at the cabana, yet dressy enough for watching as evening's odd, drugged
    shadows crawl along the streets of Tijuana.</p></div>"|5886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5886-three-piece-suite/|7.3|Andy Beta

    primitive lure of 8-bit home gaming.  Both guitarist Spencer Seim and drummer Zach Hill openly pledge
    allegiance to the dusty gray console that reared so many of us-- Seim has even logged time in a Nintendo
    cover band.  It shows.  Hella dance a highly technical, relentlessly suffocating two-step of pummeling
    percussion and breathless guitar, which, for all their torrential fervor, retain the primitive simplicity
    of a single-minded two-man sonic tag-team.  At the very least, <i>The Devil Isn't Red</i> systematically
    shakes down like it was the rocker's score to upper-level <i>Tetris</i>-- no matter how swiftly the pieces
    descend, Hella manage to drop them in place.</p><p>
    
    For most of this record, Hella run a constricted gauntlet of tangled (if slyly unified) instrumental rock
    songs.  Opener ""Hello Great Architects of the Future"" is akin to witnessing someone's garbled attempt to
    spit a string of unsorted numbers, where the mind desperately clings to pockets of order despite all
    attempts to randomly abandon them.  Upon first witnessing such pyretic tracks as ""Suistyle"" and ""Top
    Twenty Notes"", you may question the duo's ability to replicate even a single run, given the seemingly
    off-the-cuff pairings of such polyrhythmic drumming and menacing guitar lines.  But the code is pure--
    Hella couldn't get no tighter.</p><p>
    
    The title track, which features some nimble, Heroic Doses-style guitar jamming, and ""Welcome to the Jungle
    Baby, You're Gonna Live"", sport the purest rhythms, and as such, sustain longer than any of the album's
    other tracks once the disc stops spinning.  Disparate onslaughts of complex rhythms blend seamlessly
    together with wrist-breaking punishment.  And Hella shreds true even when they go digital: ""Brown Medal
    2003"" sounds like a soup kitchen riot broken up by homeless robots, while ""You DJ Parents"" draws a straight
    line to antiquated game tracking.  Without such inclusions, the record could play as a single 30-minute
    track, because for the most part, <i>The Devil Isn't Red</i> is unapologetically linear in scope.  This
    reluctance to deviate from form both solidifies the band's grip and confines its orbit.  Hella's technical
    proficiency is undeniable, but their vision is to be considered.  I, too, once considered duct-taping
    <i>Tetris</i> into my Nintendo.  My scores were stellar and my addiction certifiable.  But I thought:
    ""What of <i>Contra</i>?""</p></div>"|3961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3961-the-devil-isnt-red/|6.8|William Morris

By 1862, he had graduated from
    a French boarding school, where he's said to have excelled at arithmetic, drawing, and Latin verse translation.
    He was known to his peers as a silent boy who wrote ""bizarre and obscure"" poems.  At 21, he was described by
    his editor as ""a big, brown-haired young man, unshaven, nervous, of regular habits, and hard-working,"" known
    to his neighbors for banging out verses at the piano.  A year later, under the pseudonym le Compte de Lautréamont,
    he published the <i>Chants de Maldoror</i>. His death in 1870-- at 24, the age of your humble reviewer-- went
    unexplained and unnoticed, fulfilling a line from his last book: ""I know my annihilation will be complete.""</p><p>
    That it was, until half a century later, when surrealists started gushing over his dark wit and transgressive
    logic.  <i>Maldoror</i> excited André Gide to the point of delirium, and André Breton went so far as to call
    it ""the expression of a total revelation which seems to surpass human capacities."" <i>Maldoror</i> is the
    kind of prose work that only a poet could love, a lavish and rapt necrocopia, fleshed out with obsessive
    rigor in a spirit that can truthfully be called cruel.  If it has a plot, it is the narrator's descent into
    savagery and madness as he decides to follow the thorny path carved by his evil twin, Maldoror.  But the
    whole thing is a little too decadent and far too choppy to be paraphrased.</p><p>
    Producer Michael Montes, we are told, took the risk of making Maldoror the basis for an album of improvisations
    by New York cellist Erik Friedlander, his first solo release.  The formula is simple: put a piece of Ducasse's
    text in front of the cellist in the studio, along with a few notes, and let him compose music to match it
    on the spot.  It panned out, more or less, not because <i>Maldoror</i> was conceived as a series of songs,
    but because Erik Friedlander can do things with a cello that should have a reasonable listener fearing for
    her life.  Rostropovich one second and Rottweiler the next, Friedlander is a credible threat, working over
    the poet's perverse logic with power tools.  The results are surprisingly literal settings of the poems,
    some falling flat, some holding up to repeated listening as through-composed studies would.  Others work
    better as scores to enhance the creepy effect of the prose excerpts printed in the well-designed (if
    maddeningly typeset) liner notes.</p><p>
    We hear a single detuned tendril blossom into a blurry wall of thorns, cautioning the weak reader to turn
    around before he reaches the gate.  ""For unless he bring to his reading a rigorous logic and mental
    application at least as tough enough to balance his distrust,"" warns Lautréamont, ""the deadly sins of
    this book will lap up his soul as water does sugar.""  He makes good on this promise immediately, with a
    passage commanding the reader to grow out his fingernails so he can skewer the heart of a prepubescent
    boy, ""but not so that he dies, for if he died you would miss the sight of his subsequent sufferings.""  The
    wind starts up, but its tenor lament is interrupted by gratings and gnashings.  ""Then dogs, driven wild,
    snap their chains and escape from far-off farms,"" the poet starts in, as uneven figures come to the surface.
    ""Suddenly they stop, stare in every direction with a fierce unease, their eyes ablaze... as elephants in
    the desert look up one last time at the sky before dying, desperately lifting their trunks..."" Screeching
    octaves whine up at the moon, gasping for punctuation, sawing their own torsos with bitter fifths.</p><p>
    Dawn breaks suddenly, and it's time for some airier mind games.  ""O stern mathematics, I have not forgotten
    you since your learned teachings, sweeter than honey, filtered through my heart like a refreshing wave,""
    pluck the arpeggios as they sketch a stream of open chords.  Just as a halting melody surfaces, it gets
    swallowed by a honeydew froth, as math clears the air with ""an excessive coolness, a consummate prudence,
    and an implacable logic.""  Not for long.  A madwoman tiptoes in-- gnawing, scraping, sobbing, scribbling--
    as if driven ""like a poplar leaf blown along by the whirlwind of unconscious powers"" toward a world ""she
    glimpses again through the mists of a demolished mind.""  No sooner does she vanish than the poet begins
    a long slow metamorphosis, with an earthmelting drone offering up a fine bouquet of mud and mulch.  ""I am
    filthy.  Lice gnaw me.  Swine, when they look at me, vomit.""  As the reader looks on in horror, the cello
    drops tendrils as its master turns to fungus.  ""Seated on a shapeless chunk of furniture, I have not moved
    a limb for four centuries.  My feet have taken root in the soil forming a sort of perennial vegetation not
    yet quite plant-life though no longer flesh as far as my belly is filled with parasites,"" the poet declares
    proudly.  ""My heart, however, is still beating.""</p></div>"|3287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3287-maldoror/|8.3|Jascha Hoffman

    slow down and my ravenous hunger for Boreproduct could not be satiated.  By the time <i>Feather Float</i>
    was released in 2001, I'd had plenty of time to fully absorb <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> and the word on
    the street was that drummer Yoshimi P-We's side project carried a torch that by then had a flame a mile
    high.  That claim turned out to be false, but I still enjoyed the hell out of their oddball pop/rock, and
    I appreciated the moments when they occasionally assumed the krautrock-worshiping drive of the mothership.</p><p>
<i>Feather Float</i> was OOIOO's second record, and they've had a Japan-only release in the interim.  Now
    they return for their fourth album and Thrill Jockey debut.  To this point, OOIOO has generally been a loud,
    energetic rock band with new wave leanings and an occasional fondness for tribal stomp, but on <i>Kila Kila
    Kila</i>, experimentation rules.  Yoshimi is stretching here, trying her hand at extended forms, some new
    instrumental configurations, and compositions that depend heavily on repetition.  Perhaps realizing that
    Boredoms may be no more, Yoshimi seems inclined to use their unique flavor of psychedelia for her own ends.</p><p>
<i>Kila Kila Kila</i> is severely hampered by a painfully slow start.  The first three songs, which total
    roughly 17 minutes, go nowhere.  The title track starts the record off with a minute-and-a-half of organ
    noodling and chattering voices, and then ""Ene Soda"" is five minutes of wind chimes, a single limp power
    chord that appears periodically, and some half-hearted howling by Yoshimi.  ""Sizuku Ring Neng"" is a little
    better, with a discordant guitar riff that finally awakens the drums about six minutes in, but then the
    final five minutes just sort of simmer without reaching a boil.  These are the kind of moments the Boredoms
    use to tease the listener before a dramatic crescendo, but here they just stretch endlessly to the horizon,
    parallel lines that never combust.</p><p>
    
    Finally, with ""On Mani"" comes the first good song.  With its twitchy guitar riff, trumpet and rollicking
    drums, it sounds like an epic, crazed rewrite of an old TV Western theme.  That it eventually implodes into
    a quartet of strings working their instruments over with jagged sawtooth tones is even more inspired.
    Unfortunately, this plateau is not maintained, as <i>Kila Kila Kila</i> dips back into Dull Valley during
    ""Northern Lights"" and ""Niko Niko Niko"".  Yoshimi has some interesting guitar work here, sometimes suggesting
    the noisy logic of the dueling lines that wind through <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>, but these tracks never
    catch fire.</p><p>
    
    The 15-minute closer ""Anuenue Au"" ends on an exceptionally high note, however, delivering the kind of deep,
    expansive psychedelia that her regular band perfected.  A throbbing mess of strings, beatific harp runs
    and wordless chants, ""Anuenue Au"" is a grand spire leading heavenward.  I want to follow Yoshimi into the
    clouds, but most of <i>Kila Kila Kila</i> is heavy in all the wrong ways and strangely earthbound.  With
    any luck, this is a palate-cleansing transitional record.</p></div>"|6014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6014-kila-kila-kila/|5.8|Mark Richardson

    album whose idiosyncratic blend of hypnotic acoustic texturing, skittering lap-pop glitches and fractured
    English translated to the most widespread success, critically or commercially, this Weilheim, Germany-based
    collective had ever seen.  It only makes sense that they'd finally be ready to release a new EP at the
    start of 2004, if for no other reason than to keep themselves fresh in the public hivemind.  After all,
    their audience is surely growing restless by now-- surely, <i>Different Cars and Trains</i> would tide
    them over until the next LP.</p><p>
    
    Well, it would-- assuming it had the decency to offer new songs, which it doesn't.  Rather, <i>Different
    Cars and Trains</i>-- as hinted at by the title, pulled from the lyrics of <i>Neon Golden</i>'s ""Pilot""--
    is a too-convenient stateside gathering of scattered remixes (and one B-side) lazily culled from the band's
    import-only singles (<i>Pick Up the Phone</i>, <i>Pilot</i> and <i>Trashing Days</i>), which have been
    available on P2P networks since shortly after <i>Neon Golden</i>'s release.  This, in itself, is fair,
    since not all of us are file-trading degenerates, and even fewer of us have access to (or can afford)
    costly imports; the real problem lies in that none of these tracks recapture the affecting solitude that
    haunted <i>Neon Golden</i>'s best moments, and instead offer cold plates of commonplace, textbook IDM.</p><p>
    
    The EP starts with two surprising remixes from Console, the primary alias of The Notwist's programming guru
    Martin Gretschmann.  I say ""surprising"" because it seemed obvious enough to me that few people would be
    interested in hearing a proto-house remix version of <i>Neon Golden</i>'s bluesy, banjo-laced title track.
    Gretschmann, apparently, felt otherwise, and situated the song's lonesome Wurlitzer chords and confessional
    banjo motif atop a jarring dance pulse; hearing frontman Markus Acher pleading ""don't leave me here"" over
    this incessant disco thump decimates the song's humanity.  Console's ""Pilot"" remix (one of two reworkings
    of the song included) fares only slightly better.  The same throbbing pulse is again employed, but is
    greeted here by obligatory reversed vocal snippets and languid rhythmic flourishes that only succeed in
    overwhelming the tasteful minimalism of the original version.</p><p>
    
    The Console remixes are followed by the sole new submission on <i>Different Cars and Trains</i>, the
    instrumental ""Red Room"".  Organic flute loops serve as an introduction, followed by percussion lines
    that roll by on the usual hi-hat cymbals and clicks, while standard electronic pings are added to the
    mix.  Acher's coolly detached vocal melodies and uniquely identifiable guitar work are both sorely
    missed here, particularly given that they're such a defining element of the group's most recent sound.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>Different Cars and Trains</i>' two closing tracks swiftly rescue the disc from total
    insignificance.  Four Tet's Kieran Hebden and Manitoba's Dan Snaith offer a first-time, dream-team
    collaboration in their remix of ""This Room"".  Over a driving funk break, the duo cooks up an ode to
    all things reversed: tunnels of backwards vocals, slide guitars, percussion and god knows what else
    swarm past in blurs, while washes of the original version's Rhodes keyboards constitute the pastoral
    chill evident in both artists' solo work.  Interestingly, you can really hear who's responsible for
    what here, as the programmed jazz breaks echo those of Four Tet's <i>Rounds</i> and the dense wave of
    glassy chimes and looped vocals and instrumentation sound ripped from the same hard drive that produced
    <i>Up in Flames</i>.  The closing remix of ""Pilot"", retitled ""Different Cars and Trains"", is also worth
    putting down money for.  A contribution from Loopspool, a member of the Notwist-affiliated jazz project
    Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, the rendition cleverly transforms the thirty-second dub-break of the Notwist original
    into a blissful five-minute space-out of hazy atmospherics and pungent basslines.</p><p>
    
    These two closing tracks offer a glimpse at what might have been, had the band thought to outsource their
    remixes to artists (like, say, ones that <i>aren't</i> in the band) who might have had fresher and more
    varied takes on the Notwist sound.  Instead, <i>Different Cars and Trains</i> stands as a disappointing,
    and rather uneventful, diehards-only affair-- a cheap tease to keep you on the edge of your seat in
    dutiful anticipation of whatever Germany's experimental pop heroes decide to do next.</p></div>"|5847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5847-different-cars-and-trains-ep/|6.6|Hartley Goldstein

    ""bogus.""  In his travelogue, <i>Labels</i>, he wrote, ""It seems to me this scrap of jargon, in every
    gradation of meaning... gives a very adequate expression of the essence of modern Paris.""  Thanks mostly
    to San Dimas High School, in the seventy sum years since Waugh's trip, the term-- and bogus journeys, in
    general-- has evolved into a firm negative.  Waugh, however, <i>enjoyed</i> Parisians' ability to dismiss
    nostalgia in art and revel in the present without regard to the future, past, or public reception.  In so
    few words, the French don't give a fuck.</p><p>
    
    Because of this, American audiences continually underestimate French music, assuming our rigid filters of
    ""authentic"" or ""ironic"" apply.  Admittedly, the cultural barrier is difficult to overcome: Daft Punk's
    masked robot disco, Gainsbourg's reggae, and Phoenix's flying-V Steely Dan tribute seem cute and studied
    when compared to the supposed bleeding-on-wax of our idolized Kurts and Jimis.  As such, investing emotionally
    in ""Sexy Boy"" was akin to a Cubs fan buying playoff tickets.  Air's revered debut hit cosmetic commercials
    within weeks of its release and goes great with a dry Chardonnay.  <i>10,000 Hz Legend</i> opened with
    synthetic voices proclaiming, ""We are electronic performers,"" before 10cc choruses toyingly queried, ""How
    does it make you feel?""</p><p>
    
    Which makes the overwhelming beauty and longing of <i>Talkie Walkie</i> that much more stunning.  No longer
    are Air's sincerities lost in translation.  The album title (no, they're not being cute, that's just how
    they say it in French) knowingly acknowledges this fact.  Like the communication devices, <i>Talkie Walkie</i>
    sounds intimate, yet distant and distorted.  Hope Sandoval nailed ""Cherry Blossom Girl"" on a demo, yet in
    forgoing guest vocalists for the first time, Air unerringly personalize their songwriting.  Stomping piano
    and opiated gospel handclaps march ""Venus"" in a brutal funereal pace through keyboards that break like dead,
    pale winter sunlight and falling ice.  Tolling bells and crickets take the song into twilight.  Somehow it's
    numbingly romantic.  Atonal music boxes, Plutonian pings, and digital fugues create a Side One that evokes
    purgatorial drifting, running out of oxygen, and passing into the light after a Space Walk disaster.</p><p>
    
    The second half with the propulsive ""Surfin' on a Rocket"", whistling ""Alpha Beta Gaga"", banjo-laced
    ""Biological"", and the Japanese imperial garden suite, ""Alone in Kyoto"", reconstitute Brian Wilson's surfing
    symphonies through Bowie and Eno's Berlin flipsides.  Nigel Godrich, rather than supplying his default clean,
    shimmering production that can homogenize artists such as Beck, Travis, and The Divine Comedy, betters some
    of his Radiohead A-game here.  The album's chilling resonance is due in part to Godrich's anagogical recording
    of minimal instrumentation and digitally etiolated detail.</p><p>
    
    Being the good Parisians of Waugh's estimation, Air load <i>Talkie Walkie</i> with images of moonbase love
    and alien encounters that neither mocks the comically misjudged visions of yellowed science fiction, nor
    longs for some utopian future.  Air creates the alternate now, an environment that begs escapism without
    denying humanity.   <i>Talkie Walkie</i> may mollify Air's overt Frenchness, but should in no way be deemed
    a sudden opening of the soul.  In their insular way, Air have always been soul.  They've simply grown more
    cosmopolitan, and not just in their solubility with vodka, Cointreau and cranberry.</p></div>"|81.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/81-talkie-walkie/|8.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

In the late 60s, an apostrophe-less Groovies was fending for its life amidst the roving     psychopaths, hallucinations, and trampled corpses of San Francisco.  When the more popular drugs made you     whisper to invisible snow-queens and crumple into fetus-like stupors for days on end, there was no place     for California's loneliest Elvis-loving, hormone-injected, primordial punk freaks.</p>
<p>Underrated, but undeterred, the band (fronted by Roy Loney and guitarist Cyril Jordan) hobbled together a     couple thousand dollars in 1968 and self-released their debut-- a seven-song, 17-minute 10-inch called     <i>Sneakers</i>-- and waited for the throngs of sunglasses-worshiping teenage girls.  To no avail.  When     you call your band the Flamin' anythings, there is an intrinsic contract drawn up with the listener.  In     return for the listener's undivided attention, the Flamin' band henceforth must muster snarling, leathering     pinnacles of claustrophobically entwined guitar riffs and brutally overwrought vocals.  At this early stage,     the band simply couldn't quite contend with the ambition of its name.  Nevertheless, they did come bearing     three guitars, knowledge of every genre since the 20s, and enough cigarettes to fill their gloriously tight     pants tenfold.</p>
<p>It was apparently ammunition enough to forge one truly great song.  ""Golden Clouds"" begins with all the     brio of a tempest and recedes into a smacking bar-band rhythm as Loney ends every line with a twanged warble     he flagrantly copped from every Sun Records song he'd ever heard.  If that musty analogy is going to be     brought up, let's do another one: If the Groovies performing on <i>Teenage Head</i> and <i>Flamingo</i> were the American Rolling Stones, ""Golden Clouds"" is the British Rolling Stones.  It's perhaps the single     greatest defense of blatant plagiarism ever recorded.</p>
<p>Confusingly, then, the rest of <i>Sneakers</i> makes for some of the most willfully diverse stylization in     the Groovies' repertoire.  ""The Slide"" is sung with such smoothness and schmaltz that Loney sounds like he's     auditioning for The Drifters.  ""Prelude in A Flat to Afternoon of a Pud"" could qualify as circus jazz with     its chugging harmonica and gallivanting guitar.  The most surprising element is the band's penchant for 20s     and 30s burlesque.  The inflection on ""Love Time"" and ""Babes in the Sky"" is alternately leisurely cabaret     or a flapper dance.  They may be gimmicks (along with the bluegrass ""My Yada""), but they're gimmicks that     are played fast enough, filthily enough, or tight enough to clearly be the work of a band that was about     to hit its prime.  How could a song with the line, ""L-O-V spells 'love time'"" be anything less than an     ignorant rock riot masterpiece?</p>
<p>For added value, <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i> have been tacked on to this reissue.  Thus, a forced     condensation of the band's trajectory: Got signed by Epic, released one great record, got dropped by Epic,     toured with the MC5 and The Stooges, released two sell-all-your-posessions-and-buy-1,000-copies records,     fell apart in a pit of despair and anger, and, like all great bands, went to fix their lives in Europe.     Always a bad idea.</p>
<p>Loney was out, Chris Wilson was in, and the band set up in Rockfield studios in Wales with neo-50s rocker     Dave Edmunds as producer.  <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i> is four covers and three originals, and it just     might be the best rock <i>album</i> of '72.  After the goofily adolescent <i>Sneakers</i>, the springing     brass accretion of ""Married Woman"" screams sophisticated ingenuity.  It's everything you need in a rock     song: the nonchalant vocals of a true rebel, lecherous lyrics, and a bashing band that chars itself into     slow, circuitous remains by the song's end.  This might be the worst song of the bunch, and it still slides     its way into the hall of fame.  Condolences should be given to Chuck Berry, The Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis,     and all those other founders of modern music; the simple fact of the matter is that the covers of ""Get a     Shot of Rhythm &amp; Blues"", ""Little Queenie"" and ""Tallahassee Lassie"" are likely the best out there.  ""Little     Queenie"", in particular, starts with dusty metal inertia and whips into a frantic strut with that ""go, go!""     chorus.  It's sort of like all of <i>Reefer Madness</i> condensed into three minutes and pumped into your     blood.</p>
<p>The Groovies' original songs are somewhat perplexing in this company, eschewing the shredded majesty of 50s     rock 'n' roll in favor of smoother production and slower, more elegant melodies.  The individual songs barely     need to be mentioned because most of them later appeared on 1976's power pop classic, <i>Shake Some Action</i>,     and they've been venerated and covered by everyone from The Dictators to Yo La Tengo.  ""Slow Death""'s cowboy     menace bends and slides over absurdly depressing lyrics.  It's suicide with handclaps and a ""yeah, yeah"" chorus.     ""Shake Some Action"" is the definition of a hastily defined genre known as fatigue-rock; the lyrics weakly     try to rattle the singer's stultified weariness.  There is simply no way to deny the cool simplicity of a     lyric like, ""I will find a way/ To get to you someday,"" particularly when it's choired and on top of the     thin line between self-annihilation and euphoria.  Somehow, the Groovies even mined this desolation to find     one of the best prancing arena-rock choruses to ever grace a record.</p>
<p>It's difficult to tell whether the mixes from this session actually differ all that much from the ones on     <i>Shake Some Action</i> or whether it just feels that way in the context of the old rock standards.     Regardless, the sequencing of <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i> shows that the transition from juvenile early     punk to pop maestros was not quite as sudden as it seemed.  That said, two of the seven songs are familiar     to any <i>Shake Some Action</i> enthusiast, and ""Slow Death"" is probably familiar to everyone else whether     they're conscious of it or not.  Still, <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i> is as good a place as any to start a     budding Groovies infatuation, as it marries their early grime and later tunefulness in one of the essential     expatriate rock sessions of our times.  That alone, however, isn't a reason to seek out this record.  Instead,     perhaps consumers should focus on how it's the best seven-side single ever released.  True, in the context     of the immaculate songwriting and professionalism of <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i>, the bizarrely added     <i>Sneakers</i> can't help but seem inessential.  Still, this is more the fault of the former than the     latter.  Pretty much any album you paired with <i>The Rockfield Sessions</i> would end up sounding inferior.</p></div>"|11744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11744-sneakers-ep-the-rockfield-sessions/|7.5|Alex Linhardt

    Saturdays, all searing anger, deafening noise and violent flash.  The visceral power of their first decade
    of work is undeniable-- they had christened themselves Einstürzende Neubauten (German for ""collapsing new
    buildings"") and they made music to match the moniker, employing scrap metal and dental equipment to give
    it the necessary sturm-und-drang.  After releasing a series of lackluster albums in 1990s which lost the
    immediacy of their prime work, the band made an impressive rebound with 2000's <i>Silence Is Sexy</i>, and
    they've all but perfected the more restrained approach begun on that album with <i>Perpetuum Mobile</i>:
    Where once they embodied bursts of malevolent violence, they're now something more akin to a different
    kind of murderer: the long-term, reclusive serial killer, whose neighbors find to be the quietest, most
    polite person on the block, but who has secretly buried 48 bodies in the woods behind his house.</p><p>
    On the whole, this is the quietest Neubauten album to date, frequently lowering to a mere whisper, but
    don't let this fool you-- no album this band has made in the past has bristled with so much latent violence
    or been haunted by a more palpable sense of unseen menace.  Bargeld sounds unbelievably relaxed and calm,
    drifting amid music that violates your sense of what is harmonically and rhythmically decent, and the two
    main culprits of this are the percussion and programming.  The album is precisely rhythmic, but mixed into
    the fairly straight rhythms are noises that scrape and warble, pitches that hide in unpleasant frequencies,
    and of course, Bargeld's measured German sing-speak.</p><p>
    All of these elements combine to create such a seamless mix of the mundane and the sinister that it can't
    help but raise the hairs on your neck.  This approach is used to devastating effect on ""Selbstportrait mit
    Kater"", the verses lurching along on a repeated bass note and scattered percussion as Bargeld delivers his
    lyrics on what sounds like the verge of anger.  Instead of exploding, though, he simply allows the music to
    do it for him, in the form of some nasty, metallic slamming noises that rhythmically frame the subtly
    delivered vocal hook.</p><p>
    The sprawling, 14-minute title track is incredible, clinging to a minimal electronic beat as the music
    mutates from quietly melodic passages to outbursts of metal percussion and into a terrifying verse backed
    primarily by the high-pitched vocal screech tones that Bargeld seems uniquely able to perform.  The movement
    between extremes is kept unpredictable-- segments vary in length and intensity for maximum nerve-racking
    effect.  Unfortunately, <i>Perpetuum Mobile</i> doesn't maintain this sinister tone for its entirety; the
    polite electropop of ""Youme &amp; Meyou"" is especially lightweight, and sounds desperately out of place, too
    consonant to effectively meld with anything else here.  Still, for the most part, this is a strikingly
    effective album, one whose dread and foreboding stick like residue after it comes to a halt in the player.
    These guys may not have the non-stop intensity they once did, but they've replaced it with a tension that's
    just as effective.</p></div>"|2698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2698-perpetuum-mobile/|7.5|Joe Tangari

For the past six
    years, she's provided the mellifluous vocals for some of Matthew Herbert's more recognized works.  Her
    warm, full-bodied tone decorated both <i>Around the House</i>-- one of the more pleasant surprises on
    Pitchfork's Best of the 1990s redux list-- and the more jazz-inflected <i>Bodily Functions</i>, which
    should be a lock to place on a selection of this decade's top albums.  This year, Herbert and Siciliano
    stick to their familiar roles but this time she gets her name above the title on her debut solo record,
    <i>Likes...</i>.</p><p>
    Herbert has put a lot of recent effort into patronage: he's focused energies on his Accidental Records
    label (which recently issued the Matthew Herbert Big Band LP <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i> and the well-received
    <i>You Are Here</i> compilation) and has now assisted with production on <i>Likes...</i>, although the
    inspiration and credit should go to Siciliano, who recorded the album in her new self-made studio.  Still,
    it (thankfully) doesn't fall far from the tree that Herbert and Siciliano planted together years ago:
    Sometimes sparse and always delicate vocals, clicking and whirring beats, the occasional funeral parlor
    brass and austere strings.</p><p>
    Despite Siciliano's touch, it's the sonics that often take center stage on album highlights such as ""Same""
    and second single ""Extra Ordinary"".  The all-too-short interlude ""Canes &amp; Trains"" is reminiscent of the
    fantastical mix of percussive clatter and top-hat-and-tails of <i>Dancer of the Dark</i>, and it segues
    well into the martial, back-alley rattle of <i>Walk the Line</i>, Matthew and Dani's most Tricky/Martina
    moment to date.  The lowlights come with the straightforward electro-pop track ""She Say Cliché"", and ""All
    the Above"", featuring Herbert's Icelandic protégé Mugison, who proves an underwhelming match for Siciliano's
    vocals.  A lounge version of Nirvana's ""Come as You Are"" could have been gauche, but Siciliano draws out
    the song's already languid tones with far-away sighs and the rather touching emphasis on the word ""memory.""
    It's the same trick that the Scissor Sisters do with ""relax"" on their <sc>Frankie Says: ""Comfortably Numb""</sc>
    cover, but with a quite different effect.</p><p>
    On <i>Likes...</i>, the overall effect is much as one would expect from Siciliano and Herbert.  It's a
    record that, at its most atmospheric, hints at the Northern European noir of Nico, but splits the difference
    between the former VU chanteuse's early singer/songwriter work for the Immediate label and the darker tones
    of her 70s solo efforts.  The middle ground may not be as captivating or unexpected as either extreme would
    have been, but there's still plenty to here to recommend.</p></div>"|7732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7732-likes/|6.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Credit superstar producer T-Bone Burnett's archivist instincts, or the lunatic     collision of an Appalachian folk song and George Clooney's shameless mug-- either way, <i>O Brother</i> is     single-handedly responsible for tugging the soundtrack out of its premature grave and granting American     folk its first truly popular revival.</p>
<p>For the <i>Cold Mountain</i> soundtrack, Burnett has burrowed back into his yellowing sack of nuggets and     emerged with a fistful of gritty, mid-19th-century classics and long-lost Americana.  The resulting record     combines original orchestral scores, contemporary shape-note singing, covered obscurities, and freshly     written songs, all held in place by the commercial super-spike of Jack White (and aided by the big-name-songwriter     credits of Elvis Costello and Sting).</p>
<p>White has always been vaguely preoccupied with his ever-important (if occasionally unclear) tenets of     authenticity, and his work on <i>Cold Mountain</i> is an oddly telling mirror to The White Stripes'     throwback blues-rock parade.  In addition to being recruited for musical toil, White was also cast to     portray a traveling Civil War-era troubadour in the film-- and his contributions to the soundtrack are     guised in the exact same kind of otherworldly, hat-and-backpack costuming that his bit part openly demanded.     No matter whether you credit White's sonic role-playing to his wider musical agenda (see the Stripes'     incessant Delta re-appropriation) or just to plain old method acting, <i>Cold Mountain</i> is still a     pretty convincing turn: Gone are the wild, fluttering yelps of his Stripes work, replaced by scrappy,     talking-blues squeaks and gruff whispers, and his trademark guitar noodling has been mercifully superceded     by scraped, tinny strings and perfect bluegrass picking.</p>
<p>Performing a handful of traditional cuts and one original, White is ably backed up a dream-team of dusty     country players, including Dirk Powell on banjo, Mike Compton and Norman Blake on mandolin, and Stuart     Duncan on fiddle.  White opens the record with ""Wayfaring Stranger"", a tortured traveling ballad (previously     taken on by Johnny Cash, Sam Bush, Alison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris); while White's homeward-bound moans     are sometimes disappointingly resigned, the trembling acoustics of his bandmates are more than sufficiently     agonized, and ""Wayfaring Stranger"" is as inviting as it is defeated.  White's lone original, the sweet and     acoustic ""Never Far Away"" also benefits from the kind of soft, dynamic backing that Meg White just can't     seem to provide for him (and sees more of Norman Blake's mandolin, with cello by Nancy Blake).</p>
<p>White's involvement may be causing the most commotion, but it's the Sacred Harp Singers of Liberty Church     that deserve all the tongue-wagging attention.  Using traditional shape-note harmonies (a trend efficiently     documented by Smithsonian brainchild Alan Lomax, and oddly resurrected last year by Portland indie-pop     quartet The Joggers), the Liberty Church Singers warble in perfect, a cappella four-part harmony, their     collective bellows bouncing up and down between each of the four shape-notes.  Meanwhile, the Sting-penned     ""You Will Be My Ain True Love"" is impressively voiced by bluegrass matriarch Alison Krauss, although her     able pipes do little to transcend the over-arranged sappiness of the song itself, which features Sting on     backing harmonies and a few too many weeping strings.</p>
<p>Krauss' pairing with Elvis Costello, on the Costello-written ""The Scarlet Tide"", is far less overstated: A     pretty (if ultimately benign) piano melody and some subtle cello rub quietly, backing up Krauss' breathy     coos.  Composer Gabriel Yared also contributes four sweeping, orchestral breezes that pile up on top of     each other at the bottom of the record; while appropriate for the film, they're unnecessary and cumbersome     on the soundtrack, upsetting the dirty, proletariat posturing of the album's other cuts.</p>
<p>While the chances of the <i>Cold Mountain</i> soundtrack matching the success of <i>O Brother</i> are pretty     scrawny, it's still an oddly compelling collection, with a small handful of traditional cuts finally getting     the wide release they deserve.  Far more interesting than a Jack White vanity outlet, the record is an     engaging-- if inconsistent-- dip into grubby, pre-radio pop.</p></div>"|8766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8766-cold-mountain/|7.1|Amanda Petrusich

    roster that-- oh my god-- enjoy the music of the Grateful Dead.  Personally, I go for <i>Anthem of the
    Sun</i>, while Rob Mitchum's favorite era is '77-'78, featuring the Godcheauxs.  Heck, the Richardson
    household even owns that atrocious disco album the Dead made.</p><p>
    
    So we love us some freedom rock, man!  While we can't quite get with either Rat Dog or The Dead (and only
    Mitchum would be so depraved as to trade Phish concerts), we've had to look for our vital instrumental
    noodling outlets elsewhere.  Following a two-disc set recorded in Europe (ker-splat! goes the ice cream
    cone in your rainbow afro) none could be finer and weirder than the loose and sprawling collective of
    Oregon, New York, and DC weirdoes that by the <i>nom de plume</i> of Jackie-O Motherfucker. They've been
    jamming cross-country and swapping tapes of live shows through their U-Sound Archive for a few years now,
    and news of this two-disc reissue of vinyl-only releases from the turn of the twenty-first century had us
    filling balloons with hippie crack and suede-brushing Birks in anticipation.</p><p>
    
    Originally shoveled into duct-taped sleeves from the compounds of Thurston Moore and Byron Coley's esoteric
    Ecstatic Peace! label back in 1999, <i>The Magick Fire Music</i> coasts out on the slow, simmering waves of
    a Zildjian Cymbal Ocean, drifting for 15 minutes of bliss and never-ending nerve-melt on the opening
    ""Extension"".  Ten players rotate in and out of the mix, the group mind honed in on the disengaged mantra-riff
    and a slow expansion out on the rolling toms. The piece evolves like some great barrier reef, beyond the
    usual group sounds that get clumped with Godspeed You! Black Emperor.  Yet they don't really scrabble about
    like the shadowy black ids of New York's No-Neck Blues Band, either (who they always get lumped with, for
    being American and weird), instead moving as one before dying with the utmost group-grace.</p><p>
    
    ""The Cage"" and ""Second Ave. 2AM"" pluck a half-parched guitar twang from the desert dust of Ennio Morricone
    and utilize them to very different effect.  The former stays with the dried hide of the riff, chewing at
    it and finally reaching a tremolo-ing state with scratched record gasps (or are they barks?) by the
    eleven-minute mark.  The latter piece proceeds to beat the western guitar lick like a dead horse, driving
    it into the ground with free horn skronks that make lips crack.  Underneath the lurching gait of a wandering
    horse clomps a trip-hop anomaly that lopes against the clattering battery of drummer Jessie Carrot.</p><p>
    
    As the double LP plays out, a comfortable pattern gets set.  Simple textures, either from reverberating
    guitars or primitive electronics set the mood, and the remainder of the band buoys it as best they can,
    more content to keep the moment aloft than to necessarily move things forward.  There's no need to go
    somewhere necessarily, so why not just enjoy the moment?  For ""Jugband 2000"", an awkward drum-machine and
    disquieting reverb magnetizes the digital detritus of snipped voices and CPU bloops.  Two minutes in, a
    swell of guitar and cloudy Gamelan clangs provide lift, but the background ranting remains, neither
    enunciated nor erased, and it keeps the piece from either enjoying sweet drift or making a concrete
    statement.  ""Quaker"" similarly meanders like blown cone smoke in a dorm drum circle, the textures of thumb
    piano, jaw harp, toms, a gurgling rice-pot, and surf guitar froth slowly mingling with some spacy FX for
    a prolonged (albeit mild) buzz.</p><p>
    
    While plenty of other JOMF jams take anywhere from five-to-eight minutes to start cranking, <i>Wow!</i>
    (originally a UK release from 2000) starts off keyed-up. ""Black Squirrels"" gets built with pecan clacks
    and nutty vinyl scratching, promptly riding a nicked Appalachian lick up Himalayan heights.  As opposed
    to waiting eight-to-ten minutes for peaks and plateaus, it gels better than horse hooves into a jubilant
    jamboree between the Owsley acid-spritzing guitars of Tom Greenwood and Jef Brown.  Billy Crowley even
    frisbees brief thumps of a house record into the percussion dogpile for Bacchanalian good measure.  The
    reduced group (for the most part a septet) whirls in glee, spinning a good nine minutes before plunking
    down into the kalimba-like opening of ""Wow"", which pokes percussion about into other folk forms.  It never
    literally lives up to its name or the dizzying heights of its predecessor.  Instead, it shivers and wheezes,
    two Dirty Threes taking a pack-a-day breather.  Their shared vision gets beat-ific three-quarters in, though,
    gleaning light lavenders glimpsed at dusk before Sonic Youth's <i>Bad Moon</i> rises.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Love Horn"" indulges a bit too much in their love of newbie free jazz, the horns squawking out some
    sympathetic textures that verge on noxious.  For over two hours, though, they bring the jams, and this
    reissued set will make any head most grateful.</p></div>"|11763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11763-wow-the-magick-fire-music/|8.4|Andy Beta

    revival.  Granted, they weren't ignored-- each of them scored a few reviews and a handful of well-deserved
    praise.  But by the time David Banner got screwed and chopped, the ""Meringue Remix"" of ""Get Low"" slipped
    onto the radio, the Soundmurderer + SK1 12-inches received proper release, and Tigerbeat6 released a handful
    of records that didn't treat jungle and drill sounds like aural raspberries, it became more clear that these
    were a couple of the most under-told stories of 2K3.</p><p>
    
    When it comes to the ragga-jungle revival, the place to start is still where the present meets the past:
    Soundmurderer's <i>Wired for Sound</i> features a trio of breakneck mixes of some of most ruff, masculine
    and steely-eyed moments in first-wave ragga-jungle.  A tall tale of ragga-jungle's history, <i>Wired for
    Sound</i> re-cast its rhythmic innovation as all peaks and no valleys, a frenetic series of whipsmart
    neck-snapping drumbeats which, in the right hands, isn't actually that much of a fib.  Fittingly, one of
    the producers who most heavily features on <i>Wired for Sound</i> is Remarc, who in 1995-97 released ten
    singles of uncanny power and elasticity on labels such as the legendary Suburban Base, Dollar, Kemet,
    Labello, and White House.  <i>Sound Murderer</i> collects most of those tracks-- many of them on CD for
    the first time-- on a well-deserved Remarc full-length. (A second compilation of Remarc's work, <i>Unreleased
    Dubs 94-96</i>, will be released on Planet Mu on CD and 4xLP in late spring.)</p><p>
    
    Despite the variety and a near-chaotic intensity of Remarc's re-wiring of the empty promise of rave to the
    sinisterism and dread of darkcore, the origin of each of these tracks lies on the flipside to the Winstons'
    1969 top 10 soul hit ""Color Him Father"".  Like many junglists, Remarc built his tracks over the ""Amen"" break,
    which is derived from ""Amen Brother"", a break that is sort of to jungle what ""Apache"" is to hip-hop: perhaps
    <i>the</i> integral strand in each sound's genetic code.</p><p>
    
    Far from the IDM-leaning of jungle's over-ground, more white-washed head music, these are tracks of urgency
    and dread that appealed to/soothed the paranoia of too many years of drug use as much as it did to embody
    the thrill of communicative dance music.  And yet, it's more sonically stuffed and sophisticated than both
    its spliff-cloud brethren and the drill-n-bass snobs who later delighted in rubbing sludge over melody rather
    than marrying them to any great effect.  Among the few Remarc classics missing from this comp is perhaps the
    most extreme, the cold sweat of ""Ricky"", a track so overcome by drug-induced paranoia that it sounds like
    an anxiety attack on acetate.</p><p>
    
    What is here includes some of the most deft manipulations of rhythm of the jungle era, from the drums,
    sub-bass and congas in your face of ""Unity"" to the self-explanatory yet still funky title track to already
    exalted classics such as ""R.I.P."" and ""Thunderclap"".  The snaps and skitters of Remarc's robust breaks
    color his tracks without pulverizing them, whether laid alongside the bravado of Jamaican patois or gunshots
    or more unexpected and docile treats such as or Spaghetti Western whistling or delicate string lines. After
    years of jungle being associated with too much of the latter and not enough of the former, this is a welcome
    resurrection.</p></div>"|6905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6905-sound-murderer/|8.8|Scott Plagenhoef

Unable to reconcile the
    strains of Joy Division's growing fame and impending tour of America with the stringent, idealistic demands
    of his own artistry, faced with a lifetime at the mercy of his worsening epilepsy, and dealing with a
    divorce from his wife less than a month earlier, on the morning of Sunday, May 18th, 1980, Curtis chased
    a viewing of Herzog's tragic <i>Stroszek</i> with liquor, pills, and finally hanged himself.  Many artists
    have suffered untimely deaths, but few have been so broadly perceived as having their greatest achievements
    yet to come, as Curtis was.  That his plight was in some ways so apparently easy to relate to-- finding the
    dreams of fame he harbored as a working-class youth in Macclesfield tarnished as he came closer and closer
    to the reality of stardom-- makes it nearly impossible to separate his brief life from his work; that his
    plight was simultaneously so alien-- few people can understand the pain of contending with such a permanent,
    crippling disease-- makes it harder still.  That is how the story of Joy Division ends, and nothing that
    they have ever produced has been, or will ever be, viewed outside that context since his passing, nor
    should it; Curtis killed himself, in part, for his music.</p><p>
    
    With the release of <i>Refractured</i>, presumably the ultimate live document, such considerations are even
    more important; his death also ensured that few of Joy Division's fans would be able to experience the band
    apart from their modest studio output.  Live, they played barely a hundred shows, only a dozen off England's
    shores, fewer of which were well recorded enough to endure-- and thanks to the outstanding, groundbreaking
    production of Martin Hannett, Joy Division's studio output is leagues removed from their monumental live
    presence.  Hannett applied exceedingly modern (for the time) digital filters to their mixes, fueling the
    sense of alienation inherent in Curtis' bracing, anxious lyrics with even more distance.   His pioneering
    use of delay made Joy Division's barbed, jarring threats seem impossibly remote, like atrocities viewed
    through the lens of a camera.  Seen in the morning paper, the awful scenes captured in photos may resonate
    emotionally, but never nearer than arm's length.</p><p>
    
    That illusion of removal is a potent counterpoint to the emotional turmoil of <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, and
    even moreso on <i>Closer</i>'s grim march, where it becomes a necessity; as mercurial and aloof as Curtis
    often was, even at a distance, Joy Division's brutally confessional nature is almost overwhelming.
    Nevertheless, Hannett's production techniques practically made him a fifth member, to the point that
    <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> was all but disowned by the band in spite of his interference.  The raw urgency
    of their live performance had been replaced by a bitter, reigned-in tension, equally gripping, but not
    what they set out to record; not until 1999 was an attempt made to properly master and document a live
    performance and finally balance their album presence with the unfettered immediacy of the stage.</p><p>
    
    Factory's choice, however, was the bafflingly low-quality <i>Preston Warehouse 28 February 1980</i>;
    although it showcases Joy Division near the peak (and, sadly, the end) of their career, it has been
    described by band members as ""the worst fucking show we ever did,"" due to numerous technical mishaps.
    A far superior performance at Les Bains Douche in 1979 soon followed (along with some material from the
    January 1980 performance in Amsterdam's Paradiso), though, and comes very close to suggesting the real
    power the band commanded onstage.  The concerts are uniformly excellent, regardless of wildly fluctuating
    sound quality between discs and some redundancy among the sets; all recordings are also readily available
    elsewhere-- the original <i>Fractured</i> box, released in 2001, already compiles <i>Les Bains</i> (with
    the extras from Amsterdam, already a bootleg old enough to have crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower) and
    <i>Preston</i>.  The originals were just barely a step removed from posthumous cash-ins but served a need.
    However, to box up widely available material for more money, as <i>Refractured</i> has done, with the pointless
    inclusion of a t-shirt (an awful iron-on of the <i>Refractured</i> logo) and a small, reprinted concert
    flier circumnavigates greed and sets sail straight for stupidity.  As a final incentive, the box also comes
    with a hand-signed and numbered note from whoever runs Alchemy calling you a sucker.</p><p>
    
    That said, the recordings themselves are remarkable portraits of what an entirely different creature Joy
    Division became onstage, and for anyone who isn't intimately familiar with them beyond <i>Closer</i>, or
    <i>Substance</i>, or even the limp, isolated live inclusions on <i>Still</i>, this collection is simply
    incredible.  Fundamentally, Joy Division's inspiration was drawn from the aggressive spirit of punk-- a
    fact made stunningly evident in their live recordings as they relentlessly tear through sets.  Their
    oppressive testaments to loss, reflection and regret are left at the studio; live, Joy Division embodied
    fiery condemnation, Curtis' every scream daring the audience to try and share his burden, laughing as they
    (of course) flinch at the prospect.  His on-album brooding becomes pure catharsis when given an audience
    upon which to inflict it; Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook's measured interplay becomes a deafening, numbing
    thrash, and Stephen Morris' drumming, in particular, is absolutely unstoppable.</p><p>
    
    Without exception, every minute of every song presented here is performed with passion and energy, and much
    of that starts with Morris; even the more resigned tracks are made ominously transient from his intensity,
    and the aggressive numbers become truly suffocating.  ""Love Will Tear Us Apart""'s breathless fatalism is
    so much more tenuous, sped up dramatically and embellished with a desperate crescendo at Les Bains,
    highlighting some of Morris' most impressively, and frantically, improvised fills.  His skittering hi-hat
    sets a blistering pace for ""Transmission"" in Amsterdam as Sumner's slashing guitar cuts in and out; at
    Preston, he drives ""Interzone"" at an unthinkable pace, nearly drowning out Curtis due to poor recording
    issues, but making his few screams to the surface even more incredible.  Morris sets the tone throughout,
    and Curtis, Sumner and Hook unfailingly, unflinchingly rise to meet him, giving themselves over to the
    audience in some of the most wracking performances ever likely to be captured to tape.  Only the majesty
    of ""Atmosphere"" slows the proceedings; as the final number at Les Bains, it is the great winding
    down of the universe-- no other song carries such a beautiful sense of finality.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, live recording techniques of the time create a distance all their own in the recordings-- the
    quality of the Preston recording is particularly terrible, often muddying Curtis' performance to the point
    of incomprehensibility (when it isn't totally inaudible)-- a unique natural alternative to Hannett's studio-processed
    subdual of Joy Division's ominous presence, but a minor shame nonetheless.  Originally, these recordings
    overcome the obstacle through sheer strength of the band's will to be heard.  <i>Les Bains Douches</i>, by
    itself, is flawless; of the available recordings there are none better.  <i>Amsterdam</i> features a
    brilliant set with a few gaffes and an even-keeled performance that might be the least energetic but is
    still unquestionably great.  Even <i>Preston</i> is impressive; if anything, the faulty mixing and an ""off""
    performance humanizes them, makes them seem uncomfortably imperfect in direct contrast to their sterling
    critical image.</p><p>
    
    And that's finally the killer; <i>Refractured</i> presents these recordings with an unbelievably amateurish
    two-second gap between tracks, shattering the whole intent of the live recordings in the first place.  These
    recordings are a marvel no matter what, but to fail to capture the essence of a live show so spectacularly
    is a crime.  In the end, that's the point: This box tries to bring Joy Division out from behind the studio
    glass and present them, and mainly Curtis, in all the awesome, terrifying conflict that he channeled through
    his voice and his music, the conflict that eventually led to him taking his life; to simply present them in
    the most honest, impassioned way possible.  The individual recordings, and even the original <i>Fractured</i>
    box, succeed flawlessly; all <i>Refractured</i> succeeds at is inflicting an injustice on otherwise classic
    performances.</p></div>"|4342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4342-refractured/|5.8|Eric Carr

Why spin off spin-offs?  Why make a spectacle of yourself?
    Why, indeed, Statistics?  Desaparecidos co-songwriter Denver Dalley now finds himself at the reins of
    this solo project, just another in a long, unending line of hopeless supporting acts led by a sideman
    from a semi-popular indie band.  These projects sometimes reap fantastic results, but judging from this
    debut outing, Dalley's future could hardly be bleaker.</p><p>
    
    To begin, Dalley possesses neither heart nor soul as a lead vocalist, and his milk-warm emotional outpouring
    of tiresome, overwrought subject matter could get lost in a crowd of two.  That these are the best assets
    of Statistics is a sad fact, but that he spends half this album relying instead on flak-shot instrumentals
    is simply fatal.  Of <i>Leave Your Name</i>'s eleven songs, five are nebulous, inscrutable ""experiments
    in sound,"" including the near five-minute closer ""Circular Memories"".</p><p>
    
    In a way, this could be seen as a positive trait, but the lack of sentiment in these ambling post-rock
    passages, which all boil over with bombastic riffage and gratuitous drum rolls, is every bit as insipid
    as Dalley's plaintive, weeping vocal outbursts.  Perfunctory mood-setting stabs like ""Chairman of the
    Bored"" (nice one!) and ""Accomplishment"" at least confine themselves to runtimes of less than three minutes,
    but nonetheless taxi along on piano or acoustic meandering above linear backdrops of half-baked ambience.</p><p>
    
    ""Sing a Song"" opens with unsettling Oakenfold-bred resonance giving way to Jealous Sound jangle-pop-by-numbers,
    replete with predictable shifts in dynamics and antiseptic crescendos.  Same goes for ""Hours Seemed Like Days"",
    which boasts the record's most obnoxious lyrics, opining how ""claymation is gone and now it's all become
    CG"" in an embarrassing tone of false nostalgia.  Lamentably, +/- has already run the numbers on this
    hybridization of purebred-rock-to-shakedown-ambience, only with a touch of innovation-- and on a track
    like, ""A Number, Not a Name"", Dalley proves he's a far cry from Tamborello as well.  Pigeonholing this
    record into a simple genre like ""emo"" or ""post-rock"" or ""sadcore"" is impossible, as its focus is far too
    splintered to qualify for any one in particular.  I can, however, tell you what it's not: a record you
    haven't heard before.</p></div>"|7730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7730-leave-your-name/|4.0|Alan Smithee

    fearlessness: A man alone can charter a dangerous commodity.  Adulteration is always a concern for a talent
    whose work is crosshatched with such distinctly rendered spiritual and philosophical allegiances, but when
    he drew up plans for <i>Hope You Fail Better</i>-- an album that would further explore the same intimate
    themes of frustrated devotion and mortality that haunted 2002's dauntless <i>Baby's Breadth</i>-- he chose,
    for the first time, to enlist a steady cast of players to tour and record the album.  Thankfully, this
    decision hasn't diluted the unsettling potency of his vision, which unfolds as feverishly as ever; rather,
    it breathes new life into his usual message.</p><p>
    
    Crafting a lonely funereal strain for the opening stanza of Edna St. Vincent Millay's ""Dirge Without Music"",
    Panic's opener instantly digs into his earthworn philosophy.  Millay, typically known for her precocious
    sexuality and malcontent's bohemian sensibilities, here offers no resignation to death's inevitable calling,
    and Panic delivers her words acutely and mournfully.  His conversional bent sobers the text's underlining
    message, and plays excellently as an introduction to Panic's dusty temperance.</p><p>
    
    The brisk fever of ""Let My Lungs Coin Words"" is the first indication that his decision to expand was not
    ill-forged.  Panic sounds renewed and even transcendent as, with the help of producer Daniel Smith of The
    Danielson Famile, Panic's elfin, Dylanesque warble rises just enough above the jangling sway to project
    itself fitfully.  ""Breach Birth Control"", ""The World Is Not a Place"", and ""Paint Legs on the Snake"" rollick,
    too, while Panic even utilizes handclaps, though the mood never truly lightens.</p><p>
    
    Fettered both by fears of dying and of not truly living, Panic teetertotter's his way through the recording.
    The album's true voice might be heard through ""Both Sides of the Paper"" and ""On 'H's' They"", where you can
    hear gusts of wind pass portentously through weathered windvanes as Panic reports, with Jason Molina-esque
    conviction, ""Every new day is further from where you can go to be with those that died.""  He sweeps death
    under the rug with the closing four tracks, the strongest batch on the album.  Each hems in a line Panic
    has sewn into his intensely personal brand of distorted alt-country for all of Hope: ""Getting Over Joy""'s
    slick slide guitar line, the inflated grandeur of ""Expensive Attic"", and the ponderous call to death of
    ""Leaving Me My Eyes"" all anchor the mood that almost ballooned away in the middle of the album-- though in
    no way due to any relenting philosophical exploration.  He simply sounds more alive than ever.</p><p>
    
    The gentle, clean swabs of acoustic guitar and saloon-slapped piano on ""That's the Moon, Son"" end the
    album with his most traditional structure and message.  It feels like an answer, or at least a call to
    a drifter's end, a solidification of thought.  You may not be swaying like paper in the winds of change,
    or ruminating daily on the distance you've marked for death, but for the duration of <i>Hope You Fail
    Better</i>, you'll swear you are.</p></div>"|6144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6144-hope-you-fail-better/|8.0|William Morris

(Formerly 'Country on the Click')|1445.0|The Fall|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Action']|2004-01-21 00:00:00|2003|2016-06-11 21:16:49.576809|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1pg6f0s9rls.1.6:0.1.0.$2975/=1$2975.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>There's a 1987 interview with The Fall where everyone's favorite repellently preening pest and poet Mark
    E. Smith is asked to give his Ins and Outs.  (A small sample: Ins - Ultra-flash black people, Asian pop
    groups, and James Cain; Outs - Scotch pop groups featuring pseudo-intellectuals, the Iraq war, and Eddie
    Murphy.)  When read again 16 years later, the underlying moral is this: Mark E. Smith was always right,
    and always will be.  His image is right.  His politics are right.  His precipitously craggy face is right.
    More fundamentally, his rampageous, begrudgingly musical wreckage is right.  Lord knows his indignant,
    dragooning rigmarole is about as necessary to rock 'n' roll as Elvis and felonies.  Sure, he's released
    enough mediocre-to-awful albums to sustain entire countries, but one gets the curious sense that at some
    point in the future (say 20 years), it'll turn out that Smith was right yet again, and we just weren't
    clever enough to acknowledge it.</p><p>
    
    This is probably a bit of a quandary for Smith.  Oh, of course writhing masses of pinheads and blockheads
    still tirelessly berate The Fall (often with good reason), but, for the last decade, even the insults are
    now termed in the same way you insult Dylan or Leonard Cohen.  Much to the chagrin of everyone involved,
    Smith has become the primordial prophet.  He has nowhere left to go, nothing left to see.  The faithful may
    still cling to decayed compilations in certain Yahoo! chatrooms, but there's nary a shred of anticipation
    to be found.</p><p>
    
    More bad news: <i>The Real New Fall LP</i> is as valuable an album as anything The Fall ever released in
    the 1990s, and Smith's vocals and lyrics have been reinvigorated since his work with the listless line-up
    on <i>Are You Are Missing Winner</i>.  To get our parameters set, there are hardly any rockabilly brambles,
    trivial dub jumbles, or any other excursions into the myriad genres The Fall helped cultivate.  But then,
    if you listen to The Fall for diversity, you're missing the point.</p><p>
    
    Like always, enjoyment of The Fall is directly proportional to one's tolerance of whatever sludge, flare-up
    or balderdash is repeated ad nauseum for a song's entirety.  A reviewer's Aristotelian notions of what
    constitutes aesthetic truth are emptied in a blink of one of the yawping brutalities on this album.  On
    ""Theme from Sparta F.C."", Smith may shout, ""I don't have a jack knife,"" but clearly no one told the guitars.
    Elsewhere, ""Contraflow"" slides shackled, trodden quagmires between verses.  The riffs are barbed and boiled,
    flaunting menace, flouting melody, and about to topple off of Smith's face.  Towards the end of ""Last
    Commands of Xyralothep via M.E.S."", the guitars are at such an unbearable pitch that the production sounds
    like literally rocking the needle off its groove.  Any subtle departures from the typical Fall sound are on
    the hushed folk-rock on ""Janet, Johnny + James"" or the deceased, out-of-key back-up vocals on ""Mike's Love
    Xexagon"".</p><p>
    
    Smith's lyrics are at a near career-best of insolence and nonsense.  They're brilliant if you wrangle an
    understanding, and even more so if you can't.  By the second song, he's already gone fishing, fled a pet
    cemetery, and successfully shoved anarchy onto the desk of a jingoistic Dolly Parton-Lord Byron alliance.
    On ""The Past #2"", he finally liquidates the concepts of time and truth themselves.  There's an entire song
    committed to portraying Brian Wilson as a furtive despot and Mike Love as Christ, and on the Lee
    Hazlewood-written ""Loop41 'Houston"", he keeps inadvertently slurring ""Houston"" into ""sedition.""</p><p>
    
    It's their best album since 1996's <i>Light User Syndrome</i>, which may seem like faint praise until we
    recall that The Fall have released enough records to bankrupt entire record store chains.  (It's also
    notable because 2000's <i>The Unutterable</i> was perilously close to greatness as well.)  The Fall have
    been defrosted yet again, and there should be rejoicing in the streets.  They're as brittle, volatile and
    consistently riveting as any band out there, and even though no one could possibly take Smith seriously
    anymore, it insinuates that there's still enough justification here to warrant following The Fall's devious
    discography into one more decade.</p></div>"|2975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2975-the-real-new-fall-lp-formerly-country-on-the-click/|7.9|Alex Linhardt

    list of 100 ""best"" DIY punk singles</u></a> from the <i>Ugly Things</i> zine is a lesson in the fleeting
    bursts of creativity and desperation every collector of rare shit must wade through.  I've never really
    been bitten by the collector bug personally, but have known enough people who have that it's become pretty
    easy for me to spot what they're looking for.  Generally, bands that didn't last very long and put out
    records very few people heard (preferably self-pressed, and certainly vinyl- or cassette-only) find their
    way into collector hands almost as quickly as they disappeared.  Sometimes, these folks uncover real hidden
    gems.  For every few dozen of deservedly forgotten garage punk artistes, there's a band that could have
    been contenders in the world of the living had their luck been better.  British trio The Homosexuals fit
    this bill, and I've a feeling that anyone into those hallowed days of apathy, art and the anti-social in
    the UK during the late 70s will be happy to know they existed.</p><p>
    
    The Homosexuals were a strange prospect.  Seemingly, their music should fit into a similar spot as that of
    angry young men like Wire and Magazine who carried their penchants for art-school angst in the midst of
    proto-thug posturing, like badges of authentic alienation.  And of course, in many ways, these bands were
    alienated-- at least from what had been passing for British rock prior to 1976.  However, L'Voag (aka Jim,
    Amos, and now, Xentos), Anton (aka George Harassment) and Bruno were also part of a different scene, where
    more ""progressive"" notions of artistic protest were at stake: This Heat, Family Fodder and Chris Cutler's
    bands Henry Cow and the Art Bears were some of the names going at it in these circles.</p><p>
    
    So what and who were they?  And where have they been for the last 25 years?  The band actually formed in
    1977, shortly after L'Voag noticed Bruno in protest at a National Front gathering/riot, while Anton
    answered an ad.  After choosing a calculatedly provocative name, the three set about playing and recording
    a little on their own, and the following year, engineer Chris Gray (brother of producer Nigel Gray) brought
    them to Surrey Sound to record all of the music that ended up on the original <i>Homosexuals' Record</i>,
    and indeed, everything on this CD reissue.  Their first release was the ""Hearts in Exile""/""Soft South
    Africans"" single, which was given extra collector life by its placement on Kugelberg's list (as was their
    seven-inch, ""You're Not Moving the Way You're Supposed To"", not contained on this album).  The band released
    a couple of EPs from these sessions on Black Noise Records, as well as working on myriad solo projects
    before splitting in the early 80s.</p><p>
    
    The Homosexuals' split was no mere parting of ways, but a complete severing of ties.  Bruno actually gave
    the tapes that became <i>The Homosexuals' Record</i> (reportedly from a cassette dub of masters he'd
    destroyed) to Cutler's ReR in 1984 without consulting the rest of the band.  Before anyone could do anything
    about it, the record had been released and already gone out of print.  Just like that, you get a lurid
    backstory, a flash of music, and fuzzy details over who did what to whom.  Result: punk legend and collector
    fantasy.  Today, L'Voag is the most musically active, having most recently released music as Xentos with
    Die Computer Trip Die-- though as with all things Homosexuals, specific details on the musicians are sketchy.</p><p>
    
    The music on <i>The Homosexuals' CD</i> is a sprawling bag of angular power-pop, quasi-dub, garage-punk
    and other stuff I'd liken to Faust or some such lunatic mob if I had to.  In fact, I have a Homosexuals
    cover of Faust's ""It's a Rainy Day Sunshine Girl"" on CDR, which I still can't fit into this whole story.
    Suffice to say, were it not for the rudimentary production values, I'd say these guys would have given
    any of the big post-punk bands a run for their money in terms of both songwriting (the impact of these
    songs is almost impossible to deny) and sheer diversity.</p><p>
    
    This reissue doesn't collect everything The Homosexuals did, but it does emphasize what a great, fun,
    strange band they were.  ""Hearts in Exile"" is the perfect punk love song, with a slow-building intro
    of slashed guitar and L'Voag's cryptic description of ""bloodshot eyes/ Appetizing, isolation.../ The
    messages of radio,"" his voice coming and going and bathed in reverb; it's all very hard to pin down, as
    if the song might suddenly fade out into nothing at any moment.  And then comes the hook, featuring a
    four-note, pleading guitar riff that conveys heartbreak masked by aggression perfectly.  Even better is
    the punchy, ambitious ""Astral Glamour"" (also the name of a pending three-disc set planned by Chuck Warner's
    Hyped to Death label later this year), a shiny piece of power-pop that would sound as good coming from
    early XTC as it would have on The Who's <i>Sell Out</i>.  Nonsensical lyrics (""Astral glamour semen in
    the region"") barely hide the infectious, incredibly concise strains.  By all rights, this should have
    been a hit, as should either version of ""Soft South Africans"" contained here.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, The Homosexuals ram out tunes with speed-of-light abandon.  ""My Night Out"", ""Technique Street"",
    ""Vociferous Slam"" and ""A Million Keys"" all clock in at less than two minutes and are explosive bits of
    jagged post-punk along the lines of Gang of Four.  However, L'Voag is a much more overtly passionate
    vocalist, going for broke on pretty much everything.  He bleats lines like, ""Lovers licking labia seem
    satisfied, satisfied,"" as if shouting over a mad crowd of sweaty admirers and psychopaths.  ""Divorce
    Proceedings from Reality"" and ""Neutron Lover"" proceed with similar zeal, but with the immediacy of great,
    sparkling pop.  A far cry removed are tracks like ""All About Cheap"" (the DIY aesthetic defined) and ""Mecho
    Madness"", using the limited studio technology at their disposal to construct strange, damaged art pieces
    reminiscent of concurrent Pere Ubu.</p><p>
    
    The worst part about a release like this is that if you want more, you're virtually out of luck.  The
    remaining Homosexuals material is all from the same period (excepting an EP recorded after L'Voag left
    the band), but if you want to find out ""what happened next,"" you'll have to search the various long-gone
    solo projects including Amos &amp; Sara, George Harassment, Sara Goes Pop, and Nancy Sesay &amp; The Melodaires.
    Warner's set should take care of some of that, but there are still holes in their official discography.
    However, now that there's a legit (and presumably well-distributed) CD issue of The Homosexuals' music,
    I bet their legacy gets a boost.  The music speaks volumes for itself.</p></div>"|3974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3974-the-homosexuals-cd/|8.4|Dominique Leone

Even if you ignore the image gracing the cover--     an enormous Masonic pyramid alluding to the United States' Great Seal-- the interior notes still feature a     painting of a magenta helicopter landing on a golf course, with Conn and his Gypsies proudly vamping around     a hole, chests revealed, heels high.  As usual, Bobby Conn's outfits are as glitter-perfect as his sound,     but on <i>The Homeland</i>, Conn's bombastic, prog-funk diddling (firmly rooted in Parliament, Bowie, and     yes, Styx) gets mixed up in his equally flashy protest-ready agenda, thus making <i>The Homeland</i> a     ridiculous mix of 70s glam and suit-and-tie politics.</p>
<p>The best way to describe <i>The Homeland</i> is as a self-contained circus, but one without the burlesque     growl that absurdist carnival-sloggers like Tom Waits or Firewater consistently peddle: nothing here is     laced with subtlety.  The sonic equivalent of hula-hooping ladies and dainty brother/sister high-wire acts     (in matching sequined leotards!), <i>The Homeland</i> is sparkly and perpetually overstated, a clown car     spilling over with big red noses and three-foot shoes, as studied as it is camp.  Conn's pastel pleather     suits are part-Prince, part-Ziggy Stardust, and just about the last thing you'd expect to see a protest     singer sporting-- which is nicely subversive, since, as its grandiose title so boldly suggests, <i>The     Homeland</i> is essentially a protest album, a caustic, quasi-righteous diatribe against America's current     political regime.</p>
<p>That Bobby Conn is the made-up messenger of this statement is both strange and gratifying: Conn is making     broad political arguments against the American government (see nearly every track, especially ""We Come in     Peace"", ""Relax"", and ""Home Sweet Home"", or ponder lyrics like, ""We are your friends/ We come in peace/ We     brought our guns to set you free.../ Say goodbye to all your history/ Come and join our family""), but he's     doing so while sporting high-heeled, lace-up boots (in bright New York Dolls white) and playing jam-lite     boogie guitar.</p>
<p>Conn's work has always been overtly political, but gone from <i>The Homeland</i> are the hedonistic,     coked-up sex stories of Conn's past (who can forget the gums-only fellatio promise of 2001's ""Whore""?)     replaced by not-so-secret conspiracy theories (""I didn't need to get elected/ When I was born selected"")     and sweeping political laments.  There are a handful of departures (""Bus No. 243"", about riding drunk     around London Bus No. 243), but most of <i>The Homeland</i> is preoccupied with taking the same anti-Bush     stance over and over again.</p>
<p>Despite Conn's impossibly explicit agenda, fans will find still plenty of tights and riffage, sunglasses and     swagger, drum machines and big, warbling vocals.  And unlike the piles of self-proclaimed heirs currently     mucking up the once-despised 70s guitar landscape, there's something persistently uncool about Bobby Conn--     and it's that kind of fuck-off, punk disobedience that makes him such a convincing portrait of pure,     unfettered rock abandon.  Anyone who's read a few chapters of <i>The Dirt</i> gets how wearing eyeliner     can be a dangerous occupation, no matter how big your guitar amp is, and Conn's complete disregard for     contemporary expectations (and hipsters relentlessly pushing irony) is delightfully unexpected, if     ultimately underwhelming.</p></div>"|1580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1580-the-homeland/|5.8|Amanda Petrusich

    contains songs that, for all their effort to sound otherwise, can't help being pop, even when they're drawn

    recitals.  I'm reminded of this record, of course, by <i>Ringodom or Proctor</i>, the ambitiously weird,

    French horns, flutes and keyboards with minimal interludes of creaking harmonies and repetitive percussion
    or accordion patterns.  In terms of scope, it resembles Ween's <i>The Mollusk</i> without all the bathroom
    humor; it even bursts into the occasional sea shanty.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""January on Strike"" swerves from an almost industrial rhythmic assault into a slow, majestic passage
    that drifts into a buildup that finally deposits you in the propulsive opening verse of ""Curve That Byrd"".
    The loopy bassline and big three-part harmonies make for a colossal hook, and the song returns to this
    structure after several detours, including an anthemic guitar passage backed by marimba, and a huge
    violin-drenched chorus that features four interlocking vocal parts.  That's a ton of stuff to absorb in
    the space of about six minutes, which is apparently just the way the band likes it-- every one of their
    songs includes at least three distinct sections and usually a couple of tempo changes.</p><p>
    
    ""Yeoman or Tinker"" runs through strange sections that sound like a room full of clocks, buckles under the
    weight of massive horn and string bombast, and cools off with harmonies and piano, while ""Acme: The Summit
    of a Mountain"" is a boisterous anthem for kids who feel pressured into attending institutions in which they
    have no interest, like summer camp and tech school.  It's probably the most straightforward rock song here,
    though it's got nothing on the sunshiny dancepop of ""Science Needed a Medical Man"", a bell-and-horn-dappled
    blast of melody about the return of the first man to travel at the speed of light to Earth, and his
    subsequent death from the strain.</p><p>
    
    Where Head of Femur finally differ the most from an old band like Nektar is the fact that they embrace their
    pop core, no matter how much prog apple they pile on around it.  <i>Ringodom or Proctor</i> certainly has
    its flaws-- plenty of lyrics that sound too much like placeholders, and arrangements that sometimes get
    too opaque are the two most worthy of note-- but for a band just starting out, it's an impressive statement
    of purpose, and the tease of waiting to see if they can refine and sharpen this sound for a second go round
    is overwhelming.  Head of Femur definitely bear watching in the future.</p></div>"|3972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3972-ringodom-or-proctor/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    last year, swerving to avoid hitting a deer.  Luckily, nobody died, though it was severe enough that Calvin
    Johnson and bassist Chris Sutton were hospitalized.  Benefits were held, and before too long, the band was
    rested and healed.  In that context, you could view <i>Degenerate Introduction</i>, the band's sixth
    full-length (and first in five years) as a comeback celebration of punk-rock resiliency.  (Get up!  Ride
    that funky horse again!  Show some resolve!)  As they've been doing since 1993, Dub Narcotic concoct a mix
    of reggae, dub, hip-hop beats, sludgy garage, and Calvin's party-boy monotone in search of nothing more than
    a packed dance floor.  (And it's a good thing they just wanna dance, because when CJ gets political on ""Blood
    Flow"", the sophomoric name-calling doesn't move beyond ""Ashcroft is an ass,"" ""Colin Powell is a corporate
    marionette wet dream,"" and ""Cheney is a heartless corpse.""  Agreed, man, agreed, but c'mon, Belafonte, where
    do we go from there?)</p><p>
    
    You hate to kick someone in the shin when they're already nursing wounds-- especially when those cuts and
    bruises occurred in the course of saving Bambie-- but damnit if <i>Degenerate Introduction</i> doesn't make
    any sort of kindness incredibly impossible.  I've always been a Calvin apologist and was a huge Beat
    Happening fan, so when I say that the majority of these nine tracks are emphatically embarrassing, please
    know that I'm also blushing myself.  While I don't think a dud like this diminishes Johnson's past musical
    work, how many of these misfires can a person take before they turn their attention elsewhere?</p><p>
    
    In Dub Narcotic, there's an overwhelming sense that Calvin's lost touch with his strengths.  Or maybe this
    project doesn't suit his better qualities?  I know the guy has it in him; he formed Dub Narcotic just a year
    after Beat Happening went out with the triumphant swan song <i>You Turn Me On</i>.  Occasionally, there've
    been a few flashes of guest-spot enjoyment: ""C Is the Heavenly Option"", Johnson's stumbling collaboration
    with Heavenly, made for a nice mixtape gag in the early 90s; he keyed-in adequately hushed background vocals
    for Modest Mouse's ""Head South"".  Bar none, the most successful sustained post-Beat Happening project, The
    Halo Benders, works largely because of the pleasing juxtaposition of Johnson's guttural frog voice against
    Doug Marsch's high-end howl.  (Plus they've covered the Smiths and basically sound like Built to Spill with
    Calvin on the guest mic.)  Here, though, Calvin's only vocal foil is Liardbird's Heather Dunn, who seems to
    be trying as hard as she can to sing horrifically off-key on the endlessly bad ""Fuck Me Up"".  (Bring back
    Lois!  Bring back Miranda July!)</p><p>
    
    As proven on past Dub Narcotic efforts, Calvin himself is no Tikiman, King Tubby or Lee ""Scratch"" Perry,
    so his cravings for ""old-school grooves and rare hip-hop beats"" are embarrassing, especially when laid
    down over an awkward human beatbox and a drum that comes in a fraction of second too late.  The self-referential
    ""Dub Narcotic Groove"" proves that perhaps Johnson really is the indie rock Paul Schaffer: His shoutouts to
    Olympia and funtime sloganeering (""The dance floor is your friend!"", ""No room for squares out on the dance
    floor!"") are ingredients for an awkward jam at the 12th Annual K Records Retirees Fundraiser at the Punk
    'n' Twee Hall of Fame.</p><p>
    
    In this broke-ass, no-voice context, the best tracks are the instrumentals.  The relaxed, pleasing ""Code
    of the West"" is performed with Melodica, a la Augustus Pablo, and ""Mate's Revenge"" is eight minutes of
    noisy, convincing dub-psych, rife with guitar manipulations, handclaps, sax screech, pitch shifts, super
    wah, fluctuating drums, intergalactic soloing, and flippant instrumental turns that equally recall Temple
    of Bon Matin and Cul De Sac's ecstatic mid-90s jackpot, <i>I Don't Want to Go to Bed</i>.  These two tracks
    alone save <i>Degenerate Introduction</i> from complete dissolution.  Still, Dub Narcotic's aim has always
    been to bring people to their feet, and that they find the most success with the least dance-inflected
    tracks should serve as a wake-up call: DJs who clear the floor don't get invited back.</p></div>"|2470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2470-degenerate-introduction/|3.9|Brandon Stosuy

By marrying The Field Mice's shimmering sonics with (where applicable) lovelorn lyrical impulses, those on the Morr and City Centre Offices rosters, Múm, The Postal Service, Freescha, Casino Versus Japan and Broadcast have been providing the warm hugs for the Darla set that used to be administered by post-C-86 jangle-pop.  True, The Aislers Set, The Lucksmiths, and The Clientele have continued to proudly (and successfully) wave the flag for more classic melancholia, but in the first couple of years of this new millennium, too few other have bands managed to approach their charm.</p><p>  However, in the past year or so, there's been a shift back toward the more traditional indie pop thanks to the slight return of Belle &amp; Sebastian and records by Saturday Looks Good to Me, PAS/CAL, Pipas, The Happy Couple, Ballboy and, most of all, Camera Obscura.  The Scottish band's second album, <em>Underachievers Please Try Harder</em>, captures a portion of the wispy bedsit magic that used to mark some of The Field Mice's best work and boosts it with the lush, ""Hazey Jane II""-like chamber-pop of Belle &amp; Sebastian's first flourishes of glory.  (Admittedly, as a co-ed, Glaswegian sextet, B&amp;S comparisons would have come fast and easy even if Camera Obscura hadn't once featured Richard Colburn on drums or got their foot in the door of public consciousness with a single produced by Stuart Murdoch, ""Eighties Fan"".)</p><p> <em>Underachievers</em> was released in the UK last year on Spain's Elefant Records, and now Merge spreads the word in the U.S. and adds B-sides ""I Don't Want to See You"" and ""Footloose and Fancyfree"".  Ignoring the infantilism of some of the more twee indie pop, Camera Obscura scold immature relationship decisions on ""Teenager"", offer tender advice on ""A Sister's Social Agony"", and go on the make on ""Suspended from Class"". Their honest, wide, and adult approach to heartbreak, romantic liaisons, and escapism is extended to the subtle range of influence-- most of which is shown off on the tracks sung by John Henderson.  ""Before You Cry"" is a graceful nod to Nashville, ""Your Picture"" is a dead ringer for Leonard Cohen, and Motown stomper ""Let Me Go Home"" is the best of their soul boy all-nighters.</p><p>  Camera Obscura keep their cards closer to their indie pop chest when Tracyanne Campbell is alone on the mic, and, despite the success of the aforementioned tracks, are all the better for it.  ""A Sister's Social Agony"" apes the gentle harmonies and chimes of sibling-led vocal groups Four Freshman and The Beach Boys-- an appropriate and sly arrangement for the subject matter.  Best of all are the gentle, luminous ""Suspended from Class"" and ""Books Written for Girls"", each of which feature self-deprecating lyrics, tender arrangements, and a lifeline for heart-on-sleeve acoustic pop.</p><p> </p></div>"|1748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1748-underachievers-please-try-harder/|8.0|Scott Plagenhoef

Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Love of the Last Tycoon</i> contains a passage that reads: ""It would come in
    some such guise as the auto-horns from the technicolor boulevards below or be barely audible, a tattoo on
    the muffled drum of the moon.  He strained to hear it, knowing only that music was beginning, new music
    that he liked and did not understand.""  The book's climactic love scene served as the basis of a Movietone
    song from 2000's beguiling and beautiful <i>The Blossom Filled Streets</i>.  Yet the description above
    continues to lend itself to the Bristol group's follow-up, <i>The Sand and the Stars</i>, in that their
    music embodies both closeness and distance, the encompassing sounds in between (be they boulevards or
    heavenly bodies) as much a part of the music as the music itself.</p><p>
    
    This is not accidental: the quintet lugged recording equipment out of their home studio and into churches
    and warehouses, up a cliff, and even into a bay near Land's End to capture that quality.  The incidental,
    environmental sounds infuse with guitar, dulcimer, banjo, brushed drums, cubist bass, and the pastoral
    whispers of Kate Wright and Rachel Brook (who offset the brunt of early Flying Saucer Attack with a gentle
    serenity in her maiden days).  The songs in turn reflect the cyclic patterns of ebb and flow found out
    there in the elements.  ""Ocean Song"" gently sways along with the tremolo guitar and malleted patter of
    toms, as dripping water makes its own rhythm somewhere deeper in the mix.  ""Let Night In"" vacillates between
    Rachel's ""Chopsticks""-piano and more pedal-heavy resonance, accompanied by her husband's strums.</p><p>
    
    Harmonizing with accordion and wine glasses on ""Pale Tracks"", Sam and Matt Jones have all the morose male
    throat of the early, shadow-shrouded records of their fellow stable-mates Palace Brothers.  Perhaps to keep
    up with the incoming tide, Movietone expand to nine players for ""We Rode On""-- here, clarinet, trumpet and
    saxophone breathe along with the bay.  ""Snow Is Falling"" imagines a subdued, small Mingus group accompanying
    Vashti Bunyan through the drifts swirling at nightfall, juxtaposing a dark, walking bass with the lighter
    exhalations of Kate Wright.  The only bit of abstract noise to make it over from <i>The Blossom Filled
    Streets</i> comes in the organ interlude of ""Not Even Close"", and even that recedes into subdued guitar
    and the banjo and wobbly jazz of ""Red Earth"".</p><p>
    
    The final two songs of the disc find the group wandering about with their instruments out to the beach itself.
    ""Beach Samba"" is as joyful and refreshing as a quick, chilly dip with Shirley Collins, Astrud Gilberto and
    Lionel Belasco, while closer ""Near Marconi's Hut"" finds Kate Wright alone on a coastal path at night, with
    only her guitar to warm her voice and a lighthouse to shine in the darkness.  In its final minutes, <i>The
    Sand and the Stars</i> gleans a delicate, human music between the distant heavens and cold terra firma.</p></div>"|5471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5471-the-sand-and-the-stars/|8.0|Andy Beta

    double-standard.  On the one hand, we expect music to demonstrate effort and skill beyond what we consider
    ourselves capable of-- hence snarky and devastating dismissals to the tune of ""give me a few days and even
    I could make that album.""  At the same time, we have little tolerance for anything that seems forced--
    ""effortless"" is tossed around as a compliment just as certainly as a lack of effort is cited as grounds
    for dismissal.</p><p>
    
    The amount of care and consideration John Vanderslice puts into the minutia of his records is beyond
    impressive.  Over the course of three solo albums since the dissolution of his band MK Ultra, Vanderslice
    has proven himself to be not only a skilled songwriter, but one of the most unique, talented and thoughtful
    producers working in indie rock today.  Vanderslice's ""sloppy hi-fi"" approach marries the grandiosity of
    Dave Fridmann's fuzzed-out, super-compressed sonic palate with the subtle charm and inventiveness of lo-fi
    techniques, and has resulted in some of the best-produced indie rock to see release in the last several
    years.</p><p>
    
    While this attention to sonic detail is one of Vanderslice's greatest strengths, it often seems to limit
    him as well.  Vanderslice will sometimes pack a song full of so many masterful arrangements and subtle
    textural shifts that the songs themselves fail to be as riveting as they should be when viewed from a
    distance.  Though every song he's recorded is host to a plethora of riveting and intriguing sounds, these
    sounds sometimes fail to come together when taken as a whole-- comfortable midtempo pacing gets a little
    too comfortable, melodies seem tacked on, and the song itself comes across as an afterthought to the
    brilliantly conceived production and orchestration.</p><p>
    
    For this, his fourth album, Vanderslice seems to have scaled down the bells and whistles that adorned his
    previous solo outings, placing a greater emphasis on his own unique delivery.  As a singer, he's remarkable
    and distinctive, and on <i>Cellar Door</i>, he explores the range and impact of his voice to great effect.
    On ""They Won't Let Me Run"", Vanderslice abandons the restraint that often characterizes his singing and
    comes away with a poignant, pretty and memorable song that rivals his best.  It's one of many songs on
    <i>Cellar Door</i> to explore the theme of families, and things that interfere with and complicate them.
    ""When It Hits My Blood"", another one of the album's standouts, begins with a confession, ""I stole from my
    mother,"" before revealing that the aforementioned mother is, herself, a ""pill fiend.""  The song benefits
    greatly from Vanderslice's production talents-- this man can do things with a piano and a drumset that
    would make Steve Albini blush.  Ultimately, though, one wishes the song would build to something slightly
    greater than it does-- not because it renders the song any less enjoyable or affecting, but rather because
    it prevents it from the transcendent greatness it comes so close to achieving.</p><p>
    
    The more uptempo numbers are similarly promising.  ""Coming and Going on Easy Terms"" is significant not only
    for its melodic excellence, but for its instrumentation as well, allowing each its own voice while paying
    great attention to their interplay. ""Pale Horse"", the album's leadoff track and original title, shows the
    influence of Vanderslice collaborator John Darnielle of Mountain Goats in its sound and approach alike,
    and proves one of the most engaging songs on <i>Cellar Door</i>.</p><p>
    
    The only objectionable thing about <i>Cellar Door</i> is that it is, yet again, not the earth-shattering
    album Vanderslice has been almost-making for the last four years.  Fortunately, his love of sound and ideas
    alike comes through with much more clarity than on 2002's <i>Life and Death of an American Four-Tracker</i>,
    which would seem to indicate that he's gradually progressing to a peak where his defining artistic statement
    can finally be made.  Indeed, the most promising thing of all about <i>Cellar Door</i> is that it contains
    moments in which the music sounds, well, effortless.  Further honing his songcraft and embracing the unique
    characteristics of his voice, Vanderslice is beginning to write songs that are every bit as elegant as their
    arrangements.  Over the years, John Vanderslice has always been more than eager to give credit to his friends,
    his collaborators, his influences, and even his equipment, but <i>Cellar Door</i> is another compelling piece
    of evidence that the main attraction is, and always has been, Vanderslice himself.</p></div>"|8403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8403-cellar-door/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    of the doubt when a mangled phrase slips out, or when the sentiment is about a million years out of date in
    our own slang (see: The Notwist's ""One with the Freaks""), but sometimes you just have to draw a line.
    Plainly, Sweden's The Wannadies have a high degree of fluency with English.  They've been the country's
    premier Britpop export (aside from maybe Kent) for a full decade now, belting out the hits in a foreign
    tongue like it was no big thing.  But, god, the chorus to this album's second single, ""Piss on You"", is a
    fucking atrocity.  To wit: ""So I piss on you/ Piss on you/ I piss on you/ Oh yes, it's true/ I piss on you/
    I know I do/ Piss on you.""</p><p>
    These words, delivered in sing-songy, sincere male/female harmony, were so confounding to me upon first
    listen that I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.  On top of that, the song's opening line goes, ""I like
    rock, but you give me the blues,"" which opens a whole socio-musicological can of worms.  You see, the idea
    is that she gives him something he doesn't want, but rock is based on blues to begin with, so it isn't really
    that far off, and certainly it's no grounds for being pissed on.  At any rate, it's one of the worst singles
    I've heard yet in this nascent century of ours.  Thankfully, it's also the absolute nadir of the album at
    large, so everything else comes up roses by comparison.</p><p>
    The album is deliberately divided into halves, with all of the uptempo stuff frontloaded, and the ballads
    pushed to the back-- the residual effect of the band's original concept for the album, which was to record
    two separate albums and release them together in the same package.  One album (<i>Before</i>) was intended
    to be the ""party record,"" with quick, snappy tunes you might dance to, while the second (<i>After</i>) was
    to be the ""comedown,"" full of ballads and slower tracks.  It's clear from the final version, however, that
    this concept could never have played out effectively, since the band simply doesn't vary their sound enough
    to really convey different moods-- the slow tracks feel just as upbeat as the fast ones, and the fast ones
    aren't terribly danceable in their own right.  Besides, Pulp already executed this concept by accident with
    <i>Different Class</i> and <i>This Is Hardcore</i>, and frankly, I don't see anyone beating that pair
    anytime soon.</p><p>
    Ultimately, The Wannadies are exactly good enough to pull off a 36-minute pop record, so it's for the best
    that they left their lofty ambitions at the curbside and concentrated on writing pure sugar like ""All Over
    Me"" and ""Disko"", the latter of which leads off the <i>After</i> half of the album with a slippery lounge
    groove, some big guitar hooks and the best drum fills on the record.  ""Come with Me"" is the cream of the
    ballad bumper crop, with a nice waltzing beat and sparse piano backing the by-now familiar tenor/soprano
    combination of Pär Wiksten and Christina Bergmark.  It all adds up to a nice enough look back at the glory
    days of Britpop through Scandinavian eyes, though one that's hardly essential for non-fanatics.  If nothing
    else, the sunny mood is an improvement on the forced anger that plagued 1999's <i>Yeah</i>, though for prime
    Wannadies, your best bet is to dive in to the band's 1997 self-titled American debut, which shows their craft
    in fuller flower.</p></div>"|8765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8765-before-after/|6.3|Joe Tangari

It was an inevitable junction, really,
    as the aesthetic values and fanbases of these worlds have so much overlap.  But it's everywhere now.  The
    abstract laptoppers are incorporating vocals and remixing pop artists; the indie rockers have IDM side
    projects.</p><p>
    
    On its first album, Music A.M. is finds itself in the midst of this fertile ground.  The band is new but
    the players have been around.  Luke Sutherland, who used to front the Too Pure bands Long Fin Killie and
    Bows (and now plays violin for Mogwai), sings and plays guitar.  Volker Bertelmann is on keyboards and
    computers, and Stefan Schneider, the driving force behind To Rococo Rot, contributes bass and synth.  They're
    an exceptionally quiet and cozy ensemble that fuses post-rock instrumental interplay and glitchy, spare
    electronics into well-crafted songs.</p><p>
    
    They're also one of those perfectly named bands.  On a rainy Sunday with a thick <i>New York Times</i> to
    get through, all I need is a pot of black coffee and music that sounds like <i>A Heart &amp; Two Stars</i>. Sam
    Prekop's solo album is an acoustic record for this mood, but Music A.M. comes from gurgly circuitry.  It
    reminds me a bit of Tortoise's <i>TNT</i>, with a side of pop structure and minus the jazzy runs.  Sutherland's
    guitar is plucked as his lines wind around the melody, Bertelmann trades out percussion for rustles, clicks
    and pops, and Schneider is instantly indefinable as he smothers it all in an electric blanket of bass and
    synth chords.  There's a ton of space and the instruments continually reference the tune at hand in some
    way.  And the vocals, despite being quietly half-sung by Sutherland, are surprisingly melodic.</p><p>
    
    Of course, post-rock bands have been whispering their way through the occasional song since the early 90s,
    and so often it seemed a cop-out, the only signal a tone-deaf vocalist could broadcast.  But Music A.M.
    get the technique right.  The quality of Sutherland's lyrics helps immensely, requiring more attention than
    one usually grants music this soft.  His lyrical skill shouldn't come as a surprise since he's taken time
    off music to publish one well-received novel (1998's <i>Jelly Roll</i>) and has written another, but it's
    unusual to hear words so clear and evocative in this setting.</p><p>
    
    Rather than hiding behind opacity or Grubbsian wordplay, Sutherland's words are direct.  He can be a
    storyteller in the Aidan Moffat mode as easily as he delivers absurd haiku.  ""Black Flash"" is like a grainy
    dream as it tells the story of a downtrodden professional wrestler who, while pinned to the canvas, catches
    a glimpse of his brutal long-lost father in the audience.  ""Bit Wheel"" compresses its narrative into a
    series of three-word lines that start as banal as possible (""boy meets girl"") and end fantastical, as
    estranged lovers roll through town suspended atop a runaway Ferris wheel.</p><p>
    
    About half the tracks on <i>A Heart &amp; Two Stars</i> are instrumental, and I heard and enjoyed the record a
    dozen times before the words registered at all.  It's fresh and balanced and easy to like right away.  But

    Ben Folds managed to skirt this immutable law two years ago, when he ditched the Five to do the
    alone-in-the-studio thing for <i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i>.  Though better than it might've been, <i>Suburbs</i>
    was nonetheless no great evolutionary leap forward for Folds, consisting of largely the same proper-name
    ivory-pop he made with Robert Sledge and Darren Jesse (if a bit heavier on the tissue-box Harry Chapin
    son-love ballads).  Which raises the question: if you're not going to change the sound that got your CD
    into every college girl's sun-visor disc wallet, why fire your band?</p><p>
    
    These EPs, released under-radar-stylee through that radical indie warehouse iTunes, would seem to present
    the perfect secret stage for Folds to branch out into new areas, as he brings a few members of his touring
    band in-studio for two no-frills quintets of new material and covers.  And yet, <i>Sunny 16</i> and
    <i>Speed Graphic</i> find the piano-man following the same old steps, with BFF trademarks like fuzz-plucked

    frequency than usual.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, ""There's Always Someone Cooler than You"" is a dilution of the Bizkit-taunt ""Rockin' the
    Suburbs"", which was in turn a dilution of the hipster-roasts ""Underground"" and ""The Battle of Who Could
    Care Less"".  Whereas the wry skewering of the latter track were dead-on observations chased with unshakeable
    minor-key doo-dooing, the voice of ""Always Someone Cooler"" is more a condescending curmudgeon act, no longer
    laced with that little twinge of self-effacement that leavens the scolding.  In fact, the majority of <i>Sunny
    16</i>'s lyrics appear in the form of parental commands: ""There's never gonna be no moment of truth for you,""
    ""You've got to give the people what they want,"" ""Go bless someone else for a while.""  Sit through this much
    piano-bench lecturing and you start to understand why Folds can't hold a band together.</p><p>
<i>Sunny 16</i> barely scrounges up a Mendoza line average, the only standout being ""Rockstar"", where Folds'
    key-banging revisits the chordal triumph of oldies like ""The Last Polka"" and the admonishments seem at
    least partially self-directed.  But these good feelings are quickly snuffed by his dreadfully saccharine
    cover of The Divine Comedy's ""Songs of Love"", a track that excuses a certain level of romanticism, but not
    the overwrought string section spackled on by Folds in lieu of the original's awesomely tinny harpsichord.
    Less grating is his take on The Cure's ""In Between Days"" on <i>Speed Graphic</i>, done fairly straight;
    like his old cover of Built to Spill's ""Twin Falls"", the song acclimates surprisingly well to piano
    interpretation, even if it misses its old acoustic chug.</p><p>
    
    Of <i>Speed Graphic</i>'s originals, only the anxious drumming and Joe Jackson chording of ""Protection""
    comes off as more than a castaway, while dreary-slow material like ""Wandering"" and ""Give Judy My Notice""
    continue adult-contempt-orary pandering for the ""Brick"" audience and moms who discovered Ben on United
    In-Flight music videos.  That three of the short-player's five tracks are older compositions only now
    being laid to tape might excuse the lack of progression evidenced here, but the songs also do little to
    dispel the notion that Folds is scraping the barrel of his range.</p><p>
    
    This EP series was initially planned as a trilogy, but for whatever conspiratorial reasons you want to
    dream up (certainly not sales, as both have done rather well on Steve Jobs' idle finger to the record
    labels), the third part was recently scrapped.  Perhaps Ben's taking the collaboration maxim to heart,
    though future projects with Bens Kweller and Lee (still waiting on my royalty check, guys) and, gulp,
    his second with William Shatner, appear less than promising.  In the meantime, anyone who once had a

    --Jason Molina, to Athens, GA patrons, August 2002</b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit A: Mr. Molina followed The Sunshine Fix and Snowglobe that night, but was opening for a
    then very-uncelebrated Polyphonic Spree.  He'd been invited for some kind of ""showcase.""  He explained
    that he would deliver both worlds of Songs: Ohia-- the solo performer and the full band-- but made it
    clear that the crowd had to be good during the solo stuff in order to be rewarded with a full band show.
    Molina had a right to expect an attentive crowd, having been specially chosen for this non-tour-stop event.
    He began to heckle the room as it socialized throughout his set and drowned out his mopey, <i>Pyramid</i>-ish
    hero-and-guitar material.  ""Why did you ask me to come here?""  ""I'm not doing anything until you shut up.""
    Etc.</p><p>
    
    He tailored his set to a semicircle of anemic boys and girls who tried to ""feel it,"" honest, but Molina's
    fragmented, voyeuristic ballads can seem self-directed and standoffish.  Just before the show devolved into
    a filibuster, Molina gave the good kids two full band songs (one of which was the majestically serious
    ""Farewell Transmission"", from what would be his final album as Songs: Ohia), and then told them that he'd
    planned to do more, but oh well, not now, you drove-all-night-to-see-me shitbonnets.  One year later,
    opening for Enon, Molina would ""rock out"" the whole set, and remain humble-- affable, even-- as if he knew
    the squirmy throng lacked the patience to comprehend his one-man chariots of fire.</p><p>
<b>Exhibit B: The Velvet Underground's Moe Tucker, in the Half Japanese documentary <i>The Band That Would
    Be King</i>, twice bemoans how ""sick"" it is that fringe artists have no chance of ""making a limited living""
    via their music because they are denied access to major means of publicity and distribution.</b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit B: But, but, but Moe!  Even in this freest of states, we can't just do what we want and
    sustain ourselves.  Within the existing structures that bind this planet's inhabitants, we can't all go
    write poems and massage pianos and practice your patented doon-doon-doon-PUH on our skins.  Who would build
    airports and overpasses and laundromats?  Whose punk fancy would those endeavors fulfill?  And perhaps
    fringe artists such as Jason Molina are too plucky and impulsive for mass consumption.</p><p>
    
    Molina obviously lives for the song itself and its power to baptize his (or his characters') demons.  If
    he were market- or fiscal-survival-driven, why would he interrupt his thrilling evolution with this
    recorded-in-2001, stripped-down, ""vinyl-only"" throwback to least-beloved discography-cloggers such as
    <i>Our Golden Ratio</i> and <i>The Ghost</i>?  Those aggrieved collections contain naught but solo murk.
    Why didn't Molina ""return to basics"" with some interesting noise-tracks and drums, as he did to liven up
    <i>Protection Spells</i>?  And if he was going on sabbatical from Albini, to skulk back into Mike Mogis'
    arms, why not hang some atmospheric scraps on the songs' bones, as he did on the incomparably haunting and
    underrated <i>Ghost Tropic</i>?</p><p>
<b>Exhibit C: ""Using images from the craft, scientists have determined the age of the universe, about 13.7
    billion years, and discovered that a mysterious energy, called the dark force, is causing all of the objects
    in the universe to move apart at an accelerating rate.  This force is still poorly understood.""
            --Paul Recer, Associated Press, January 2004</b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit C: From news item entitled ""U.S. Allowing Hubble Telescope to Degrade"".  Try to connect
    these dots: Jason Molina allowed Songs: Ohia to degrade.  Often, humans celebrate their ""earthiness"" by
    broadcasting their affinity for ""red"" mud.  NASA is refocusing at the behest of an unelected defense-industry
    bitch.  They are shifting their energies to the moon, a hunk of dead rock on which our country won a
    gladiatorial drag race/pissing contest with ""red"" Russia (resulting in the mass manufacture of Tang, Velcro
    and lubricants for machines as well as humans).  Jason Molina has shifted his energies to utilities concerns,
    such as Magnolia Electric Company, but he frequently refers to the moon.  Mars is the ""red planet.""
    <i>Pyramid</i> contains a cathedral-wrecking piano dirge entitled ""Red Comet Dust"".  Interplanetary travel
    is as excruciatingly slow as this album.  I think you can detect the conspiracy-dandruff here.  When
    MolinaGate blows wide open, we will learn how he maintains such a grip on the dark cosmic force, while
    proclaiming, ""I want to be true like the solid earth."" (A death wish?)</p><p>
<b>Exhibit D:  Since he busted onto the scene in 1995, Jason Molina has released an estimated 23 songs
    that are over seven minutes long.</b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit D: ""Jason Molina"" is not a post-rock quintet, nor is he Bob Dylan, but this record's best
    songs are the monsters.  ""Long Desert Train"" is the least adorned and most traditional, and its list of
    insecurities is harrowing.  The title track is Mogis' showpiece, as Molina sounds like he's reluctantly
    gigging at a wedding chapel on a tin replica of Noah's ark.  The song is about ""our"" adaptability to
    heinousness.  (Molina loves these kinds of generalizations, things ""we all"" go through.)  ""You'll have
    friends who won't come home/ You'll see their bones not separate yet from death/ You'll get used to it.""
    Need I mention the war on war?  Need I mention that death is a character on most of this album's songs,
    an active participant with fireballs and a language?  ""Honey, Watch Your Ass"" is one of the best Molina
    compositions ever, <i>ever</i>, and it convicts its neighbors of slightness.  Despite a lyric that hands
    critics a hammer (""It's like nothing's got a pulse""), the song communicates its danger, passion and
    withdrawal vividly and urgently.  The clunkiness of some of the other songs' lyrics, and the inevitability
    of their imagery must be embarrassed to run up against showstoppers such as, ""She smells a little like a
    train.""</p><p>
<b>Exhibit E: ""In a world without sadness what would there be to encourage attachment to our children or
    our partners?""<br/>
            --Lewis Wolpert, <i>Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression</i></b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit E: The reviewer's mother spent one Christmas-- this woman loves Christmas-- in solitary confinement at a state
    prison.  One of the reviewer's high-school girlfriends just got killed in Iraq.  The reviewer's exercise
    bulimia has reached stage four (called ""Omelet Equals Treadmill"" by doctors).  Sanatorium residence runs
    in his family.  The poor reviewer, impervious to ""real-world"" pathos, regularly weeps along to albums,
    having disproportionately privileged their status as safely manipulative/triggering commodities.  The
    reviewer takes Jason Molina too seriously, having collected all of his releases, as if they were buffers
    against some fundamental lack.  But even the reviewer can find mirth and consolation, in a bawdy Britcom,
    or a backyard fight between a raccoon and a cat.  Just as Elliott Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"" was perfect
    for the suicide-attempt scene in <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>, any song on this album would complement a
    still-photo montage of a prolonged labor ending in a miscarriage.</p><p>
<b>Exhibit F: ""Don't believe the hype.""<br/>
            --Public Enemy, <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</i></b></p><p>
    
    Note - Exhibit F: Secretly Canadian's website explains that Molina camped out in the studio like Mary Shelley
    for this album, but the album's songs keep their distance from the listener.  Molina feels everything, to an
    almost macho, almost Russell Crowe extreme.  Secretly Canadian cites the vocals of Ali Farka Toure, but the
    reviewer only hears the guitars of Ry Cooder, or slowed-down soul/funk greats, in Molina's choral, and
    occasionally erect vibrato.  Keeping this album would be like saving some shed space for a cool-looking
    but dead lawnmower.  <i>Pyramid Electric Co.</i> is a thing of beauty and mystery, but its skin is chafed
    from wallowing, and I am its Debra Winger, slurping up mascara.  If you ""get"" it, congratulations; you're
    impenetrable.</p></div>"|5565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5565-pyramid-electric-co/|6.9|William Bowers

    have been obsessed over, while the plugged-in, underground jangle-pop of the early 80s remains obfuscated
    like the mossy gray overgrowth on the cover of <i>Murmur</i>.  Fortunately, recent weeks have seen reissues
    of albums by the Mitch Easter-fronted jangle-pop band Let's Active, and now, Rochester-based Absolute Grey.
    Largely forgotten upstate-- save for a handful of fliers, an entry in <i>Trouser Press</i>, and generous
    remembrances by band peer Peter Buck, Bangs biographer Jim DeRogatis and former Forced Exposure scribe Byron
    Coley-- Absolute Grey's last LPs only saw daylight in Greece.  Now, hoping to set matters straight, DBK has
    given their debut the remastered treatment.</p><p>
    
    Beth Brown's melodic yearning on ""Saving Face"" hints at an alternate universe in which R.E.M. was femme-fronted,
    though its Rickenbacker jangle is more receptive than Buck's and its rhythm not quite so wooden as it breathes
    and spirals through longer six-minute pop structures.  On ""More Walnuts"", a feeling of teen love resounds
    with a solid, slightly psychoactive backbeat, the new world's apologetic ""So. Central Rain"".  Other tunes
    like ""Sidewalk"" and ""Remorse"" sport the spartan instrument flange that echoes other paisley poppers of their
    day, not to mention the tint (and bangs) of Echo &amp; The Bunnymen.  Bolstering these studio baby-steps, this
    new edition of <i>Greenhouse</i> is augmented by a live version of their ""Memory of You"" and an
    underground-obligatory cover of the Velvets' ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"".  Both show the peppy
    exuberance and limber interplay between drummer Patrick Thomas and bassist Mitch Rasor, giving Brown's
    voice plenty of room to soar.</p><p>
    
    The album is also accompanied by a live disc whose title, <i>Bless Their Pointed Little Heads: Live at
    Scorgie's</i> bares the group's adoration of circa-'67 Jefferson Airplane (it should not be bemused as
    expansion upon their earlier live album, <i>A Journey Through the Past</i>, which evokes Neil Young).
    It shows the band indulging in a more psychedelic space, leaning towards early Fillmore West music expansion
    within pop structures, while similarly maintaining diligence in the face of extended jamming proclivities.
    The ""poetry"" cringes at moments, though, and Brown's out-of-nowhere screech of ""We hate ice cream... the
    mouse ran up the clock!"" breaks the otherwise hypnotic and harrowing mood of ""Two Years a Handshake"".</p><p>
    
    Only four songs from <i>Greenhouse</i> are documented live; the recording instead chooses to showcase the
    band's songwriting range, which not only rocks out with ""Getting Me Down"" and ""Candy Canes"", but also
    includes The Dream Syndicate's ""Tell Me When It's Over"".  Before they shoot through ""Willow"" (complete
    with a brief, quicksilver soaring inside its instrumental break), Absolute Grey use their brief time
    onstage to breathlessly insist that the audience go see Invisible Party, Pat Casket, and Personal Effects
    open for Alex Chilton, still relatively unknown himself.  For a second, it sounds as if they were already
    aware of the impermanent aspect of underground pop and the giddiness of its unimportant importance.</p></div>"|419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/419-greenhouse-20th-anniversary-edition/|7.7|Andy Beta

    <i>Cloudz</i> is not only markedly different from his earlier records, it's also an album so internally
    varied that it feels almost genreless, coyly hopping from ambient ooze to craggy noise to thick, droning
    waves of guitar.  Considering Bower's ample discography as an avant-noise artist, it was once reasonable
    to accuse him of cribbing an agenda from his mold-cracking predecessors (see: Rhys Chatham, Glenn Branca,
    La Monte Young).  But no matter how heavily annotated his previous work may have been, <i>Cloudz</i> is a
    stubbornly contemporary record, taking its cues from modern technology and aesthetics.</p><p>
    
    For those familiar with Bower's former experiments, both as Sunroof! and with his old band Skullflower,
    <i>Cloudz</i> may seem like a shockingly docile departure, without a single hike into harsh, bleating,
    feedback-heavy noise.  Instead, Bower serves pretty half-melodies and blurry, pre-dawn beats, sketching
    a vague, meandering, half-lit landscape.  Even at its most aggressive, <i>Cloudz</i> is still far more
    gentle and inviting than anything else Bower has done, and while the sudden shift into tranquility (slyly
    hinted at on the second disc of 2002's <i>Bliss</i>) might perplex some longtime fans, it also backhandedly
    suggests that Bower's frame of reference has finally expanded to include some of his current droner-peers
    (see: the easy atmospherics of Labradford or Stars of the Lid).</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, each song on <i>Cloudz</i> has been designated its own ""cloud,"" qualified only by a
    corresponding track number.  Ultimately, Bower's additional nomenclature is almost laughably unnecessary,
    considering that these compositions evoke more than enough white, wispy images all on their own.  Cloud
    One, the buoyant ""Machine"", layers loads of smooth, chirping bleeps (including samples of twittering birds)
    over a soft piano line, each tone just sweet enough to sound vaguely celestial, building nearly ten minutes
    of peaceable, meandering light.  ""Viva"" mixes in bits of crank and crunch; ""Tornado Rose Canoe"" is packed
    with Bower's classic guitar squeal, including a big, sweaty electric solo.</p><p>
    
    While occasionally mesmerizing, <i>Cloudz</i> is still more effective in theory than it is in practice.
    Extended exposure quickly reveals the gaps in his matrix: Bower's aggressive pursuit of diversity, while
    not necessarily responsible for an inherently disjointed product, does break the sense of cohesion and
    atmospherics that's necessary for these sorts of albums to function well over time.  By opting for internal

    reckoned it could only be assessed via method acting.  But after countless listens, I realized that drinking
    four Clearchannels (one-third organic apple juice, one-third expensive gin, one-third cheap saki-- the kind
    with an ""intended for cooking"" sticker) wasn't enough.  To truly pull a Clinton on this album's pain, I
    would have had to freebase suppositories, disown my circle, and score some fabric softener so the noose
    wouldn't burn as much.</p><p>
    
    The good folks at Texas Instruments helped to determine the rating above, based on an average calculation
    of the 9.9 this release deserved for its conception and off-putting bravery, and the 3.9 it earns due to
    par loops and too-precious delivery.  <i>The Young Machines</i> will rank among your favorite albums if
    you're someone's mortifyingly jaded ex, but if you come to it craving electronic vocal-pop keeping pace
    with anything north of Jimmy Tamborello's shoulders, you'll end up frustrated by the simple and repetitive
    violin bits that drive the big retro beats of ""Tech Romance"", ""Girl Problem"" and ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"".
    These stately, neutered forays into gangsta's paradise don't do enough with their chamber-hop, though
    ""Boyfriend""'s choral punk-out at least adds variety.  Lest you think any kind of rap reference is a sad
    stretch when discussing Her Space Holiday: the album was not just released on the primarily underground
    hip-hop label Mush, but its liner notes' brief shoutouts additionally thank Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, The
    Streets, cLOUDDEAD, and The Neptunes.  This ain't your father's digital shoegaze.</p><p>
    
    Mark Bianchi's life was in the shitter, if his lyrics can be trusted, yet his blippy backing tracks, despite
    their limitations (his own songs sound like his remixes of others' songs, etc) remain oddly ascendant in
    tone-- some of these could serve as Muzak for a tourist-town's rainforest or seahorse exhibit.  The title
    track (and what a title, awesome in its own right, and suggesting such triumphs as the Young Fresh Fellows,
    Marble Giants, Gods, People, legend Neil, TV on the Radio's <i>Liars</i>, The Constantines' ""Lions"", and
    Pavement's Gary) is a stunner, a kind of IDM take on <i>The Ice Storm</i>'s score, with anime musicboxery,
    and are those voices saying ""let go"" and ""save me?""  Avant-guardians will ruin my fun by crying Moby, but
    dig the layered reprise on ""The Luxury of Loneliness"".</p><p>
    
    ""Meet the Pressure"" is a bitchslap to Bianchi's negative reviews and reviewers. I sympathize with the man's
    point: the de-evolution of labor involved in blurbiage and its reception is disheartening.</p><p>
    
    1. An artist labors to fashion an album.</p><p>
    
    2. A critic half-labors to fashion a review about how the album wasn't messianic.</p><p>
    
    3. A webboarder calls the critic a bald ugly fag.</p><p>
    
    4. A lurker misregurges the webboarder in an IM to his cousin: ""Don't download that band; their junk'll be
    stoops.""</p><p>
    
    Bianchi's song is about meanness, revenge and lyric-misquoting.  He includes a sample from an answering
    machine about his ""Internet press"" after he says some crits are ""hoping that their viciousness will boost
    traffic on their site.""  But then he ruins his complicated rumination on the indie ""media"" with a fantasy
    (?) about the critic being cuckolded.  I had to think of some of the disses my inbox has weathered (from
    artists I like, such as Ween and Cex) and the sensitivity expressed by other artists (Aereogramme and
    Songs: Ohia, who asked for my address-- I cling every night to my crossbow, Molina, with a Cape Fear
    tripwire around my lhasa apso).</p><p>
    
    So if you're up to hearing what Kurtis Blow would sound like on Saddle Creek, or if you love cinematic
    self-vigilantism, or cover artwork that places engine gears in women's wombs, or if you've been waiting
    for a breakdown album since Kramer's <i>The Guilt Trip</i>, or if you can dig how ""Japanese Gum"" conjures
    a mood by suggesting Black Black brand (Engrish fans know their slogan ""Hi-Technical Taste and Flavor!""),
    buy <i>The Young Machines</i>.  Few albums about druggies dealing with the death of a grandmother are as
    stark.  Bianchi even admits to missing his mom at one intermittently moving point.  But when his liner notes
    claim he doesn't deserve any of his fans, he's being way too hard on himself.  Hopefully his devotees know
    their suicide watch etiquette.</p></div>"|3826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3826-the-young-machines/|6.9|William Bowers

    60s-influenced psych juggernaut they got rolling into a mesmerizing drone-rock hybrid seven years ago;
    every album has demonstrated constant development toward their uniquely iterative rock dynamic.  No matter
    what the current musical climate, Oneida have never deviated from their unique sense of manifest destiny.
    The goal is outwardly simple; for seven years these Brooklyn boys have been striving for nothing more than
    the single Perfect Riff, the fundamentally isolated element around which all songs can be built.  The
    ancient Greeks knew it in legend; medieval astronomers predicted its eventual return through the movement
    of planets, but none ever witnessed the Return itself.  The Hippies may have come the closest, dropping
    acid and swallowing Quaaludes in the hopes of just glimpsing it; some found inspiration in their quest and
    paved the way for others to follow, but the One True Riff was still never found.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps not for much longer: Oneida know things that mere mortals do not, and they can see things no
    one else can see; time was, they were prone to acid flashback meltdowns and psych jams like their forefathers,
    but recently, Oneida have begun to surpass mere psychedelia into the realm of pure hypnosis.  <i>Each One
    Teach One</i> devoted an entire disc to the exploration of the phenomenon.  It was music as anesthetic,
    pummeling listeners with cascading sheets of sounds, piling repetition atop repetition until the mounting
    pressure revealed a diamond, the One True Riff.  Possession and knowledge are separate things, though, and
    the path to mastery did not come quickly enough to save that album from misuse and abuse of the newfound
    power.  <i>Secret Wars</i> is the first step toward the combination of Oneida's monolithic psych-rock and
    the numbing riff iteration they've spent so long deriving.</p><p>
    
    The foundation of <i>Secret Wars</i> is repetition on a massive scale; songs are built atop the constant
    cycling of hyper-minimal progressions, fairly bludgeoning the listener into a state of docility with as
    minimal an approach as possible.  Sometimes Fat Bobby provides the key hook on the organ, other times Hanoi
    Jane's bass locks the groove, but the end results are almost always uniform: spiraling, acid-washed descents
    into cultivated monotony based on little more than bar or two stacked again and again.  For the first time,
    though, they've figured out how to tweak the patterns, modify them without breaking them, and seamlessly
    mesh these forays into drone with the psych-rock in which they've always been so proficient.  ""$50 Tea"" may
    be the most perfect example; the shrieking organ-grind from Hell begins the cycle, but slowly gives way to
    pounding bass and guitar underneath the trance-like vocals, and each instrument comes to the fore to carry
    the drone before the song's end.</p><p>
    
    ""The Winter Shaker"" and ""Changes in the City"" play like a continuation of ""Sheets of Easter"", full of
    plodding riffs like a shot of novocaine to the frontal lobe, but this time with dirge-like vocals to match,
    seeing the album to its natural conclusion in turn.  Again, the results are startlingly effective, taking
    hold at some primal, subconscious level and holding on until the end, but by being the most overwrought of
    the bunch, they highlight a few of Oneida's remaining faults: when reduced to just a storm of looping noise,
    the sonic concussion they create is easier to shake off, and more importantly, they're hampered by some
    not-insignificant production issues.  For all of their bombast, the mix on <i>Secret Wars</i> is totally
    flat; vocals are strained, and the waves of sound aren't as immediately imposing as they ought to be.  To
    be truly effective, Oneida needs to tower over the listener, and in that respect, they still fall short.
    Nevertheless, <i>Secret Wars</i> is the first really unified effort Oneida has been able to construct,
    finally striking the perfect balance between the classic slabs of psych you grew up on and new-school
    mind-control.  They still have some studio issues to work out, but those are only a matter of time, so
    savor your remaining independent thought while you can; by next album it may be too late.</p></div>"|5999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5999-secret-wars/|7.8|Eric Carr

    incorporated into movie soundtracks thus far have been fairly unconvincing.  Anyone who remembers the
    Ashley Judd Oscar bid, <i>Someone Like You</i>, knows both that a wristwatch will disappear if you
    unflinchingly stare at it for more than an hour in a dark theatre, and that <i>69 Love Songs</i>'
    ""Absolutely Cuckoo"" didn't exactly fit into the proceedings.  Fighting back the inclination to blame all
    our pop music woes on the Judd family yet again, the incompatibility of Merritt and the movies is probably
    the electro-troubadour's own fault: his music is just too witty, too perceptive, and too memorable to make
    any sense in another medium.  Still, if someone put a Howitzer to an ambitious filmmaker's head and told
    them to make some sort of Merritt vehicle (trust me, this happens all the time if you stay out too late on
    4th Street in Downtown L.A.), the only satisfactory result would have to be about frigid undergraduates
    seducing wintry laundromat workers in libraries.</p><p>
    
    It was with weary eyes, then, that the world received Merritt's first album-length soundtrack for 2002's
    ode to statutory rape, <i>Eban &amp; Charley</i>.  The franchise was underwhelming to say the least, the only
    similarity between the album and the movie being that shy, barrette-fastened teenagers bought them for
    birthday presents to seem controversially sophisticated.  Now, because Merritt is eminently, eccentrically
    charismatic (and because 90 percent of his career output has been worthwhile), we're willing to give him
    another chance-- particularly because the film he's scoring stars a pseudo-post-goth, emotionally fragile
    Katie Holmes reconciling with a dope-smoking cancer victim.</p><p>
    
    Though it's as close to a perfect setting as the music could get, the actual movie didn't give much presence
    to these songs (excepting the one written specifically for it).  Regardless, <i>Pieces of April</i> stacks
    four new Magnetic Fields songs (none of which were even in the movie), one new Merritt song, and five
    previously released Magnetic Fields/6ths songs on one shorter-than-the-movie's-theatrical-run 27-minute
    CD.  The new Magnetic Fields songs will, thankfully, not raise any eyebrows; the enthusiasm and sparkling
    spontaneity is, like always, pressed into ukuleles and tucked into preposterously addictive Yamaha sound
    settings circa 1985.</p><p>
    
    ""Dreams Anymore"" has the sort of lambent whimsy-chimes that accompany all good dream
    sequences while the lyrics and the ever-imperious harmonium solo do everything in their power to disown
    that image ""'cause she don't believe in dreams anymore.""  ""Stray with Me"" is not nearly as engrossing: it
    proves you can add however much cello you want to a song and it can still sound like a bad Eels B-side with
    a Jimmy Buffett bassline and lyrics worse than the titular pun.  Merritt's ""One April Day"", the only song
    specifically commissioned for the movie (and given any substantial screen time) is quiet, pleasant,
    ignorable, and full of sparse mandolin and light tambourine.  Needless to say, it sounds like a soundtrack
    when the cardinal rule of a good soundtrack is to do whatever's necessary to make sure the album doesn't
    just sound like a soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    With that in mind, the other two additions are easy to savor, particularly in contrast.  ""Heather Heather""
    begrimes Merritt's music box effects and has some genuinely arresting lines: ""We belong together/ Like sex
    and violence/ Like death and silence.""  Strangely, it gets progressively more rocksteady in the last 30
    seconds, which is either brilliant or incoherent depending on your intelligence.  There's also one song
    that fills enough criteria to clearly announce its candidacy for ""great song"" status:  ""All I Want to Know""
    has the usual slender drums, bells and synths, but the chorus, built off of an erratically simmering uke
    solo, is an expanding pop incline performed with just the right vocal histrionics, while the lyrics are as
    knowingly torn between irony and sincerity as anything Merritt's ever recorded: ""Is there nothing nohow
    left to save?/ Tell me tonight or not at all/ We'll have to fight/ I can make last call, and play a little
    pinball.""</p><p>
    
    Even if it's not in your Top 10, it smashes the smattering of 6ths tunes on here, all from the unresponsively
    received and unresponsively performed 2000 album, <i>Hyacinths and Thistles</i>.  The Momus collaboration,
    ""As You Turn to Go"", is lethargic, tedious and haphazardly instrumented.  It should be the perfect place to
    highlight the lyrics (or at least it would be if they weren't so uncharacteristically vapid and painstakingly
    grumbled).  Luckily, the remaining are all ""First Song on Your 1999 Mix Tape"" cuts from <i>69 Love Songs</i>:
    the barbershop-enunciated reverent country-rock clomp, ""Epitaph for My Heart""; the trotting, giddily
    reflexive ""I Think I Need a New Heart""; and the flopping, carnivalesque chorus of ""The Luckiest Guy on the
    Lower East Side"".</p><p>
    
    Any Merritt fan worth their daintily-held white burgundy probably owns five of the ten songs on here.  When
    we use calculus, we find that this means the average Merritt fan will be spending upwards of $11 on thirteen
    minutes of new music.  That's about $1.20 a minute, and unless you're receiving aural, intellectual and
    physical pleasure during that period, that's just too much.  If, on the other hand, you saw the movie,
    decided the music held some promise (or just find the movie so remarkable you need to constantly evoke it)
    and wanted a quick sampler, this is a cautious buy/download on your way to the Magnetic Fields full-length
    that's supposed to be released later this year.</p></div>"|5239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5239-pieces-of-april/|7.2|Alex Linhardt

    session down the hall from his own.  As the story goes, Wilson was hanging at Studio Three West with <i>Pet
    Sounds</i> collaborator Gary Usher in the spring of 1966 when he caught snippets of a recording conducted by
    21-year-old wunderkind Curt Boettcher.  Boettcher, fresh from producing The Association's first record, and
    with something of a rare talent for soaring, angelic vocal arrangements along the lines of Wilson's very own,
    took Wilson and Usher by complete surprise.  In fact, legend has it that Boettcher's ability to produce
    majestically layered instrumental and vocal pieces seemingly at the drop of a hat threw Wilson for a loop,
    and is rumored to have started the breakdown that would ultimately destroy his <i>Smile</i> project, and
    indeed his life ever after.</p><p>
    
    Even if you don't buy the story, Boettcher's effect on L.A. pop cannot be denied.  Usher would soon pull
    him in as a collaborator on what would later become <i>Present Tense</i> by Sagittarius, a psych-pop outfit
    whose only LP is one of the great, lost classics of ""sunshine pop.""  Boettcher's other major projects in
    the 60s were work with his own band The Ballroom, and later, a curiously overlooked record by songwriter
    supergroup The Millennium.  In addition to his love of exquisite harmony vocals, Boettcher's stereo
    productions were remarkably crisp for the time-- certainly more so that Wilson's concurrent adventures in
    mono.  I'd say Boettcher's own songs (and that of most sunshine pop artists) usually weren't of the same
    depth as Wilson's, but that's another argument.</p><p>
    
    The Millennium was comprised of several successful songwriters and musicians living and working in Los
    Angeles in the mid-60s, including Lee Mallory, Sandy Salisbury and Joey Stec.  All had worked with or
    around Boettcher and Usher, and proved themselves capable of delivering on what would become the largest
    recording budget in Columbia Records' history to that point.  Their result was 1968's <i>Begin</i>, and
    though it's probably the single greatest 60s pop record produced in L.A. outside of The Beach Boys, it
    (like Wilson's music) found itself very much outside the times that year.  After <i>Begin</i> tanked, the
    band was dropped from Columbia-- setting up the perfect cult record years later.  Of course, the band had
    planned to make many more albums, and <i>Pieces</i> collects demos intended for their follow-up.</p><p>
    
    Anyone hip to The Millennium or other Boettcher projects might recognize many of the songs here, as they've
    been released before as <i>Again</i>, though <i>Pieces</i> includes many tracks that failed to make that
    compilation.  Most importantly, almost all of these songs will be of interest to folks looking for perfect
    pop in the mold of The Association, Beach Boys and even into the budding country-rock of The Byrds.  ""I
    Just Don't Know How to Say Goodbye"" is an almost perfect realization of the styles of each of those artists,
    though the tune and loose, gentle optimism of Salisbury's vocal give it a strength to stand on its own.
    The song, with rising, major-key guitar figures and a folkish bent (much of this music could have worked
    in a completely acoustic setting) did show up on Salisbury's 1968 solo LP.</p><p>
    
    ""Can You See"" is one of many Stec/Michael Fennelly songs (the pair was also responsible for the magnificent
    ""To Claudia on Thursday"" from <i>Begin</i>), and is a typically upbeat, sunny tune that might pass for The
    Monkees were it not for its surprisingly down-to-earth lyrics lamenting love lost over material concerns.
    The strength of the writing throughout the album is such that the band's failure to break through is a
    little shocking.  ""How Much I Love You"" is a tender acoustic ballad also penned by Stec and Fennelly, and
    though it probably helped give birth to Jewel mk. I, it's nonetheless at once achingly melancholy and
    performed with professionalism that could have made it a hit in another universe.  The same goes for the
    pair's ""Sometime or Another"", though this actually approaches indie-torch song along the lines Uncle
    Tupelo.</p><p>
    
    Although not every song on <i>Pieces</i> matches up with the band's best, none of it ever really betrays
    its origination as demo recordings.  Boettcher obviously had some hand in this, though since all of the
    band were insiders to some degree, it's not surprising they had access to studios and engineers no other
    similarly unknown band could ever dream of.  Song like ""Suspended Animation"" (first rate country-pop with
    a strange sci-fi theme) or the Beatlesque ""It's You"" sound better than 90% of the music to actually chart
    in 1968.  The latter song in particular, with its pristine harmony vocals and chugging, ""Baby You're a Rich
    Man"" bass work, makes it hard to believe Clive Davis never saw anything in these guys.</p><p>
    
    If all of this is news to you, my advice is to run out in grab a copy of <i>Begin</i>.  After that, check
    out Sagittarius and Boettcher's other projects.  And <i>then</i>, when you think you've run out of sugary
    fun-time pop with a faint dejected edge, head here.  The Millennium deserved better way back when, but
    anyone interested in 60s pop and folk-rock should have no problem digging them now.</p></div>"|5546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5546-pieces/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    wanted to say.  This is a pretty common criticism of bands by people who probably stopped listening to
    the records years ago-- though to be fair, if that's your idea of a flaw, Stereolab are deeply flawed.
    It's certainly something I've considered from time to time.  Why it should come up more often with this
    band than, say, Radiohead, is another question.  Apparently, ""ruts"" are not inherently bad, and it turns
    out the majors have been demonstrating this for as long as ""pop"" meant ""popular.""  No, I don't think the
    fact that Stereolab have been making variations on the same record every year for almost ten years is the
    reason they briefly fell out of favor.  This is fashion, you understand, and if anyone should understand
    the stylish generation, it's the Lab.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Stereolab never really fell ""out of favor,"" per se, but getting two people to agree on the value
    of their indie-pop stock is a tall order.  The main problem is that taking stock of the band's place within
    a contemporary context assumes that they were ever really ""contemporary.""  Even back in the days when they
    might feasibly have been playing ""indie rock,"" all of their musical cues were throwbacks to the vintage
    post-rock power of folks like Neu! and Raymond Scott.  Their imagery was all fluorescents and retro-futuristic
    schemata, even before their music became the same.  Their Marxism was about ten years too late to really be
    cool-- but as they consistently demonstrate, their kind of ""cool"" is, at best, a paradox.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, and perhaps most on point, their music hasn't actually gotten any worse over the years.  That
    may sound like a backhanded compliment, but in the faces of a significant faction of former Stereolab fans
    who think they've gone soft, it's practically blasphemy.  You know, in merely quantitative terms, the ratio
    of good songs on their records is about the same as it was during their perceived mid-90s ""peak,"" and I
    would argue that their music is actually more interesting now.  Their preference for lounge and faux-acid
    jazz textures tend to polarize people, which I guess is a good thing considering my fear of a pending acid
    jazz revival.</p><p>
    
    All of this brings me to <i>Margerine Eclipse</i>.  As a reward for sticking with me this far, I'll get
    right to the point: if you hated <i>Cobra and Phases</i>, <i>Sound-Dust</i> and <i>Dots &amp; Loops</i>, you'll
    probably have little need for Stereolab's eighth proper full-length.  All of the hallmarks of latter-day
    Groop are here: harpsichords, silly (yet great) 70s analog synthesizers with futuristic roto-bossa beats,
    and plenty of dreamy harmonies to fill out the barely existent song structures.  Mary Hansen's presence is
    missed when you hear Laetitia Sadier spot herself on the high vocals, though it's easy enough to imagine
    her back in there if you want.  All of it is very easy, which is a perfect way to sum up a new Stereolab
    record: easy to predict, easy to criticize.  And easy to like.</p><p>
    
    I should come clean in that I never hated post-<i>ETK</i> Stereolab, so the familiar movements of
    <i>Margerine Eclipse</i> aren't really a disappointment as much as yearly revisits from old friends.  When
    the band released an uninspired <i>Instant 0 in the Universe</i> EP in 2003 (coming off their first year
    without new studio material since they started making records), it looked momentarily as if the train was
    stopping.  Now, the notion seems funny because listening to bright, buoyant tunes like ""Le Demeure"" or the
    fantastic opener, ""Vonal Declosion"", reminds me that they'll probably keep going like this until they're
    gone.</p><p>
    
    The aforementioned ""Vonal Declosion"" rings in the new record with a flash and the trill of the Farfisa, as
    the bass dances below Sadier's well-worn rhythmic French nothings.  What's more, as the band transitions
    into a section sounding ripped out of Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking"" and <i>Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>
    incidental music at once, supermarket strings enter on the left and reveal Stereolab's true calling for
    delivering Perfect Pop for Then People.  ""Cosmic Country Noir"" pulls out the classic robotic Wurlitzer drum
    machine patterns for more antiqua-groove, though the main body of the song is more reminiscent of The Free
    Design than Kraftwerk.</p><p>
    
    ""Margerine Rock"" doubles back on Stereolab's way with pop history by sounding most similar to their own
    music, circa <i>Mars Audiac Quintet</i>, even if guitars can't quite mask their now low-key charms.  More
    fitting seems the poignant ""Dear Marge"", with Spanish guitar, gliding Farfisa, percolating synth and
    Sadier's counterpoint vocals so obviously being transmitted to Hansen somewhere off in the cosmos.  The
    song is nostalgic, but handled with such care that its sweetness never approaches saccharine sentiment,
    or worse, stale lounge-pop.  They ensure the song's fate by galloping out on a disco-funk plane right out
    of an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire record.  (Okay, so restraint isn't really Stereolab's thing, but damn it, they
    just have such good taste in sudden disco flashbacks.)</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Margerine Eclipse</i> probably won't be received as a ""return to form,"" other than to say
    it's perfectly in accord with everything they've given us for the last several years.  It won't gather them
    new fans, etc. etc., though I think that's an unfair way to judge a record.  Times have changed, and the
    band hasn't, so you might just as well praise them for sticking to their ideals instead of latching onto
    some trend (Tim Gane does dancepunk, anyone?  Bad example, I'd listen to that).  The best way I can
    think to hear <i>Margerine Eclipse</i> is as another in a line of accomplished, eternally pleasant and
    intermittently brilliant Stereolab records.  Really, it's just that easy.</p></div>"|7502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7502-margerine-eclipse/|7.6|Dominique Leone

After his recent reunion with Alan Vega on 2002's
    <i>American Supreme</i>, Suicide's behind-the-boards man, Martin Rev, offers thirteen new tracks in search
    of songcraft.  Since Rev is the funny old uncle of electroclash, who probably wears his shades in the
    shower and sleeps in leather bedsheets, <i>To Live</i> obviously has no difficulty sounding cool: his
    production is a physical assault, the music marching through what sounds like Boeing's biggest wind
    tunnel.  In fact, playing it on cheap, tinny speakers seems to enhance it: all the colors bleed out to
    leave a violent, blaring grey of guitars and drum machines that loop in hammers through each song, too
    rusty to be industrial and too open-air to pass for tidy dance music.</p><p>
    
    Except the final product is never a ""song.""  Rev eschews choruses and bridges, which would be a fair enough
    approach if the verses consisted of something other than just breathy, inexpressive whispers.  He muffles
    the lyrics so much that sometimes you can only make out the first few words: for one example, ""Places I Go""
    goes, ""Places I go/ [mumble mumble]/ [Something] I [something]/ whsssssssss.""  It's astounding to think
    what Rev could have had if only he'd brought a few decent vocalists in on the project to work off the beats,
    or replace the frankly vacuous lyrics, or to just give the record a focal point.  As it stands, it's hard
    to imagine a bigger waste of great backing tracks.</p><p>
    
    If you could break up the monotony that each of these tracks quickly and effortlessly slips into, you'd
    have amazing productions: each track starts off like a slap in the face, from the overdriven lounge music
    of ""Gutter Rock"" to ""Search for Stone""'s lithe keyboard hook.  The roiling vibes on ""Jaded"" are spacy yet
    smooth, and the fuzzy-noise keyboard instrumental ""Shimmer"" evokes the feeling of having the wax removed
    from your ears and then plugged back in again.</p><p>
    
    Suicide and Martin Rev fans could eat this up if they hone in on the good parts, but it's hard to guess why
    Rev considered these songs complete.  <i>To Live</i> sounds like a workbook, full of half-formed ideas and
    tracks that show incredible potential if fleshed out.  Unfortunately, even as a solo statement it offers
    few clues to Rev's vision beyond his bluntest, most consistent aesthetic preferences: the range of ideas
    is as limited as the sound palette, and Rev's still hiding behind the sunglasses.</p></div>"|6904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6904-to-live/|5.2|Chris Dahlen

Some set out to make
    a masterpiece, others to explore new sounds, and still others can't help reacting to newfound success,
    either by attempting to prove it wasn't a fluke or striving to distance themselves from the formula that
    brought them that success.  And then there are those rare albums that develop organically from weekends
    spent casually recording with friends, miles from spotlights, with virtually no pressure or expectations
    to deliver.  It's tough for an established band to make an album like this, simply because scrutiny colors
    everything a veteran band does, but hundreds if not thousands of ultra-obscure garage bands (and I'm not
    talking about well-funded, Detroit-aping Swedes here) across the country patch together inspired records
    simply by accident every year.</p><p>
    If ever an album fit that description, it's this one, the grab-bag debut from Boston's Bluegrazer, which
    could probably be referred to as a side-project of Hip Tanaka's Joe Pleiman if that band weren't so
    ridiculously obscure themselves.  So there's nothing for these guys to lose for trying everything, and
    try everything they do, piecing together a full CD of scattered ideas, wacky pop songs and assorted fits
    of lunacy, complete with a sort-of-tribute to They Might Be Giants' ""Fingertips"" concept, which comprised
    about 20 short snippets of music that spiced up their <i>Apollo 18</i> album when you set your player to
    ""random.""</p><p>
    Pleiman openly admits that the Johns' influenced his approach, though the Brooklyn-based duo only informs
    his actual sound very slightly.  Truthfully, the 26 tracks on the album are about as focused as a Jackson
    Pollack painting, some of them sounding like they were banged out from conception to what you're hearing
    in about a half hour; others, like ""Turn It Over"", with its delay-drenched, angelic refrain and dry,
    aggressive verses, obviously took a lot of thought and post-production tinkering.  There's total fluff
    like ""Jam On"", a hooky indie rock two-step that's so casually ingratiating you won't even notice how sticky
    it is until you're singing it in the car two days later, and über-oddities like ""Brendan Smith"", which is
    basically instrumental Wesley Willis, a bleepy Casio jam that seems designed purely to amuse.</p><p>
    And then there's ""Word"", a great process piece that features a nasty fuzz bass and some surprisingly solid
    beats behind a collage of one-word answering machine messages Pleiman had his friends leave him.  You get
    over-eager participants yelling things like ""Schmoopies!"" and more low-key offerings like ""verisimilitude,""
    ""Netherlands,"" ""moist"", and, perhaps most tellingly, ""fingertips,"" but it's the way the music reacts to
    what's being said that makes it more than just a novel idea.</p><p>
    Of course, amidst all the faux-country trucker songs, wistful folk tunes cropping up out of nowhere, and
    spiky, extemporaneous pop songs, it's really easy for a quietly fantastic song like ""Sister Sue"", with its
    flypaper melody and great off-the-cuff harmonies, to get lost, or at least hidden, in the shuffle.  And
    that's really the biggest criticism you can level at <i>The Bluegrazer Album</i>.  It's all over the place,
    and in its wanderings, it occasionally steps in something unpleasant or surrounds a great song with two
    pretty mediocre ones.  Still, for all its unevenness, this album is about as much fun as you can have in
    73 minutes without resorting to substance abuse.</p></div>"|1099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1099-the-bluegrazer-album/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    Zachary Mastoon) offers all sorts of mixed signifiers on the <i>Blurred July</i> EP, his miniature follow-up
    to last year's full-length debut, <i>Stars on My Ceiling</i>.  Falling somewhere between lite-jazz, <i>TNT</i>-era
    Tortoise, Four Tet incidentalism, and aesthetically correct elevator chops, <i>Blurred July</i> includes
    three post-rock/hip-hop instrumentals, plus one slightly raucous vocal jam presided over by labelmate
    Diverse.</p><p>
    
    Despite his knack for post-rock pastiche, Caural remains difficult to pin down.  A recent piece he
    contribute to <i>Dusted Magazine</i> mentions Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold Vein</i>, Minor Threat's
    <i>Complete Discography</i>, the sheen of Slowdive and MBV, and Mille Plateaux's experimental ambient
    works as important musical building blocks.  <i>Blurred July</i>, decorated by UK graffiti artist/MC Kid
    Acne (of Toah Dynamic), evokes old-school hip-hop commingling with underground comic books, Saturday morning
    cartoons and electronica-minded Flash sites.  Or, though you may never see these masterminds in one sentence
    again, imagine the teeming gentleness of Nobukazu Takemura's <i>Child &amp; Magic</i> revamped and expanded to
    include the moodier, noir moments of Glenn Frey's ""You Belong to the City"".</p><p>
    
    Further complicating the catch phraseology, Mastoon gets all literary on us.  If you've read Haruki Murakami's
    <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, the opening track ""Goodbye May Kasahara"" offers additional resonance.
    Begin by peeling back the Rhodes and pay especial attention to anything vaguely reminiscent of Murakami's
    mysterious and charming teenage character, May Kasahara.  Maybe her unread letters, slight limp, beloved
    duck people.  Nothing.  If you take a step back, ""Goodbye, May Kasahara"" (note the comma) is the last
    sentence spoken by <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>'s main character, Toru Okada (aka Mr. Wind-Up Bird).
    He's said it a couple of times, but at narrative's end, it's an unwilling renunciation of a more childlike
    path in life, a world of lemon drops, back-porch crushes and nervous kisses.  Instead, Okada walks headfirst
    into a crumbling marriage, solitary ruminations, duty, adulthood's various shades of grey.</p><p>
    
    I admire the romantic spirit.  Though ""Goodbye May Kasahara"" doesn't capture the importance of this subtle
    departing sentiment, it is a pretty track.  Beginning with fractured percussion enveloped by applause (and
    then more interspersed, pronounced handclaps), the song's accented by vibes, brushed snare, rattling shakers,
    vocal sighs, the strains of mechanization.  Things pick up with a more pronounced drumbeat, the repetition
    of hi-hat, bass swells.  I'd compare it to Susumu Yokota's ""Sky Blue"" or mention the acoustic/analog/synth
    vibe of Max Tundra's <i>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i> without as many dips, shifts or sways.
    And then where?</p><p>
    
    The second track, ""Blacktops and Plains"", confuses its forefather's easy-listening sleepwalk with Diverse's
    casually smooth, scattershot one-liners.  An even more syrupy Jay-Z in love with fifty-cent words, he delivers
    his spiel over a busted-up and distorted drum track.  The real charm's his laidback, mumbled chorus: ""Tryin'
    to open up your blacktops and plains.""  Back on the original path, ""Visuals"" is a feast of rain stick,
    electronics, cymbal reverb, soft percussion and backwards dissolves.  Caural samples a girl's voice and
    spits it back out in a leisurely, well-spaced loop.  Yeah, digital-age Rod McKuen.  Or a more structured,
    poppy take on Fennesz's ""Paint It Black"".  Or Lali Puna veering onto an anonymous German countryside.  The
    finale, ""Sipping Snake Blood Wine (Savath &amp; Savalas Remix)"" is the Scott Herren remix of a track that first
    appeared on <i>Stars on My Ceiling</i>.  This version removes the hectic sloppy kiss drumming of the
    original (it always reminded me of a cardboard 2x4) and replaces it with a sleepier percussive track. On
    the whole, the remix is cleaner than the original, jibing well with the other compositions.</p><p>
    
    All this to say: okay, I'm not sure how to label Caural.  In some ways, <i>Blurred July</i>'s nothing more
    than another installment of trip-hop built-on Grade A influences, but Mastoon pursues his craft with enough
    creativity and smarts that, instead of spending time being dismissive, I'm just wondering where he plans
    to go next.</p></div>"|1353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1353-blurred-july-ep/|7.2|Brandon Stosuy

    and chances are, he knows it.  Over the course of his almost two-decade-long career, the former Afghan
    Whigs guru and current Twilight Singers mastermind has rarely deviated from the oversexed, drugged-out
    rock 'n' soul persona to which he so aggressively plays.  Less a gimmick than a stylistic trait, his image
    and thematic technique has served him well: <i>Congregation</i>, <i>Black Love</i>, and the certifiable
    indie classic <i>Gentlemen</i> aren't just the sound of harrowing confessionals set against searing,
    stabbing guitar abuse and distorted squall, but also of a man at the top of his game achieving what he'd
    set out to accomplish from the very start: make brilliant rock records.</p><p>
    Though he basically perfected his volatile blend of bar-table theatrics, melodramatic soul pomp, and
    Jaggerian rock swagger his first day on the job, it isn't necessarily such a bad thing that Dulli hasn't
    exactly been pushing the creative envelope of late.  In fact, Dulli's music tends to suffer more from
    experimentation.  In 2000, after six albums and fourteen years of Afghan Whigs, he conceived the Twilight
    Singers, a side project whose revolving lineup of diverse musicians was recruited as a means of freeing him
    from the confines of his identity as The Afghan Whigs' seething, dejected crowned prince.  However, their
    unrelentingly demure debut, <i>Twilight</i>, proved Dulli's frothy croon is better suited to roaring
    accompaniment that can match the intensity of his cutting delivery.</p><p>
    Thankfully, this kind of debauched, emotive overload makes a return on the Twilight Singers' latest,
    <i>Blackberry Belle</i>.  There are moments on this record in which Dulli's band-- featuring guest spots by
    everyone from Prince protégé Apollonia, to That Dog alumna Petra Haden, to ex-Screaming Trees frontman Mark
    Lanegan-- flawlessly recreates the vibe of the Whigs' heyday.  Album highlight ""Teenage Wristband"" is a
    piano-driven cocktail of self-destruction, showcasing Dulli's penchant for rock bombast and spite-driven
    vocal histrionics.  Even ethereal female background vocals from Apollonia and Haden can't cool Dulli down,
    as he menacingly coos, ""You wanna go for a riiiide?/ I got sixteen hours to burn and I wanna stay up all
    niiiighht.""  ""The Killer"" also marks Dulli's most soulful performance in years; over a suave 2am groove
    and a wash of electric guitar fuzz, he urgently confesses, ""I caught a fever/ A holy fire/ 'Til I was
    crawling on the ceiling.</p><p>
<i>Blackberry Belle</i> is also injected with Dulli's trademark flair for concept; the record kicks off
    with the part-dirge/part-rocker ""Martin Eden"", which pays tribute to the Jack London novel that chronicles
    the exploits of a writer who commits suicide after being exposed to the pressures of fame (there's also a
    quote from the book in the liner notes, as well).  But in standard Dulli fashion, the record's strongest
    trait is his cunning lyrics, which seem more overtly personal here than ever.  This heightened sense of
    intimacy allows the delivery of lyrics like, ""Let me bleed/ For God has come to play/ So play me,"" to
    seem unusually convincing.""</p><p>
    However, for all of Dulli's fantasies of martyrdom, his songs never come off as unrelentingly dark as his
    lyrics.  Unlike the Twilight Singers' debut, Dulli's collaborators on <i>Blackberry Belle</i> most frequently
    serve as sublime accompaniment for his consummate showmanship.  ""Esta Noche""'s proclamations of ""neverlasting
    love"" conclude in a rousing coda of spirited horn accompaniment, courtesy of session pros Kamasi Washington,
    Josh Lampkins and Chris Gray, while Dulli's taunts serve as a careful counterpoint to Jon Skibic's impassioned
    banjo playing on the stirring acoustic ballad ""Papillion"".  Additionally, producer Mike Napolitano lends the
    record a cavernous, gothic ambiance that nicely enhances Dulli's moody musings.</p><p>
    Given this context, it's of little surprise that <i>Blackberry Belle</i>'s finest moment comes in the form
    of the Mark Lanegan duet that serves as the record's closer, ""Number Nine"".  The track is a stumbling
    slow-motion dirge in which Petra Haden's longing violin notes entangle with Richard Ford's melting pedal
    steel lines, and the reverberating melancholy of Hammond Organ chords soothe Lanegan's trembling, gravelly
    basso as he sings Dulli's ravaged lyrics: ""You trouble me, and I ain't myself anymore/ I'm crawling around
    like a whore.""  Whereas the guest vocalists on the Twilight Singers' debut, never seemed quite as inspired
    as Dulli, Lanegan's mercurial turn makes all the difference here, beautifully contrasting Dulli's wavering
    falsetto.  It makes for what is not only the most moving moment on <i>Blackberry Belle</i>, but also one of
    the sublime highlights of Dulli's entire career.</p><p>
    Ultimately, <i>Blackberry Belle</i> comes to serve as a rather inconspicuous career-defining moment for
    Greg Dulli; most songwriters who abandon their main gig to embark on solo ventures fail at recreating any
    of their previously recorded magic.  That Dulli, with more than three years gone since separating from the
    Whigs and one solo flop already behind him, has regained his footing with an album of this caliber now
    separates him from any number of alternarock has-beens and reclaims his relative worth as an indie rock
    should-be.</p></div>"|8211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8211-blackberry-belle/|7.7|Hartley Goldstein

    gawked that year with voyeuristic wonder as their splinter projects, The Gentle Waves and Looper, slid
    into deserved ignominy.  It seemed unlikely that Isobel Campbell's first solo record might be the statement
    of reformation that would break my spell of disenchantment with the band and their spinoffs, but I went
    into it with an open mind nonetheless.  As a cellist and vocalist, Campbell's contributions to Belle &amp;
    Sebastian ranged from harmlessly superfluous to irksome, and during her stint as the lead troubadour for
    The Gentle Waves, she rarely exhibited the merit to justify any sort of solo career, even while most of
    her work was pleasantly melancholic and remained respectfully restrained.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Amorino</i>, however, that restraint has succumbed to an orchestral throng of players, who back
    Campbell as she unravels her featherweight whisper of a swoon over beds of intricately wrought, fluttering
    strings.  As could be expected, the production is sharp, and the song structures are tightly wound and
    delicately unraveled.  The problem is that the effort as a whole is too slick, and its charm suffers as
    a result.  The stylistic approach of <i>Amorino</i> ranges from light New Orleans jazz to Lambchop-inflected
    chamber numbers, with the songs frequently gliding from breathy girl-pop to bebop without a single quirk.
    But while they do cascade with a certain cinematic grandeur, they generally lack the emotive prowess necessary
    to clue Campbell into any sort of revelatory or innovative ground.  A classical sense abounds, but never
    delivers upon the pulling threads of musical sentiments past.</p><p>
    
    ""The Cat's Pyjamas"" might be heard on a New Orleans Prohibitionist's night out, with Campbell playing the
    coy role of sophisticate.  ""October's Sky"" and ""Song for Baby"" playfully hint at traditional and Parisian
    light jazz, augmented by fleeting buoyant string and flute lines.  On ""Monologue for an Old True Love"",
    Campbell's orchestral backing makes its first vainglorious approach as she navigates a sea of bossa nova
    horns and 60s-inspired drum and guitar work.  The problem being not Campbell's vocal touch, but her inability
    to emotively carry the more subtly melodic moments or the sweepingly faux-inspirational tones of revelation:
    her soft intonation lulls somnolently no matter the background fare.  Whereas some moments (such as the more
    modern-flavored ""There Is No Greater Gold"") approach <i>Moon Safari</i>-inspired tones of soft concession,
    Campbell fails to gently brush strokes of naked disclosure the likes of Beth Hirsch.  It's this ineptness
    to ever truly engage that sinks <i>Amorino</i> in the end.  Though it just may be too pleasant to actually
    offensive, the absence of any epochal splendor remitted over the course of such a well-crafted effort does
    leave a mark.  Or perhaps it leaves none at all.</p></div>"|1746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1746-amorino/|5.7|William Morris

I don't hear Mathis on <em>7</em> (though he could be here somewhere-- with Jeck you never know) but I imagine these words appear because <em>The Art of Remembering</em> would be a great title for a Philip Jeck album.  For most of the 20th Century, the phonograph record was the primary time-based storage medium.  You could buy pre-made 8mm and 16mm reels, but home films never had the market penetration of recorded sound.  Music, speeches, plays, sound effects, sporting events, even film storylines were preserved and sold on records.</p><p>  The vinyl record was one of the primary devices for storing culture's collective memory.  Hundreds of millions of these fragments were strewn all around the world.  What happened to all these chunks of data? Most decayed or were rendered obsolete and were tossed out, but plenty are still in circulation, and a good number of them wound up in Philip Jeck's record collection.  Jeck makes music by playing, mixing and processing vinyl records (mostly obscure ones), and on <em>7</em>, he reflects our memories back to us in a profound and terribly exciting way.  Here, Jeck is at the peak of his creative powers.</p><p>  The first track ""Wholesome"" shows how damn <em>pretty</em> Jeck can sound when so inclined.  You expect pieces built from old manipulated vinyl and loops to be prickly with a disturbing undercurrent, but ""Wholesome"", which isolates, stretches and repeats a Disneyfied swirl of night sky strings and impressionistic piano plinks, is like a flower in perpetual bloom.  It gets distorted and blacker toward the end when Jeck rolls off the treble completely, but that's just the sun setting and, like e.e. cummings said, if it has to happen, this is a beautiful way.  ""Wipe"" is just as lovely with a different feel, distant and lonely instead of warm and welcoming.  It reminds me of Experimental Audio Research circa ""Tribute to John Cage in C*A*G*E"", music for drifting slow through space, a cold drone echoing in an asteroid's cave.</p><p>  ""Now You Can Let Go"" is where Jeck robs the memory bank for identifiable fragments.  He turns crackly loops of locomotive chugs into percussion, pushes corny three-note jazz phrases nicked from a Steamboat Willie short into a dub chamber, and keeps a recording of a lathe humming along to bind it all into a singular sound machine.  ""Some Pennies"" is doubly referential, as the ghostly bass ostinato looping through was also the central element of (the even more powerful) ""Vinyl Coda I"", recorded in 1999.  It's an ominous piece of music, but somehow never threatens; despite its bleak overtone, ""Some Pennies"" is subtle and invites intimate observation.  You want to inch closer and pick the piece apart, each layer of sound folded inside, a world within a world.</p><p>  I like to think of ""Bush Hum"" as a reference to our president and the violence that's accompanied his term in office, though the sleeve notes indicate that the sole sound source for the track is the ungrounded hum of a Bush turntable run through a delay pedal.  Still, the abrasive, atonal buzz generated by Jeck's processed electrical circuit could stand in for the sounds of war.  An atypical track for a man whose music always incorporates the friction of the physical, ""Bush Hum"" is nonetheless very effective.

Where so many electronic musicians are content to simply create atmosphere or bring     conceptual experiments to life, the songs are as integral to M83's music as the sounds that inhabit them--     in fact, the two often seem inexorably linked.

<p>In the wake of their epic <i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</i>, M83 have released these two singles,     each of which is backed by a handful of reinterpreted tracks from the album.  The single release for ""Run     into Flowers"", the standout track from that album, is accompanied here by three distinctive and diverse     remixes, while the ""0078h"" single takes a less traditional route, offering a live version of the album     track ""Gone"", as well as a cover of ""In Church"" by M83 labelmates Cyann &amp; Ben.  None of these come close     to surpassing the originals, of course, but each constitutes an artful, considerate and revealing take on     the source material.</p>
<p>By far the most accessible track on <i>Dead Cities</i>, ""Run into Flowers"" stands as the obvious choice for     first single.  A perfect representation of M83's strengths, the song is remarkable for both its intensity     and its tenderness.  Its hushed vocals, juxtaposed with glorious swells of digital strings, are the beating     heart of <i>Dead Cities</i>, providing a locus of humanity amidst the album's surprisingly wrenching     synthesized arrangements.  By contrast, the song's remixes seem rather ordinary; in two out of three cases,     the ostensibly shoegazey tendencies of the original are eschewed in favor of a more familiar beats-and-cuts     aesthetic.</p>
<p>French glitch-hop crew Abstrackt Keal Agram chop the vast and impenetrable ""Run into Flowers"" into more     manageable pieces before fitting it with a sturdy backbeat and some additional vocal flourishes.  The shift     to a more straightforward rhythm robs the original of much of its unrelenting vibrancy, but the remixers     wisely build to a surging crescendo, recasting the song's vocals as a disembodied mantra.  Jackson's     ""Midnight Fuck Remix"" is the most playful to be found here, projecting subtle micro-house manipulations atop     the song's buzzing synth background.  Kg's ""Ig Farbenvorschlag Remix"", meanwhile, adds swirling drums,     guitars and white noise to the already dense original, but otherwise leaves the structure largely intact.</p>
<p>The ""0078h"" single offers two subtler reinterpretations.  A concert version of ""Gone"", replete with live     drumming and haunting electric guitar, demonstrates that M83 have as much in common with crescendo-rockers     like Explosions in the Sky as they do with their electronic contemporaries.  The cover of ""In Church"" from     M83's psych-folk labelmates Cyann &amp; Ben replaces the overbearing atmosphere of the original with a more     stately, vaguely baroque arrangement.  The dramatic shifts in texture and dynamics that marked the original     are replaced here by haunting, reverb-laden vocals and fragile plucked acoustic guitars.  While not nearly     as powerful as M83's version, Cyann &amp; Ben's rendition of ""In Church"" is as different in effect as it is in     aesthetic, and certainly a worthwhile and interesting B-side.</p>
<p>There's not a dud to be found on either of these singles, but perhaps unsurprisingly, there's nothing really     essential, either.  One of M83's greatest strengths is the unflinching intensity they bring to their music--     in the interest of reinventing it, that intensity can't help but be disrupted.  Those who are madly in love     with this group should find these recast textures and reconfigured songs engaging, if not revelatory of     hidden subtleties.

    throbbing, heavy with a richness that's almost menacing.  The sun hovers, uncomfortably plump.  Lawn crickets
    yawn and twitter in double speed, their collective whispers slowly spinning into a single, disembodied howl.
    Everything else turns way too green.</p><p>
    
    Listening to Califone's sweaty, blues-heavy scrap-rock is not an entirely dissimilar sensory experience:
    devious, fertile, and dangerously pretty, Califone records sound as futuristic as they do ancient, and as
    familiar as they do strange.  With loops dredged from riverbeds and vocals rolled in salt, Califone spew a
    hoarse mix of synthesized sounds, sweeping guitars, and bizarre, snickering percussion, an enigmatic mix of
    real and imagined sounds.</p><p>
    
    The band's latest, <i>Heron King Blues</i>, is no less curious-- it's impossible to tell if the record's
    echoing pings were tapped out on drums, programmed into laptops, or snatched from a dripping basement sink,
    each gleaming, viscous plop caught, unknowingly, on tape.  Thus, the serendipity of Califone: the accidental
    orchestration, the mysterious creaks, the bits of poetry, the eerie omnipresence, the perfect, unnamable
    noise.</p><p>
    
    Although not exactly a concept album, <i>Heron King Blues</i> was inspired, at least tangentially, by
    frontman Tim Rutili's recurring dream about a half-man, half-bird creature (check the freaked-out cover
    art), and brought into gritty fruition on the heels of Rutili's subsequent epiphany: the character his
    subconscious had (presumably) spun from nothing boasted inexplicable roots in ancient Druid legend.</p><p>
    
    The story, as Rutili tells it, goes like this: a mischievous band of Roman soldiers discovered, in the
    final days of an otherwise pitiful siege against England, that their enemy lived in perpetual fear of a
    half-man, half-bird creature known as the Heron King.  Hoisting a Roman solider onto stilts and slapping a
    heron mask over his face, the Romans sent a tipsy Heron King decoy careening into the middle of a British
    camp, watching as lines of English soldiers scurried off in terror.</p><p>
    
    There are other Heron King fables circulating, and loads of half-man, half-bird deities nesting snug in
    leather-bound history books, but the actual circumstances of the King's story are mostly irrelevant: what
    matters is that <i>Heron King Blues</i> is possessed by the same kind of sweeping, metaphysical realization
    that goes hand-in-hand with discovering that you are, in fact, dreaming legends.  The resulting album is
    haunting, nervous, and shaking with catharsis.</p><p>
    
    On Califone's last studio LP, 2003's <i>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</i>, Rutili and longtime percussionist Ben
    Massarella were joined by guitarist Jim Becker and drummer Joe Adamik, exchanging their revolving lineup
    (previous guests included former Red Red Meat percussionist Brian Deck, Fruit Bats Eric Johnson and Gillian
    Lisee, and Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo) for a more static stable of players.  Now returning as a
    four-piece, <i>Heron King Blues</i> reflects the efforts of a tight, cohesive unit, despite the band's
    admission that most of the songs were improvised (see also <i>Deceleration One</i> and <i>Deceleration Two</i>)
    or written in the studio.</p><p>
    
    With Califone's penchant for extemporaneous creation finally being properly indulged, <i>Heron King Blues</i>
    is an appropriately loose and sprawling record, requiring a bit more patience than some of the band's previous
    projects.  Still, its weight is majestic.  Opener ""Wingbone"" stacks gaping guitar and backroom percussion
    like bricks, building a spare wall of sad, groaning sounds.  Rutili's careful vocal melody is what
    ultimately carries ""Wingbone"", his soft, throaty promises somehow both desperate and vacant; when Rutili
    gently mumbles, ""Fill my belly with your whispering,"" it's obvious that he could be speaking directly to
    his own songs.</p><p>
    
    Inching close to eight minutes long, ""Sawtooth Sung a Cheater's Song"" is near-epic in scope, swinging from
    dusty country blues to sweeping orchestral laments, while the backwards disco-funk of ""Two Sisters Drunk
    on Each Other"" carries along a small army of drum machines, bleating elephant-horns, pump organ, keyboards,
    loops and squawking guitars.  Individually, these songs may flutter from style to style, but each of <i>Heron
    King</i>'s seven (eight counting an uncredited outro) tracks perfectly embody Rutili's increasingly perverse
    sense of self-discovery.</p><p>
    
    If you pump Califone through a decent pair of headphones, it's alarmingly easy to synchronize your body to
    their songs: inhalations become bowed strings, heartbeats mimic steady, muted drums.  It's the idea of being
    over-alive, too tuned in to the blood and gore of the universe.  Sweltering and beautiful, <i>Heron King Blues</i>
    is a triumphant exploration of quiet excess.</p></div>"|1243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1243-heron-king-blues/|8.4|Amanda Petrusich

    cratedigger?  Equal parts obsessive, archivist, collector and artist, the cratedigger's life-consuming
    quest for the perfect breakbeat(s) magically transforms one's local Yellow Pages into a record collector's
    Holy Grail; while an individual's basement can be a vinyl-addict's utopia where time-forgotten funk manna
    patiently awaits discovery.  The collectors are notoriously obsessive, eternally flipping through abandoned
    boxes to locate (and mine the fuck out of) that one brilliant twelve-second clip.  And then there are
    folks like those mad Los Angelino B-boys behind Stones Throw Records-- namely Peanut Butter Wolf, Madlib,
    and Egon-- for whom sampling isn't enough: these guys actually go to the trouble of remastering and releasing
    these out-of-print obscurities on compact disc in what could only be described as a deranged act of beat-crazed
    taboo.</p><p>
    Stones Throw has been opening hip-hop listeners' blunt-addled minds for some time now; stretching the
    conceptions of ""digging"" culture seems only a natural progression for the marquee label.  Any single track
    off of 2001's archivist funk odyssey, <i>The Funky 16 Corners</i>, could be considered a proverbial
    wet-dream for DJs far and wide.  And last year's reissue of Stark Reality's <i>Now</i>, through its solid
    selection of proto-funk grooves, not only exposed the blueprint for Madlib's trademark love affair with the
    vibes, but also saved plenty of sample-hungry tastemakers from shelling out hundreds on eBay for the
    über-rare vinyl original.</p><p>
    The strongest of these inspired reissues yet, however, is the unabashedly multi-racial, Omaha-bred mutt-funk
    troupe The L.A. Carnival's early 70s release, <i>Pose a Question</i>.  That the band's frontman, drummer and
    chief songwriter Lester Abrams is not a legendary icon of American funk is probably due somewhat
    to locale: raised in the racially segregated Omaha of the 60s with roots in both Native and Black American
    cultures, Abrams' music is imbued with a distinctly American conflation of funk, jazz and soul that drops
    overtly political overtones atop feverish, percussion-heavy grooves.  Abrams' incendiary drum lines steal
    the show on almost every number; cymbals swing effortlessly as barrages of snare hits frenetically pop
    like ricocheting pinballs.</p><p>
    What comes to identify <i>Pose a Question</i>, though, is Abrams' method of channeling his
    multi-ethnic American heritage through the genre-defying exuberance of his tunes.  By having such movement
    within each number and throughout the sequence of the entire record (""Blind Man"" is straight Motown Soul,
    while ""Ron's Tune"" is a bossa-funk chill-out), The L.A. Carnival flaunt their diversity; the ultimate act
    of aesthetic revolt in the face of a black-and-white America clinging to its ideological labels and racial
    stereotypes.  On the album's opener, ""Flyin'"", Ron Cooley's wiry guitar licks melt over a steady laconic
    funk bop, while Rick Chudacoff's electric bass notes pounce on the off beats before the chorus breaks in
    with the calming soul twinkle of a Rhodes piano motif.  While on the album's showstopper, ""7 Step to Nowhere"",
    rolling percussion and jerky guitar chords hold the awkward 7/4 time signature together, only for the inherent
    calm of a lone jazz sax solo to cool-out the bridge section.</p><p>
    While the arrangements on <i>Pose a Question</i> should undoubtedly break smiles across DJs' faces and get
    funk fanatics' heads' nodding, the lyrical content of most of these numbers sounds irrepressibly derivative
    of 60s idealism.  In an age where even irony is coming under the gun, it's hard to take a song titled
    ""We Need Peace and Love"" seriously-- particularly when those are the number's only lyrics. Furthermore,
    the album's title track, with lyrics about the black ""brotha man,"" and laughably simplistic questions like,
    ""Can we all live together one by one,"" seem rather banal when heard in today's context.  Of course, you can't
    fault a record for sounding like a product of its time (even if you can champion one that was ahead of it),
    and The L.A. Carnival's sweet-as-can-be, three-part vocal harmonies (courtesy of Leslie Smith, Arno Lucas
    and Abrams) generally help the revolution go down easy for even the most jaded listener.</p></div>"|4957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4957-pose-a-question/|7.5|Hartley Goldstein

David Scott, the unassuming core of Scottish pop outfit
    The Pearlfishers, has this nice guy thing honed to a fine, fine point.  Which, to be direct, he should,
    considering that he's been playing the angle since 1984, when he recorded his first demos under the
    ill-advised moniker Chewy Raccoon.  Scott obviously spends a lot of time soaking up Burt Bacharach,
    Brian Wilson and Beatles (his website lists eight Paul McCartney solo records amongst his nineteen
    favorite albums), as every aspect of his music-- from the syrupy horns and willowy strings to the
    quasi-jazz chord changes and snatches of harmony vocals-- screams their influence.  But if Scott doesn't
    possess the naturally appealing voice of many of his heroes, he at least gets by on a reedy tenor and
    enthusiasm.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Sky Meadows</i>, he's joined by a small orchestra of collaborators.  It's much the same setup he
    employed on 2001's <i>Across the Milky Way</i>, and to a similar result, coating each track in a thick
    lather of baroque instrumentation.  The overall effect, though, is less a channeling of Scott Walker and
    The Beach Boys than some bizarre midpoint between John Sebastian's ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" theme and Mike
    Post's ""Hill Street Blues"" soundtracks, a too-polite concoction of inflated orch-pop perhaps best referred
    to as doormat-rock.  A guy like Joe Pernice can get away with piling on the sugar like this because his
    songs are taut and tension-packed, but Scott's melodies and lyrics are too nondescript, and can't fully
    support the breezy sentimentality of the music without allowing at least some of it melt away into so much
    fey mush.  I could swear I heard ""Todd is God"" on my last trip to the dentist.</p><p>
    
    Still, a case could be made that The Pearlfishers are just occupying the niche left vacant by Prefab Sprout
    in the early 90s, and that such inoffensive indie pop still has its place in the world-- a case I'm not
    inclined to argue against.  Plenty of people will find a lot to enjoy in this little ray of sunshine,
    even if it's not the masterpiece it wants to be.  ""My Dad the Weatherfan"" is a fine song, for example--
    perhaps the best The Pearlfishers have ever served up; with the same kind of bounding rhythm and bubbly
    piano that made Mull Historical Society's ""Watching Xanadu"" such a fun trip back to 70s A.M. and a unique
    lyrical narrative about a son admiring the accuracy of his father's meteorological predictions, it's the
    kind of bubblegum that doesn't lose its flavor on impact, and it's the song most likely to stick with you
    when the album's over.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, nothing else reaches that height-- though I should note that there's really no notable low
    point, either.  When closer ""Say Goodbye to the Fairground"" takes you out on a velvety-smooth ride through
    Kinksy nostalgia and hazy-eyed reflection, with the whole crew joining in for one last chorus, the sense
    of community and warmth pretty perfectly closes the book on this collection of songs.  It also makes me
    feel awful for saying anything bad about The Pearlfishers.  The reality, though, is that only hardest-core
    fans of breeze-blown orchestral pop will have any interest in checking this record out-- it's not the one
    to win any new converts for an already well-plied genre.</p></div>"|6527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6527-sky-meadows/|6.1|Joe Tangari

    many automobiles and methamphetamines, the sometimes unknown names of many of its purveyors can often be
    cavalierly bypassed on the strength of their labels' reputations alone.  Stalwarts like Mike Ink's
    Profan, Stefan Betke's ~scape, and Peter Rehberg's Mego are no-brainers, the label identities as one with
    their masters' renowned monikers.</p><p>
    
    The Ware label has quickly been building a solid reputation of its own, having issued a string of remarkable
    and consistent long-players over the past year.  Markus Guentner's Audio Island was a song-based house epic;
    Coloma contrived poppy clicks of mod-glitch with astounding wordplay that absolutely shamed The Postal Service.
    And now Iven Schmidt's debut is before me, more rubbery in its dance-steps than its brethren-- and more
    club-oriented-- but no less catchy.</p><p>
    
    Built around three previous Ware singles, the eleven tracks here stay uptempo. While not the first to
    explicitly craft a record around the concept of driving (or highways, or autobahns), Schmidt conjures
    up the sleek German design of today by hotwiring its primitive arcade heart and making a driving game
    out of it. ""Quest for Tires"" starts off like the Commodore 64's classic <i>Night Driver</i> game, all
    simple white dashes on a black screen before the bass and distorted patches shift up into something more
    akin to <i>Pole Position</i>-- the pulses and accompanying clicks seem almost kinetic as the track makes
    hairpin turns and musses up digitized hairdos.</p><p>
    
    ""Digital Sun"" is a quarter-eater, too.  With a bass like glycerin drops on a trampoline, Schmidt keeps his
    keys in a twitchy mode, flicking pings across the ears before breaking it all down into a distorted Nintendo
    ditty bouncing like <i>Donkey Kong</i> barrels.  While ""Pocket Hero"" may be the track built from assorted
    Game Boy sounds, ""LSR"" is most gamey, combining canned handclaps with Mario fireballs and jump-blips. And if
    the classic arcade sentiments weren't conveyed already, ""Moon Patrol"" revitalizes that craggy, horizontal-scrolling
    shooter of yore with stun-synths and vocoded commands.</p><p>
    
    Built from a crisp house beat, ""M Track"" drops in snips of distorted scratches until its breakdown reveals
    the crunching noises to be the edge of a biting melodic line. It stutters to a stop before bouncing back
    even harder with little pings darting out like <i>Frogger</i> in the tempered traffic of Model 500-type

Check the NYC
    chirping of yesteryear, when every post-punkish, well-dressed pack of players was unknowingly smooshed
    into context with The Velvet Underground, or even more awesomely, The Strokes.  Some bands found their
    sound stupidly oversimplified, all of their peripheral influences spontaneously discounted in favor of
    press-ready convenience; other groups became unnecessarily puffed-up, needlessly sucked into a massive
    wave of buzz.  Considering that most music fans weren't exactly pining away for another hollow, hype-heavy
    pseudo-scene, nor desperately awaiting news of another nonexistent city-based community, the band-as-local-spokesperson
    paradigm seemed (and continues to seem) like an especially dumb approach.</p><p>
    
    San Francisco's Oranger might not be subject to the same kind of vacuum-seal as their East Coast brethren,
    but, like an awful lot of California-based bands with Brian Wilson/Gram Parsons cassettes overflowing their
    glove compartments, they still somehow perfectly embody the sea-salted landscape that spawned them.
    Oranger's  breezy, 60s-inspired psych-pop borrows the classic California recipe of mixing guitar fuzz and
    sunny melodies; even their name seems designed to champion their decidedly West Coast roots.  Oranger are
    postcard-ready California iconography.</p><p>
<i>Shutdown the Sun</i> is Oranger's third full-length, and their tightest effort to date: Abandoning some
    of the meandering, neo-psych tendencies of their past, <i>Shutdown</i> is packed with solid, intricately
    structured pop songs, each cut boasting a brassy, AM-radio throwback tinge.  Singer/guitarist Mike Drake
    is the band's sole songwriter, and his vision includes plenty of Beatlesque melodies and soft, lilting
    choruses-- but what's most interesting about <i>Shutdown the Sun</i> is the record's versatility (a trait
    easily attributable to Drake's flexibility as a songwriter), and its accompanying cohesion, flitting
    seamlessly between tones (stands range from straightforward indie-pop to shaky, freewheeling garage riffage).</p><p>
    
    The record's title track is a carefree, harmony-heavy bit of sun-song that lovingly descends into a closing
    freakout just spastic enough to distinguish the band from their by-the-books contemporaries (see Rooney,
    etc).  ""Sweet Goodbye"" is all jangle and romp, its frantic keys and unapologetic guitar solo providing both
    point and counterpoint to the Rolling Stones; opener ""Cut Off Yer Thumbs"" features glorious pedal steel
    whines (guest-played by Chris ""The Texican"" Heinrich) and plenty of salty guitar twang, layered over enough
    soft drone and feedback to satiate even the most frigid lovers of post-rock.  Which is all to say that
    Oranger are at their best when they deviate from standard indie-pop formula-- the more obvious tracks
    (see ""Going Under"") tend to do little other than bog the album down.</p><p>
    
    The first 3000 copies of <i>Shutdown the Sun</i> come complete with a staggering 34-track bonus disc,
    comprised of rare and/or unreleased songs recorded between 1998-2002.  Designed, presumably, to showcase
    the band's more experimental tendencies, <i>From the Ashes of Electric Elves</i> is an interesting side
    dish to <i>Shutdown the Sun</i>, but not an especially necessary one.  Fortunately, the record stands alone:
    Oranger have managed to shove thick ocean breezes, cloudless skies, and California languor into every note
    they play, creating an album that's as appealing as it is light.</p></div>"|6022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6022-shutdown-the-sun/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

In
    the garage, I mean (very few of them managed to escape the 60s).  Not many of these guys' ambitions ever
    exceeded the primal desire that coursed through the veins of our hairiest, most slope-browed ancestors--
    the desire (of course) to rock-- and it's hard to fault someone for genetic predisposition.  Some of these
    bands, like The Seeds, The Barbarians, The Godz, or The Sonics even wormed their way back onto hipster
    entrance exams as soon as someone accidentally mistook The Strokes' New York lofts for carholes.  Certainly,
    the unbearably dirty, blues-infected sound of the 60s garage movement often made for incredible rock 'n'
    roll, but in the end, the sheer paucity of musical ideas at its core all but ensured two things:</p><p>
    
    1) The vast majority of the bands, outside of a few select singles, sounded virtually identical.  Rock was
    still in its infancy, and so most of these teenagers were drawing from the same exceedingly shallow pool of
    influences-- the founding fathers (Berry, Holly, etc.) and blues roots-- and though all of them were likely
    to know their way around a blues progression, most's knowledge of the blues was about as deep as a scratch
    on a John Lee Hooker 45.  Super-primitive production techniques just short of hand-carving the vinyl then
    conspired to make sure that any attempt at subtlety was virtually inaudible.  Bands couldn't even play out
    without their own raunched-up version of ""Louie Louie"", and if it wasn't better The Sonics' nuclear-strength
    rendition, they shouldn't have bothered.</p><p>
    
    2) As a direct result of 1), most of these bands have been tidily forgotten, even in the wake of rampant
    revivalism.</p><p>
    
    An ignominious end, for sure, but that's why we need bands like The Husbands; without them, who would remind
    us both of the visceral power of garage rock as well as why it was long-forgotten in the first place?  After
    working on a litany of prior false-starts over the past few years, Sadie Shaw (ex-Vanishing) and Sarah Reed
    (ex-Lies) hooked up with Nikki Sloate (ex-No Knife) to form The Husbands (ex-every negligibly important band
    of all time) and play some old-fashioned, no-frills sludge.  <i>Introducing the Sounds of The Husbands</i>
    fairly blazes through fourteen tracks of classic guitar-grind and drumming straight from the Meg White
    School of Percussion (School motto: ""Why are there so many different drums on this set?"") to close out at
    fast-and-hard 26-six minutes.  But even within two tracks, it's clear that they have a judo hold on real
    garage rock.  That's a mixed-blessing, sadly; just like the classics from which they draw their sound, it
    proves to be as intermittently refreshing as it is ultimately monotonous.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for anyone big on instant gratification, The Husbands produce like champs; the immediacy of
    these songs is never suspect.  On nearly every track, nothing is withheld-- every chord, snare hit, bass
    kick, or cymbal crash is banged out full-force.  Even if they were leaking oil, with four flats and a
    swarm of Africanized killer bees trapped inside the car, they'd still have the pedal on the floor, so
    give credit where it's due.  On ""I'm Doing Fine"", they hold back just long enough, coasting on a slick
    little groove before all-out ignition on Sugar Pie DeSanto's ""In the Basement"", the album's only really
    impressive build.  It's so impressive, however, that it becomes clear what a shame it is that they don't
    hold out a little more often.  But The Husbands aren't the kind of band that trucks with pansy stuff like
    subtlety or restraint, and I reckon they'll pick a fight soon as look at you just for mentioning it.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes that's fine, if the songwriting and energy can back up the full-throttle approach, but here it
    fails more often than it works, and that's the big problem with <i>Introducing</i>'s abundance of misguided
    energy.  Nearly half of these songs are covers.  Extremely faithful renditions of The Barbarians' ""Take It
    or Leave It"", or Half Pint &amp; The Fifths' ""Orphan Boy"" immediately stand out as the best songs here.  The
    beautiful, pace-breaking versions of doo-wop hits ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and The Drifters' ""There
    Goes My Baby"" are fine, as well, but it takes a rare charm to muster the same magic as a great original.
    The Husbands, unfortunately, don't <i>quite</i> nail it, instead residing in a terrifying limbo where they
    play just well enough to fall short of evoking the feel of the source material, but perfectly adequately
    to overshadow their own songwriting, which can only come off as bland and (not accidentally) exceedingly
    derivative in comparison-- just like the old days.  There's such a thing as too faithful; garage meant the
    world to punk and to the current state of rock 'n' roll, but homage or not, its faults are better left
    obscured in revisionist history.</p></div>"|3971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3971-introducing-the-sounds-of-the-husbands/|6.1|Eric Carr

    keyboards requires a preternatural convergence of insolence, foolishness, and strangely consumerist fortitude.
    This willful deprivation may not quite be up to the same level as the infamous Ophir Prison Marching Kazoo
    Band, but, in its own quiet way, it seems as momentous and dangerous a sacrifice as anything religious
    leaders or secular professional sacrificers have ever undertaken.  Like those ascetics, such loyalty
    deserves our begrudging respect, and no small degree of unfair ridicule.</p><p>
    Schlammpeitziger, as should be readily apparent right about now, is no stranger to this ambivalence.  The
    name alone all but threatens reviewers to assume Jo Zimmermann studied music solely so his pseudonym could
    be insulted.  Another prevalent assumption among those new to the great IDM fanclub (endearingly called
    Schlammpeitzigerverrückteköpfe) is that the reliance on such basic hardware (his patented ""Casionics"") will
    produce droll, maypole-circling, percolating bouts of paradisiacal plop-pop.  And, indeed, it's typically
    nostalgic to the point where you run the risk of accidentally preventing your parents from conceiving you.
    To the vexation of all those who create altars to their Pan Sonic 10-inches, however, there's not a damn
    thing wrong with Zimmermann's cloyingly radiant sunshine-in-the-ice-cream-truck delicacy.</p><p>
<i>Everything Without All Inclusive</i> is Zimmermann's first full-length since 2000, although the musician
    has been extensively name-dropped all over popular men's magazines since the superb compilation, <i>Collected
    Simplesongs of My Temporary Past</i>.  The new album does not disappoint; it also does not thrill.  Nevertheless,
    it's probably Zimmermann's best album to date.  Strangely and unconvincingly, this claim rests almost solely
    on the fact that this record entirely abolishes any of the faint traces of diversity on his earlier albums.
    The opening track's menacing buzz may suggest some broad departure, but the warm, familiar fuzzes fasten the
    fate of the rest of the album as comfortably as Velcro.  Distanced armament, circumnavigating valves and
    short-circuited beat-boxing all take their place as the delicate Casio mulls on and on, to the dismay of
    musical provocateurs and to the slothful joy of daydreamers.</p><p>
    The most jarring sound is the clickity-clack of a jacob's ladder.  The stone-skipping beat architecture
    invites all sorts of geeky adjective-analopuns, but the best one has to be pseudo-biologic virogenesis:
    microscopic organisms scurrying around, finding a spot they can mitosimate/replicate/whatthehell for a
    moment, and ending their woefully short ""life""-spans in a hail of soft bio-techno-Casio-bullets. It's
    never chaotic, but it sounds like if you left it unsupervised for 24 hours, things might get sort of
    rambunctious.</p><p>
    Even though this is undoubtedly an album about happiness, tenderness, and other out-of-date concepts, there
    are more than a few dark patches.  He may play a Casio, but he's not always Cardinal Pollyanna's keyboardist,
    annoyingly saccharifying a black-hearted congregation.  Okay, I lied: he typically is, but there are still
    those scorched brass blasts that might as well have come out of the <i>Taxi Driver</i> theme, and those
    abrasive scythes that could either be a harvest celebration or a Texas scythe massacre, um, harvest.  Also,
    as someone who listens to breaths and wind a lot (because I can't figure out these damn headphones), I have
    the authority to note that Zimmermann's blustery wind (in the Winnie the Pooh sense, not the Hurricane Mitch
    one) is about as good as any around, finding the middle ground between Kraftwerk's ridiculous mechanics and
    the hyper-avant-garde's ""no-thing"" recordings.</p><p>
    For everything that recommends Schlammpeitziger, it is inevitably and undeniably redundant music; focus is
    not always compulsory, nor even possible.  And the middle third reeks of mediocrity or worse: poor man's
    Atari music, bluntly stupid opera, creaking floorboards, overly derivative house, etc.  The fifth track is
    flat-out, hard-lined nauseating for people that don't spend every waking minute at Disneyland.  But the
    majority of the album is more of the same for people who enjoy that sort of thing: a harmless, even lovely,
    pleasure that may not exemplify standing-ovation genius anytime soon, but manages to easily and efficiently
    make comfortable, yet often complex, pop.</p></div>"|7024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7024-everything-without-all-inclusive/|7.4|Alex Linhardt

Along with Walker, perhaps only The Beatles, Roxy
    Music, John Cale and David Bowie have engulfed themselves in both art and pop and created such riches in
    each vein.  Incredibly, Walker swung much further in each direction than any of those other artists, singing
    standards (and other housewives' choices) on a TV variety show, and creating famously impenetrable, esoteric
    work on his most recent (a loosely used term here, to be sure) solo albums.  Therefore, the first challenge
    of any examination of his career demands rectifying the split between his more populist and cerebral impulses.
    Happily, the five-disc, 93-track <i>5 Easy Pieces</i> rises to the challenge, capturing the on-the-surface
    duality between Walker's MOR song styling and his avant-garde leanings, as well as demonstrating the common
    ground shared by everything he did in between.</p><p>
    
    Born Scott Engel in Ohio, Walker was one-third of The Walker Brothers, a group of ex-pats sold back to
    America as the crooner arm of the British Invasion, but it was in the UK that The Walker Brothers had
    the most success, enjoying a pair of #1 singles and rivaling The Beatles, Stones, and Monkees as the
    biggest-selling band of the mid-1960s.  (Conversely, their U.S. run consisted of just two top 20 singles.)
    The group disbanded in 1967, and Walker released four solo albums over the next three years, laying his
    expressive and sometimes bombastic vocals over lush string and horn arrangements.  More a Left Bank stylist
    than a Las Vegas one, Walker's earliest solo records are best characterized by bawdy, cabaret-esque Jacques
    Brel covers.</p><p>
    
    Soon, however, Walker shifted from song interpretations to original compositions.  These songs, colored by
    existentialist musings, overweight prostitutes, Josef Stalin, <i>The Seventh Seal</i>, and the Sisyphean
    struggles of vulnerable, damaged souls, didn't sit well with his established fanbase.  The commercial
    failure of Walker's fourth (and best) solo album, <i>Scott 4</i>-- the first of his releases to feature
    only his own songwriting, and one criminally not represented on this box by either ""Duchess"" or ""Two Ragged
    Soldiers""-- dented his confidence.  After 1970's <i>'Til the Band Comes In</i>-- a quick follow-up split
    evenly between Walker originals and covers-- also tanked, Walker spent the rest of the first half of that
    decade returning to his balladeer roots.  During this time, he hosted his own TV variety show and released
    five limp albums of standards, film themes, and country-tinged pop covers.</p><p>
    
    When a couple of mid-70s albums by the reunited Walker Brothers did little to stir the commercial or critical
    pot, Walker's career seemed stranded.  Yet, unexpectedly, on a third Walker Brothers comeback album, 1978's
    <i>Nite Flights</i>, Scott kicked off the second half of his career, offering four original tracks-- his
    first compositions in eight years.  Angular pieces with opaque lyrics and elements of both Krautrock and
    Sheffield's burgeoning electronic scene, Walker's new work couldn't have been further from the
    Nashville-tinged dirges that the Brothers Mk. II had been recording.  After that release, Walker drifted
    further into reclusion, releasing solo albums in 1984 (<i>Climate of Hunter</i>) and 1995 (<i>Tilt</i>),
    only recently re-surfacing to do soundtrack, songwriting, and production work for (or alongside) artists
    ranging from Pulp to Ute Lemper to Sonic Youth.</p><p>
    
    Earlier attempts to compile Walker's career have focused either solely on The Walker Brothers or his initial
    solo output.  Of the latter, Razor &amp; Tie's <i>It's Raining Today</i> is far too Spartan and scattershot to
    be recommended.  The UK releases were only a slightly better bet: <i>Sings Jacques Brel</i> and <i>Boy Child</i>--
    which compiles the best of Walker's own writing from 1967-1970-- are merely adequate snapshots of one particular
    phase of Walker's career.</p><p>
    
    A specialist approach was also attempted by the compilers of <i>5 Easy Pieces</i>, in which each of the set's
    discs is arranged by theme, or ""ways into the heart of Scott Walker.""  The <i>In My Room</i> disc collects
    kitchen-sink dramas and lonely howls at the moon.  <i>Where's the Girl?</i> is subtitled <i>Songs of Lady,
    Love and Loss</i>, but as its proper title suggests, the emphasis is on ""loss.""  The third disc, <i>An
    American in Europe</i>, divvies up his ruminations on his home and adopted home-- thankfully including only
    one of his country-rock songs.  <i>This Is How You Disappear</i>-- despite borrowing its title from ""Patriot"",
    a track on CD3-- is an alternate ""greatest hits,"" focusing on Walker's later, more avant-garde releases.
    Finally, <i>Scott on Screen</i> collects his cinematic works, most notably a portion of the score he composed
    for Leos Carax's 1999 film <i>Pola X</i>.</p><p>
    
    With a large number of rare and out-of-print tracks sitting alongside most of his best-known work, this is
    a rare collection that would appeal to both Walker devotees and novices.  And with a few exceptions, each
    disc is arranged chronologically, demonstrating in some cases that Walker's unusual path didn't have as many
    sharp turns as most would think.  <i>In My Room</i> and <i>Where's the Girl?</i> each feature a half-dozen
    of the more dark, brooding Walker Brothers tracks.  It's just as well: The popular Walker Brothers songs
    are easily found on bargain comps, and none of them are predicative of Walker's solo career.  So, for
    example, instead of a U.S. hit like ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"", you get that record's stronger
    B-side, the Drifters-like ""After the Lights Go Out"".  Each of these dozen tracks-- ranging from the
    full-throated Wall of Sound of ""Hurting Each Other"" (a song popularized by The Guess Who!) to the bedsit
    lament of ""In My Room""-- is a well-selected gem.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of the first two discs, however, is made up of Walker's best-known solo songs: lush, emotionally
    engaging ballads such as ""It's Raining Today"", ""Montague Terrace (in Blue)"", and ""The Amorous Humphrey
    Plugg"".  Among his rarer works here are the jazz-tinged ""Joe"" and ""Time Operator"", ""Someone Who Cared""--
    the slow-burning highlight of <i>Stretch</i>-- and the largely forgettable Esther Ofarim-voiced ""Long
    About Now"" from <i>Til' the Band Comes In</i>.  <i>Where's the Girl?</i> also includes a pair of dramatic,
    sprawling 11-minute epics written for German chanteuse Ute Lemper's 2000 album <i>Punishing Kiss</i> (which
    also features compositions from Nick Cave, Neil Hannon, and Elvis Costello), each of which is rich in both
    ambition and nuance.</p><p>
<i>An American in Europe</i> is the most accessible of the five discs.  The first half (""Europe"") is
    highlighted by eight mostly buoyant, sexually charged and rousing Brel covers that no doubt caused more
    than a few blushes when they were first released.  It also boasts Walker's excellent Brelian pastiche ""The
    Girls from the Streets"" and the <i>Scott 3</i> highlight ""Copenhagen"".  The ""America"" half kicks off with
    the militaristic march of ""We Came Through"", and includes the delicate twang of ""Rhymes of Goodbye"", B-side
    ""My Way Home"", and ""Cowbells Shakin'"", the title track to The Walker Brothers' <i>Lines</i>, and four of
    the more less-then-leftfield tracks from <i>Climate of Hunter</i> and 1995's notoriously difficult <i>Tilt</i>.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of ""difficult"", the gloves are off on <i>This Is How You Disappear</i>, which for long-time fans
    is perhaps the most intriguing of the discs, as it tells a fairly linear alternate history of Walker's
    career.  The disc has a mere three songs plucked from his late-60s period: much beloved B-side ""The Plague"",
    ""Plastic Palace People"", and ""Boy Child"".  For the most part, though, it's dominated by the most crucial
    tracks from his post-1970 albums: four each from The Walker Brothers' 1978 comeback <i>Nite Flights</i>
    (the only ones on that album penned by Scott), <i>Climate of Hunter</i>, and <i>Tilt</i>.  Walker's vaguely
    Frippian/Teutonic work for <i>Nite Flights</i> peaks with the underrated synth-pop of ""The Electrician"", a
    benchmark for the late-70s Berlin fashionistas and a template for the more uncompromising post-punk
    electronic artists such as Cabaret Voltaire and The Human League.  The <i>Climate of Hunter</i> tracks are
    even more textural and abstract, and those from <i>Tilt</i> can be exercises in patience and endurance for
    some listeners.</p><p>
<i>Scott on Screen</i> is the set's least essential collection of music, but perversely, is the most valuable
    to the box, as it collects seven <i>Pola X</i> pieces, as well as works from nine additional sources (including,
    oddly, the recent James Bond film <i>The World Is Not Enough</i>).  Cherry-picking a number of excellent
    curios from Walker's past (including a mere one cut from career low-light ""The Moviegoer"") and mixing them
    with his haunting orchestral work, <i>Scott on Screen</i> is the disc best approached as individual tracks.
    Of course, a document of Walker's film work was never going to be anything but slightly clumsy when presented
    on one disc, and it's a tiny quibble for rescuing a number of his lesser-known and difficult-to-find
    (even by file-sharing standards) works.</p><p>
    
    An increasingly revered figure, Scott Walker is a singular craftsmen, one of rock's few individuals to
    demonstrate a willingness to both embrace elements of the unfashionable and ignore prevailing trends, yet
    also display an acute awareness of contemporary sounds.  Forgoing many of the stylistic trappings of rock,
    Walker has explored a broad range of Western musical styles and displayed an intellectualism that is at
    times subversive, hilarious, cutting and poignant.  It's a slight bit odd to attempt to delve into the
    heart and mind of one of pop's most anomalous and enigmatic figures by examining his work-- that's an
    approach more often reserved for long-departed painters, sculptors or writers who created in often
    self-conscious ""periods.""  Therefore, as an exploration of an artist's psyche, <i>5 Easy Pieces</i> is
    incomplete at best.  More importantly, however, as an exploration of this artist's career, it's endlessly
    rewarding, almost wholly engrossing, and long overdue.</p></div>"|8763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8763-5-easy-pieces/|9.5|Scott Plagenhoef

    impossible to overestimate the influence of the organ on the history of music and sound.""  Indeed, dating
    from before Christianity, the organ has undergone changes in both physical construction and musical
    importance.  Today, many people probably think of churches as the best place to see and hear organs, but
    the instrument was at first rejected by Christian authorities for being too associated with secular music.
    In the Middle Ages, organs were first built into churches, though even then only to appease growing secular
    political powers.  The instruments were soon built as part of the churches themselves, and anyone who has
    seen a particularly impressive organ towering over church patrons in an old cathedral can attest to their
    intimidating presence.</p><p>
    However, to connect this ancient instrument to modern music and sound design (as Touch appears to do with
    this compilation), you have to look at arguably the most important aspect of the organ: chiefly, it
    represents the first time man attempted to create music using mechanical means, and in the process allowed
    him to create music theretofore unimagined.  The first Greek organs were powered by air pumped from pockets
    of pressure inside a bucket submerged in water.  Thus, it became possible to perform music without ever
    having to take a breath.  Furthermore, organs were soon able to emit tones beyond the range or volume of
    any traditional instrument.  In short, almost every musical tool, piece of electronic equipment or software
    can be traced back to this thing.  Viva la pertinence.</p><p>
<i>Spire</i> is a collection of pieces ""inspired or more directly influenced"" by the organ, featuring a few
    Touch mainstays like Christian Fennesz, Philip Jeck and Biosphere, as well as actual organ composers like
    Marcus Davidson.  In reality, very few of the tracks are actual organ performances.  Most treat the
    instrument as merely a source, making <i>Spire</i> something of a radical organ remix record.  Step back
    a few and it also works as pure ambience-- the naturally rich, rounded tone of the organs played or sampled
    overwhelms any attempts to subvert it.  However, the two-disc collection also acts as a rare look back among
    contemporary electronica composers and producers at their ""roots.""  Perhaps the day when we think of our
    generation's electronic music as being part of the same canon as the organ's isn't far ahead.</p><p>
    Fennesz works with Sparklehorse's Scott Minor on ""Dwan"", a track they began working on while in residence
    at a Geneva festival.  Performed on a distorted Wurlitzer organ, the track moves from static-ridden clusters
    to phased, melancholy progressions.  At 2\xBD minutes, it ends far too quickly to really establish much mood,
    rather seeming like a quick summary instead of a finished piece.  Similarly, Jeck's ""Stops"" is prefaced by
    a quote from famed French composer Olivier Messiaen, who contributed some of the most amazing music for
    organ of the 20th Century.  In English, it reads, ""Music does not express anything directly,"" and is a
    perfect preamble to the dense wall of distortion Jeck applies to his major chord.  Messiaen's quote betrays
    his beliefs in musical impressionism by way of Debussy (who also gets a quote in the booklet), and suits
    the often mysterious qualities of <i>Spire</i>.</p><p>
    Biosphere's ""Visible Invisible"" is an original performance, and features the solemn tones of church organ
    as you might hear during a funeral Mass.  He uses the instrument as a calming force, constructing the
    entirely uncluttered piece from overlapping consonances.  It's the aural equivalent of faint blue and
    purple watercolors running together into a formless cushion.  ""Askam Wind Cluster"", by erstwhile Cabaret
    Voltaire and Hafler Trio member Chris Watson, goes for the arch concept by forming his piece not from an
    actual organ, but from wind's convection currents, presumably acting in a similar way to air within the
    pipes of an organ.  The rhythmic ""beat"" of currents demonstrates essentially pure ambience, and also a
    deceptively simple process of how organ music is produced.</p><p>
    Z'EV contributes ""If Only That Love Lets Letting Happen (Organ Music for Organs)"", composed from fragments
    of Bach's ""Wenn Nur Den Lieben Gott Laesst Walten"", and like Biosphere, creates sweet, mystic calm out of
    overlapping tones.  This is a far cry from Icelandic composer Finnbogi Petursson's ""Diabolus"", wherein two
    subsonic organ tones create a ""tritone"" interval, at one time referred to by Church musicians as the ""devil
    in music"" due to its extreme dissonance.  Well, that's the idea anyway; Petursson's piece mostly seems like
    low-level hum unless you really get up close to your speakers (at which time you may experience some light
    nausea!).</p><p>
    If you have zero interest in a bunch of guys playing with organs, <i>Spire</i> works about as well as any
    compilation featuring the same cast of characters would.  Over time, Touch has left its brand on a whole
    school of sound design that takes into account classical and natural phenomena, so this set should at least
    be pretty cool for people already into their roster.  Of course, you don't need any special appreciation
    of organ music to enjoy this, but it's sometimes reassuring to know the new kids still remember their
    basics.</p></div>"|2036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2036-spire-organ-works-past-present-future/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    a cat, and that the album title some sort of inane pun, but you could easily extend the title to apply to
    the actual music here: <i>Pussyfootin'</i> consists of gently rendered acoustic pop songs that decline to
    get up in your face, but not so light that you wouldn't notice having them around.  But most clearly, the
    title refers to the fact that these are some of the earliest recordings made by The Capitol Years, back
    when it was just one guy named Shai Halperin who hadn't yet decided what he wanted to sound like; the disc
    compiles a bunch of songs he laid to tape way back when and ignored until finally releasing them in late
    2003.</p><p>
    
    The stuff he pulls from his body of 2000 and 2001 recordings offers portents of both of the directions in
    which his music career has taken him since then.  The down-home vibe foreshadows the intimacy, if not the
    breadth, of his official debut, <i>Meet Yr Acres</i>, while the directness and umambiguously organic
    approach is more akin to 2002's <i>Jewelry Store</i> EP, the first Capitol Years album to feature a full
    band.  There's a grab-bag of touchstones here, from obvious ones (Dylan, Parsons-era Byrds), to a few less
    expected ones (""There's a Bridge"" sounds like Leo Kottke backing Tom Petty).</p><p>
    
    The Kottke influence becomes particularly apparent on the instrumentals ""Sloppy Train"" and ""South Jersey"",
    finger-pickin'-good guitar acoustic guitar workouts that help to pace the collection and make it feel more
    like a cohesive album.  Shai obviously had more on his mind than acoustic folk when he recorded these songs,
    though, and subtle things, like the abundance of slapback echo on ""Those Who Suck Will Blow"" or what sounds
    like a flute mellotron on ""Hookers"" crop up unexpectedly to add other colors. The sound collage and vocal
    processing of ""There's a Starlet"" could even be called ambitious if it lasted for more than a minute.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't all work, naturally, as ""Wear You Down"" sounds too worn down; the harmonies and slow, distant
    drums come across like The Kingsbury Manx recording after 65 continuous hours without sleep.  ""Tumbleweed
    Prayer"", a cross-country collaboration with a songwriter named Michael Taylor, has a certain lo-fi charm
    to it, but it's also quite the patch job-- Taylor's vocal tape sounds like it was recorded in the foyer of
    a Dairy Queen on Fisher Price equipment, and it's out of time to the point where Shai's accompaniment has
    to drop out for a few seconds here and there and come back in when the beat is reestablished.  A shame,
    too, because otherwise, it sounds like a pretty good song.</p><p>
    
    Andy Rooney was just groaning a few minutes ago on <i>60 Minutes</i> about taking stock of what's clogging
    up your closets each year, and deciding what to get rid of, and that seems to be what Shai is doing before
    moving on to the next phase of the Capitol Years.  While <i>Pussyfootin'</i> works well as a stopgap, though,
    I'm more eager to see what he'll do on a full-length with his new band, which holds a lot of promise if
    their live show and first EP are any indication.  At any rate, this exercise in cleaning house makes for
    an enjoyable record, and a satisfactory wrapup for this band's earliest phase.</p></div>"|1296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1296-pussyfootin/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Too many of the acts are either
    redundant tributes to better bands or materially nostalgic in the Cracker Barrel way, churning out prefab
    faux-rural simulacra.  Fortunately, EZ T trots alongside those few scuffed-rhinestone acts able to use
    Americana's cadences to examine darker waves of grain.  While you'd be right in assuming that <i>Goodbye
    Little Doll</i>'s sound barely dodges cow-patties in that field of dreams between Wilco and Junior Kimbrough,
    the album's urbane nihilism and undertones of absurdity protect it from being confused with the O
    Brotherhoodlums whose ""agrarian"" poses are as transparently escapist as Disney's Main Street USA.</p><p>
    
    Fans of Drag City's key post-folk dramatists might consider this album an all-star jam, since it boasts so
    many recognizable session-people (and even makes an argument that these musicians comprise much of the
    twisted Bonnie backbone that other bands are often accused of echoing).  EZ T is lead by Will Oldham studio
    and concert collaborator Colin Gagon, features two members of Ned Oldham's Anomoanon, boasts Paul Oldham on
    bass, showcases the production skills of Bill (Smog) Callahan, and is seasoned with Smog backup singer
    Sarabeth Tucek's unadorned pipes.  Gagon's voice suggests that he's a temporary medium for the looser
    ghost of Papa M's Dave Pajo, and the wishlist ""Central Control"" is practically an homage to the Silver
    Jews' David Berman (what with its great line about Nixon withering, and the mini-refrain, ""I want to drink
    my weight in blood"").  So if you're keeping score, Liam Hayes' Plush project remains the only ""spinoff""
    from this circle whose releases don't give their peers away.</p><p>
    
    Let me not treat EZ T like Drag City apocrypha, though, even if Gagon's lyrical tone mirrors the observations
    of <i>Arise Therefore</i>'s whoreson stranger, and even if he furthers that label's family-affair ethos by
    enlisting two more Gagons to accompany him.  <i>Goodbye Little Doll</i> is somehow a singular beast, perhaps
    due to Gagon's tough mumble (the listener pictures an anemic Joe Don Baker) and his players' scrappier, less
    deliberate executions.  Plus he rocks out!  If you ever hoped to hear Bleeding Rearwater Revival cover the
    climax of ""How Soon Is Now"" (yes, the ""I go about things the wrong way"" part), then just wait for the final
    minute of the fence-torching ""New River"".  Hell, the first line is startling enough: ""Mama, don't hang
    yourself.""  And then there's the point at which the speaker reckons he ""could kill the president with my
    bare hands""--</p><p>
    
    The album is packed with raucous portraits of misfortunate mothers, sisters and children (imagine if the
    Donner Party was actually a shindig in someone's loft).  ""Fingerless Children"" is a rewrite of the traditional
    ""Motherless Children"" popularized by The Carter Family and Blind Willie Johnson (okay, EZ T's arrangement
    wouldn't sound out of place on their producer's <i>Rain on Lens</i>).  The parent and sibling on ""Cruxes,
    Cruxes"" even poisoned the song's speaker.  Unlike exile-hungry hipsters, Gagon doesn't take domestic/matriarchal
    imagery for granted, and never insists that sisters lack mystery.  (While I'm outing my womb-envy, I'll add
    that this album's worst repeat-play trait is its Chan Marshall-esque minor-chord minimalism.)  If we're
    lucky, future Americana-ists will consult EZ T to learn how the credneck sound can be a vivid palette with
    which to investigate and convey complicated moods and ironies, just as some paper mills wait until night
    to release their pollutant clouds.</p></div>"|2897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2897-goodbye-little-doll/|7.9|William Bowers

    it aloud in public I will punch him in the face.  Call it what you want, but the digging of the crates (gah!)
    is London trio Chicken Lips' M.O. for their entry into !K7's laureated DJ Kicks series.  Here are 21 vastly
    different cuts of little popular renown, culled largely from the 80s traditions of Hi-NRG disco and friendly-tempo
    dub. Along with these are a few tracks of recent vintage, including a Matthew Herbert remix and three written
    by Chicken Lips themselves, one of which has the best bassline ever.</p><p>
    These three newer tracks throw the mix somewhat into flux.  Not to say that it's a necessity of mixtapes
    or a requirement of the DJ Kicks series, but in general there's some sort of discernible common thread to
    a DJ-set style collection of tracks.  If it isn't entirely because the tracks are of same time period, and,
    if it certainly isn't entirely because of similar genre, I would hazard that Chicken Lips picked these
    particular songs because in each, one element or another is, to put it crudely, not quite right.  For many
    of the tracks, this peculiarity can be as simple as some incongruous synthline that works despite all odds;
    in the case of Nina Hagen's ""African Reggae"", for instance, it's as extreme as a German woman yodeling.
    This thread of transcendent weirdness allows Chicken Lips to seamlessly string together what would otherwise
    be deeply jarring sequences-- the mix consequently has both an esoteric feel that warrants much praise, and
    also an amateur and personal aura that ingratiates itself.</p><p>
    Picking the best tracks out of oddball mixtape albums seems more of a personal task than a critical one,
    but if I may, in order as they appear: Matthew Herbert gives Norwegian vocalist Karin Krog's sultry ""Meaning
    of Love"" a glitchy treatment up to par with the best of his similar work on <i>Secondhand Sounds</i>, kindly
    minimizing the fete of its Brazilian-style flute-looped shuffle without desecrating it.  Herbert's track
    is followed immediately by the timbales, key-tar, and low-coded chorus of Jimmy Spicer's classic hip-hop
    relic ""The Bubble Bunch"", which, if it does not win over the listener with its somewhat kitschy funk guitar
    riff, will do so by the force of nostalgia alone.  Nina Hagen's ""African Reggae"", mentioned above for its
    German yodels, also sports an anthemic arena guitar solo that takes up the chorus melody of ""I... wanna go
    to Af-ri-ca""-- you'll hate it or you'll love it, but either way ""African Reggae"" is the track most
    indicative of the quirky Chicken Lips mix spirit, and perhaps the most memorable here.</p><p>
    Beyond the meticulous amount of thought that informed their track selection, Chicken Lips also contribute
    the absolutely sick groove of ""Wind Ya Neck In"", a 5\xBD minute big beat track that, in a way, is the album's
    only true dance number, and betrays the group's pre-history as 90s house duo Bizarre Inc.  Redeeming the
    five-song rut of relative bores that begins after Larry Levan's upped reworking of Gwen Guthrie's ""Seventh
    Heaven"", Chicken Lips keep the individual parts of ""Wind Ya Neck In"" relatively simple, but certainly not
    minimal.  The track builds on the spastic stop/start sixteenth notes of a hi-hat and a fat three-note
    bassline, peppered with occasional percussive slashes and hazy humble synth tucked far away in the
    background.  It is fittingly the longest track on <i>DJ Kicks</i>, followed immediately in sequence and
    length by Big Two Hundred's ""Suckee"", which has a similarly deep bass and big beat feel.</p><p>
    Going from that terribly mediocre selection of songs in the middle of the album into the vibrant Chicken
    Lips number, one can't help but worry that the trio might develop something of a Michael Mayer complex--
    always compiling others' work but rarely releasing their own.  The other two Chicken Lips' tracks on <i>DJ
    Kicks</i> are fresh, perhaps more perfected takes on the Hi-NRG style, with their synths more finely timbre'd
    and an overall depth of sound much more realized than their vintage predecessors.  ""You're Not Ready Yet""
    pits a bassline against itself, whose unlikely jitter fights with its sloddy lowtones: background hands are
    clapped in what sounds like a basketball arena five miles away.  ""Bad Skin"" closes the mix, approximating a
    radio cut-up style a la Akufen as tandem male/female love croons are interspersed among a shattered erotic
    sampling of I-can-go-all-nights and Baby-I've-got-it-bads. With any hope, Chicken Lips will suspend the
    cratedigging (they also did a mix last summer called <i>Body Music</i> for the Nite Life label), take
    Mayer's cue, and plan to release an album of original work in the near future-- the sooner the better.</p></div>"|1745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1745-dj-kicks/|7.7|Nick Sylvester

    over British Rock has been usurped by Radiohead's cathartic explorations.  A glance at the current UK album
    charts confirms it: Coldplay's <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>, David Gray's <i>A New Day at Midnight</i>
    and Muse's <i>Absolution</i> all topple Britpop's old school.  The Stereophonics are the only band in the
    entire Top 40 that arguably aim for a Beatlesque sound, and they're more a poor man's Manic Street Preachers,
    anyway.</p><p>
    
    It's still surprising, though, that many of Britain's current taste-making bands have been able to find
    such contemporary success abandoning The Beatles' formulas.  At one point, Blur encompassed the very
    essence of British rock's pop-heavy exuberance; who'd have thought that, in the ensuing years, Damon Albarn
    would strike critical gold with alternative hip-hop experiments (Gorillaz) and dumbfounding collaborative
    world music projects (Mali Music) that adhere to little of Britpop's confining tenements?  And what of
    one-time Blur nemeses Oasis, whose seemingly endless cache of anthemic choruses, ""psychedelic"" nonsense
    lyrics, and saccharine bombast made them, for better or worse, 90s rock legends?  In recent years, their
    Beatle-cribbing has only led them into semi-retirement and complete creative bankruptcy.</p><p>
    
    When the Manchester five-piece Elbow released their 2001 debut, <i>Asleep in the Back</i>, it was but one
    more successful debut from a British band drawing more inspiration from <i>OK Computer</i> than <i>Sgt.
    Pepper</i>.  Reportedly three years in the making, the record made good-- at least commercially-- on the
    heaps of media-buzz that greeted its release, but ultimately proved anything but an uplifting listen.
    Bogged down in unassuming gray tones and irrepressible cynicism, the album's songs traveled on ominous
    basslines and nerve-wracked, guitar-based atmospherics.  It was a record whose protagonists not only
    longed for escape from their surroundings (""Any day now, how's about getting out of this place anyways""),
    but also for liberation from themselves and those around them (""You're a tragedy waiting to happen"").</p><p>
    
    Even before one can wrestle Elbow's new <i>Cast of Thousands</i> out of its shrinkwrap, the record seems a
    completely different story.  Its cover is strikingly white (serving in contrast to their debut's gothic
    blacks and midnight blues) and depicts crude statues of a man and woman standing side by side.  For all of
    <i>Asleep in the Back</i>'s romanticizing of escapism, <i>Cast of Thousands</i>' overtly optimistic themes
    of togetherness will likely have more than a few fans' eyes rolling.  Even the title is a statement of
    inclusion, referring to the thousands of fans at Elbow's Glastonbury show that acted as an impromptu chorus
    for this record's celestial denouement, ""Grace Under Pressure"" (the band even went to meticulous lengths
    to credit each of these fans in the liner notes).</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>Cast of Thousands</i> rides the borders of sentimentality expertly-- Elbow's new-found
    hope in unity may seem like idealistic drivel on paper, but is carried off on record with refreshing
    determination.  Opener ""Ribcage"" ebbs on Ben Hillier's patently ambitious production work, which marries
    seething basslines to looping bouts of percussion and admittedly excessive vocals by the London Gospel
    Community Choir.  However, the song is importantly as volatile as it is uplifting: Elbow frontman Guy
    Garvey's lyrical musings run the gamut from explosive (""We blew the doors, didn't we?/ We pissed in their
    champagne"") to confessional (""All you have is kisses/ And all I need is you"").  This dualism haunts most
    all of <i>Cast of Thousands</i>, providing each number with an unstable elemental charge.</p><p>
    
    The record is at its best when the band is at their most unassuming.  Garvey may populate <i>Cast of
    Thousands</i> with ""fallen angels"" and ""fugitives,"" but his protagonists always remain likeable, and
    simply put, normal.  On the string-laden acoustic ballad ""Fugitive Motel"", Garvey is ""tired"" and insists,
    ""Not 'til I can read by the moon/ Am I going anywhere.""  Elsewhere, ""Not a Job"" may not be rock music's
    first stab at capturing the frustrations of a day job, but is probably one of a very few that neither
    advises its characters to quit nor exact sweet revenge on unfeeling supervisors.  Garvey's lyrics avoid
    quixotic fantasizing and are all the more compelling for it: he temperately advises ""Not a Job's"" aggravated
    subject, ""You have to give yourself a break.""</p><p>
    
    If <i>Cast of Thousands</i> is largely inspired, the album's grand finale, ""Grace Under Pressure"", is damn
    near revelatory.  Over a rollicking, cymbal-heavy drumbreak seemingly lifted from DJ Shadow's sampler,
    Elbow are joined again by the London Community Gospel Choir and the thousands of their fans from the
    Glastonbury show, as they all sing in unison, ""We still believe in love, so fuck you.""  It's as an
    incredibly moving moment; a wash of rebellious uprising over the sound of a band at the height of its
    creative powers.</p></div>"|2719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2719-cast-of-thousands/|7.8|Hartley Goldstein

You've taken one look at the name Pedal Steel Transmission and you
    figure it could only be some sort of nu-country thing straight out of the midsection of the latest issue
    of <i>No Depression</i>.  At least, that's what I figured it would be when I heard the name, but I could
    scarcely have been further from the truth.  Sure, the namesake instrument puts in quite a few appearances,
    and there's twang to be had from time to time, but this is hardly your run-of-the-mill indie &amp; western
    album, as this Chicago quartet swings through all manner of post-this and neo-that territory en route to
    making their wide-ranging, occasionally exhilarating sophomore album.</p><p>
    
    The heart of the band's sound is really nothing terribly special-- if you've listened to an appreciable
    pile of indie rock records released since 1991 you've heard it all-- but where they take it is what makes
    it worth listening to.  ""Breakin' Windows Everywhere"" is, at its core, a standard alt-country tune circa
    <i>Anodyne</i>-- it's got the smattering of banjo, the shuffling rhythm, the hint of twang in the otherwise
    urban accent and of course the keening pedal steel-- but it has the squirming ambient collage, ""It's Only
    a Day 'Til My Bed Is Warm"" for an intro, and these rushing Chicago post-rock swells interspersed throughout,
    stretching an otherwise ordinary song into a broadly eclectic mini-epic.</p><p>
    
    And the mini-epic is Pedal Steel Transmission's true bread-and-butter.  Witness the quaking, wah-drenched
    improvisation and murky Slint-channeling riffage of ""Gilman Report"", or the way ""Editene"" burns through a
    lengthy, herky-jerky intro before offering up anything like a verse.  The album opens with the band's best
    mini-epic, a brilliant song called ""Waiting"" that initially seems to embody its title, droning on a
    remarkably slow Spanish guitar fade-in before sliding comfortably into a quasi-Latin groove for which
    Pinetop Seven deserve royalties.  The surf-informed guitars flutter with tremolo around Dan Schneider's
    everyman voice, but once again, something that seems pretty straightforward at first takes a strange twist,
    as the band begins a build at the five-minute mark that lasts all the way to the nine-minute mark,
    distortion creeping in around the edges and finally overwhelming the song in a thrashing climax that lets
    out with a stuttering cadence and a final vocal tag.  It's stunning.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the guys blow most of their load on that impressive opener, and the rest of the album has
    its share of filler, like the utterly MOR indie rock of ""Silent Like Hands"" and the wanking southern-rock
    jam that constitutes closer ""Baionette"".  There's one more jaw-dropping song to be found, though, in ""I
    Saved the Last High Style for You"", a gorgeously tense nod to Black Heart Procession and Calexico that
    rests so precariously between sunny, rural prettiness and wrenching dissonance that it could constantly
    fall either way but somehow never does.  The deep, groaning bass and doubled vocals conjure the coldest
    moments of Modest Mouse's <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, but I don't think I've ever heard a song that
    balanced contrasting elements quite like this one.</p><p>
    
    Which is all to say that Pedal Steel Transmission have some tremendous songs on their second effort, even
    if their synthesis of dozens of readily identifiable influences isn't quite yet complete.  If they can
    somehow manage to spin their finest moments into the fabric of a whole record, it's going to make for one
    spectacular album.  As it stands, <i>Angel of the Squared Circle</i> is worth checking out for fans of

    made matters.  Even though the last ten years or so have seen a once-hopeful, experimental community of
    electronic music producers graduate to the mainstream, I'd argue the timeframe has been considerably
    longer and the impact on all of music greater than we can discern.  Sure, today things are possible in
    music no one could have dreamed of twenty years ago, merely due to technological benefits, but I believe
    the real revolution came to a head when the music we loved became digitally powered without anyone noticing.
    The moment when we stop hearing music as distinctly ""electronic"" seems like an important one, and I wonder
    if we're actually past that point already.  Or whether that's a good or a bad thing.</p><p>
    This question came to me while listening to English-born artist and programmer Mileece.  The pieces on her
    debut, <i>Formations</i>, are based on natural phenomena such as light's changing patterns and the structure
    of snowflakes, all processed via self-authored programs.  Yet, it isn't the inspiration I'm interested in,
    as musicians impacted by nature or even technology are hardly unique to our generation.  What strikes me
    about <i>Formations</i> is that, despite its obviously studied, mechanical skeleton, it resonates as vitally
    as any other collection of ""real"" music.  This stuff exists under the electronica umbrella because it is
    produced electronically, but it succeeds in part because its construction is rendered completely irrelevant.</p><p>
    Mileece was born 1978 in London, where she had access to a recording studio from a very young age.  In
    college she studied ""sonic art,"" wherein her studio and generative programming chops (using Super Collider)
    were honed.  She trumpets a claim that computers can be changed from static objects into ""something capable
    of participating in the creation of music in a way which is interactive with the composer as well as the
    audience.""  Of course, this isn't a new idea either among young IDM or electronic music composers.  Still,
    the music on <i>Formations</i> seems less an experiment in laptop-based composition than plain old
    interesting music.  That's a good thing, right?</p><p>
    Bells pervade <i>Formations</i>.  Mileece opts for the ping of small, clear music-box bells in all of the
    music here, creating a bright, percussive ambience, albeit slightly monolithic.  ""Aube"" begins the record,
    and establishes the album's sound quickly.  As the piece starts, the impact of notes slowly descending upon
    themselves as the tonality moves from major to minor briefly leads me to believe it may proceed into
    ""nostalgic"" IDM along the lines of Múm or Boards of Canada.  However, Mileece seems more fond of
    micro-polyphonic clusters of sound.  The melodies seem secondary to perpetual movement and the impression
    of direction.  Since all of the music on <i>Formations</i> was based on natural patterns, and with
    ""parameterized chance"" written into her programs, looking for traditional structure might not be the best
    course of action.</p><p>
    The title track wastes no time jumping right into the flighty, seemingly random sequence of pings from the
    previous tune.  Where ""Aube"" progressed gracefully, this one is hyper.  The tones bounce all around the mix,
    frantically moving out of each other's ways as new pings set forth.  Musically, this reminds me of famed
    minimalist composer Terry Riley's classic <i>Rainbow in Curved Air</i> from 1967.  The same major-key,
    otherworldly atmosphere is presented, but Mileece's piece takes on an added clarity, as if an ensemble of
    Gamelan players were invited to perform the lifecycle of diamond.  Later on the album, ""Fern"" covers similar
    ground, but with a palette of darker blues and reds, rather than the vibrant oranges and yellows of
    ""Formations"".</p><p>
    ""Nightfall"" is the only track to feature Mileece's vocals, and she uses them to sing a somber lullaby.
    She also adds sparse cello, and in the process is very reminiscent of Björk.  In fact, my only real
    disappointment with <i>Formations</i> is that Mileece's non-electronic ideas aren't quite as mature as
    her more computerized ones.  Still, over the course of the album, my overwhelming impression is that she
    has a gift for making calming, engaging music.  And yes, that's a very good thing.</p></div>"|5564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5564-formations/|8.3|Dominique Leone

As context shifts, so too does a
    record's resonance and weight-- looking back at 2003, I couldn't help considering which albums I had under-
    or overrated.  Among those that I listen to more often now than I had thought I would are Richard X's
    <i>Presents His X-Factor, Vol. 1</i> and Tobias Thomas' <i>Smallville</i>.  Richard X is pop distilled,
    from start to finish, but Thomas' mix disc glides gracefully from the beatless to buoyant without any
    jarring moves.  It's no surprise, then, that its bridge-crossing center features a couple of tracks from
    the Berlin-based, Kompakt-distributed, Marco Haas (T. Raumschmiere)-owned Shitkatapult label, whose
    minimalism and skittery, almost glitch-like beats marry the ambient and the experimental.</p><p>
<i>Smallville</i> includes a track each from Swede Anders Ilar and Finn Sami Koivikko-- two of three members
    of the Shitkatapult roster to release albums in 2003.  The third is Apparat (Sascha Ring), whose <i>Duplex</i>
    LP veers away from the dub-meets-ambient and tech-house paths walked by Ilar and Koivikko, respectively, and
    sticks closer to more familiar, worn IDM roads.  What Apparat does so differently from most of his bleeps-and-bloops
    counterparts is saturate the listener with a variety of sounds, from the sandpaper glitch of ""Granular
    Bastards"" to the horn-laden ""Negro Modelo"" to the tone poems of ""Contradiction"" and ""Wooden"", each of
    which feature vocalist Klas Yngborn.</p><p>
    
    Despite his prevalence for creating a frozen ambient base in which he can skate and etch different grooves,
    Apparat is most engaging when he takes a maximalist approach.  Which isn't to say that <i>Duplex</i> is an
    album of all left turns-- it's simply powered by its will to continue moving forward, never allowing its
    songs to settle firmly into melodies, nor leading its listeners merely in circles.  Indeed, Apparat brings
    these songs to life by delicately coaxing a range of sounds from his IDM core: tracks such as ""Interrupt""
    and ""Warm Signal"" begin with low hums, but seem to yearn to break out of their shells-- and when they do,
    whether it's with warm tones or a thumping bass, the effect is that same: a sort of journey not so much
    through sound, but from it, an audio exploratory than seems organic and somehow idyllic. ""Wooden"", with
    its martial beat and quivering melody, almost sounds avant-folk, delicately blending the acoustic and
    electronic like one of George's tracks through the woods.</p><p>
    
    Saxophone and clarinet, Eastern melodies, road-movie-meets-Western guitar, Aphex-like bouncing balls, and
    the childlike ticks and tocks of Plone also adorn the record, each emerging naturally rather than seeming
    like window dressing.  The result is clicks and cuts without the bells and whistles-- an IDM record you can
    love in a time when too many artists working within the genre seem as if they'd rather merely impress you.</p></div>"|417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/417-duplex/|7.3|Scott Plagenhoef

The cover art, despite the
    utterly enrapturing beige vapor emanating from Anton Fier's bleary eyes and blearier cigarette, desperately
    cries out for a sophisticated lingerie vixen reading French poetry on a chaise longue somewhere in the
    background.  It's already torn between channeling the French new-wave and solitary meditation, and it seems
    unjust to deny the audience that last image before they listen to an album as seductive, perplexing,
    serenely droning, and effortlessly cool as anything released in the last decade.</p><p>
    
    Anton Fier, one of the more underrated drummers of the New York jazz/rock scene, has had a remarkable career.
    He was the drummer for The Feelies, The Lounge Lizards, and Pere Ubu, as well as a session musician for
    everyone from Jeff Buckley to Yoko Ono.  In addition, he found the time to found one of the classic
    ""almost-classic"" non-bands of the 80s and 90s, The Golden Palominos.  The two-disc <i>Dreamspeed/Blind
    Light (1992-1994)</i> compiles his two alluring, eternally out-of-print solo albums recorded in the midst
    of one of the Palominos' most fertile period.</p><p>
    
    1992's <i>Dreamspeed</i> would probably be entertaining enough if the line-up just stood there, staring at
    the walls: It features the usual Fier cohorts (Bill Laswell, Matt Stein), and adds Parliament/Funkadelic's
    Bootsy Collins, Otomo Yoshihide collaborator/poet Phew, Blonde Redhead guitarist Makino Kazu, and that great
    freakshow Zelig, Buckethead.  Evidently, when you mix these colors, you get fearsomely confident tabla-smashing,
    lipstick-smacking, luminously malefic libidi-vertigo.  While any clumsily monolingual listeners will have
    difficulty parsing the whole talking-in-Japanese thing Phew employs, let's hope, for everyone's benefit,
    that she's discussing the finer points of stealthily stabbing Mafiosi and the prostitutes that love them.
    This is dark, devious music as terrifying and romantic as <i>Blue Lines</i>, and as bewitching and angelic
    as anything the Palominos ever released.  Who cares if the song titles deal with the Book of Jude and a
    Heidegger tome?  This music should be scoring British gangster movies or, at the very least, trouncing
    Coldplay in the contest to see what music they should play before people hook up on <i>The Real World:
    San Diego</i>.</p><p>
    
    This shouldn't dissuade anyone looking for experimentation: the title track develops Phew's impossibly
    arousing voice into some horrible Mengele experiment involving the voice box, a baby's tears, angry seagulls,
    and angrier dominatrices.  Other songs pile heapings of trashcan drums and grating woodchippers on top of
    Zen waves of beatific placidity.  The seemingly endless layering of Phew's vocal tracks start falling like
    a rainstorm, and pendulous guitar slithers out of silence with Doppler effects no mortal man could experience.
    For all the digital effects, the so-pomo-it's-not self-sampling, the looped vocals, this is immensely
    organic music; it basically drips all the vital liquids we hold so dear in a plangent mess all over your
    ears.  It's drubbed, dubbed, drifting music at the pace of smoking cigarettes between midnight breakfast
    and sex.</p><p>
    
    1994's <i>Blind Light</i> stocks up on the members of <i>Pure</i>-era Palominos and, pretty obviously, it
    sounds very similar to that album.  This is far from a bad thing.  The masterstroke is the title track,
    beginning with filtered pseudo-gabba, launching into smoking jug-huffing, drunken Caribbean organs, and
    lumbering 12-strings.  Elsewhere, the continuity of <i>Dreamspeed</i> is dispensed with in favor of
    startling periods of silence.  ""Midnight"" gets some 60s soul momentum going, even putting some crowd cheers
    in, and right when the drums should be fading in, they fade out, which isn't even possible.  On
    ""Clairvoyance of Self"", the song stops for a good two or three seconds any time another instrument or
    effect is added.  Take comfort in the fact that it would be seamless without these stops, and it's
    seamlessly seamed with them.  You win, you win.  You lose, you win.  Either way, you win.</p><p>
    
    As with anything unavoidably beautiful and often low-key, there are moments that you might hear over a
    Starbucks speaker system.  My advice: get a discount card and order a mocha.  Then have sex with everyone
    in the room on top of velvet drapery.  Then go to NYC to go see Fier jumpstart his career and reassume the
    reins of gorgeous atmospheric music: after many years of alleged retirement, he has recently performed
    with John Zorn and other old friends at Tonic in December.  After two hours of this, even the lung cancer
    ward will be smoking.</p></div>"|3283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3283-dreamspeedblind-light-1992-1994/|8.5|Alex Linhardt

Or warlocks, I guess.  <i>All
    Strange Beasts of the Past</i>, the quartet's fourth album, is especially backwoods esoteric.  It's hard to
    say how much hocus-pocus is intended; you need to locate a certain mood to get it.  If willing and able,
    maybe you should invoke the proper mood.  Like wander a forest until you find the right tree.  Try to sleep
    then.  Wake up.  Eat dirt.  Ostensibly, these are the sorts of things that connect you to an environment.
    Or watch treetops catch the wind and assign meaning to the patterns of dispersal.  If it gets cold, let
    needles and sap cover you completely.  Or bed beneath a white cedar.  Wake up again.  Stay there.  Build
    instruments.  Adapt.  Play something based on your experience.  You can obviously enjoy this music without
    going mystic, but if you do follow this program, maybe you'll achieve a David Tibet-styled inward light, a
    glowing path towards deciphering the more cryptic messages embedded within Thuja's admirably understated,
    unformed folk.</p><p>
    
    Though I live in overcrowded Brooklyn, I'm continually seduced by San Francisco's Jewelled Antler Collective.
    The best of pedigrees, Thuja's a Jewelled Antler supergroup that includes active members of The Birdtree,
    Blithe Sons, Dead Raven Choir, Id Battery, and Hala Strana.  What bothers me as a city-bound fan of these
    free-psych folkies are the subtleties I might miss, the wilted tones drowned by the germ-infested subway,
    overdriven car stereos, and unending construction.  Somehow the ""let's record in the woods"" aesthetic seems
    lost amid pornographic skyscrapers and memorials.  Making things more difficult on their fourth stellar
    release, the quartet never musters a human voice.  Without Glenn Donaldson's haunting vocalizations,
    especially effective on The Birdtree's brilliant <i>Orchards &amp; Caravans</i>, the chill of the languidly
    paced instrumentals acts as a blank-eyed frontman spitting code.  Here, he keeps quiet.</p><p>
    
    Because of this dependence on instrumental interplay, I can't imagine these songs separated from one another.
    There aren't singles, or hits.  No hooks or choruses.  And the album reads weirdly when approached as separate
    fragments leading to a resolution.  Instead, consider these compositions as interwoven moments in a single
    chapter.  Maybe overlapping shadows.  Actually, the same notion of serial compositions could be applied to
    the work of the Jewelled Antler Collective in general.  In its oeuvre,  subsequent projects are additional
    layers in a narrative that maps the players' aesthetic and social concerns: field recordings, collage,
    reworked standards, emulation of naturally occurring sounds, found instruments, melancholy tunefulness,
    mournful drone, deep listening, hybridization, and a disciplined but ecstatic improvisational sense.</p><p>
    
    On <i>All Strange Beasts of the Past</i>, the compositional sense is languidly collagist.  Sound patterns
    develop biologically and usher scattered movements and functions from one moment to the next.  Eastern
    drone.  Shakers take the forefront.  Water droplets chime.  Deep percussive hums create a foundation.
    Random bells and anarchic guitar strums add a sense of ghostly connective tissue to otherwise freeform
    acoustic ramblings.  It's a cracked fireside chorus.  As with a number of Jewelled Antler releases, the
    noisemakers are often unidentifiable: a water stick, crackling wood, synth drone, spring reverb, twittering
    crickets, violin.  Recorded live with no processing, each tone has a pristine, temporarily dreamy feel,
    especially the ghostly, echoed pianos on track five, and the tapping and shuddering of tin or metal on
    track seven.</p><p>
    
    Despite my emphasis on whispers, the volume does jolt upwards a during that seventh track.  It's a 17+
    minute incantation wrapped in the fits and starts of clanking bottles, background rattle, bowed strings,
    whirrs, upper-level screech, out-of-tune call-and-response, and a muted snarl.  Even during its loudest
    moments, though, gurgling water and the ringing of acoustic strings are clearly discerned.  It's an
    acoustic shout-- and compositionally, it's just as fractured as the six tracks before it.  By avoiding
    a self-contained climax, the piece remains unresolved, assuring the listener this chapter's still open
    in either direction.  And though I'm unsure where the story goes next, <i>All Strange Beasts of the Past</i>
    remains exquisitely opaque: ambient hiss recast as northwoods divination.</p></div>"|8052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8052-all-strange-beasts-of-the-past/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

What minimal     suggestion put forth by a drone is so easily applied to pretty much any impression you might have that,     predictably, describing one often leads to vague subjectivities bordering on bad poetry.  And as much as     I'd love to go around proclaiming my love for ""deeply resonant, holy abysses"" (not), I wish there were an     easier way to communicate the real power of the things.</p><p>England's Hafler Trio are no strangers to an elusive clarity; rather, Andrew Mackenzie isn't.  Mackenzie is     the only current member of the self-dubbed h\xB3o, a group that at no point was actually comprised of three     people-- unless you count their ""collaborators"", like imaginary scientists Robert Spridgeon or Dr. Edward     Moolenbeek, both of whom were fabricated by Mackenzie and founding member Chris Watson (ex-Cabaret Voltaire)     for their fairly astounding 1984 debut, <em>Bang! An Open Letter</em>.  On that album, and on many early     Hafler Trio recordings, tape edits and loops, found sound and Residents-style Dadaism ruled the day.  Since     Watson's departure in the late 80s, Mackenzie has gravitated more towards experimental ambient and drone     music.</p><p>Autechre, on the other hand, seem to have been moving in the opposite direction.  2003's <em>Draft 7.30</em> might have been slightly more straightforward than 2001's extraordinary <em>Confield</em>, but could hardly     have been further from ambient if it tried.  Even the moments that might conceivably have been called ""drone""     (parts of ""Surripere"", for example) seemed skittish and nervous.  Certainly a far cry from anything on the     Autechre/Hafler Trio split aptly titled, <em>ae\xB3o &amp; h\xB3ae</em>, a daunting exercise in ominous hum, icy space     and digital resonance.  In fact, I had a hard time locating anything obviously Autech'd, whereas the album     has much in common with recent Hafler releases such as the <em>Moment When We Blow Flour from Our Tongues</em> EP.</p>
<p>""ae\xB3o"" begins as a high-pitched, muffled scream, clearly emanating from the cold circulatory system of a     computer and without the slightest notion of making you feel all warm inside.  Soon, what seems like white     noise fills in the space beneath, and a bass-heavy generator noise becomes dominates.  It reminds me of     sound-sculptor Richard Chartier's album on American experimental electronic label Crouton from last year--     Hafler Trio have also recorded for Crouton, and fans of modern dark ambient and electronic will have much     to investigate on their roster.  ""ae\xB3o"" moves through long periods of relative calm (if you consider     residual static hum calm), but never comes to a point of resolution.  It's bleak, in the way any lack of     root is bleak.  It could also be endlessly fascinating in a chemically altered state.</p>
<p>The second piece, ""h\xB3ae"", begins unassumingly with what sounds like a distant wind.  Listening closer,     there's also a faint sonar whistle, gradually growing louder.  Then, the unison growl of jet engines     overtakes the introductory ambience, eventually expanding into a massive howl.  It sounds as if I'm being     sucked into a giant black hole, passing through faster and faster, until nothing is really clear except     that there doesn't appear to be a light on the other side.  Midway through the 15-minute track, things     become calmer for a short period, as the ""engine"" noises give way to the sound of actual flight.  However,     again a gradual increase in volume and depth is used as a device to reel me further into the cavernous     house of mirrors that is the artists' preferred workshop.  The track ends with the only rhythmically     active section on the CD, as the previous noises are cut up into short, clipped propulsions before settling     on a single distorted buzz-drone.</p>
<p>Although Autechre and Mackenzie need little excuse to dive into the abstract, <em>ae\xB3o &amp; h\xB3ae</em> is, as     these things go, relatively accessible.  For starters, there's much variation over the course of the two     lengthy pieces, and things never really approach either pure noise or pure ambience.  It's not the kind of     record I'd play to chill out, but since there are hundreds of small details to focus on, anyone willing to     block out some quality listening time (and not in need of any unnecessary ""songs"") could become quickly     engrossed.  Musically, it's consistently interesting, if a tad cold, so I'd recommend it with the caveat     that you shouldn't expect much of a helping hand from the bands.</p></div>"|367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/367-ae3o-h3ae/|7.3|Dominique Leone

    Fucking.</p><p>
    
    Slowly.</p><p>
    
    Their ""extreme doom"" descends from grinding to just plain labored.  They plug in their amps like they're
    too tired to breathe, their hands hit their instruments like hundred pound weights.  The drummer plays
    like he's falling limp on the kit.  Total silence mires the noise and swallows all hope.</p><p>
    
    Only one of them doesn't go down for the count, and that's singer Alan Dubin.  The band makes a fierce
    rumble, to be sure-- Stephen O'Malley's repeating, laudanum AC/DC riffs chime like burnt-out church bells,
    and James Plotkin will make your subwoofer moan like a masturbating whale; but the drone-noise-metal cascades
    hang back in a fog while Dubin gets the spotlight.  He makes a soliloquy of shrieks and agitation.  At turns
    drowning in a swamp, then shrieking as shrilly as if his throat were pinned open, Dubin protests and wails,
    vanishing for minutes then coming back at full volume.  He lingers over lyrics and then garbles others
    (""pockets"" sounds like ""sockets,"" or ""fuck it""); wails high like our generation's other great existential
    hero-- Peter Jackson's Gollum-- then rasps back to the mists.</p><p>
    
    It wouldn't work if the band didn't stand firm against him.  Between the stern music and Dubin's ejaculations
    lies the existential dilemma: he's struggling without a hope for release, he's mired in conflict but can't
    picture an end.  Dubin fights without advancing a step, and he can't stop fighting even though he has
    nothing to show for it.  Even the music's few peaks fall into thuds instead of blowing into catharsis.
    It's empty outrage: they're a Sisyphus that can't budge the stone.</p><p>
    
    With an hour of music divided into just four tracks, the tempo crawls-- it's even slower, and darker, than
    their self-titled debut.  It forces you to obsess over every overtone in O'Malley's guitar, every rip in
    Dubin's larynx.  It's reminiscent of some of Stephen King's stories-- not the horror ones, but the stories
    that take you through a drawn-out process: digging a car-sized pit in the baking desert sun, or crawling
    around the ledge of an office building.  Khanate have that skill for unfolding an action in such excruciating
    detail that you're slowly edged off your seat.  But in this case there's no resolution, aside from an uptick
    of squealing discordance and a buzzing electronic noise that ushers out the record.</p><p>
<i>Things Viral</i> is extreme enough to appeal to people who don't have any interest in metal; the members
    cross metal pedigrees with noise-drone-art-damage bands-- from Burning Witch and Old, to Sunn 0))), to Blind

    a cheap acoustic guitar and clicking awkward beats into an oversized laptop, red-faced and breathless with
    the notion of original creation.  If nothing else, the image of the humble bedroom troubadour is one of the
    greatest equalizers in pop music: almost every successful musician started somewhere, cramped, goofy, and
    cross-legged on beige carpet.  The trick is knowing when to bundle up your gear, inch down the hallway, and
    creep cautiously out the front door to broaden your scope, your skills, and your means.</p><p>
    
    Having bravely abandoned the scrappy pings and whistles of his Playstation-heavy solo debut, Royal City's
    Jim Guthrie has finally dragged his guitar out into the open, opting to indulge in some bold studio bluster
    and multi-instrumental antics for his latest release, the fulsome <i>Now, More Than Ever</i>.  Fulfilling
    the promise of his last full-length, 2002's <i>Morning Noon Night</i>, Guthrie's new album proves he can
    successfully scramble up the lo-fi ladder without sacrificing any of his quirky charm.  The disc, in fact,
    marks a unique moment of catharsis for the songwriter; Jim Guthrie has left the bedroom.</p><p>
    
    It's tricky to address Guthrie's maturation without unintentionally belittling his earlier work; 2000's <i>A
    Thousand Songs</i> was hasty, skittish, and alarmingly energetic, its moments of idiosyncratic brilliance
    often overshadowed by self-referential giggles.  <i>Now, More Than Ever</i> is hardly glossed to perfection
    (there are still a handful of broken plates, squeaky tiles, and toys exploding in the background), but it
    nonetheless provides a slightly more substantial pedestal for Guthrie's getting-stronger-by-the-second
    songwriting.  The record's approach is docile, but its impact is immediate: this is an album packed with
    gorgeous, intricate pop songs, carried by Guthrie's plaintive whispers and delicate strums.</p><p>
    
    With a battalion of able players backing him up (check the impeccable string swells here, lovingly arranged
    by Owen Pallett of Toronto's Hidden Cameras, or the shimmering banjo shakes on ""Problems with Solutions"",
    carefully played by The Constantines' Bry Webb), Guthrie's songs occasionally evoke the versatile billowing
    of Sufjan Stevens, or the Byrds-ish croon of The Clientele.  ""All Gone"" shudders open with a chorus of
    yawning, suspense-heavy strings, each nervous yelp bending back in favor of a soft melody and Guthrie's
    obtuse poetics (""The forest needs the fire/ Like the fire needs the tree/ Can you make something out of
    nothing?"").  ""So Small"" is a loping, unpretentious rumination on mortality, gently layered over bleating
    horns, jangly piano, and a nervously plucked violin.</p><p>
    
    For most of this record, subtle apprehension rules: despite its perfectly established prettiness, an
    unspoken anxiety still hovers, each careful arrangement belying a strange urgency-- meticulously bowed
    violins descend into feedback-heavy outburts, stretches of calm somersault into chaos.  These kinds of
    dualities pervade the album; <i>Now, More Than Ever</i> is both hushed and sprawling, serene and agitated,
    jumpy and constant.  Even if the phrase ""Canadian indie pop"" rouses your skeptical, hype-resistant scowl
    from its post-New Years snooze, the lush, orchestral puffs of <i>Now, More Than Ever</i> should prove
    undeniable: Jim Guthrie's sweet, fertile pop deserves all the praise it gets.</p></div>"|3613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3613-now-more-than-ever/|8.2|Amanda Petrusich

    urgency of his situation compels him to strike while the iron is hot.  It took his former band, Whiskeytown,
    seven years to release a trio of critically revered albums, and his first solo record, 2000's <i>Heartbreaker</i>,
    was in the works for half that.  But when <i>Heartbreaker</i> saw release, and was promptly met with virtually
    unanimous critical praise, Adams clearly became inspired and quickly turned out sixteen new tracks for a
    sophomore record-- the rushed, overproduced <i>Gold</i>-- which came with a bonus disc sporting five tracks
    in the more stripped vein of the album's predecessor.  And when that album scored Adams a commercial
    alternative radio hit in the well-timed ""New York, New York"", he descended into a recording fervor that
    continues, unabated, to this day.</p><p>
    
    Irrational outbursts and public meltdowns aside, Adams is, at heart, an extremely gifted songwriter who
    just doesn't realize that what he really needs is to take a deep breath and slow the fuck down.  During
    the course of the past two years, he's released a collection of demos (<i>Demolition</i>), and a 21-track
    side project called The Finger with ex-D Generation frontman Jesse Malin (the ""double-album"" <i>We Are
    Fuck You/Punk's Dead Let's Fuck</i>).  He's currently planning a box set titled <i>Career Ender</i>, which
    will be crammed with <i>five discs</i> of the songs he's discarded since <i>Gold</i> dropped two years ago.
    And that's not even taking into account the four-tracked blues version of The Strokes' album <i>Is This It</i>
    that he's said to have recorded.  Did I mention his collaborations with Beth Orton and Emmylou Harris?
    How about the track he co-wrote for the Counting Crows?  His session work with Lucinda Williams and
    Alejandro Escovedo?  His production work on Jesse Malin's solo album?  I think you get the point.  The
    question is: why doesn't he?</p><p>
    
    Adams originally intended <i>Love Is Hell</i> as his official third full-length, but his label, Lost Highway,
    scoffed when he handed in the tapes.  Initially, he planned to rework it, but then agreed to dashing off a
    glossy, radio-friendlier full-length (the disasterous <i>Rock N Roll</i>), provided the label would also
    make room on their release schedule for a secondary release for <i>Love Is Hell</i>.  It's easy to see why
    Lost Highway balked: an insincere, smugly posturing Ryan Adams who lives up to his stage persona by creating
    an album like <i>Rock N Roll</i> simply <i>had</i> to have been preferable to the miserable, slobbering
    woe-is-me shtick he plays up here.  At least when he was wearing the proverbial alt-country tag, his
    balancing act of conceitedness and overemoting was halfway convincing.  Unfortunately, just as the
    caricature-laden excesses of <i>Rock N Roll</i> aped garage-rockers and postmortem Rock Hall of Famers,
    <i>Love Is Hell</i> reaches for the dripping, maudlin sentimentality of Rufus Wainwright or a mock Jeff
    Buckley.</p><p>
    
    It's a shock, given that the press surrounding the <i>Love Is Hell</i> sessions had pegged the record as
    Adams' return to the sparse, two-in-the-morning flair of his debut-- and when Lost Highway postponed the
    recordings, calling them ""too dark,"" it only heightened the expectations of optimistic fans hoping for a
    stark, brooding future classic.  Of course, it did seem something of an enigma as well: Adams' music, after
    all, had always faired best with pared-down arrangements making room for his own brand of confessional
    singer/songwriter groveling (e.g. <i>Heartbreaker</i> standouts ""Call Me on Your Way Back Home"" and ""Come
    Pick Me Up""); shelving Ryan Adams for being too dark seemed to make about as much sense as shelving
    Kraftwerk for being too German.</p><p>
    
    But while it's safe to say that these EPs are certainly dark-- at least in contrast to <i>Rock N Roll</i>
    and even parts of <i>Gold</i>-- they fail to capture the striking imagery and confident vocals of which
    Adams seemed a master on <i>Heartbreaker</i>.  For example, <i>Love Is Hell</i>'s opening, piano-led
    ""Political Scientist"", replaces Adams' confessional, first-person narratives with a third-person tale
    that indicts the government for supplying cocaine, and candy factories for poisoning the environment.
    Conspiracy theories aside, playing Greenpeace spokesman is not Adams' strong suit; he attempts the
    political profundity of a Thom Yorke and comes off like a diet Chris Martin.</p><p>
    
    And if Adams fails to adopt Yorke's political relevance, he'll settle for the Radiohead frontman's
    melismatics-- <i>Love Is Hell</i> is riddled with Adams' unabashed aping of Yorke's signature fragmented
    lyrical style.  On the lethargic lite-country stomp of ""This House Is Not for Sale"", Adams repeatedly
    pleads, ""Calm down/ Just calm down,"" the emotional resonance of which verges on laughable.  Meanwhile,
    the sleepy, acoustic blather of ""Afraid Not Scared"" has Adams repeatedly confessing that he is ""really
    dying in here,"" and just wants to be ""let down,"" sounding about as genuinely distraught as Ja Rule sounds
    genuinely ""gangsta.""</p><p>
    
    The eight songs that constitute <i>Love Is Hell, Pt. 1</i> seem intentionally built around a studio version
    of Adams' infamous live staple, a cover of the Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"".  Acclaimed Smiths producer John
    Porter unfortunately buries Adams beneath a sobering wall of reverb, which drains the song of its spirited
    pop ingenuity and transforms its nonsensical lyrics into some sort of momentous, self-important dirge.
    Consequently, ""Wonderwall"" seems emblematic of the rest of the disc, a collection of preposterously
    cheerless (and charmless) songs that try much too hard to achieve a poignancy-- or anything, really--
    that might hide their complete insignificance.</p><p>
    
    As <i>Love Is Hell, Pt. 1</i> resoundingly proves, Adams is at his finest when he sticks to the subject
    matter he knows best: broken hearts and bar fights.  Given this, it's no shock that the highlight of this
    entire project comes with the Dylanesque Beth Orton kiss-off ""English Girls Approximately"".  Appearing
    halfway into <i>Love Is Hell, Pt. 2</i>, the song is classic Adams, brimming with his smug wit (sample
    lyric: ""You said you didn't love me, it was right on time/ I was just about to tell you, but ok, alright"")
    and unabashed, acoustic guitar-driven ecstasy.  As Marianne Faithful lends her austere vocal harmonies to
    the chorus, it serves as a breathtaking reminder of the chemistry Adams shared with Emmylou Harris on
    <i>Heartbreaker</i>'s divine ballad, ""Oh, My Sweet Carolina"".</p><p>
    
    Another highlight of <i>Love Is Hell, Pt. 2</i> is its closing R&amp;B; vamp, ""Chelsea Nights"".  Over a bed of
    radiating Wurlitzer chords and bluesy guitar fills, Adams narrates a night spent aimlessly wandering New
    York City's unfeeling winter streets, searching for the love he always manages to lose.  The track, which
    peaks with Adams' plaintive confession, ""I played your song/ I got the melody all wrong,"" is filled with
    the self-awareness, irony, and despondency that's made Adams' best work so moving, all the way back to his
    Whiskeytown days; it's a shame he forces his listeners to wade through a glut of unsalvageable crap-rock
    to arrive at it.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, these two tracks are anomalies-- happy accidents, or moments of clarity-- amongst the overbearing
    melodrama of the bulk of material contained on <i>Love Is Hell, Pt. 2</i>.  ""Thank You Louise"" serves as
    the harrowing antithesis to these diamonds in the rough, an atrocious slice of sloppy sentimentality in
    which Adams sings, over an unnecessarily bloated string section, of a mother receiving news of her son's
    death.  For a guy who's attained uncommon levels of infamy by simply being a sarcastic fucking prick all
    the time, he pours on the schmaltz here like he studied under Air Supply.  The Joy Division rip-off ""City
    Rain, City Streets"" is so bereft of any humor that its megalomania challenges even Conor Oberst: Adams
    crams nearly four minutes of distorted new-wave guitars and gratuitous reverb into this shudder-inducing
    display of shamelessness, proudly spouting disasters like, ""I fucked you over a million times,"" and, ""You
    died, you died, you really died.""</p><p>
    
    Listening to these discs, one can only imagine the myriad reasons Lost Highway decided to release the
    <i>Love Is Hell</i> sessions not as one spiraling, abysmal full-length, but as a pair of EPs (let alone
    why they shelved it to make way for <i>Rock N Roll</i> instead).  The obvious, cynical answer is that it
    wouldn't detract from the publicity they were expecting <i>Rock N Roll</i> to receive.  But it's also easy
    to envision the label's creative heads considering how spreading the material out might help conceal the
    songs' alarmingly empty sentiments.  The sad fact is, no marketing strategy, no matter how savvy, could
    conceal this collection's bathetic, overwrought travesties and gruesome failures.  In the midst of this
    mess, both Adams and Lost Highway come out losers: one critical car-wreck might have been manageable, but
    they may not recover from two.</p></div>"|41.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/41-love-is-hell-pts-1-2/|3.1|Hartley Goldstein

I had mistakenly and categorically written him off as a splintered postscript     by-product of the necessary dissolution of Seattle's overindulgent early 90s scene, that is, until recently     exploring a good chunk of his back catalog and this, <i>Here Comes That Weird Chill</i>, his most recent     solo release.  Granted, the post-departure travails of the driving forces behind such rusted vehicles as     Dinosaur Jr. and Soundgarden surely contaminated my expectations, but I wouldn't say they had ritually     poisoned me to bar acceptance of artistic redefinition within their sphere.  So, then, what flowers may     bloom from the northwest doorway?  Read on, Chris Cornell.</p>
<p>For these eight, brief snapshots of Lanegan's vitality-- a mini-LP featuring one finished song and assorted     outtakes from his forthcoming Beggars Banquet debut-- he's dropped much of the southern folk and acoustic     blues of his previous solo releases, giving way to a muddier, more driven sound.  A highlight, ""Wish You     Well"" exemplifies Lanegan's ability to grittily belie a gorgeous base melody with layers of guitar and     droning tones from organs, looped noise and synths.  Above the mix rest his vocals, which are best served     when he deploys a low-down, brash Waits-ian husk, as on ""Lexington Slowdown"", and are contextually masterful     when he plays the role of a confessional journeyman.  Past the midway point of the album, ""Lexington Slowdown""     marks the first time a lucid piano rings beneath his growling sing/speak, dichotomously playing up the role     of his pipes above a mirthfully ponderous piano lilt.  A gospel-infused chorus then enters, but with such     subtlety as to merely excuse its presence.  Other than this, the rest of the material grinds on through     low-level electric guitar and random, elemental scattershot accompaniment.  Settle down, J Mascis.</p>
<p>But his ability to consistently deliver dirty, linear melodies without too-soon drying the well is the     biggest feather in Lanegan's cap. ""Methamphetamine Blues"" (the ""single,"" as it were) begins the album with     an industrial assembly-line percussive element, hitting like tormented anvils on sparking steel, but never     flies loose; rather, it flits along with a dirty persistence.  ""Message to Mine"" does reel away for a moment     of churning swamp-rock, but gently haunts its way into the spin before dying off to Lanegan's plea, ""Baby/     It's good/ So good/ It's gonna make me forget/ Forget myself again.""  His delivery is so artfully persuasive     and soulfully wrought.  And it's all so sleazy that this backwoods poetry reads like Dylan Thomas under all     the murk and dirt and scum.</p>
<p>Lanegan manages to pack down layers of sonic dirt on each track here, but it's all so deftly wound that the     songs never feel anything but linear and reserved, even for all the action.  The lone acoustic moment is     employed as a launch pad for the electric guitar machine-gun rendering of ""Skeletal History"", which tightly     jams on after a brief reprieve, but never relentlessly so.  He also offers a cover of Captain Beefheart's     ""Clear Spot"", which he manages to slime up and slither unnoticeably between his original pieces.  Lanegan     is the brand of artist who can make a home in any camp, and, as he proves on this stormy release-- in any     weather.  Watch your back, Mark Eitzel.</p></div>"|4678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4678-here-comes-that-weird-chill/|7.6|William Morris

It's true that we reviewers are lethargic cretins opposed to thinking of actual criticisms, but the real reason everyone's compelled to state this relationship is that Muffin has so little going for her, it just seems like we can give her a reprieve by bringing someone else into the review for a minute.  It's like that old ""how would it feel to be Jesus' sibling?"" joke.  Of course, Jon Spencer is barely the Son of Pussy Galore, let alone God.  Suffice to say, when Jesus rolls out his blues explosion, you better all be packing heat.</p><p>  As for Brassy, well, put it like this: If you are Brassy, please don't read the rest of this review.  It's rarely a good sign when the best track on an album is a 30-second sample of some 50s pop standard.  Anyone who's ever heard a 50s pop standard knows that could not possibly be a compliment of anything on this CD. Anything that was obliquely, lingeringly entertaining about 2000's <em>Got It Made</em> is thrown on the ground here, disparaged, defiled, and left for dead.  It is admittedly significantly more hip-hop-inspired than its predecessor's cauldron of spaz-pop, echo chambers, creepy psychopathic narcissism, and lyrics that all but defined the word ""stoopid.""  This is not saying much.  Lest the genre of hip-hop is at all familiar to you, let it quickly be noted that the hip-hop inflections here are the same ones present on Limp Bizkit's newest album.  I doubt there's a more incompetent DJ in the entire western hemisphere than DJ Swett.  His contribution to his own band's songs is tantamount to what DJ Shadow contributes to the average Tito Puente album: effectively nothing.</p><p>  To dispel with the task at hand in the most harmless way possible: ""Hit 'Em Hard"", ""Mine"", ""Feeling Sorry"", ""Dus'"", and ""Where Did You Get That Funk?"", and, okay, almost every other song on this album, all have some cliched wah-wahing funk guitar that's kind of interesting in its absurd banality until it becomes apparent that there's usually nothing else accompanying them-- for, on average, four minutes straight of our lives. Occasionally, pop/punk guitar bursts will punctuate the meandering attempts at making people ""hit 'em hard"" or ""shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie"" (yes, this is actually repeated in a song) or ""still stealin' when we come to the stage"" or whatever other nonsensical stream-of-boredom choruses get tossed into the mix.  The most unique offering is ""1-0-0"" and this is primarily because it centers itself around a two-note keyboard line and mindless reverbed vocals that, maybe, grasp at some sort of jazz singing amidst the typical Jon Spencer-style egomania, smugness, and vain disco-rapping.  For some point of comparison in terms of sheer pillaging, uniformity, and tedium, I'm going to go with that Jamiroquai song off the <em>Godzilla</em> soundtrack, except I at least liked the bass on that song the first few times I heard it.</p><p>  In the aim of balance, it can be claimed that ""Mine""'s beat is sort of fascinating in the same way tumbling kitchenware is.  Kettles, ambience, radio static, and studio echoing permeates a lot of the mixes, but they're superfluous layers done better elsewhere.  The lyric about ""my unfettered flow"" was briefly amusing. Poor imitations of trip-hop are distributed through a handful of tracks seemingly only to ensure listeners know this group can hollowly duplicate a few more sounds.  And to quietly appreciate aspects of one song, ""Still Stealing"" has a guitar riff as dismembered and discombobulating as P. Diddy's ""Bad Boy for Life"". Whether you think these aspects are enough to warrant interest in this album is up to you.  But they shouldn't be.  Perhaps if you're really into dancing, to the neglect of all intelligence and taste, you could find one or two songs to enjoy here.  For the rest of us, let's forget this whole family and move on with our lives.</p><p> </p></div>"|917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/917-gettin-wise/|2.0|Alex Linhardt

His coolness was in question even
    back in the '70s, despite the grudging thumbs-up (""Springsteen is all right"") Lou Reed gave him on the
    live album <i>Take No Prisoners</i>.  The aging population that loves ""real rock 'n' roll"" are his biggest
    supporters, from rock critic turned producer/manager Jon Landau through biographer Dave Marsh and on down.
    If Springsteen partied with Warhol, the photos are rarely anthologized.</p><p>
    Springsteen is neither glamorous nor mysterious, but as this three-disc compilation demonstrates, he is an
    extremely talented and important artist.  Assembled as part of Columbia's <i>Essential</i> repackaging of
    its signature artists, <i>The Essential Bruce Springsteen</i> is a fine introduction to his work and it
    atones for the shoddy 1995 compilation <i>Greatest Hits</i> (12 tracks are common to both).  The previous
    <i>Hits</i> collection was both too brief, and poorly selected.  <i>The Essential</i> stretches 30 of
    Springsteen's best-known songs over two discs and then adds a third of odds-and-ends.</p><p>
    Springsteen's career has been a series of attacks and retreats.  He stormed out of the gate in 1973 on
    <i>Greetings from Asbury Park</i> as a word-drunk boho who spent as much time in Manhattan as he did on
    the Jersey shore.  Manfred Mann and Greg Kihn made ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""For You"" into hits by
    omitting words, smoothing out Springsteen's chaotic phrasing and tightening the rhythm.  The original
    versions here are loose and elastic as they come, with rubbery drumming by early E Streeter Vinnie Lopez
    that was the polar opposite of Max Weinberg's robotic thud.  The race for the rock 'n' roll prize picked
    up steam later that year with <i>The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle</i>, but here, Springsteen
    traded some of the goofy Dylanesque wordplay of his debut for detailed, romantic character studies that
    borrowed from Van Morrison.  When Tom Waits described Springsteen's songs from this period as ""little black
    and white films,"" he was talking about material like ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"".  And there has
    never been a bar band rave-up quite like ""Rosalita"", which is structured like a suite without losing any
    of its whiteboy R&amp;B; energy.</p><p>
    The final phase of Springsteen's early charge was the 1975 album <i>Born to Run</i>, where he openly stated
    that he was trying to make the greatest rock album of all time (later he clarified that what he was shooting
    for was Phil Spector producing Roy Orbison with words by Dylan).  Songs like ""Born to Run"" and ""Jungleland""
    are overblown to a degree that some find comical (here is the structural template for Meat Loaf's <i>Bat Out
    of Hell</i>).  It's true, these songs swirl and build and jump from one discrete section to the next, and
    who now would try and get away with the line, ""I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight in an
    everlasting kiss""?  (Andrew WK, maybe.)  This is rock mythology as gospel music, and there is no possible
    way to appreciate it other than to give yourself over to it completely.</p><p>
<i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> from 1978 was the first retreat.  Springsteen's lyrical focus darkened
    as his sound became leaner.  This was the record in which Springsteen saw economy as a storytelling virtue,
    perhaps in emulation of fiction writers he admired like Flannery O'Connor.  Unfortunately, <i>Darkness</i>
    is probably the album served most poorly by <i>Essential</i>.  The omission of ""Racing in the Street"" is
    puzzling, considering that it's one of Springsteen's best ballads and also manages to turn the mythology
    of ""Born to Run"" completely on its head.  ""Candy's Room"" is one of his best rock songs and should have
    replaced ""Promised Land"".</p><p>
    The two-disc album <i>The River</i> is difficult to pull from for an anthology.  It was something of a
    summary of what Springsteen had done to that point, its upbeat frat-rock cuts alternating with country
    weepers.  <i>The Essential</i> chooses ""Hungry Heart"" and ""The River"", one great song from each end of
    the spectrum.  Obvious choices, certainly, but sensible.  ""Hungry Heart"" was Springsteen's first Top 10
    single and he followed that popularity by drawing inward and recording the solo acoustic <i>Nebraska</i>,
    the album that has certainly become the indie rock favorite in Springsteen's catalog.  He was at home with
    the four-track years before it became an indie cliché, and he was writing stark, superbly focused songs
    that people have been covering ever since.  ""Nebraska"" and ""Atlantic City"" are the two represented here,
    again completely obvious choices but ones that make the most sense for a Springsteen newcomer.</p><p>
    The second disc of <i>The Essential</i> picks up with ""Born in the USA"".  At some point after <i>Nebraska</i>,
    Springsteen decided to kick his career back into high gear.  His sound got huge, he became versed in the ways
    of MTV (though his videos were awful), and he basically lived in stadiums for a couple years.  <i>Born in
    the USA</i> has little to recommend to an indie purist but listen to ""Dancing in the Dark"" and it's easy
    to hear why it was so popular: Springsteen's melodic gift was at its peak.  <i>The Essential</i> adds
    ""Glory Days"", which I never liked (I would have swapped it for ""I'm on Fire"", the album's subtlest moment),
    and the title track, about which little remains to be said.  It was ironic but the patriots loved (and
    love) it.</p><p>
    After the deluge of <i>Born in the USA</i>, Springsteen laid low for a good ten years to make quieter music
    and eventually raise a family.  <i>Tunnel of Love</i> from 1987, recorded largely alone at his home studio,
    is Springsteen's most underrated album and certainly his last great one.  The title track has the booming
    synth-pop sound of the preceding record, but Springsteen is painting with a finer brush and dealing with
    emotion in the abstract.  ""Brilliant Disguise"" is perhaps Springsteen's finest lyric, a sharply observed
    mediation on vulnerability and self-doubt.  The two albums Springsteen released in 1992 were the weakest
    of his career, and <i>Essential</i> rescues the titles cuts and ""Living Proof"" from the heap (though only
    ""Human Touch"" approaches the best of <i>Tunnel of Love</i>).</p><p>
    Springsteen peaked melodically in the early 80s, but he's compensated for his weaker tunes since by becoming
    a more skilled storyteller.  <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> has the stark sound and detail of some <i>Nebraska</i>
    songs, but the title track, represented here, lacks a tune that sounds like it has always existed.  The
    events of 9/11 energized Springsteen, calling him back to the spotlight for his first record with the E
    Street band since <i>Born in the USA</i>.  I like the melody of ""The Rising"", but it sounds an awful lot
    like Steve Miller's ""Jet Airliner"", and ""Mary's Place"" doesn't have nearly enough of a hook for a song
    about a party.  As demonstrated on these songs and the live tribute to Amadou Diallo, ""American Skin (41
    Shots)"", Springsteen addresses big contemporary topics with nuance, but it's tough to listen to songs
    repeatedly when you know they're connected with a single real-life event.</p><p>
    The bonus rarities disc is spotty but has awesome highs.  It's great to finally have Springsteen's dynamic
    live cover of Jimmy Cliff's ""Trapped"" on CD, which was previously released only on the USA for Africa album
    (it was a radio staple in 1985).  The slow, gentle ""Lift Me Up"", which Springsteen recorded for a John
    Sayles film, has an ungodly beautiful falsetto and perhaps Springsteen's best melody of the 90s.  I could
    do without the cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"", however, and ""Code of Silence"" is a Springsteen rocker on
    autopilot.  But that's why they're a bonus.  The meat of this collection is enough to chew on for a
    lifetime.  The two discs get the Springsteen story as right as is possible in 150 minutes, and if they
    don't work, then Springsteen is definitely not for you.</p></div>"|7727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7727-the-essential-bruce-springsteen/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    record.  For some reason, mingling with heavy riffage and wild drum fills just didn't seem that appealing
    last year.  But absence, as they say, makes the heart grow fonder, and lately I've been craving rock with
    an ""a"" and a ""w"" in doses far greater than I can ever remember.  Enter <i>Major Fables</i>, the third album
    from Boston quintet The Lot Six.  Packing raw throats, a triple-guitar phalanx and several more beats per
    minute than your average rockers, The Lot Six manage to merge punk rage and energy with classic rock flair
    that does away with prefixes and pretense and gets right to the point.</p><p>
    ""Autobrats"" bucks its way out of the gate with a crusty but melodic riff and flails like mad for 3\xBD minutes,
    lead vocalist David Vicini vigorously contributing more mass to the polyps that no doubt coat his vocal cords
    by now.  Blasts of fuzzy bass face off against whirling, skritchy guitars that nod to Fugazi and Drive Like
    Jehu on ""No UFO's"", which also has drummer Lawrence Sinclair royally abusing his toms in the spastically
    shouted chorus.</p><p>
    It's not all wild hammer-ons and buzzsaw axe interplay, though, as some funky tack piano finds its way into
    ""I Was You"" courtesy of guitarist Julian Cassanetti, who also handles trombone on the song.  The track
    bounces through its verses, Vicini trading his shout for a wayward croon and then trading it back for some
    outlandish outbursts on the chorus.  ""X-Rayted"" bursts with three-chord Kinks riffs, and Vicini goes totally
    Ian MacKaye on us on ""Out of Control"" with his wildly shouted refrain of, ""Ordinary everyday people ought to
    stay that way.""</p><p>
    Things only really slow down twice on <i>Major Fables</i>-- once for the pastiche country of ""My Baby's
    Gone"", which comes complete with closing time harmonies and a bit of slide guitar from Apollo Sunshine's
    Sam Cohen; and once again for the more ambitious and less tongue-in-cheek ""Go to Sleep"", whose slow-motion
    ska groove is damn tedious.  Which is unfortunate, because these guys do some of their best work at their
    most ambitious; last year's <i>Animals</i> is still their best album precisely <i>because</i> it aimed high.
    <i>Major Fables</i> may be more focused and consistent, but it's also less compelling as a result.  That the
    band appears to be retreating here from a more expansive approach is a shame.</p><p>
    Still, this album is a taut blast of muscle-bound rock with enough brains to lodge a bevy of splintered
    riffs and shouted hooks in yours.  When the bone-headed punk of closer ""Die Polizei"" ends things on a
    ragged, delirious note, it puts the cap on a satisfyingly rough-and-tumble collection of songs that,
    while failing to constitute a masterpiece, will nonetheless give your adrenal glands a swift kick.</p></div>"|4870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4870-major-fables/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    truth.  To that end, I'm going to start writing this review before I do the obligatory background research
    on the mystery that is Colleen, frightened as I am to be let down by the actual story behind this
    group/band/woman/entity.  <i>Everyone Alive Wants Answers</i> is one of those albums that has me
    quick-drawing on the ""unlike anything I've heard"" cliché, a curious album that catches my pop-oriented
    fancy even though it's clearly more Dominique or Richard-San territory.  The cue cards read ""glacial""
    and ""ambient,"" but I'd rather make up my own interpretation.</p><p>
    The opening, self-titled track is, appropriately, a thesis statement of the record's approach, cutting in
    abruptly with a ragged-edged loop of what sounds like a harp played with a sharp rock.  Loops like these
    are the foundation of Colleen's unusual sound, though to call them loops is pretty much a technical
    overstatement; more accurately, they'd be called skips.  If Oval made music by meticulously scratching
    compact discs, Colleen's compositions appear to manifest themselves out of vinyl scratches, the repetitions
    coming less from ProTools Ctrl+V-ing than from a stylus sentenced to trace the same groove forever.</p><p>
    Many tracks add instrumentation of some sort over these backdrops, like the title song, which features
    soloing that sounds like an octopus tuning a piano in double time.  Others add layers of malfunctioning
    records to build atmosphere like a slowcore DJ, ""Ritournelle"" weaving ellipses of soft vibraphone,
    eternally swelling strings, and dust particle crackles into an Elfman-esque score that's equal parts
    creepy and fantastical.  Colleen's attic toybox seems bottomless: ""One Night and It's Gone"" has a ""bassline""
    crafted from different tones of static hiss, ""Nice and Simple"" features a chorus of music boxes, while
    ""Long Live Mice in the Metro"" incorporates backwards tweaking and heavily treated effects without
    sacrificing organic warmth.</p><p>
    Chances are, there are modern compositional precedents for all of these sounds-- hell, some of them have
    modern Björk-asitional precedents even I've heard before.  And while <i>Everyone Alive Wants Answers</i>
    is most definitely top-heavy, hitting its peak with the first two songs and losing focus as the rough-edged
    loops make fewer appearances, at 39 minutes it ends before one's iPod finger gets itchy.  Thirteen tracks
    wrapped in a reassuring blanket of fuzz, it's the perfect headphones soundtrack to a bus ride through
    ultraviolet city snow.</p><p>
    Turns out Colleen is, in fact, a she, though it's a she confusingly named Cecile, and she's from Paris,
    which explains some of the exoticism.  Instruments reported include glockenspiel, cello, Melodica, and
    music box, with nary an octopus to be seen.  The truth is only a slight disappointment (at least it's not
    another unshaven guy with a Powerbook and a fiber-optic light show) but a letdown nonetheless, though it's
    no fair fight pitting actual biography against my commute-time imaginings in this post-liner notes age--
    an age that suits <i>Everyone Alive Wants Answers</i>, one of those rare, truly evocative abstract pieces
    of art where every observer takes away their own interpretation, and is left feeling a little more special
    about their experience as a result.</p></div>"|1743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1743-everyone-alive-wants-answers/|8.4|Rob Mitchum

    when even The Offspring can manage to
    garner esteem for ""keeping punk alive"" merely by sucking for ten years
    running. ""Everything's so goddamned
    obligatory!"" cries the punk relic. ""The sound, the look, the act-- time
    was, this whole thing used to be
    about standing apart, not blending in!"" And it was, for about a day,
    until Richard Hell ostensibly wore a
    ripped t-shirt onstage and finally gave everyone a consensus-cool role
    model (if only 'cause most of them
    couldn't pull off the Dolls' drag, or Reed's arrogance). Sure, the
    great bands still beat a few divergent
    paths even if they all ended at the same idealistic destination, and to
    be fair, no one too far under 40
    can know the exact feeling of starvation and heroin addiction in the
    Bowery circa 1973 or water-rationing
    in England, but neither did most of the bondage-clad horde back then,
    either. It's the nature of a trend:
    only a few people are allowed to drive-- the rest are along for the
    ride.</p><p>I realize that punk rock's own Trail of Tears is a long road to
    travel just for me to lead up to The
    Distillers (but here we are)-- doubly so because I'm about to ask you
    to disregard all of it. I only
    mention it because that specter of some sort of ideal or credibility is
    inescapable. Still, for all the
    talk of parallels between Hole/Nirvana and Brodie Dalle's
    Distillers/ex-husband Tim Armstrong's Rancid,
    all the willful categorization, all the thousand-times-old liberty
    spikes, chains, and piercings, The
    Distillers have created one hell of a rock album-- and it doesn't
    purport to be anything more.</p><p><em>Coral Fang</em> impresses not just by some nebulous ""punk""
    standards, but by the standards of just about
    anyone who wants to be rocked gently out of sleep by the dulcet tones
    of thrashing guitars, pogo-friendly
    love songs, and possibly the most compellingly forceful female punk vocals since Exene Cervenka wailed her
    way out of the nihilistic abyss that cartographers call ""L.A."" Here,
    technical ability takes a back seat
    to frantic blasts of distortion and mechanical percussion like a
    metronome powered by the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p>Though far from a three-chord wonder, <em>Coral Fang</em> doesn't
    fall far from a typically SoCal sound--
    the chord changes aren't rocket science, but the rhythms are fast and
    the fills are rare, quick and
    poisonous. From the lonely start/stop build of ""The Hunger"", to the
    jackhammer assaults and beautifully
    harmonized choruses of ""Coral Fang"" or ""Die on a Rope"", the album's
    range is strictly textbook material,
    albeit with some uncommonly effective production. With surprising
    consistency, The Distillers come off
    like a cross between X at their most incomparably, beautifully raw and
    the greased-up melodies of an angry
    Rocket from the Crypt.</p>
<p>But this is really Brodie Dalle's show; her razor-cut cords are the
    bastard product of Mike Ness and Exene
    Cervenka, and from the sound of things, they could possibly go on to
    rule the world if sufficiently provoked.
    Anyone who lifted a hand to champion Karen O as some symbol of modern
    empowerment in rock music, take note,
    because Dalle is everything Karen isn't: an impassioned, powerful
    frontwoman, the legitimate heart of her
    band, and probably the most dominating female presence-at-large (read:
    receiving M2 rotation) in rock right
    now. Not that she has much competition, apart from O and maybe plastic
    surgery disaster Courtney Love, but
    if the field were increased tenfold, I'd still like her odds. She has a
    wearied depth and subtlety in her
    voice that lends genuine weight to what otherwise might seem merely
    passable punk anthems, and a charm and
    vulnerability that carries more conviction and authenticity than
    caricature-- which is an almost unspeakably
    rare trait for someone who opens her record shouting, ""All my friends
    are murderers.""</p>
<p>Dalle gives <em>Coral Fang</em> what may be best described as a sense
    of near-maturity. It's an earnest call
    among the crowd of would-be voices of youth in carefully controlled and
    marketed revolt, but also provides
    a hint of the adolescent sense that real revolt is a logical means to
    an end. It panders to that angst-ridden
    vibe somewhat, alternately flexing and wallowing, but it's ultimately
    forgivable; as long as a kid dreams of
    smashing the system while struggling to balance equations before
    homeroom, there'll be a need for this. The
    classically retarded, album-ending storm of outro chaos raises the
    sense of gratuity a little higher, but
    not as much as so, so many have in the past-- like Rancid, or Bad
    Religion, or even the Sex Pistols, say.</p>
<p><em>""Wait, what the hell are you doing coming back to 'punk rock?'
    Isn't this, like, not about that stuff?""</em></p>
<p>An astute question, friend (cue music for the sappy resolution, and
    fight back the tears, kids-- I'll keep
    the after-school special brief). I don't know, maybe the punk ""ideal""
    of pure individualism passed rock by
    for bands like Liars, or for Kevin Drumm, or any number of other
    artists who are really unburdened by the
    need for critical or popular success, even if they sometimes get it.
    But if simply knowing <em>Coral Fang</em>
    rocks exceptionally hard isn't enough, I'll say this: die-hard ""punk as
    fuck""-ers can (and likely will)
    easily find reason to cry themselves to sleep on their badass
    spiked-leather pillows, and
    The Distillers
    might not be able to spot a new idea with the Hubble, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">and</span> no one will single-handedly
    save any faltering
    genre anytime soon, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">and</span> even
    with that ""punk"" stigma looming large... <em>Coral Fang</em> is
    still a
    proud
    achievement.</p></div>"|2537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2537-coral-fang/|8.0|Eric Carr

    behind The Dirty Projectors:</p><p>
<li> The Yale dropout is (why pull punches?) a nobrow genius, who claims to find similar solaces in the
    work of Beethoven, Wagner, Zeppelin and Timberlake.<p>
<li> He is obsessed with rendering into song an image that congeals the iconography of Poe, Hitchcock, and
    McDonalds.  That image: a young man defending himself from an army of finches by pelting them with french
    fries.  This daymare haunts Longstreth's (for freak-out fans only) <i>Morning Better Last</i> EP and his
    current album <i>The Glad Fact</i>, as well as his forthcoming ""double EP"", <i>Slaves' Graves and Ballads</i>
    (half of which will feature his ten-piece Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra), and
    his upcoming ""glitch opera,"" <i>The Getty Address</i>.<p>
<li> His (often multi-tracked) vocals are (often wonderfully) way over the top: he belts like a conspicuous
    olden minstrel who'd be murdered by his knights, croons like a homeless, yankee Morrissey, warbles like an
    acid-bent Jim James, panics like a bansheefied M. Ward, and even occasionally barks like a castrati
    Casablancas.  These comparisons are cute indie lilypads for us to drink to, but I am still failing to
    communicate how soothing Longstreth can sound, how raceless, and how sincerely surreal.  I could throw
    more vocal styles at you (Xiu Xiu, Bobby McFerrin, TV on the Radio), but the neighbors and their cops
    would think we were causing a disturbance.<p>
<li> He wrote much of <i>The Glad Fact</i> in lungbursts, accompanying himself with a fist on the roof of
    his car.  One of the album's showpieces, ""My Offwhite Flag"", with its deconstructed Toots &amp; The Maytals
    versus Need New Body vibe, evokes a Lockheed Martin post-kaboom-scape: to this song the listener can
    picture a West that has been smithereened into archipelagodom, where the human survivors place their faith
    in po-mo calypso's power to impress the warlord carnival judges.<p>
<li> He doesn't cling to any lo-fi manifesto, telling me in an email Q&amp;A; that championing one aesthetic as
    somehow offering more texture than another is ""like religion, a way of training your gaze to obscure what's
    in front of you.""  While he promises that his next project will be 5.1, fuzz-and-buzzheads may savor the
    Robert Pollard chords of ""Naked We Made It"" and the underplayed epic solo of ""Lit from Below"".<p>
<li> He has created some bizarrely tuned and timed Connecticut jazz. ""Boredom Is a Product"" plays like Owls
    being led by a drag Nina Simone; the brilliantly strummed ""Like Fake Blood in Crisp October"" suggests a
    pre-intermission ballad from <i>Institutionalizing Porgy and Bess</i>.  Longstreth coos the Liars-esque
    line, ""That's not a monument/ It's a grave,"" only to transcend it: ""The new feelings will probably be buried
    here, too.""<p>
    
    Let me clarify my earlier reliance on ""genius.""  Longstreth is not necessarily a zeitgeisty and palatable
    master assimilator (see Bob Dylan).  He's another kind of genius, the unhinged, half-formed kind who
    sometimes overconceives and overexecutes (see Phil Elvrum).  D-Lo has, fittingly, toured with several of
    the experi-mellow bands out of the increasingly mystical K Records compound.</p><p>
    
    Also be warned: if you grew up in the back of a stationwagon, near a ""classic parking lot at the end of
    time,"" prepare for a life-changingly deadpan and exultant refrain about those days of plastic passion:
    no one can swoon ""We drank a two-liter of Orange Crush"" the way Dave Longstreth does.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|2534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2534-the-glad-fact/|8.5|William Bowers

    a more fruitful career than one lived by poor Kelis.  The charismatic vocalist is (was?) the perfect voice
    for Star Trak's sci-fi disco, and should rightfully be a household name by now.  The limelight, however,
    managed to elude her over the course of her past two albums, marking her for a career more akin to that
    of Bubba Sparxxx: some critical acclaim, a slight public profile, but otherwise wrongly written off as a
    diversionary pet project for a superstar producer.</p><p>
    It all started well: a duet with ODB (""Got Your Money"") and a minor hit (""Caught Out There"", with the
    memorable refrain, ""I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!"") from a fantastic debut, <i>Kaleidoscope</i>, which
    made more than one PFM writer's best-of-the-90s list.  Sadly, the record-- an offbeat blend of afrofuturism
    and futuristic beats-- was merely a cult hit, and her no-less-accomplished follow-up, the prescient lo-fi
    digital disco-spattered <i>Wanderland</i>, wasn't even released domestically.</p><p>
    A steady stream of guest appearances with everyone from dance producers Richard X, Moby, and Timo Maas to
    Star Trak cohorts Philly's Most Wanted and N.E.R.D. kept her in the public sphere, if still largely out of
    the public eye.  The result of it all has made Kelis one of the unluckiest women in pop, so when, on her
    <i>Tasty</i> collaboration with fiancé Nas, she says she wants to get it on ""in public,"" she could as likely
    mean MTV or the glossy pages of music monthlies as ""a club bathroom or a restaurant mens' room.""  Too often
    here, it sounds as if she's aiming for that alone, trading the eccentricity and rough-edged headsnap of her
    first two albums for a fairly generic run of radio-friendly sounds: nu-soul balladry, a Rick Rubin-circa-1986
    outtake, and some Neptunes-by-numbers.  Indeed, with <i>Tasty</i>, Kelis has left the roller-rink, returned
    from outer space, and she's back on her own two feet on terra firma-- unfortunately.</p><p>
    That Nas collaboration, ""In Public"", is possibly the low-point of what is often a transparent Beyoncé-aping
    full-length (starting with the cover art, which bares a striking resemblance to that of the ""Crazy in Love""
    single).  Naturally, Kelis' relationship with Jay-Z's one-time sparring partner Nas aids comparisons like
    this, but they're deserved nonetheless, as the once fiercely individualistic singer now seems content
    the constitute one-half of Bonnie and Clyde '04.</p><p>
    Despite her concessions to shoot higher in the charts, <i>Tasty</i> is far from all doom-and-gloom.
    Ironically, it's one of the album's most adventurous beats, ""Milkshake"", that's providing Kelis a
    breakthrough-- all the more reason to lament the pair of sluggish duets with Raphael Saadiq and the
    woeful Neptunes track ""Sugar Honey Iced Tea"", which both demonstrate touches of straight-laced, polite
    nu-soul.  Most of The Neptunes' tracks are fine, and all are recognizable-- you know the drill by now--
    but little to get excited about.</p><p>
    Outkast's Andre 3000 puts in appearance as well, reciprocating for Kelis' guest spot on ""Dracula's Wedding"",
    with a decent track that, while an improvement on most of his overcooked work on <i>The Love Below</i>,
    still feels a bit slight, like a sketch or an idea half-realized-- and which ironically relegates Kelis
    herself to the margins.  Dallas Austin punches above his weight with ""Trick Me"", on which Kelis advises
    to ""call the police/ There's a madwoman in town,"" over a skanking, slightly echoed guitar.  Alas, that's
    a warning more apropos for <i>Kaleidoscope</i> and <i>Wanderland</i>, but since neither of those records

    melodies and oozing, drone-heavy vocals, it's difficult to acclimate an active, warm-blooded body to
    the band's aggressively wound-down aesthetic.  Winter helps-- think slowly rising walls of snow,
    landscapes thinning into grey, or puddles quietly settling into dark, cloudy slabs of ice.  The view
    from here: dramatic, formless, and heartbreakingly barren.</p><p>
    
    The pet project of Drunk's Rick Alverson, Spokane marries docile boy/girl coos, barely-present,
    chattering-teeth percussion (check a handful of tiny, dull cymbal clicks), blurry guitar, and plenty
    of big, shuddering echoes.  <i>Measurement</i>, the group's fourth full-length, sees Labradford's
    Robert Donne pitching in on bass, who must be at least partially accountable for Spokane's sudden
    shift away from the punchy strings and smaller spaces of their first two records, 2000's <i>Leisure
    and Other Songs</i> and 2001's <i>The Proud Graduates</i>.</p><p>
    
    More generous listeners might find <i>Measurement</i>'s epically unmediated expanse ""unsentimental"" or
    ""minimalist,"" but convincing detachment isn't always enough to justify the tedium that goes hand in hand
    with these kinds of stark artistic decisions.  <i>Measurement</i> boasts a few glorious moments (see the
    creepy, music-box chiming of ""An Ideal History"", or the cascading strings during the closing minutes of
    ""Temporary Things""), but most of the record's eight airy tracks bleed together into a single blurred image,
    as forgettable as it is stirring.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Plotted Courses"" begins with a low-pitched buzz, Alverson's whispered vocals hitting like feathers
    and stirring up tiny puffs of poetry: ""Nightstands and cupboards/ And bedside prayers/ Mittens full of
    snow/ And the promise of warm hands.""  Layered over timid guitar and pulling strings, and backed by
    vocalist Courtney Bowles' breathy sighs, the song is a spare, haunting indictment that feels almost
    unbearably light, far too fragile to take anywhere after it's over.</p><p>
    
    ""Cities"" starts with Alverson murmuring on the subtle deceits of time (""The length of days has widened now/
    The cost of time seems clear/ And the terms that I had settled on/ Just hid behind the year""), his
    ruminations bolstered by the pitch-perfect harmonizing of Bowles and some shaky hi-hat pings.  Lilting
    and repetitive, this is <i>Measurement</i>'s strongest track, its sonic trickery in perfect line with
    Alverson's narrative goals.</p><p>
    
    Cerebral, throbbing, and spineless, <i>Measurement</i> can be a lovely listen, but it's ultimately too
    hazy to hold up-- depending on your capacity for heavy-lidded brooding, Spokane can seem either
    transcendent or completely unbearable.</p></div>"|7425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7425-measurement/|6.3|Amanda Petrusich

    reluctantly inspired at worst, there's never been a successful method of conveying what must have been one
    of the great live shows in the history of rock.  Even if it hardly needs to be mentioned at this point, The
    Magic Band's music aspires to a confluence of all the most visceral and kinetic forms of music in the last
    century: sliding, sling-shotting Chicago blues, cindered rockabilly brannigans, eviscerating free-jazz
    convulsions, and spontaneous ""turn on, drop out"" happenings.  One would imagine a Magic Band at their prime
    could, at the very least, challenge the galvanic pandemonium of a Ronnie Hawkins/Albert Ayler double-bill.
    If the U.S. could harness this kind of energy, we wouldn't be in Iraq right now.  Unfortunately, for the
    last three decades, the official live Beefheart concerts have been pretty dismal: They either document some
    of the less interesting permutations of the band in the 1980s or are marred by poor recording technology.
    There was a slight consolation for the wealthy businessman who happened to find themselves in the German
    bootleg market; the rest of us suffered in silence.</p><p>
    
    Until now.  Or, actually, three years ago.  In 2000, Rhino Handmade released an Internet-only 1.16-disc
    recording of the <i>Shiny Beast</i>-era Magic Band at a November 1978 show in Long Island.  Now it's being
    re-released all over Amazon.com and your local Blockbuster Music, permitting all those off-line backcountry
    hippies to relive their glory days without sacrificing their bizarre commune lifestyles.  Most of the
    selections in the 85-minute show are drawn from 1978's <i>Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)</i>, Beefheart's
    return to form after three previous lackluster albums.  However, there's also ample material from 1967's
    gorged garage masterpiece, <i>Safe as Milk</i>, 1972's eerily approachable <i>Clear Spot</i>, and <i>Trout
    Mask Replica</i>.</p><p>
    
    For a band often accused of an overly abstract exploitation of rhythm and blues, this particular Magic Band
    incarnation can growl like a toasted bar-band or keep the sort of lock-step dance percussion that later
    generations would ignorantly deem ""post-rock.""  On ""Owed T'Alex"" and ""Tropical Hot Dog Night"", the guitars
    are weightless, flickering, and muted.  Robert Williams' drums are given prominence and Bruce Fowler's
    epically metal trombone plunges straight to the Earth's core.  And, of course, there's also Beefheart's
    deranged grumbling of lyrics that even Freud would shake his head at.  The yelping crowd, alternately
    entranced and exasperated, drives the Captain to ever-further limits of howling depravity.  His voice is
    more carcinogenic than Bob Dylan's, more drunkenly spastic than Hasil Adkins', and more sinisterly sepulchral
    than Johnny Cash's.</p><p>
    
    Even more interesting than the <i>Shiny Beast</i> tracks, however, is the band's rendition of songs written
    by an earlier Magic Band.  Guitarists Jeff Tepper and Richard Redus never try to simply ape Zoot Horn
    Rollo's legendary lunacy on <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>.  Instead, on ""Old Fart at Play"", ""Moonlight on
    Vermont"", and ""Veteran's Day Poppy"", the new band folds the cuttingly arrhythmic honks and squawks into
    traditional blues arcs that are only apparent after the ""riff"" is over.  This perfectly captures the whole
    point of Beefheart's music: not to sound crazy, but to sound one step away from normal, like a jigsaw puzzle
    that coincidentally fits together without making the intended picture.  Though Beefheart's vocals on the
    older <i>Safe as Milk</i> songs aren't always up to his usual standard, the songs themselves seem faster,
    leaner, and, on ""Dropout Boogie"", even more self-parodic, like a teenage anthem played from the bottom of
    a well.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, the most enticing aspect of this might be Beefheart's between-song banter.  He somehow manages
    to sound even more unhinged than he sounds in the studio.  By the end of the second song, he's already
    rambling about Roslyn's Hollywood telephone cords to a clearly hostile audience.  At other points, he
    breaks off a performance to yell (at an audience member?) about assuming a song is in 4/4 and blames the
    death of poetry on a 24-hour Denny's.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, then, this is a damn good time.  Still, <i>I'm Going to Do What I Wanna Do</i> certainly doesn't
    recommend itself to Beefheart neophytes.  Although it's surely the best official Beefheart live release on
    the market right now, I will be personally offended if you listen to it before hearing his studio albums.
    At the same time, isolated milliseconds of a song like ""Suction Prints"" have been converted into entire
    albums by indie cognoscenti in the 80s and 90s.  There are one or two moments on this show, towards the
    end, that are as close to a pure distillation of rock energy as this sad world is ever likely to get.  It
    comes down to this: one of the best bands of the 70s playing some of the most intimidating and irrational
    songs of the century in front of a crowd of acidheads and hooligans.</p></div>"|1742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1742-im-going-to-do-what-i-wanna-do-live-at-my-fathers-place-1978/|8.5|Alex Linhardt

    sublime world of minimalist electronica (1999's <i>Pop Loops for Breakfast</i>, and 2000's <i>A Choir of
    Empty Beds</i>) behind him.  Those record displayed enough glitch-friendly melodic bliss to satisfy fans
    of both Prefuse 73 and Arvo Pärt, but with <i>Welcome Tourist</i>, he attempts, like his labelmates, to
    push the IDM envelope.  Here, for the first time, Fleischmann has added a varied assortment of live
    instrumentation to his once-solo, groovebox-born musings: Fleischmann himself plays piano, drums, and
    vibraphone, and fleshes the mix out with saxophone, steel guitar, and looped slabs of musique concrete
    sampling which he has presumably collected while touring.   Unfortunately, though this fusion of sonic
    elements has produced remarkably vibrant results on albums like The Notwist's <i>Neon Golden</i>, and
    Ms. John Soda's <i>No P. or D.</i>, Fleischmann's double-disc <i>Welcome Tourist</i> is a stubbornly
    monotonous and solemn affair.</p><p>
    The album's twelve compositions (eleven on the first disc, and one 45-minute excursion on the second) are
    anchored around a quote from American political iconoclast Henry David Thoreau's <i>Civil Disobedience</i>.
    While Fleischmann's pieces seem too icily removed from Thoreau's heated, emotive writings, many of the
    record's formal components are tainted with their own brand of individualist politics.  Part of the reason
    the album seems so distant is that Fleischmann no longer allows his melodies to take sonic center stage;
    each pristine melodic motif is shrouded under sweepingly oppressive and unruly blankets of distortion.  In
    this context, <i>Welcome Tourist</i> seems to present an aesthetic power struggle among different layers of
    opposing musical strata.  Rather than simply allowing these divergent textures to harmonize, Fleischmann
    aims to show that there will always be an oppressor, and an oppressed, striving for freedom.</p><p>
    These power roles remain in constant flux throughout the record.  ""A Letter from Home"" features the subdued
    groove of a live drumkit holding steady under a wondrous piano theme reminiscent of Sigur Rós' ""Untitled
    #1"", only to be disrupted by boisterous rounds of wailing distortion and icy electronic meandering.  Later
    in the track, the blissful calm of a saxophone (courtesy of Charhizma Records guru Christof Kurzmann) appears
    like a referee helping to quell the established aesthetic tension.  The choppy hip-hop bounce of ""Grunt""
    spotlights this same formal equation to equally moving results; a frenetic layer of crumbling sub-atomic
    sheen holds the muted gloom of tumbling piano notes and the interweaving rhythmic motifs of live drumming
    and skittering glitch-friendly pops under lock and key.</p><p>
    The shining moment of <i>Welcome Tourist</i>, as it so happens, is in complete opposition to the stark
    instrumental IDM gloom that populates much of the record; near the end of the first disc, ""Le Desir""
    swoops in, a modest burst of pure glitch-pop exuberance.  The song (which was previously released in
    another form, and is one of two non-instrumental tracks here) comes as a proverbial breath of fresh air,
    perfectly capturing Fleischmann's individual championing ideology without coming at the expense of his
    own music's energy.  Over a bed of wistfully melting Rhodes notes and the minimal, driving bounce of
    electropop liveliness, Christof Kurzman sings empathy-laden lyrics like, ""Yes, we have dreams, and we want
    them to come true/ Yes, we will live for these moments, me and you/ There's more to life than the everyday
    routine/ Keep this in mind until life becomes your dream.""  ""Le Desir"" is a rare inspired moment of
    unhampered sentiment, and its purity offers respite from the record of <i>Welcome Tourist</i>'s bitter
    tension.</p><p>
    Much of this record can be summed up in its stagnant, 45-minute closure, appropriately titled ""Take Your
    Time"".  Over the course of an album's length, Fleischmann projects a six-note piano motif within as many
    different stylistic cues as possible, from country to rock to IDM to jazz.  Ultimately, though, like
    the project as a whole, the track is wildly ambitious, but unfortunately, far too refined to match its
    scope with any lasting sonic ingenuity.</p></div>"|3282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3282-welcome-tourist/|6.8|Hartley Goldstein

    their balance on a downtown train.  Their gestures of voice, guitar, and rhythm are promptly drowned in
    brake drones, the shuddering of the decrepit old tracks, and plastic-protected ads for acne surgery and
    model-proffered Budweisers.  All I can hear through the din is the disquieting roar of Mars and singer
    China Burg's sinister slurring: ""What I put together, I can take apart.""</p><p>
    
    Since I refuse to spend the $30 for a CD copy of <i>No New York</i>, I'm grateful to have the complete
    recordings of Mars (count one seven-inch, four tracks from <i>NNY</i>, and one EP-- a half-hour in total)
    howling through my headphones.  For those keeping track, since the digital age, another complete discography
    of Mars already came out on the Atavistic label, but with vague sonic tweaking by Foetus scraper Jim
    Thirlwell.  Purists might argue that since band member Mark Cunningham used a different master tape for
    transferring the <i>Mars</i> EP (even restoring its binaural recording quality), it's still not going to
    sound like the ""murkier"" frequencies of the original wax.  From the metallic sparkle of the midnight blue
    card sleeve to the insightful commentary offered by the remaining members (Sumner Crane passed away earlier
    this year), this limited edition package is too exquisite to overlook, no matter how distressing the aural
    mess splattered inside.</p><p>
    
    For those obsessed with the no-wave aura, the biggest surprise would appear to be their first single,
    ""3E""/""11,000 Volts"".  The quartet of Burg, Crane, Cunningham, and drummer Nancy Arlen were still toying
    with post-punk in 1977, the instruments fairly coherent as they churned together.  Sumner could've sounded
    as haunted as Ian Curtis were he not evoking <i>Swann's Way</i> in the lyrics.  On the flip, the
    ever-encroaching menace of their sound manifests itself, seeping up around the eerie utterances of China
    Burg.  It continues to seethe through certain moments of Sonic Youth and the Dead C, up through the Liars
    and Yeah Yeah Yeahs today, but here it's an uncut sound that curdles milk into white-noise gobs.</p><p>
    
    Mars' quarter of <i>No New York</i> still stuns, despite Eno's fabled ""no production"" technique.  From the
    strafing runs of ""Helen Forsdale"" through the bleary stabs of ""Hairwaves"", they remain beyond rock (or any
    music's) reason.  Whether smothering everything in the claustrophobic horrors of ""Tunnel"" or flashing a
    brief second of funk bass before the hallucinated ""Puerto Rican Ghost"", their malice merges with the absurd.
    How else to have sneered lyrics about ""pimply pimply skin so reptilian"" and off-track betting go with
    transcriptions of homeless madmen, snatches of impenetrable French writer Raymond Rousseau, and readings
    from <i>The Theory of Business Enterprises</i> sound so deranged and (the biggest surprise for me) dangerous
    still?</p><p>
    
    As they continued to devolve and finally disintegrate, by December of 1978, Mars happen upon disinterred
    beats and sonic dementia too bleak to ever again be approximated.  Lurching and moaning like the undead,
    their final EP (basically a live performance for no one, recorded by Arto Lindsay) is scabrous and abhorrent
    listening.  Nothing gags a fashionable name-dropper like ""The Immediate Stages of the Erotic"", their final
    three minutes.  Despite a vocal performance that purportedly draws on Kirkegaard and ancient Egyptian
    consonants, these are the band's death spasms, their sound like a bag lady retching up rodenticide while
    roasting on the third rail, beyond thought and notated music into the tarry, animalistic pit of it all.
    Harrowing and writhing beyond the constraints of any art concept or tidy movement, Mars music falls apart
    like zombie limbs, no matter how anyone tries to piece it back together.</p></div>"|5563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5563-the-complete-studio-recordings-nyc-1977-1978/|7.9|Andy Beta

    ever-constricting labels: Maybe more so than any other sonic subculture, floppy-haired, pink-faced
    singer/songwriters have an odd tendency to eschew ""sensitive"" pigeonholing by employing jerky beats and
    wobbly loops, threading in synth lines to counteract their earnest acoustic strums.  Thus, the emergence
    of a formula: Temper organics by sneaking in squeaky electronic bits, each earthy, misty-eyed component
    carefully offset by its cold, shiny opposite.</p><p>
    Australian press-prodigy Ben Lee's last full-length, 1998's <i>Breathing Tornadoes</i>, saw him pushing
    the same kind of disappointingly benign electro-folk aesthetic: precious warbling layered over limp,
    tittering beats, an endless expanse of flaccid, noncommittal elevator-pop without the hooks or ingenuity
    to endure.  Nearly six years have passed since that album's release (Lee's label, the Beastie Boy-owned
    Grand Royal, has since collapsed), and while Lee has since roped in an impressive collaborator-- shockingly,
    <i>Hey You</i> was produced by Dan the Automator-- and spent plenty of time weaseling around with fellow
    pop-rockers Ben Kweller, Ben Folds, and Evan Dando, his artistic agenda hasn't shifted in any significant
    way.</p><p>
    If anything, <i>Hey You, Yes You</i> is remarkable for its blankness; the record putters along, dopily
    paced and packed with glib, yawning one-liners (""It's not my fault/ Your love's like salt""), politely
    trotting itself into the ground.  While not quite as self-consciously electro-drenched as <i>Breathing
    Tornadoes</i>, <i>Hey You</i> has more than enough instantly forgettable lite-rock quasi-noodling to
    compensate for its lost beats.</p><p>
    While Lee never quite grew into the brilliance his chattering critics predicted, his earlier releases
    nonetheless showcased an ability to pen inescapable pop hooks, which was vaguely remarkable, given his
    age: At 14, Lee, then fronting childhood band Noise Addict, was stacking up massive piles of next-big-thing
    press clippings, unilaterally lauded for his songwriting prowess and championed by cred-heavy U.S. artists
    like Thurston Moore (who released Noise Addict's demo as an EP, on his Ecstatic Peace label) and Mike D.
    (who later signed Lee to Grand Royal).  <i>Hey You, Yes You</i> reveals little of young Lee's fervor, and
    even less of his energy: Opener ""Running with Scissors"" is as clichéd as its title: A goofy guitar riff
    and Lee's high warbles coalesce into a perfectly generic whole, while the synthesized percussion keeping
    time beneath sounds plucked from the pre-programmed beatbank of a cheap Casio.</p><p>
    ""Dirty Mind"" features the keyboard stylings of Phantom Planet's Jason Schwartzman (who also co-wrote
    ""Chills"", a sappy trip-hop lament that boasts the face-souring/mind-blowing chorus, ""You give me chills"")
    and is, regrettably, <i>Hey You</i>'s most instantly palatable track, a bouncy, vocals-heavy bit of blippy
    folk-rock.  ""Music 4 the Young and Foolish"" (chorus: ""'Cause this is music/ 4 the young and foolish"") seems
    unintentionally dated with its clunky, oddly arrhythmic disco swells.  ""No Room to Bleed"" is almost
    embarrassingly overwrought, its plaintive piano melody periodically interrupted by bursts of drum machine,
    and Lee's mournful coos landing like the yelps of a less smirky Ben Folds.  By now, the straightforward
    folk-ballad ""Shine"" feels gloriously, refreshingly honest.</p><p>
    It's possible that Ben Lee's been perpetually distracted by his numerous side projects, or simply gotten
    too comfortable with steady mediocrity.  Either way, <i>Hey You, Yes You</i> is a wincingly ordinary
    experiment in wincingly ordinary songwriting.  Folk-beat formula can, occasionally, yield brilliant (or
    at least interesting) results, building unexpectedly prickly tensions-- or, it can allow, as it does here,
    for a record that sounds stifled, contrived, and unbearably trite.</p></div>"|4712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4712-hey-you-yes-you/|3.1|Amanda Petrusich

    Records, I inevitably felt drawn to take advantage of the record store's extremely unorthodox and
    potentially self-destructive perk: a cart-blanche listening station.  The only true try-before-buy I
    know of, short of supermarket samples and certain types of prostitution, any album can be cracked open
    and held suspect to the stylus; everyone, it seems, has struggled through the Merzbox for at least a
    couple hours.</p><p>
    
    This feature finds itself particularly useful in the case of those countless, expensive electronic imports
    that continually elude the P2Ps.  My criterion for the day was admittedly simple-minded: I was perfectly
    beat-happy, and the debut innards of Montreal-based Egg's digipak, <i>Don't Postpone Joy</i>, had to be,
    too.  The disc, beyond the onus of introducing artists Julien Roy and Guillaume Coutu-Dumont, also
    inaugurates Mutek Records, which plans to issue a compilation of its successful Montreal experimental
    electronic festival namesake and a wealth of similar-minded local Montreal talent.</p><p>
    
    Much of <i>Don't Postpone Joy</i> is largely upbeat, falling squarely in the crib of minimal electronic's
    archetypal, failsafe slickness.  The record most consistently recalls the darker, respoked big beats and
    glitchy quirk of Mouse on Mars' <i>Idiology</i> and the crisp, wiry sampling (and geography) of Akufen's
    <i>My Way</i>-- although in forgoing a reliance on hooks for almost suffocating builds of cut-ups and added
    instrumental lines, this duo seems to aspire less to the dancefloor than to some intensified abstraction
    of its sweat.</p><p>
    
    ""Alternative Biology"", ""La Corde"" and ""Continuous Drizzle"" constitute the album's dark, delicately composed
    opening sequence.  There's more rhythm present in these tracks than in the more abstract material of Eggs'
    contemporaries in Mouse on Mars, as shots of synth are fired into vast, open chambers, and vocal cut-ups
    echo and pan across the Bucaphelan bounce.  An unobtrusive bassline and sputters of high- and low-frequency
    glitch settle into the mix, which for its nervous turbulence, lacks any discernible build or motivation.
    ""La Corde"", on the other hand, flat-out smokes.  Coupling a big bass/tiny click movement with deft string
    section cut-ups, Egg stuffs the track with quick shouts of ""Party!"" and vinyl, locked groove-style violin
    skips.  The groove's heart of darkness is loosened only once, when a fleeting string sample sounds the
    track's lone major chord.  ""Continuous Drizzle"", with its endless barrage of vocal cut-ups and fittingly
    splattered treble drops, is simply stormy Akufen-- which is both a compliment and criticism.</p><p>
    
    Clearly, the duo take root in a storied electronic tradition, and their ability to make sweeping stylistic
    shifts is commendable, but at times, their similarities to predecessors and forbearers are too overwhelming:
    the spritely ""Clara"", while enjoyable, also rips its pages from Akufen's book; ""Ramp"" sports effects eerily
    similar to Wolfgang Voigt's 12-inches; the brief ""Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport"" is a quirky
    sampling ditty that comes off too much like a middle-aged Max Tundra.  Beyond these regurgitations, however,
    Egg offer two wonderfully inventive tracks:</p><p>
    
    The first, the downtempo ""Kabuki Express"", borrows the tapered horn blasts of Mouse on Mars and shrouds
    itself in a verdant mist and spooky flute and synth melodies.  The samples react to one another with a
    dynamic akin to jazz rhythm sections, inhabiting a peculiar consciousness that expresses itself through
    the samples' call-and-response mimicry and self-incarnation.  The second, ""Rouge de Base"", most clearly
    showcases Egg's potential ability to busy a track with an inordinately varied number of samples while
    maintaining legitimate and perspirant movement.  What's unusual about this track is that, despite its
    complete lack of a hook, it remains undeniably a song in the most traditional sense, its tearful bassline
    bearing all the marks of a tech-house break-up anthem like Luomo's ""Tessio"".</p><p>
    
    Between these two numbers, it's clear that Egg have something new to add to a micro-house genre growing
    exponentially as artists, labels, and debuts of both crop up before us.  As an inaugural release for Mutek,
    <i>Don't Postpone Joy</i> also promises the possibility of a new electro-label epicenter: a Montreal Kompakt
    or Basic Channel certainly couldn't be a bad thing.</p></div>"|2896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2896-dont-postpone-joy/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

    of Mute's <i>Can DVD</i> set as I write.  Karoli, as is consistently revealed throughout the documentary and
    concert footage, is at once completely in his own world and utterly dependent on those around him to supply
    a vast, textured canvas upon which he can deposit all the glorious, psychedelic sun rays his guitar can
    muster.  His portion of the disc demonstrates that although Can were no longer an active entity, he was
    playing with the same abandon, albeit with a slightly vintage grace that would have been too restrictive
    for his younger self.  Sure, Soforkontakt sound suspiciously like a jam-band Can, but weren't Can really
    just a smart, curious, disciplined jam band, anyway?</p><p>
    
    Or, I could attempt the high road and say Can were the archetypical post-rock collective.  They took the
    spontaneous energy and immediacy of rock music and replaced it with pure spontaneity.  They didn't really
    need ""riffs,"" hooks or drum solos, because their ideals were found in the individual processes of actively
    trying to go where no one had gone before, while at the same time being acutely aware that each of their
    fates were indelibly tied to those of the others.  Working as a whole, the music and the trip would take
    care of themselves.  The band certainly knew of rock and took inspiration from it, but were also aware of
    alternative revolutions: Fluxus, Stockhausen's radical formalism, jazz, free improvisation and a whole
    world of indigenous folk music.  And of course, they had the fortune not to have been from America or the
    UK, where already robust foundations of modern pop and rock would have very quickly consumed their ambitions.
    Can were always outside and apart from rock music, yet ultimately dependent on it.</p><p>
<i>Can DVD</i> helps make a lot clear about the German band, while maintaining much of the band's time-honored
    mystique.  Consisting of two DVDs and one audio CD, the set contains an incredible free concert from Cologne
    in 1972 (originally available on VHS in the out-of-print <i>Can Box</i>), multiple documentaries and remixes,
    and a CD of solo works by Irmin Schmidt, Jaki Liebezeit, Holger Czukay and Karoli.  There are a few
    testimonials from other musicians (including a frankly tossed-off ""film"" by Brian Eno), and even a vaguely
    surreal sequence of Flea and John Frusciante giving a lifetime achievement award to the band at the 2003
    Echo Awards (apparently, the German Grammys).  Of course, nobody buys these things because they need to
    know how great the band is-- they buy it because they're big fans and they'll buy anything.  Luckily, and
    probably predictably, Can's video retrospective offers a lot more than glazed montages.</p><p>
    
    The first disc begins with the aforementioned Cologne performance, and should be required viewing and
    listening for any serious Can fan.  Collectors are making noise that Mute dropped the ball by not including
    more live material (or at least different material than was present on the old <i>Can Box</i> video), but
    having this concert available on DVD can't be considered a bad thing.  Director Peter Przygodda captures a
    band still in transition from raucous motorik mammoths to minimalist sound-painters.  The opening scene
    cuts between close-ups of the band, a small child playing drums and other seemingly random images (an
    elephant, a tower, etc.); later, scenes of the band playing onstage are interspersed with scenes of them
    performing the same piece in the studio.  The direction is a tad on the artsy side, but I think more or
    less in the spirit of the group.  The bass-heavy, burning, claustrophobic version of ""Spoon"" that opens
    the show works wonders on any complaints I have of the filmmaking.</p><p>
    
    Przygodda also compiles the ""Can Notes"" documentary on disc one, which features interviews and footage from
    the band spanning 1997 (the press tour for the <i>Sacrilege</i> remix project) to 2003.  ""Can Notes"" goes a
    long way towards establishing the various personalities of Can's members, all of which are repeatedly
    emphasized throughout the remainder of the set.  Holger Czukay comes on like the wise, buoyant, eternally
    fascinated professor; Jaki Liebezeit is a simple, modest craftsman; Karoli, even in middle age, still a
    child of a different, boundless era; Schmidt surprised me the most in that he was clearly the greatest
    ""star"" of the band.  He enjoys being offhandedly provocative, receiving no end of pleasure relating his
    tales of becoming ""corrupted"" in New York City in 1966.</p><p>
    
    The second disc contains another full-length documentary compiled by seasoned music video directors Rudi
    Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher.  Of the most immediate interest are the performance clips of ""Paperhouse"",
    ""Vernal Equinox"" and their ""disco"" single, ""I Want More"", among others.  The performances are taken from
    German television, and UK programs like <i>Top of the Pops</i> and Bob Harris' <i>Old Grey Whistle Test</i>,
    and are goldmines not only of Can-icana, but of vintage 70s music television direction.  The 1971
    ""Paperhouse"" performance, wherein the band are backed by a formless yellow-green background, and with
    Damo Suzuki in full hillgnome/hippie mode will have <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i> junkies running for cover.
    I was pleasantly surprised at the energy in the band's later 70s performances, like ""Vernal Equinox"" from
    1975.  This track didn't do much for me on the <i>Landed</i> album, but here the band blows it down in
    freaked-out disco-funk style.  Similarly, their 1977 German TV instrumental renditions of ""Moonshake"" and
    ""Dizzy Dizzy"" blaze by, then with former-Traffic bassist Rosko Gee laying down a slippery fusion lines
    that eventually prompt Schmidt to get fucking crazy on his keyboard, slapping, elbowing and otherwise
    terrorizing the keys.  All that and a scene where Karoli and Schmidt talk about nose hair!</p><p>
    
    Can has long been more of an occasional gathering than a ""band,"" per se, and their decision to fill this
    collection's third disc with solo tracks by each of the members is entirely in line with past efforts like
    1990's <i>Cannibalism 3</i> compilation.  For the most part, the music is sometimes reminiscent of Can, but
    more so (and suitably) of the individual forces at work.  Schmidt's pieces with Kumo (who provides beats
    and other electronics) recall much of his solo work with evocative synth patches and a not-too-subtle
    classical influence, as if Schmidt would be perfectly at home providing space-age bachelor pad music for
    Maurice Ravel.  Czukay's three live selections with his current collaborator U-She are exercises in
    ""theories"" of musique concrete put into gothic techno-pop practice, though not quite as openly embracing
    dance music as the pair's 2003 release, <i>The New Millennium</i>.  Liebezeit's music with Flanger's Burnt
    Friedman is fittingly the most percussive of the collection-- even for a group of people who Schmidt
    describes as judging music ""in the first place"" by its rhythmic qualities.  It's a shame Liebezeit's DVD
    footage isn't nearly as fleshed out as his one piece on disc three, but then, you have to respect a drummer
    who has refined his craft to the point where he doesn't even need to use his legs anymore.</p><p>
    
    There are a couple of things <i>Can DVD</i> makes clear.  Firstly, they were one of the great live bands.
    If I have one complaint, it would not be that this set duplicates material from another box, but that
    there just isn't enough of it.  Make no mistake: This is a band who have still yet to take advantage of
    the music in their vaults; I wouldn't be surprised if there are 10 discs' worth of top-notch concert
    material thus far unheard by anyone other than the band and the audience.  Secondly, given the range of
    personalities, interests, aims and backgrounds that went into Can, it's a minor miracle that they're still
    known as one of the great, experimental collectives.  Furthermore, it becomes obvious over the course of
    the documentaries that the remaining members are still very much a part of each others' lives.  At any
    moment, if the mood should strike and everyone agrees it is the best decision, it seems they could reform
    and produce something of as great an impact as on any of their classic records.  Or, they could leave
    behind all of this business tomorrow.  Regardless, their music will remain vital for as long as people
    are fascinated with Whatever Comes Next.</p></div>"|1272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1272-can-dvd/|8.0|Dominique Leone

<p>Television, along with the other 70s legends that inspired the recent reintroduction of guitars, punk and     garage-rock to the mainstream, are continually rediscovered by new breeds of NYC hipsters looking to start     their own bands.  The group's place in history has been resacramented again and again, so by now the     backstory's old hat-- you know, the one about them kicking Richard Hell out of the band before they cut     their first single, playing gigs and publishing verse with Patti Smith, and talking the owner of the     then-unknown CBGB's to host shows of other genres than just ""country, bluegrass, and blues"" (which also     makes them largely to blame for all those people that wear the club's t-shirts).</p>
<p>You can read first-hand accounts and second-hand analyses of all these events, and one thing you'll uncover     is the debate over how ""punk"" Television was.  Sure, they joined the movement from the beginning, playing     out as early as 1973, and they harnessed the energy you associate with punk, even as they crossed it with     art-rock and the poetic urges of frontman Tom Verlaine (nee Miller, renamed after the French poet-- but not     in a fey way).  But they were also a rock band that roared through long, tense jams: When I first heard     ""Marquee Moon"", it somehow felt like I'd already been exposed to it on a classic rock station wedged between     Steve Miller and Skynyrd.</p>
<p>With all that context, the most interesting thing about picking up Television's <i>Marquee Moon</i>-- today,     for us folks who weren't old enough to buy the first edition vinyl-- is how ahistorical it sounds.  If you     listen to their original Brian Eno-produced demos, you hear a scragglier, faster band that's less confident     and more... punk?   If nothing else, the band at least sounded closer to the sometimes-sloppy Bowery clubrats     Eno must have taken them for on those early tapes.  Their sound on <i>Marquee Moon</i>, though, is clean,     raw and simple.  The band never breaks for a squall of energy, yet the whole record crackles with it, and     they never rely on atmosphere to make their case.  Billy Ficca's drums and Fred Smith's bass are extra lean     and crisp, and the band's so tight that even the ""Did you feel low?"" call-and-response on ""Venus de Milo""     sounds amusingly rehearsed.  The only rough edge is Tom Verlaine's striking warble, a somewhat choked-off     tenor influenced either by Patti Smith or by someone kicking him in the throat.</p>
<p>But the things that make the record so classic, that pump your blood like a breath of clean air, are the     guitars.  This whole record's a mash note to them.  The contrast between these two essential leads is     stunning: Richard Lloyd chisels notes out hard while Verlaine works with a subtle twang and a trace of     space-gazing delirium.  They play lines that are stately and chiming, rutting and torrential, the riff,     the solo, the rare power chord, and most of all, the power <i>note</i>: the second pang on the riff to     ""Venus de Milo"" lands like a barbell; the opening bars of ""See No Evil"" show one axe rutting the firmament     while the other spirals razorwire around it.</p>
<p>If Jose Feliciano had rearranged ""Marquee Moon"" the way he ruined ""Light My Fire""-- by emphasizing the     melody and lyrics and ditching the solos-- he'd have failed Television even worse than he did The Doors;     every part of the song is a bridge to the monstrous Verlaine showpiece, and yet his guitar solo has no     bombast: it climbs and soars in tangible increments, edging its way up scales and pounding like a contained     explosion.  The structural integrity makes this an Eiffel Tower in a world of Burning Men: in a decade full     of guitarists spraying sweat on the arenas, Verlaine comes off like a man punching through ceilings.</p>
<p>Rhino's remastered release of 1977's <i>Marquee Moon</i> adds a few alternate takes; for example, you can     hear ""See No Evil"" with guitar solos scrawled all over the verses.  But you also get the first-ever CD     release of ""Little Johnny Jewel"", a raw single that twangs and skitters around Verlaine's bug-eyed singing.     So if you're new to Television but shy about picking up this bedrock masterpiece for the first time, just     tell the cutie at the record store that you're buying it for that single, which alone would be worth the     price.</p>
<p>With <i>Marquee Moon</i> entrenched in the canon, it's more interesting to revisit their 1978 follow-up,     <i>Adventure</i>.  This record has always suffered by comparison, mainly because it's so easy to relate     it to the first record: the arrangements and the aesthetic are roughly the same, but the music is quieter     and more reflective, and that means less horsepower.  It's not weak or even very different from their debut,     but you might be disappointed when the earth doesn't cave beneath your feet.</p>
<p>There isn't a weak song here, even if you count the abandoned title track, which is restored here as a     bonus cut. ""Carried Away"", the best ballad on either album, floats away on an organ instead of a guitar;     ""The Fire"" sounds as melodramatic as ""Torn Curtain"" but a lot less Stygian.  And while ""Foxhole"" and     ""Ain't That Nothin'"" wouldn't have broken the flow on <i>Marquee Moon</i>, there's a sense that they're     going in a different direction but with the same tools.  The reissue is great-- especially for the bonus     ""Ain't That Nothin'"" instrumental runthrough-- but a new Television listener would probably be tempted     to check out a whole different experience by picking up the live albums, <i>The Blow-Up</i> or Rhino     Handmade's new <i>Live at the Old Waldorf</i>.</p>
<p>Television broke up after <i>Adventure</i>, and like typical mid-level rockers who fade away instead of     dying, they went on to other projects, cut a reunion album in 1992, and still play occasional shows to     this day.  Writing this up now, it's hard not to feel out of place as someone too young to have caught     their shows while the world is bursting with tributes and nostalgia from the people who loved them back     when.  But if my generation only inherited the band, then this release enshrines it again as something     timeless, like that Greek sculpture the band once namechecked that shows motion and grace no matter what     museum it's displayed in.  Rhino and labels in the future will keep carbon-dating and explaining <i>Marquee     Moon</i>, but sometime in the future, some Martian kid who can't get dates and hates sports will look past     the plaque and sit in his room, blaring this music and wondering how life can possibly sound this great.</p></div>"|11853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/|10.0|Chris Dahlen

    treat them with smugness and derision.  In the past, Pitchfork has only given them compliments as if they
    were confessions-- and the site wasn't alone (or necessarily wrong), either.  There was a time when writing
    about Coldplay meant unfavorable Travis comparisons (!), trying to sort out exactly what the hell ""Yellow""
    was meant to be referring to (I still have no clue), and gleefully reporting that singer and lyricist
    Chris Martin admitted he was drained of ideas after the release of their debut album.</p><p>
    
    But a funny thing happened to Coldplay on the way to their plot in the post-<i>Bends</i> cemetery next
    to Starsailor and Lowgold: they got wildly popular. What's more, the band sharpened their skills and that
    weariness Martin felt trying to write <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> translated into a handful of
    affecting, populist tracks. Martin's exhaustion exposed his wounds and shrouded them in swirling, melodic
    arrangements, and while Coldplay may not have taken Radiohead's crown as the Thinking Man's Arena Rock
    Band, with ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and especially ""Clocks"" they sort of became the Feeling Man's
    Arena Rock Band.</p><p>
    
    It wasn't really a transformation, just an improvement, that made Coldplay one of a handful of artists
    who bestrode 2003 by slowly winning over their dissenters and the disbelievers-- and by the time the
    critical establishment rediscovered the band, they ironically had to cast aside their preconceptions in
    much the same way that they'd done eight years earlier with <i>The Bends</i>.  It's fitting, then, that
    Coldplay's year ends with a live CD and DVD recorded in Sydney-- a documentation of them engaging with
    their public, those who were at their side from the start.</p><p>
    
    The decision to package both of these releases together for the same price as either would command on its
    own helps make what could be seen as a cash-in more of a bargain thank-you. The disc omits five of the
    tracks from the DVD, including the fan favorite ""Don't Panic"", the singles ""Trouble"" and ""The Scientist"",
    and ""Daylight"", which would have been a welcome mood-changer for this often middle-of-the-road set.  The
    band does little here to brush off their reputations as rock's nice, dull bunch, offering hopeful sentiments
    like, ""We sincerely hope you have the best evening of your lives,"" and, ""There's no excuse to be sat down
    during this song.  If you stand up we promise to buy you all ice cream.""</p><p>
    
    The live performance seems more stirring than rousing-- the old softie onstage would rather you put your
    arms around your best girl or guy than your mates-- and if Martin's guy-next-door stuff isn't part of
    the band's appeal for you, it may bring on a wince.  Another unfortunate downside to the set's prevailing
    mood is that, at around the halfway mark, Martin's recommendation that ""this would be a great time for you
    to start singing with us"" stretches a campfire singalong version of ""Everything's Not Lost"" to nearly nine
    minutes and my patience well past its breaking point.</p><p>
    
    The hits and the better album tracks from <i>A Rush of Blood</i> (the driving ""Politik"" and ""God Put a
    Smile Upon Your Face"") shine brightest, but there's little here for the novice.  Rarities include the
    acoustic-based ""See You Soon"" from <i>The Blue Room</i> EP and B-side ""One I Love"", a guitar-driven track
    which is one of the most Echo &amp; The Bunnymen-like things Coldplay have ever done, with Martin's voice even
    taking on a touch of McCulloch's brooding baritone.  New track ""Moses"", meanwhile, is gutsy and crisp,
    indicating that Martin may have restored his confidence-- something that might not play to the strengths
    of a band that's best with its heart on its sleeve.</p><p>
    
    Chris Martin's humility and honesty-- as evidenced by his admissions about the state of his writer's block
    and/or prolificacy-- are often construed as either bravado or proof of the band's inadequacy. I side with
    bravado, contending that he likely respects his art enough not to go through the motions and finds strength
    in appealing to a large audience.  After all, Coldplay sound better the bigger they are: Some artists just
    wouldn't work as a passed secret, and they're one of them. It was this ubiquity that won over unlikely
    fans such as Timbaland, Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake, and elevated them past yer Stripes and Good Charlottes
    and Linkin Parks on the rock star ladder this year. The challenge now is in holding that spot, and that's
    what's going to determine whether this live record turns out to be their <i>Rattle &amp; Hum</i>-- a document
    of the band at their commercial and, some might say, artistic peak-- or merely their <i>Wide Awake in
    America</i>, with something more improbably adventurous and potentially soul-enriching yet to come.</p></div>"|1540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1540-live-2003/|6.0|Scott Plagenhoef

I'm telling you, it's
    not an easy race to run, this either/or business.  A safe and sturdy middle ground is hard to find these
    days; you try to ride a fence too long and you wind up with your arm in a sling-- or worse. Personally, I
    say either straight-shoot 'er or put down your guns.  And so I take Okkervil River, for example: They
    seem to be pretty into their thing, be it alt-country or indie-folk or barnyard-to-dive bar-pop or
    what-the-fuck-have-you, and they seem pretty sincere about it-- which is the crux of the issue; but
    then again, you never can be too sure.  Every few minutes or so during <i>Down the River of Golden
    Dreams</i> I have to sit back, scratch my chin, and wonder... ""wait a minute...""  'Cause, damn, I sure
    hate being taken.</p><p>
    
    Sure, I'd like to think that maybe this is just an honest little batch of songs-- after all, these
    sentimental, acoustic tracks do feel like old friends.  Perhaps these sketchy moments where the band
    drifts into well-trodden paths and postured frameworks that don't necessarily reflect the band's ingenuity
    are mere aberrations or stochastic eventualities.  What makes me wonder is the occasional sidestep; the
    buoyantly affected pop-mongering of Bens Folds and Kweller on ""Blanket and Crib"", or frontman Will Sheff's
    frequent throaty outbursts during which he dons a Conor Oberst-style charcoal hoodie with a Ludens-stuffed
    kangaroo pocket.  I mean, when he's reserved there are these undeniably Tweedy-inflected vocals of
    crestfallen awareness.  And sure, maybe the stuff isn't so much a stealthy combination of its influences
    (though all done admirably), as it is an expansive, heartfelt, and genuine display of songsmithing that
    runs from pure balladry to starkly sketched, deeply personal and densely moody revelations. Maybe.</p><p>
    
    'Cause no posturing indiephile I know opens a song (""The War Criminal Rises and Speaks"") over meekly struck
    piano chords, earnestly and without any trace of excess-pageantry, with ""The heart wants to feel/ The heart
    wants to hold/ The heart takes past Subway, past Stop-N-Shop, past Biel's/ And calls it 'coming home.'""
    'Cause it's just not cool.  But it is effective, and consistent with the tone of the rest of the album.
    Most of the songs wade in this pool of lost love and desperation, thrashing or floating about with a
    seeming disregard for stylistic retention, but in a manner so sufficiently suffocating it sometimes feels
    calculatedly linear, even though the results come in a variety of shapes and sizes: there are moments big
    and small, frisky and repined, shifty and direct.</p><p>
    
    Okkervil River perfectly deploys healthy doses of Hammond organ, Rhodes piano, Mellotrons, and Wurlitzer
    over the course of the album.  Sometimes, as on ""It Ends with a Fall"", these instruments serve to counteract
    the jaunty musings of the track to retain its dredged moodiness.  On most of the album, though, acoustic
    guitars and slight percussion wilt beneath keys and sprinkled pedal steel flavorings.  Tracks like ""Maine
    Island Lovers"" and ""Yellow"" largely forgo involved arrangements, but creep and crawl through Sheff's
    heartbroken narratives with spacious good taste.  In all, the album may feel a bit like sleepwalking
    through a Decemberists set (and may also be packaged as such), but when you surrender yourself to the
    sincerity and listless candor of it all, it's easy to side with originality and purebred good taste.
    Songs this poignant and easy to digest will always have relevance, but then again, they had to have known
    that, hadn't they?</p></div>"|5961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5961-down-the-river-of-golden-dreams/|7.5|William Morris

    <i>Compilation #1</i>, for the first time, compiles all the Brooklyn-based production duo's hype-building
    twelve-inches, from The Juan MacLean's straightforward electro singles ""By the Time I Get To Venus"" and
    ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"", to James Murphy's famously tongue-in-cheek ""Losing My Edge"" and decidedly
    less danceable ""Give It Up"", to The Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers""-- the track that more or less made
    the DFA the internationally renown playboys they are today-- and the mellow vocal dawn of its B-side,
    ""Silent Morning"", to Black Dice's danceperimental rockers ""Cone Toaster"" and ""Endless Happiness"".</p><p>
    
    With the exception of the Black Dice track, all of these songs were released last year, and by now, it's
    safe to say that most indie music fanatics have heard, owned on vinyl, or downloaded sketchy Ogg-Vorbis
    wax rips of them.  This disc means iPodders can now download cleaner versions for their commutes, but
    after months and months of ""Losing My Edge""-- witty and brilliant though it may be-- most listeners have
    already moved onto newer DFA releases like the new LCD Soundsystem single, ""Yeah"", which is currently
    widely available despite its vinyl-only status.  At the moment, <i>Compilation #1</i> to a large degree
    functions more as an archival folio for early DFA output; in itself, it's a fantastic comp, but perhaps
    it came a little too late.  In time, the songs themselves will undoubtedly regain much of their initial
    potency, but for now, one can't help but be at least somewhat bored with the exact same song and dance.</p><p>
    
    Maybe that's one of the keys their success, though: Despite having released virtually <i>just</i> singles,
    the DFA have managed to become the most formidable production team on the indie scene. Their sole employment
    of vinyl-- an ever scarcer medium for a self-selecting crowd of hardcore music lovers-- created one of the
    most effective buzz mechanisms I can remember.  Perhaps their only recent musical supply-vs-demand equals
    are the robber barons of Jamaican dub soundsystems.  Any schmuck who's read Walter Benjamin can tell you
    that there's a relationship between a piece of art's exclusivity and the vitality of its aura; it's nothing
    new here, but the DFA is exceptionally textbook.</p><p>
    
    Moreover, this is a commendable act of self-preservation. Look at what's happened with The Neptunes: their
    immediately recognizable bump/grind formula made them the most relevant producers in hip-hop; but now,
    through oversaturation, too many commissions and not enough time to develop new musical ideas, their
    popularity has begun to wane.  The DFA could be to all of rock what The Neptunes are to hip-hop-- there
    are more than a few tales of major pop stars knocking at their door-- but Goldsworthy and Murphy opt
    instead to issue mix albums for obscure French clothing outlets and electronic music magazines. For all
    intents and purposes, their exclusivity maintains their credibility, and refuses any possible allegations
    that they are a one-trick dancepunk pony. The compilation is indeed called <i>Compilation #1</i>, and
    implies not only more material in the future as is obvious, but a commitment to growth and diversity in
    their production as well.  To hell with the kids; the DFA ain't losing its edge at all.</p></div>"|2031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2031-dfa-records-presents-compilation-1/|8.0|Nick Sylvester

In the fast moving worlds
    of both commercial and underground mixtapes, success in collaring the most relevant acts and freshest cuts
    is the difference between flash-in-the-pan and beat culture empire. In regards to the Nature Sounds team,
    their display of talent remains balanced enough to warrant a listen.</p><p>
    
    As expected from an album that exists upon the inherent differences of the artists involved, <i>Convexed</i>
    touches myriad concepts with several atypical approaches: ex-Cannibal Ox magnate Vordul extols the virtues
    and problems with habitation in ghetto in two tastes (""In the Hood"" with Carnage, ""Never Gonna Hurt Again"")
    from his upcoming Nature Sounds solo record, MF Doom indulges in aural fear and loathing with his stellar
    drug and drink anthem ""All Outta Ale"" and RA The Rugged Man &amp; Timbo King contrast the differences between
    both positive and negative spectrums on ""Black and White"".</p><p>
    
    While the majority of the record falls positively, a few tracks lower this high standard. Nature Sounds
    artists Space and Ancient Coins bore in the manner expected from label upstarts on a star-studded compilation,
    while the surprising appearance of a Cannibal Ox track (""Handle That"") leads to a sign of the times: Vordul
    rapping the same going-for-broke abstract word salad that helped make <i>The Cold Vein</i> a classic, Vast
    Aire rehashing a lame freestyle from his unbalanced mixtape album and then awkwardly freestyling out of the
    verse (""And it's like that [awkward silence]/ Cannibal Ox [more awkward silence]/ I wear mini hats/ Whether
    the jimmy or the New Era/ I get on the mic and sound clever""). This is the same guy that once said, ""You've
    got beef but there's worms in your Wellington""?</p><p>
    
    The most powerful statement is Aesop Rock's contribution, ""Numb (To the Guns)"". Opening with a news reporter
    speaking from the middle of an Iraq hot zone, Aesop Rock gives his hilarious and lackadaisical take on the
    war on Iraq, juxtaposing the convenience of watching war with other common television with intriguing
    results. Unloading great wordplay (""Me and my fine T&amp;A; on TNT,"" ""P.O.WB, buzz over the rumble of cannons
    and lead sandwiches""), Aesop claims to have empathy for the battle situation, but is unfortunately more
    concerned with watching <i>Bring It On</i>, and having ""Wolf Blitzer 'holler at his boy' when he hosts
    <i>Blind Date</i>."" When asked for his opinion on the war in a street news interview, his answer is simple:
    ""War sucks donkey dick, what's the Knicks score?"" It's a refreshingly loose vision of a commonly maligned
    topic, given a lighter approach from the person many wouldn't expect it from.</p><p>
    
    The production is a definite bright spot for the Nature Sounds team. With the majority produced by Nature
    Sounds (with some work from the Professor and Omega One), the beats succeed in mirroring the personalities
    of the rappers, from the gorgeous Mobb Deep soulful boom bap of Vordul's ""Never Gonna Hurt Again"" to the
    sharply chopped Premier-esque piano jazz of Count Bass D's ""Dro Grown"" to the red hooked <i>Twilight Zone</i>
    guitar loop of Cage's ""Middletown NY"". A couple beats disappoint, most notably Cannibal Ox's ""Handle That"",
    with its lazy gear shifting sample and boring dub chimes, and Zion I's ""Spinning"", which sounds like a
    strangled <i>Dr. Mario</i> instrumental.</p><p>
    
    While some songs meander and fail to fully develop, others completely fall flat and several never catch
    your attention, the intent is complete: Nature Sounds makes a name for itself through a nicely produced,
    traditional hip-hop compilation that both gives hope to the direction of some artists and reinforces the
    positives of others.</p></div>"|2035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2035-convexed/|7.5|Rollie Pemberton

    songwriter's commitment to dreamy Americana and stunning acoustic explorations.  An installment in the
    German label Normal's exclusive Return to Sender series-- which among its 40+ titles includes limited-edition
    LPs by U.S. Saucer, Townes van Zandt, Steve Wynn, and Barbara Manning-- the record is limited to 2,000
    copies. I'd like to think it's the modest press run that's conspired to keep <i>Wandering as Water</i>
    a secret; more likely, though, the subtle tones of Brokaw's craft lack the bells needed to attract a
    critical catchphrase or youth-market angle.  Suffice to say: He oughta be a star.</p><p>
    
    The original drummer for seminal NYC slowcore band Codeine, Brokaw co-founded Come with Thalia Zedek and
    played guitar for the Boston band until its demise. He's also played his six-string with Steve Wynn and
    knocked out a beat for post-Bedhead rockers, The New Year. He currently handles guitar in Consonant with
    Clint Conley of Mission of Burma and collaborates with Evan ""Don't Call It a Comeback"" Dando.  Despite the
    pedigree, Brokaw inhabits an unassuming, almost anonymous space with his quiet acoustic strums, warm voice,
    wordy vocal lines, and single foot-tapped tambourine.</p><p>
    
    Like his previous all-instrumental <i>Red Cities</i> (2002), this largely vocal offering creeps along an
    unadorned path towards anachronistic purity, opening up and gathering detail with each repeated listen.
    Recorded live, it's breezy and intensely focused, and though at times the songs get awkward and seem ready
    to fall apart, Brokaw hems disparate sections together, allowing the overall passages to flow crisply into
    smooth resolutions.</p><p>
    
    Somewhat backwards looking (in an especially effective way), these fifteen tracks include a spate of older
    material. The splintery, patient acoustic interpretations of Come's ""Shoot Me First"", ""Recidivist"" and
    ""German Song"" are gorgeous. ""My Idea"", a track he wrote with Lemonheads collaborator Tom Morgan that ended
    up on Dando's <i>Baby I'm Bored</i>, stands out as better enunciated and intoned than Dando's slacker
    version. Near-sacred covers of 60s troubadour Fred Neil's ""Ba-Di-Da"" and Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic
    Journey"" do what good covers should, pointing towards inspirations while offering an entrance into further,
    worthwhile listening.</p><p>
    
    Of the nine new compositions, the prairie instrumentals are especially strong, each evoking a well-drawn
    visual sequence. ""La Playa"" and ""Calimoxcho"" tackle subtle rhythmic variations, evoking at times the pace
    of a silent but emphatic one-step across the damp hay of a darkened barn or a jangling horse ride through
    the night to a dozing loved one. Over its course, ""Dresden Promenade"" accrues the pathos of a badly
    attended Veteran's Day parade or a lonely prom's last dance. The album's closer, ""The Fields"", wrangles
    a distorted ambience, a frantic chase, country-noir. Brokaw's slide and finger plucks should especially
    interest fans of M. Ward and, more so, John Fahey.</p><p>
    
    Though the newly penned vocal works aren't as successful, there are standouts. ""Cranberries"" avoids its
    initial leanings towards ""Scarborough Fair"", lighting into a sleepless territory that breathes ramshackle
    blues into the patter of repetitious guitar outbursts. Likewise, the anger in ""My Confidante"" shifts to a
    transcendent chorus reminiscent of something Robert Pollard would've written for <i>Bee Thousand</i>:
    ""Staring hard and fast/ High on the overpass/ Spoken in our defense/ Spoken in confidence."" Here, the
    tambourine picks up like a gust of wisteria, leading the song into a maze.</p><p>
    
    Brokaw continuously dances nimbly through these sorts of unexpected shifts; his acuity with control and
    complexity creates a subtle, unspoken poetry. Though certain forms of purity are definitely boring,
    Brokaw's acknowledgement of tradition and his avoidance of the cloying histrionics of his younger,
    less storied peers, goes a long way to prove you needn't be a purple-prose-spewing drama queen to convey
    passionate intensity.</p></div>"|1097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1097-wandering-as-water/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

Most of the time these records either pale in comparison to the     quality of the artists' earlier work, or prove to be incredibly sentimental mortality-pondering affairs.     Furthermore, given that the artist is dead, picking out the weaknesses of their final contributions to     the music listening public at large seems rather heartless, and more to the point, unnecessary.  The job     of the music critic is already unfairly viewed as a predatory position; no reviewer in his right mind     would want to be accused of picking on the dead.</p>
<p>The way most critics seem to go about reconciling this rather unfortunate occupational hazard is by dishing     out undeserved laudatory acclaim for these predominantly lackluster releases, which allows a perfect in for     critics to eulogize about the great contributions that so-and-so musician once doled out to the world.     Most importantly, though, this critical approach unfairly presents a very illusory and all-too tidy     closure to creative lives that rarely seem to get wrapped up in such convenient Hollywood endings.</p>
<p>It's in this mired context that Joe Strummer's fourth and regrettably final solo release (excluding the     <i>Walker</i> soundtrack), <i>Streetcore</i>, presents itself as somewhat of a posthumous album oddity.     Given that Strummer's death last December from a heart attack came entirely unexpected, <i>Streetcore</i> brims with previously untraveled aesthetic directions, bittersweetly forward-gazing lyrics, and most of     all, the overwhelmingly celebratory insurgence of rock 'n' roll-- decidedly <i>not</i> the trappings of     pondering mortality.  Ironically, it's a record that refuses to acknowledge endings; the album's aesthetics     are an inconsistent but moving string of conflated genres, including rocksteady, dub, blues and folk, that     thankfully avoid the hokey world-music-influenced pitfalls of Strummer's previous solo outings.  So, while     the record fails at living up to the hyperbolic critical proclamations of <i>London Calling</i>'s second     coming, it does make for a pretty decent, if somewhat unexpected, sweat-soaked finale for The Clash's     legendary golden boy.</p>
<p>The record opens with its greatest moment; ""Coma Girl"" is a wildly exuberant blast of telecaster majesty     whose seething, stripped-down production (courtesy of Mescaleros Martin Slattery and Scott Shield) provides     a vital injection of youthful crunch.  Though a fairly standard 4/4 rocker in spirit, it manages to equally     evoke Allen Ginsberg, Jimmy Cliff, and the Rolling Stones.  The nostalgic romp ""Arms Aloft"" offers a     possible explanation for Strummer's brazen return to his rock 'n' roll roots: Over a din of sneering guitar     licks and rollicking percussion, he finds solace in his glory days with a fist-raising chorus whose mantra     goes, ""Just when you were thinkin' of slinkin' down, I'm gonna pull you up, I'm gonna pull you down/ May I     remind you of that scene, we were arms aloft in Aberdeen!""</p>
<p>One of the most surprising aspects of <i>Streetcore</i> is that whenever Strummer indulges these Jamaican     influences, the results are less than noteworthy-- which is saying something for a man who historically     helped merge the worlds of reggae and punk rock.  For instance, the unabashedly rocksteady backdrop of the     anti-capitalist plea ""Get Down Moses"" comes off more like No Doubt than Rockers, even while Strummer drops     some well-intended lyrical musings.  The instrumental ""Midnight Jam"" reaches for the echoing, hallucinatory     highs of dub, but instead presents a laconic guitar vamp, startlingly bereft of any murky reverberated     beauty.  And then there's the worst offender: Strummer's cover of the Bob Marley classic ""Redemption Song"".     It pains me to say that this track-- the only one not drawn from the original album sessions, and included     by Strummer's widow Luce for what are most likely sentimental reasons-- verges on comedy.  The song may     have been recorded with the best of intentions as an ideal showcase for Strummer's love of reggae and folk,     but Rick Rubin's spare production only leaves room for Strummer to make a fool of himself affecting a thick     Marley patois for lines like, ""Oh, pirates, yes they rob I.""</p>
<p>If <i>Streetcore</i> fails to serve as the groundbreaking solo manifesto that critics had hoped for, it's     of no consequence.  The real marvel of the album is that it serves as an ideal document of one of rock's     greatest, most diverse individuals.  As Joe hauntingly sings on the record's sublime country-flavored     closer, a cover of a Bobby Charles tune retitled ""Silver and Gold"": ""I'm gonna go out dancing, I'm gonna     see the city lights/ And do everything silver and gold, I got to hurry up before I get too old.""     <i>Streetcore</i> is proof that Strummer indeed lived it up ""silver and gold"" on record, and probably     still is wherever he might be today.</p></div>"|7540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7540-streetcore/|6.9|Hartley Goldstein

    underground renaissance for the dormant dancehall scene, refueling the public's interest with a frantic
    mix of jubilant synth and street-smart patois.  Now, in a world where dancehall wouldn't sound out of
    place in a Carnival cruise line ad, Elephant Man unmasks himself to the masses with his widest-ever
    commercial release, <i>Good 2 Go</i>.</p><p>
    
    To those unfamiliar with his work, O'Neil Bryan's hard lisp, ball-bearing flow and ridiculous rhythmic
    power amalgamates his own brand of dance music that not only tastefully borrows 80s rock choruses for
    rhyme schemes, but also accounts for his own personality.  If Sean Paul is our generation's Shabba Ranks,
    Elephant Man is the incumbent to Bounty Killer's throne: he screams, coughs, chants and most amusingly,
    compounds his own private collection of asides-- ranging from common acknowledgements (""Yep!"", ""Okay!"")
    to skewed slang terminology (""Shizzle!"", ""Let's dance!"", ""Good to go!""). No one else could've made this
    album, regardless of the commonality of the riddims chosen.</p><p>
    
    Conceptually, <i>Good 2 Go</i> breaks very little ground: Elaborating on the common bad-man lifestyle,
    insulting assailants of his character, and detailing the measures he'll take to receive various methods
    of copulation (""Apply the pressure, make she choke and cough/ Next time, watch your dark half"") are the
    order of the day.  But in the case of dancehall reggae, you've come to the game to watch the mascot jump
    through a ring of fire, not to see a triple play, and Bryan is as gifted a showman as you're likely to
    find in the genre today; his mastery over chorus and bridge explains his immediate draw to the club crowd,
    while his constantly evolving flow barrels from expedient machine gun to labored somersault bounce with
    little-to-no difficulty. With his humorous anecdotes and distinctive voice, there's reason he's become the
    hottest commodity in the commercial hip-hop world.</p><p>
    
    ""Wine Up Yuh Self/Head Gone"" stomps and claps into the scene with a heavy array of bass drum hits, violent
    chants (""Bring them, we choppa off they head!"") and island bongos. The show is ultimately driven by Elephant
    Man's powerful choruses, seamlessly shifting from a rhythmic plea of insanity (""No, I ain't got no head"")
    to a suggestion for dancefloor acrobatics (""Do it like a genie, wine up yourself""). In a club scene with
    lazy commercial rap awkwardly lurching through speakers and identity-confused R&amp;B; acts pleading for
    acceptance, Elephant Man's straightforward party assault is refreshing.</p><p>
    
    Production is a less-than-balanced affair. With the majority of the production done by dancehall mainstays
    Vendetta, Baby G and the Blake brothers, it's hard to not notice sameness in Elephant Man's style of beat.
    Despite this, the disc is packed with standouts: the time-delay claps, muted cymbal crashes, register bells
    and ""Tequila""-style guitar of ""Real Gangstas""; the dizzy fainting synth and jungle drum set of ""Fuck U Sign"";
    and the incredible Surprise riddim's background chants, dark synth hues and grinding low end on ""Jamaica"".
    Only a few offerings truly disappoint, notably Lil' Jon's out of place inclusion ""Jook Gal"" and the obviously
    commercialized light synth treatment of ""Cock Up Your Bumper"".</p><p>
    
    With a glut of boring non-dancehall guest performers (no Kiprich? Vybz Kartel?), a lack of Elephant Man's
    most triumphant riddim disc offerings (notably missing are the spidery galleon cannonball creep of ""Gyal
    Alone We Love"" and the staggering flaming synth ring and Eastern bounce of ""Show Me""), a lame ""Bumper""
    remix and a repetitive nature inherent in both production and content, the otherwise stellar <i>Good 2
    Go</i> must be docked a few points.  Still, while many dancehall proponents opting for either full-on
    commercial intermingling or hardline dancehall sensibility, Elephant Man is one of few artists in the
    field that can hold his own on either side of the battlefield.</p></div>"|2895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2895-good-2-go/|8.4|Rollie Pemberton

Not because he has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, but because
    he's hopelessly trying to tie the unbending ends of Einstein and Heisenberg's universal principles, be they
    macrocosmic or subatomic, into one tidy theory.  It's something to which I can sort of relate: My biggest
    problem as an aficionado of African music is how to tie together Sun Ra, Jamaican godfather producer Sir
    Coxsone Dodd, Fela Kuti, and Mahmoud Ahmed, the James Brown of Ethiopia.  Fortunately, with the help of
    the similarly obsessive Brits at Honest Jon's, my connective theory for all four giants was simply solved
    by this compilation of the work of Jamaican saxophonist Cedric Im Brooks and his collective, The Light of
    Saba.</p><p>
    
    Originally cutting sides in the 1960s at Studio One, the heart of all Jamaican music (check the free sax
    squall on his ""Mun-Dun-Go"" side off of Soul Jazz's <i>Studio One Instrumentals</i>), Cedric Brooks ended
    up studying music in Philly late that decade. Already a fan of players like Pharoah Sanders and Sonny
    Rollins, he gigged and expanded on his sunny and lilting Caribbean tone, meeting up with folks like Leon
    Thomas and Sun Ra (who had moved the Arkestra back to Philly at this time). When he returned to Jamaica,
    the ideological outlook of Ra greatly informed Brooks' new approach to creating the music of his home and
    for his people around the world. Outwardly, they took up a similar sort of garb (down to the robes and
    shiny headgear), but the music expanded as well, with jazzy ensemble tones, outer-space group chants, and
    a heavily pan-African handdrum base that could support this all-encompassing and expansive music that was
    still rooted in the gritty sound of the island.</p><p>
    
    Listen to ""Free Up Black Man"", ""Outcry"", ""Jah Light It Right"" or ""Rebirth"", which all swing heavy roots
    messages within elephant-pounding and snake-rattling beats, as if Lee Perry had weighted the Black Ark
    down with a baked dozen of the Arkestra's drummers for his own dub-roots masterpiece, <i>Super Ape</i>.
    Over the manifold pounding of hand drums, crisp cymbals, and other peripheral clops, Brooks blows a
    spiritual fire that reiterates the group chants and the parallel themes of Rastafarianism happening
    elsewhere in the island's music.</p><p>
    
    ""Lambs Bread Collie"" and ""Sabasi"" have as much in common with Lonnie Liston Smith's early 70s head
    explorations on <i>Astral Traveling</i> or Charles Mingus' experimental <i>Cumbia and Jazz Fusion</i>
    as they do with those tough Studio One tracks: the horn lines ride shakers, congas, bird calls, and
    basslines that thud from deep in the jungle foliage to enlightenment. To show how universal they were
    getting down there, there are even added dashes of Latino, mid-era funk, and disco (?!) beats on tracks
    like ""Sabebe"" and ""Africa"".</p><p>
    
    Adding another twist are the Ethiopian scales that Brooks was infatuated with at the time. Woven into
    songs like ""Sabayindah"", ""Song for my Father"" and ""Sly Mongoose"", the scale imparts a snaky surface on
    the melodies that slithers between the smoky polyrhythms that seem so familiar yet sound so new. Despite
    some of the most unfriendly paper packaging I have yet to come across (my disc was already marred beyond
    belief upon breaking the seal), this record still ties together the variegated threads of the world's
    music in a way that only true dreads can.</p></div>"|1098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1098-cedric-im-brooks-the-light-of-saba/|7.8|Andy Beta

    an icy, metallic barrier and the flush of a chill wind suffocating any lingering thoughts of the natural
    world.  Depressing?  This kind of emptiness even devours depression, acting like a vacuum for emotion.
    There is no hope, only space.  Whenever you think you see a light at the end of the cylinder, it turns out
    to be an illusion.  This is not a dark place, rather an infinite reflection of light without source.  You
    are falling quickly; the bite of the draft momentarily distracts you.  In some way, giving into the
    downward spiral seems like the easiest way to crawl out-- though at your speed, crawling would do little.
    No, this seems much more permanent.  It is the sound of sudden death.</p><p>
    
    Okay, I'll back up.  Luckily, the impressions I get from sound artist Richard Chartier's strikingly minimal
    <i>Archival 1991</i> are not quite as permanent as death.  They are pretty extraordinary, capable of as
    much resonance as you're willing to invest in them.  Since there isn't much ""activity"" involved in the
    single 46-minute track, the mind has plenty of time to wander into spaces most people probably shy away
    from as a matter of practice.  This isn't to say the music is boring, but merely suggestive where most
    commercially available stuff (even experimental) works in brighter, more persuasive colors.  This CD
    probably requires an allotment of time alone (or with very attentive friends), in an uncluttered space.
    In truth, it probably requires a lot more than that, but if you're willing to give it a chance, there
    are some pretty amazing/scary head games to play.</p><p>
    
    Some people might actually know Chartier (born 1971) better as a graphic designer.  In addition to designing
    all his CD art, he's had work featured at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art and Belfast's Catalyst
    Arts gallery.  His visual aesthetic seems to emphasize the sleek, minimal and straightforward, as if
    designing an instructional manual for members of a particularly eclectic deep-space exploration team might
    be his dream job.  Fittingly, his music tends not to recall scenes from daily or natural life, but coolly
    impressionistic vignettes of a scientific world.  He releases much of his music on his own Line imprint,
    though also put out an excellent compilation this year of his non-Line compositions, <i>Other Materials</i>.</p><p>
    
    According to Chartier, <i>Archival 1991</i> began as two synthesizer-based pieces originally created in
    1991.  This summer, he revisited (i.e., applied much digital trickery to) those pieces to form this release.
    As I hear it, he's done a masterful job of integrating the source material into a seamless whole; <i>Archival
    1991</i> not only doesn't sound like a ""remix"", it threatens to overwhelm whatever source might have gone
    into it.  Although beginning hardly louder than the hum from your stereo, it's the kind of piece that will
    draw you in before you realize how much time has passed.  Strictly speaking, this is ambient music, but
    that shouldn't imply that it's sterile.</p><p>
    
    The piece works through many ebbs and flows.  It begins subtly, sounding not unlike the angry sea as heard
    through a conch shell.  Throughout, I'm reminded of the open sound of rushing wind or large bodies of water.
    A few minutes later, I realize the sound has become more intense, as if nearer the heart of a turbulent
    current.  Furthermore, there are passing washes of bass, guttural in their pitch, but as smooth as a glacier.
    These washes become more pronounced (and deeper) as the piece reaches its midway point, and as such, the
    surrounding wind-like sounds retreat to the upper registers.  Over time, the winds mostly subside, and the
    bass seems more focused-- though that could be that I've become much more used to its patterns over the
    last half hour.  <i>Archival 1991</i> ends as these bass movements spiral into nothingness.  If this is
    emptiness, it is intimidating only in that we are left to our own devices to find a happy ending, or even
    recognizably ""human"" signposts along the way.  However, it's an impressive emptiness from an interesting
    composer.</p></div>"|1741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1741-archival-1991/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    with loads of meaningless math-based metaphors.  However, Philadelphia's
    National Eye embody galactic mystery in a way that's pretty undeniable:
    prickly and dissonant, <i>The Meter Glows</i>, National Eye's eerie-but-warm
    full-length debut, mimics the sound of a band blindly pinging about the
    universe and bouncing off of planets as it spirals, satellite-style, further
    and further into space.</p><p>
    
    The band's embrace of big, atmospheric oddities (including any and all
    internal discrepancies-- check their unexpected style-hops from track to
    track) doesn't necessarily mean that <i>The Meter Glows</i> is destined to
    sit perpetually out of reach, or even that the album will feel especially
    chilling to listeners.  Flitting from Lips-ish psych to country strumming to
    spectral, vacant whispers, the record packs its own quirky charm (see their
    surprisingly pitchy croons and a few overtly sentimental lyrics), and a
    generous slathering of melodic shimmer.  In a way, the album's greatest
    achievement is that it makes discordance sound so endlessly inviting.</p><p>
<i>The Meter Glows</i> is also a stylistically surprising album.  National
    Eye are tricky to pin down because they pull from many contemporary sources,
    but take their root influences second-hand.  They offer a fresh re-reinterpretation
    of an adventurous rock canon (ranging from Pink Floyd to Wire), as opposed to
    another rote mimicry.  The approach may sound confounded, but the results
    are pleasantly surprising: opener ""I Ran Into Him"" is a sweeping start, with
    rushing vocals, inching closer, and distorted guitar noodling layered over
    crackling amp fuzz. The folky ""Dracula's Always with Me"" mixes a timid piano
    line with twinkling, effects-heavy guitar, while ""Just a Dream"" starts with
    a handful of yawning effects and settles into a sliding, earthy lament
    featuring all vocals, drums and tiny bits of bass and guitar.</p><p>
    
    National Eye may wholeheartedly embrace post-rock moodiness, but they
    stubbornly (and nobly) avoid soaking everything in a dulling puddle of
    drone. On the contrary, the instrumentation here is distinct.  The band
    wields their arsenal of noise carefully, and with high regard to traditional
    songcraft; consequently, many of these songs are as memorable as they are
    abstract.  Mixed by producer Thom Monahan (Silver Jews, Pernice Brothers,
    Beachwood Sparks), <i>The Meter Glows</i> boasts other interesting sounds--
    from organ and e-bow to creaking synths and muted microphones-- and the
    final collage is almost enough to make you want to teeter outside in your
    headphones, granting the record the kind of celestial context it requests.</p></div>"|5885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5885-the-meter-glows/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

    the UK Top 10, and dissipated into respectable obscurity for fifteen years.  Mutant disco was not a genetic
    fluke in the disco DNA.  As the squadrons of recent reparative 80s NY compilations attest, it was exactly
    the opposite: a small clubhouse of brash intellectuals, avant-garde crackpots, and underground flotsam
    calculatedly engineering a disco insurrection. They (post-punk, no-wave, new wave, post-wave) brought the
    disco; the disco didn't come to them.</p><p>
    
    The assumption here is that the only thing weirder than being weird is being partially weird. Going from
    the most outsider music possible to the most polished, mainstream sound smacks of an audacity we can barely
    comprehend. To list only a few of the credentials: James Chance was on the original <i>No New York</i> comp;
    Bill Laswell's Material featured Sonny Sharrock and Fred Frith; and Was (Not Was) littered their early
    singles with stream-of-consciousness surreal rants. To bring things into the present, this would be an
    event equal to Jim O'Rourke being produced by The Matrix. By any account, this merger should clear the
    dancefloor faster than Shaq's DJing skillz.</p><p>
    
    On this two-disc reissue of the original 1981 comp (effectively quadrupling the number of tracks), any
    hesitation is erased in the first moments of Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out"".  The great surge of generic
    disco hi-hat releases a flittering confetti of tin-foil synths. Jagged god-rawk garage feedback bides its
    time in the recesses of the track until it's propelled forward with punk rock slashes courtesy of the MC5's
    Wayne Kramer and pistonsful of Latin jazz. Even the lyrics skip along the thin line between naked
    pleasure-party and obscure psychopathy: ""No one's discouraged by you who never push the wheels. You did it.
    And I'm next."" You can be a street urchin or a glam princess: This irrepressible beast of a song will, at
    the very least, make you the most popular person alive and may very well make for the sort of nights that,
    in appropriate temperatures, cause some people to become pregnant.</p><p>
    
    Material's collaboration with ex-Labelle member Nona Hendryx stacks crepitating basslines with entire
    battalions of gradually digitized guitars lost in their own egomania. Kid Creole's hit, ""Annie, I'm Not
    Your Daddy"", sticks five genres that would be sublime easy listening by themselves and networks them until
    they take on a sonic glory, busking cuicas and crashing cymbals. Paternity tests have never been quite
    this riotous before.</p><p>
    
    And never mind that James White's ""Contort Yourself"" is to 80s NY compilations as ""Happy Together"" is to
    60s Summer-of-Love ones. The rockabilly avant-jazz version of The Contortions' version is here streamlined
    and put on dubs with a life-changing beat and enough reckless sax to let you know this band came to disco
    and can leave at will.  The ZE supergroup, The Aural Exciters, begins ""Spooks in Space"" with the utterly
    unimpeachable line, ""Mama say there'll be days like this.. but she ain't say nothin' 'bout SPOOKS!"" and
    forms a song out of bubbling potions, banana pratfall sound effects, and haunted dancehall trepidation.</p><p>
    
    A personal favorite is Cristina, a neglected diva that's alternately complacent and histrionic. Her version
    of ""Drive My Car"" renders the Hollywood dazzle of the lyrics even more playfully vacuous than the original.
    She sounds like a hollow shell of a ditzy bombshell in a car that refuses to conform to certain air
    pollution laws. ""Blame It on Disco"" has a lurching bass and a brass reggae pace, but for some reason
    there's also gales of sleet and when the swelled strings and backup singers tell us to ""blame it on disco
    with a fascinating sound/ That's the talk of the town,"" it's somehow hard to not think of a coke-snorting
    Rogers &amp; Hammerstein. ""Disco Clone"" is absolute mayhem: blaxploitating rumble and Bernard Hermann dagger
    thrusts with a refrain that's pitched so high my windows broke because the dogs ran into them. Also, it's
    a disco song with the word ""sauntering"" in it. I can die happy.</p><p>
    
    This is the tip of the iceberg. For a genre that often encompasses some of the most flagrantly irritating
    music this side of ragtime, there is such diversity here, from hewn guitar pyrotechnics to lilting bossa
    nova, two hours isn't hardly enough.  We have hit the day when disco made a better double album than Pink
    Floyd. It just goes to show that two (or more) genres don't need any similarities except hedonism,
    narcissism, and drug abuse. Tell the hardcore punks it's time to go home.</p></div>"|2028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2028-mutant-disco/|8.7|Alex Linhardt

It was a time when <i>Yo! MTV Raps</i> would broadcast its irreverent brand of an
    early hip-hop DIY aesthetic into millions of bedrooms across the globe.  It was a time when a five-mic
    review in a fledgling rap journal called <i>The Source</i> meant more than your record label making a
    check out to Benzino. It was a time when up and coming legends like Gang Starr would release career
    defining albums (<i>Daily Operation</i>) and a slew of fresh faces would soon after drop incendiary
    landmark debuts (In '93: Wu-Tang, Black Moon; In '94: Biggie, Nas). Most importantly though, 1992 was
    the year when a young duo named Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth flooded the airwaves with their rousing jazz-laced
    elegy, ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"".</p><p>
    
    Featuring a remarkably agile and sincere vocal delivery from C.L. Smooth, and Pete Rock dropping haunting
    strands of interweaving horn melodies, stabbing sax blurts and a smooth snare-driven groove, ""T.R.O.Y.""
    would become one of the most stirring and beloved hip-hop songs of all time.  Only two years later, the
    duo would call it quits, and though C.L. Smooth would seldom be heard from again, Pete Rock's foggy
    jazz-infused production would give birth to millions of imitators (if little commercial success).</p><p>
    
    Though the legendary four-year period spanning 1992-1996 served as one of hip-hop's most creatively
    inspired eras, the music business was, at the time, completely clueless as to the genre's profitability
    and artistic value.  The industry's prevailing ignorance over hip-hop (epitomized by the Wu-Tang lyric,
    ""Who's your A&amp;R;, a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?"") meant that, along with the many
    landmark albums that hit record store shelves, an ungodly amount of potential rap classics never got
    to see the light of day: Large Professor, for example, instructed listeners to ""buy my album when I
    drop it,"" on A Tribe Called Quest's ""Keep It Rollin'""-- and almost ten years later we're still waiting
    for its release.</p><p>
    
    So hip-hop aficionados worldwide should tip their collective throwback jerseys to the British beat-centric
    label BBE for rescuing some of Pete Rock's finest mid-90s production moments from a death in obscurity.
    Collected here, in their entirety are two forgotten Pete Rock-produced gems: InI's <i>Center of Attention</i>
    and Deda's <i>The Original Baby Pa</i>.  The infamously bootlegged <i>Center of Attention</i>, with its
    relentless, jaw-dropping sequence of solid instrumentals, is the real showstopper.  ""Think Twice"" bounces
    by on a choppy bed of sublimely looped piano chords, guitar stabs, and a hazy, meditative Black Moon-influenced
    drum break. Tracks like ""Step Up"" and ""Fakin' Jax"" fare even better, all piano melodies submerged in a thick
    fog of sub-aquatic vapor, while armies of shimmering horns slice through the substantial haze in intoxicating
    loops.  Additionally, a track like ""To Each His Own"" (which features guest spots from Q-Tip and Large
    Professor), with its drizzling vibe notes and flurrying horns seems to sonically billow open from out of
    the speaker fabric, like a dense trail of weed smoke swelling from out of the tip of a blunt only to be
    diffused in the surrounding air.</p><p>
    
    But while the instrumentals on Deda's <i>The Original Baby Pa</i> are similarly inspired to the ones
    found on <i>Center of Attention</i>, both albums showcase a problem that's plagued Pete Rock's career
    from day one: the quality of his beats consistently overshadows the quality of his emcees' rhymes. It's
    no coincidence that 2001's instrumental affair, <i>Petestrumentals</i>, was one of Rock's greatest moments.
    On the Deda track ""Blah Uno"", Pete cooks up a dizzying brew of swirling horns, radiating, woofer-friendly
    bass notes, and the irresistible boom-bap of snare cracks and galloping ride cymbals only for Deda to
    inanely spit, ""Blah Uno here to put suckers in the mix/ The music was fixed for me to bust wild dicks.""
    While on ""No More Words"", InI's three members (Rob-O, Grap Luva, and Pete Rock himself) kick undeniably
    smooth verses with easygoing group chemistry bereft of any lasting inspired insight.  Furthermore, a
    track like ""Markd4Death"" may showcase a debonair instrumental of pensively unraveling Rhodes notes, but
    Deda's predictable gangsterisms and humdrum threats sound about as moving as the drone of a computer fan.</p><p>
    
    The glory of the early 90s will always hold a special place in the hearts of hip-hop listeners far and
    wide; they were the adolescent years before bling killed the urban anti-star.  Of course, even while
    hip-hop fans are proverbially salivating like Pavlov's dogs for a planned Rock reunion with original
    partner-in-crime C.L. Smooth (and a possible sequel to 1998's <i>Soul Survivor</i>), <i>Lost &amp; Found</i>'s
    unearthed treasures provide an ideal soundtrack for nostalgia while successfully building anticipation
    for future material.</p></div>"|6902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6902-lost-and-found-hip-hop-underground-soul-classics/|8.2|Hartley Goldstein

    thousand college-town lessers, the Oxes. Which means that Frenemies crawls across the hallowed sod lain by
    past drummer branch-outs, i.e. the careers of the Foo Fighters, Sparrow, Phil Collins, Gary Young, Charlie
    Watts, and Ringo Starr. Those who prefer to describe the Oxes' output in the lingo of car-porn (""high
    octane,"" ""full throttle"") should be warned that Frenemies' music is an ounce more fanciful and diverse
    than that of Freeland's other combo.</p><p>
    
    The weirdness of Baltimore informs this disc's tonelessness, spontaneity, and incoherence. The listener
    imagines the scene there as a clandestine commune; bands must sneak into their stuffy art spaces, darting
    past Orioles scalpers, tiptoeing around urban chickens, and creeping past the corner bars where a Redskins
    doo-rag can either get you beaten up or felt up. How can such duress not lead to arrested development, or
    worse, batting-cage hissyfits? How do Baltimore artists grow past a fascination with wigs, boogers, and
    bicycles? This album's title track wails, tellingly, ""I'm not a friend, why should I be/ I got all my
    friends in Baltimore here with me,"" and later, ""I've got all my friends from high school here with me.""</p><p>
    
    Friendship drifts like a nitrous zeppelin, from after-school punk, to noodly art-flux, to interesting
    anti-rap, to splendid loner-pop. I assume that Freeland designed every sound here, except for the
    happy-hour choir parts, the female vox that kick off ""Moving Day"", and the rhymes of Bow &amp; Arrow (though
    I have to believe that Cex, listed as a ""Frenemy"" in the liner notes, served as a consultant for the
    heinous flow on the ""hip-hop"" tracks-- which, to their credit, always feature elegantly pimpy key loops).</p><p>
    
    A creative mania compensates for Freeland's half-hearted genre-splicing; fans of the one-take (pre-Geffen)
    Beck may fawn, as could proponents of Space Needle's analog blasts and ironic wanderscapes. ""Big 4 You"" is
    the funkiest keeper, about vowing to disinter up a buried-alive companion, even if the speaker's fingernails
    break. ""Love"", meanwhile, is the disc's best manifestation of post-Tortoise xerox-jazz, pumping like an
    autistic opus penned by Jaco Pastorius' ghost through the lovable contraption from both <i>Short Circuit</i>s.
    Baltimore is America's cluttered attic, and Freeland's freeform songs are tossing some of the junk into
    the sideyard.</p><p>
    
    The weak singing limits the proceedings somewhat; think Callaci from Refrigerator, or Beaujon from Eggs.
    The Rapture and Hot Hot Heat, et cetera, may be getting the dancefloor scuffed with their rangeless
    frontmen, but the persistence of Thom Yorke and the emergence of The Darkness' Justin Hawkins are raising
    the bar beyond even Freddy Mercury's operatic stunt-pipes. ""Step 1"" may offer DFA-worthy old-school
    skreeback, but this release knows that it's ultimately as ethereal as SARS. Frenemies just want to hang
    out.</p></div>"|3281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3281-friendship/|6.0|William Bowers

    (providing living essentials to individuals in need), their last two attempts at indie moral appeasement
    seemed overbearingly dull, if star-studded, affairs.  Fortunately, this new double-disc offering fares
    better, breaking the mind-numbing cycle of compilation blues by presenting a meticulously sequenced
    collection of new originals, rare demos, B-sides, and previously released tracks from indie-rock
    standard-bearers such as Wilco, Super Furry Animals, and Spoon.</p><p>
    
    One of <i>The Amos House Collection III</i>'s greatest assets is that its contributions, despite that many
    of its bands are making their second or third appearances on an Amos House comp here, have never sounded
    so fresh as a unified piece: The two opening tracks from Amos House alumni Emily Sparks and Spoon fit
    together beautifully.  Sparks' ""Find Your Own Fire"" segues into Spoon's invigorating burst of acoustic
    indie-rock synergy, an early unplugged demo of the <i>Kill the Moonlight</i> standout ""Jonathan Fisk""
    that serves as a fantastic counterpoint to the lilting guitar triplets and sweeping melancholy of Sparks'
    stark opener.</p><p>
    
    But disc one's inspired opening pales in comparison to the sequencing home run of its closing four tracks.
    Wheat's contribution, ""Long Shadow, USA (Wheat vs. Tim Rutili)"", eschews the overproduced alacrity of their
    latest record to match its guest guitarist's meandering bursts of distorted urgency with spacey synth lines
    and a wondrously esoteric, happy vibe.  This driving, rhythmic stargazing exercise is flawlessly followed
    by the seething, distortion-drenched stumble of Califone's cover of the Stones' classic ""Ventilator Blues"".
    Remarkably, just as Califone's blues-din has driven you to the bottle, the energized lo-fi pop shimmer
    of Elf Power's ""Evil Eye"", and the swaggering bucolic crunch of the Super Furry Animals rarity ""Foxy
    Music"" (culled from the hard-to-find <i>International League of Screaming</i> EP) draw the disc to an
    irresistibly rousing close.</p><p>
    
    Fans seeking any juicy dregs of lush, psych-pop ingenuity from Circulatory System-- the Athens, Georgia
    clique formerly known as Olivia Tremor Control-- will find much to obsess over on ""Deserts (As Big as a
    Star)"".  The track features a dizzying Eastern-influenced melodic line floating atop crumbling stutter-stop
    breakbeats and Cullen's smothering nonsensical vocals.  Unfortunately, Wilco's contribution, ""Let Me Come
    Home"", doesn't hold up quite as well.  The track feels slightly mired by its gloomy arrangement; wandering
    brush sticks caress the face of the snare, creating a shifting, disconcerting fog over stumbling minor
    piano chords and Jeff Tweedy's cracked melodramatic appeals for redemption (sample lyric: ""I'll let my
    dreams be your escape/ If you'll just let me come home"").  It's not bad, but in light of the unusually
    high standards set by Wilco's previous outstanding work, its status as an outtake could not be clearer.</p><p>
    
    In fact, Wilco's sonic disparity seems rather endemic of the vibe on most of the second disc.  Azure Ray's
    sullen, x-chromosome monotony reigns supreme on the languid ""Lucky Sevens"", while in a blindfold test, Matt
    Smith's melancholy Rhodes-driven innocence on ""Lay Down in the Leaves"" could pass for just about any of
    Ida's tender minimal musings.  To make matters worse, even a big old Saddle Creek singalong can't stop
    The Good Life's Tim Kasher from urgently declaring that he's ""lost his direction,"" in the ode to
    abandonment ""Haunted Homecoming"".  Still, despite disc two's drudgery, <i>The Amos House Collection III</i>
    is a bold step forward for compilations of its ilk.  It serves as a strong reminder that even the most
    diverse collection of great tracks, when sequenced thoughtfully, can coalesce into a unified, listenable
    whole.</p></div>"|2016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2016-the-amos-house-collection-iii/|7.1|Hartley Goldstein

    settling for a string of unrelated one-line putdowns. Might all this talk about fluidity be masking a
    sense of helplessness when it comes to rhythm and phrasing? Are flow-obsessed rappers just dried up?
    Even as I ask, Diverse wipes the smirk off my mouth. Since his sleepy 2001 debut, the <i>Move</i> EP,
    the Chicago-based rapper has made a relentless stream of cameo appearances on albums by Rjd2, Prefuse 73,
    Mos Def, and others. At some point, his style just came together, built around an easy mastery of
    micro-timing, emphasis, and pitch.  Diverse avoids insults, hype and one-liners, but doesn't even need
    to say anything interesting to get your attention-- his gift lies in a rare kind of self-possessed
    delivery that could move you hard even without a beat.  It's all in his flow.</p><p>
    
    ""A lot of MCs let the rhythm dictate how they rhyme,"" Diverse was recently quoted.  ""I'm a poet even
    before I'm an emcee, which allows me to dictate to the beat."" It's true that Diverse has a poet's gift
    for turning words-- the abstract, segmented raw materials of daily language-- into a concrete, continuous
    stream.  But I'd go farther: Diverse can make almost any beat better by weaving it through with little
    darting tendrils of words-made-music, leaving a sparkling trail of associations almost as an afterthought.
    In this case, he has his work cut out for him, since the production (by Rjd2, Prefuse 73, and Madlib,
    among others) leaves very little room for improvement.</p><p>
    
    ""Certified"" and ""Uprock"", whose hype hooks pull forward while Rjd2 leans back into a lilting cut, are
    crowd-movers, pure and simple. The production becomes mercilessly spare on a gritty Vast Aire collaboration,
    ""Big Game"", where Diverse shows his range by rhyming ""disposable circumference"" with ""pump your fist.""
    Then Vast Aire tosses red meat into the Can Ox fanclub's cage, dropping: ""I got you thinking I'm an animal/
    Kind of like Tarzan but raised by cannibals."" Despite the potential, there's no jungle-of-cities concept
    here, just a string of rhetorical twists on ""Big Game"". Madlib produces ""Ain't Right"", a decent two-part
    story-song about sudden death claiming guilty and innocent alike. Diverse can tell a story, we learn, but
    the increase in continuity is barely noticeable: Flow alone will carry him.</p><p>
    
    ""Jus Biz"", a loose meditation on wealth and livelihood, features the first of three busy, diaphanous
    Prefuse textures, with trademark distorted Rhodes, vibes, and feminine ooh's backing a loping boom-clip.
    Diverse fights for space in this environment, but wins. But ""Explosive"", a thorough collaboration with
    Quannum rapper Lyrics Born, doesn't quite earn its name. When he's really on, Lyrics Born can produce a
    brilliant flood of phonemes that stays a few steps ahead of any paraphrasable meaning. But here, articulation
    is his downfall, as a river of unenunciated blabber just makes Diverse's consistent spitting shine all the
    brighter. In ""Under the Hammer"", Jean Grae's perverse ghetto portraits get a rise out of Diverse, who's at
    his most arch and bleak. Then, horns reeking of jet fuel, ""747"" flies low with a heavy load of funk,
    spewing a hazy trail of puff-ups and put-downs. Ill as they are, I just can't believe Diverse means harm,
    especially after hearing the next track, a nuanced and tonal apology for ""Leaving"" home. I wish I'd left,
    too; the last track is a forgettable jazz collaboration with Tortoise guitarist Jeff Parker and drummer
    Ted Sirota.</p><p>
    
    Diverse's delivery is so beguiling that after dozens of listens I have yet to worry about absorbing the
    content of this album. Maybe that's because there isn't much, and next album, I'll grow impatient with
    the sheen of his immaculate delivery. For now, I'm still enjoying it: Nothing deep, but all delicious.</p></div>"|2533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2533-one-am/|8.0|Jascha Hoffman

    improvisation.  Along with Taku Sugimoto, Toshimaru Nakamura and Otomo Yoshihide, Akiyama has helped
    shaped the sound of Onkyo with his guitar-- in a scene largely heralded for its use of electronics,
    these musicians' use of a much more traditionally ""rock"" instrument shouldn't go unnoticed.  Furthermore,
    along with Nakamura, Akiyama organizes a monthly ""meeting"" at the Off Site venue in Tokyo wherein many
    of the world's most interesting improvisers collaborate in a series of electro-acoustic performances.
    The third CD compilation of these performances was recently released, and will be of interest to anyone
    into modern improv and experimental electronic music.</p><p>
    Now, all of that said, DON'T FORGET TO BOOGIE!!!  Sorry, I just had to spit that out.  Despite a CV that
    might lead you to believe Akiyama wouldn't be caught dead listening to a classic rock station, he sees
    fit to issue his third solo album as something of a tribute to the electric blooze of acts like Canned
    Heat, Led Zeppelin and John Lee Hooker.  <i>Don't Forget</i> is a straight solo performance of riffs,
    licks and grease that would make Billy Gibbons jealous and European festival organizers scratch their
    heads in bewilderment.  Where other infamous Japanese guitarists like Keiji Haino or Makoto Kawabata use
    their infatuation with hard rock to inform apocalyptic freakouts, Akiyama is content to play the kind of
    music that you might hear in a Louisiana dive late at night, after all the drunk cowboys have gone home
    and only the drunker barflies are left to give their respects to the blues.  In some way, Akiyama's record
    (vinyl only, of course) is a very clichéd notion of preserving an outdated model of authentic rock
    expression.  In another way, it's a stone, hypnotic jam.</p><p>
    Opener ""It's a Boogie Thing"" will have the hardline improv-geeks running for the hills, but all you closet
    ZZ Top fans need to go ahead and surrender now.  Akiyama's devil-come-runnin' blues shuffle is practically
    an archetypical soundtrack to cruising Texas two-lane highways in an old pick-up as the sun burns your arm
    and bugs splatter against the windshield.  The minimal, repetitive groove carries on without a care in the
    world, as if simply sitting back and reveling in the glory of a groove and a $35 amp is the height of
    sophistication.  Tunes like ""Doll House Shakin'"" and ""Dead Or..."" proceed similarly, emphasizing an almost
    intimidating willingness to do absolutely nothing for minutes at a time other than worship a riff.</p><p>
    Not everything is so straightforward.  ""She's a B-Girl"" is a pretty rumination on the power of shimmering
    light as translated by a tremolo'd guitar.  Here, Akiyama uses his instrument not so much as a conduit to
    his rock and blues heroes, but as a paintbrush, crossing stroke after stroke of an impressionist still life.
    Just as he does on his improvised releases, Akiyama finds a way to make sparse figures add up to much more
    than the sum of their parts.  This is especially the case in the ultra-trance of ""Fast Machine""; you'd be
    surprised how engaging a single, quickly repeated guitar chord emulating the monolithic pulse of passing
    highway lane-dividers can be.</p><p>
    Akiyama describes <i>Don't Forget to Boogie</i> as his ""ego trip,"" and it's certainly an album that requires
    some compromise from listeners.  For most people, perhaps an album consisting of only solo electric guitar
    blues-rock wouldn't sound like a must-have, and I'll own up to having been fairly skeptical before hearing
    it.  However, I shouldn't have been surprised to know that good musicians tend to make interesting whatever
    they try, even when they might trip over their own enthusiasm along the way.  Akiyama's ego trip is, at
    worst, a guilty pleasure, and at best, a carefree cruise into the rock and roll sunset.  Smoke 'em if you
    got 'em, boys.</p></div>"|416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/416-dont-forget-to-boogie/|7.8|Dominique Leone

The Glasgow quartet may     not yet shoulder the same weight of expectation garnered by early Strokes or Interpol EPs, but based on     what I'm hearing here, I'm guessing Santa won't be missing their house come late December.</p><p>Given only five tracks to work with-- two of them being home demo recordings, and the latter of these an     encore to the disc's first single and opening title track-- the band has as many viable future trajectories     as it does sonic resemblances. ""Darts of Pleasure"" is a bombastically truncated nod to all things     indie/electro/new wave.  Strikingly Interpolian as they lunge in alongside a healthy drum clip, jagged     guitar, and a hardboiled bassline Alex Kapranos' morose-chic vocals are coy but cool: ""You are the devil     that sells a line of dark fantastic passion.""  It's a line of modern-baroque recollection the band     tightropes for the whole act.  Synths filter in for the second verse before the song drops off to a     quick-sting bass-and-drum interlude before swirling all its ingredients back in for an everyone-in-the-studio-we're-German     singalong, ""Ich heisse superfantastiche!""  Outstanding.</p><p>""Van Tango"" is a glam testament to why Franz Ferdinand were a perfect fit for sharing the stage with Hot     Hot Heat and Interpol on recent tours, as it meshes the disparate elements and better parts of both acts     into a stew of snappy jubilance; too content not to be cool and too cool to be content, it jangles its way     through the peppiest of apathetic musing as it discusses the life of its nominal night-walking neo-vampire     hipster. ""Shopping for Blood"" could well be the new post-<em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> party anthem--     sporting a sock-hop goth-gallop and a ""Monster Mash"" narrative, it's more glam than gore.  On ""Tell Her     Tonight"", the band lets a little Kinks/Beatles-meets-electro-indie slip out.  However, I can only surmise     that the reason for the inclusion of the demo version of ""Darts of Pleasure"" was to show that the band is     not The Strokes, but could wear the costume for Halloween if they wished.  Stripped of their razor sharp     production, this is what's left.  But by then it doesn't matter, I already had my pen out.  Boys, get on     your hype riot-gear, you'll be needing it.</p></div>"|3278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3278-darts-of-pleasure-ep/|8.3|William Morris

British hip-hop kid Req is a minimalist, though he's not a student of Philip
    Glass and doesn't know or care about microsound.  What Req is about is beats, with every trace of meat
    and gristle gnawed off.  He wants to see how little he can leave inside his raw, repetitive loops and keep
    people interested. He'll take a drum break or an 808 pattern and let it run solo longer than just about
    anyone outside of a break record compiler.</p><p>
    
    Req's second album for Warp consists of tracks selected by pal Damian Harris, boss of his former label
    Skint. Some tracks were created specifically for the new album; some have been lying around for several
    years. Roughly half the record is strictly rough-and-ready breaks. ""Ry Drum I"" is total trash funk, with
    a booming loop that sounds like it was recorded in a shed behind Fred Sanford's house. The only accouterment
    comes from a squelchy bass synth and a cheap organ, and they play about three notes between them. ""Worthing
    Line"" swaps the sampler for a drum machine, lets the programmed beat play essentially untouched for almost
    five minutes (save a couple of fills) and adds a few eerie chords. ""Rhythm 77"", amazingly, makes do with
    even less for much of its length, with only a faint ghost of synth chords occasionally creeping in between
    the beats.</p><p>
<i>Car Paint Scheme</i>, like its immediate predecessor, <i>Sketchbook</i>, is a grab bag, and the rest of
    the record is fleshed out with other styles. It's not completely instrumental: Two tracks have some cockney
    spitting from Kid Acne. His throwback style fits the music well and, of course, Req gives him plenty of
    room to breath, supplementing his beats with turntable scratching. ""Train Jam"" is built around the kind
    of old funk guitar riff that makes you want to track the original down, and unlike the bulk of the record
    its mood is sunny and bright. The beat on ""Runout Scratches"" sounds built from what the title implies,
    connecting Req with the long line of turntable artists who have fetishized surface noise.</p><p>
    
    Incredibly, Req makes his naked rhythms work most of the time. There's nothing mind-blowing about the
    music by any stretch, but the minimal beatscapes manage somehow to evoke a desolate, broken down street
    scene. Perhaps he's tapping into our collective memory of graffiti documentaries, the images of colorful
    walls set against decay that's inevitably accompanied by old school hip-hop soundtracks. But there's
    something uncanny about how enjoyable these simplistic, looped rhythms can be.  You should, of course,
    be doing something else while this plays, though, because these tracks won't likely hold all your attention.
    Despite the praise he deserves for doing so much with so little, <i>Car Paint Scheme</i> is ultimately a
    bit flat and one dimensional, the sort of thing you put on very occasionally when the mood strikes.</p></div>"|6761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6761-car-paint-scheme/|5.6|Mark Richardson

    Sheffield-based duo Mu, creeks out the maxim that ""DJs awh wock band,"" while her husband, Baltimorean
    Maurice Fulton, whips Model 500 basslines around submarine alarms and a dubbed-out salsa beat.  It all
    makes sense for a second, until I re-read the lyrics and realize that she's actually saying: ""Deejays
    are rocked by an electric chair girl.""  I misunderstand her, but the two impressions, be they of a
    dancefloor-manifesto or the sensual-personal, are both extremes that get delved into on the couple's
    debut, <i>Afro Finger and Gel</i>.  Lasciviously sliding along that axis between their ten songs, the
    fluctuation only fuels my infatuation with Mu.  Hers is the heavily-FX'd split personalities; his is
    the manic approach to beat-chopping that swallows up classic Chicago house, second-line whistles, digital
    uprisings, even Cubano instrumentation; and together, the couple have birthed one bizarre, brilliant
    album.</p><p>
    
    Over a hairy squelch, ""Jealous Kids"" opens as damning and acerbic as LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"",
    berating hipsters with lines like, ""Insecure kids can't [sic] close to me/ Frightened kids can't dance,""
    and, ""Bored kids are trying to kick me off/ Are we still high school kids?""  As the beat turns into nasty
    bleeps and a steel door the size of the Grand Canyon thuds shut on the sweaty masses, Mutsumi flips her
    vocal presets to the ""Another Brick in the Wall""-style chant-chorus of ""How many days can we life for?/
    How many times are we smiling?/ How many people can we know about?/ How many music can we feel to?""
    sneering at the onlookers as she morphs into a digital wraith and scares all the kids off the dancefloor
    with abrasive shrieks.</p><p>
    
    It's all in good fun, though, as ""Let's Get Sick"" coughs up Liquid Liquid's leftfield lugies at a ferocious
    pace with a full minute of air-raid sirens before Mu's processed voice gets beamed down to walk on Yoko
    Ono's thin ice, cracking cold cowbells and ice-picking timbales with each four on the floor.  She barks
    direct orders about being positive and calling in sick to work so that she and her man can lay about all
    day, puffing on a spliff.  She even goes so far as to rhyme ""we feel each others' bodies"" with ""kisses to
    my oranges,"" which is ticklish enough, but then proceeds to go doot-doot ahhhhhh like Stereolab used to do,
    before snapping out of her haze with a scream of ""Fuck that!""</p><p>
    
    Between the jackhammering title track, faithful hubby Fulton draws a post-coital Calgon bath and ambient
    cooldown for the missus, bubbling like classic Oval or Orb in between her distorted orgasms.  The sexual
    frankness of this track and the glitch'n geisha cuss-out of ""Hello Bored Biz Man"" isn't as blatantly gaudy
    as cuts by electr'ho's like Peaches or Avenue D, although it's a hundred times more psychotic.  Still, no
    amount of prophylactic protection or chemical inoculation can prepare you for the illness of ""My Name Is
    Tommi"".  Based on a UK television show that pits couples against each other, Mutsumi simultaneously plays
    the cheating boyfriend, the hysterical girlfriend, the announcer, and the Jawa-voiced host while the entire
    set is destroyed around them, their personas melting into an icky id-mess that wallows in the nastiest,
    most petulant part of human nature, complete with commercial breaks for its viewers/listeners.</p><p>
    
    The last half of the album embeds the most enlightening messages in its manic and intricate beats.  ""Tell
    You Something"" strangles a late-era Funkadelic lick over what could be the ""Billie Jean"" beat, while Mu
    shouts over a rubbery bassline that ""Jealousy doesn't give you anything/ Let's change the way people think.../
    Make a revolution to yourself.""  I start to believe her as her voice distorts into a Kelis-like tongue
    lashing over a pole-axed break of broken Afro-Cuban percussion and flickering glitches.  She explains her
    predicament further: ""I tried to be nice to everyone/ I said yes to everything/ Contradiction was getting
    bigger in my mind/ I found a lot difference between what I said and what I think.""</p><p>
    
    Appropriating the melody of Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime"" for ""Destroying Human Nature"", Mutsumi's
    voice gets ""screwed"" down to a slurred baritone as she plaintively wonders, ""Do you have anyone who can
    comfort you?/ Drugs, money, fame.../ Too many things can destroy human nature.../ I really hope you don't
    let yourself to lose them.""  For what will most likely be played out on the dancefloor, it's a weird
    question to ask the revelers and ravers, the anorexic models and fashionable kids.</p><p>
    
    2003 might go down as a year in which some rock records learned how to dance (Electric Six, !!!, The Rapture,
    Ssion) and some dance records learned to rock (Basement Jaxx, T. Raumschmiere, Fat Truckers), but <i>Afro
    Finger and Gel</i> straddles the diametrically opposed genres obliviously, not giving a fuck.  It lashes
    out at the p(r)etty people with their limited vision, imploring them to put aside their differences and
    encouraging everyone to be true to themselves (and their humanity) above all, either between two people or
    between the sheets.  Simultaneously fun and dark, ludicrous and serious, it's a fucked-up and uplifting
    record.  ""So we are only human/ Misunderstand each other,"" Mu confesses at one point, and the message is
    undeniable, even if it's a bit hard to make out.</p></div>"|5561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5561-afro-finger-and-gel/|9.0|Andy Beta

    Readers'd revolt if I began every review that way.  Unfortunately, Missy Elliott did just that on last
    year's <i>Under Construction</i>, proclaiming the unnecessary before each track.  It's nitpicking criticism,
    but enough reason to proclaim dark, dense <i>This Is Not a Test</i> as the new, and likely temporary, Best
    Missy Elliott Album.  Time has come to examine the cultural idiosyncrasies of Virginia and discover how
    the region produced the core clique of pop innovators.  With attention focused on New York, Manchester,
    Miami, and even Seattle, the notion sounded preposterous a decade ago.  Now entrenched as the Ronnie and
    Phil of crunk, Missy and Timbaland need only compete against their past, and the occasional Neptunes track.
    As in any healthy muse/artist relationship, the producer reserves his next level work for the queen.  The
    sparse scratch and siren driven ""Let It Bump"" hits speakers like a SWAT team on a motel door.  The
    broken-cone bass buzz and snapping steel guitar string supersaturates ""Pump It Up"" with sickness.
    There's no way these beats were going to Kiley Dean or Magoo.</p><p>
    Nothing in the world rattles jeeps more than war and hip-hop.  Surrounded by a Hummer, Black Panthers,
    bull terriers, and a burnt sky, Missy looks ready to meld the two.  In this current climate, such imagery
    comes obviously loaded, yet she abstains from any referential iconography, such as Madonna's Che chic, or
    manifesto.  Songs like ""Let Me Fix My Weave"" and the dildo ode ""Toyz"" throw no stones at administrations
    or pseudo-pundits (though I suspect Condi is quite familiar with both subjects).  The imagery evokes
    Missy's unabashed forthrightness and Timbaland's accompanying steely, spiked clamor.  A verse on ""Weave""
    levels J.Lo's extensions with the common lady getting her hair ""did,"" Missy's table at Madre's be damned.
    No veils of cute or coy or irony are pulled before her façade.  Timbaland laces no trendy bhangra or
    dancehall into his minimal assaults, even those on which Elephant/Beenie Man guest.  Video vixens may pant
    and rub themselves to stumps before approaching the true sexuality of a woman who's run out of patience
    for those refusing to dance, drop their posturing, or go down on her.</p><p>
    But it's the album's end-to-end strength that speaks the most-- against hip-hop artists who fail to make
    solid albums and those rock idiots who say it can't be done.  16 tracks clock in under 60 minutes with
    meaningful mini-skits, intro, and outros.  Even the plethora of guests inconspicuously slip into the mix.
    There's no way the two stars could be outshined, though Nelly redeems his crassly commercial career with
    his ""go go Gadget dick,"" while Jay-Z brilliantly rhymes ""rectum"" with ""David Beckham"" on ""Wake Up"".</p><p>
    As that track crushes like a submarine hull crunching over sonar pings, Missy says, ""You ain't got a
    cellular phone/ It's all right/ If you gotta wear them jeans again/ It's all right.""  Even when
    backed up by the Kings of Bling, Missy continually cuts the crap.  Everyone is invited to the party,
    even those getting dissed.  Those familiar with Missy through the radio only need know this: even the
    skyscraping ""Pass That Dutch"", a masterwork of robot ropeskipping riding unbelievably deep bass that
    turns subwoofers into hair dryers, seems a mere hillock over its surroundings.</p></div>"|2758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2758-this-is-not-a-test/|8.5|Brent DiCrescenzo

But while it seems like a new split single     or EP sees release every day, split full-lengths aren't so common.  There's a reason for this: EPs and     singles tend to serve as stopgaps in the rock world, small offerings to keep the masses entertained and     hungry between albums.  Though dancier rock and file-trading are gradually taking over the underground,     the album, for now, is still viewed by most as the definitive statement an artist can make, and sharing     that statement with another artist isn't something I'm sure most bands would seriously consider.  But     Tyondai Braxton and Parts &amp; Labor manage not just to successfully expand the split EP concept into a full     album, they also make a cohesive, logical sounding record in the process.</p>
<p>It's split down the middle, with Parts &amp; Labor taking the first half, and Braxton stretching out three     compositions over the latter.  Braxton, who asserted himself as a challenging, vital artist in his own     right on last year's stunning debut <i>History That Has No Effect</i>, has a more obtuse muse than his     partners in crime, but the two halves are so sonically of a piece with each other that his work never     seems displaced.  In fact, there's not even a break between the two sides, as Parts &amp; Labor's last song,     the jittery explosion ""The Endless Air Show"", segues directly into the motion sickness-inducing drum     onslaught of Braxton's ""Stand There"", a titular retort to the album's opening track, ""Don't Just Fucking     Stand There"".</p>
<p>That song has Parts &amp; Labor's Dan Friel playing his guitar as though it were bagpipes, laying out a     majestic drone over drummer Joel Saladino's reserved pulse and bassist BJ Warshaw's squelching electronics.     The weirdly traditional Celtic melody can't help but sound at home in Friel's reedy guitar tone, and the     band even brings in real bagpipes on ""Jurassic Technology"", highlighting just how effective Friel's     technique is at imitating them.  Parts &amp; Labor offer a few vocal songs as well, gurgling like a Highland     Brainiac on ""Days in Thirds"" and bursting with stuttering rock fury on the aforementioned ""Endless Air     Show"".  Friel and Warshaw mask their voices in electronic veils, barking with force, but melting into the     music around them.</p>
<p>Braxton follows this up by drawing a long, slow vocal melody out over the frenetic backing of ""Stand There"",     a catchy blast of frayed noise that serves as the record's high point.  ""Disintegrating Reels"" sounds a lot     like its namesake, a slow, shapeshifting monster of a track that showcases Braxton's facility with     processing and looping.  Ink-black guitars trickle over chopped and diced vocal samples, and as the piece     staggers on, Braxton adds flute, cello, viola and trumpet in modest doses, creating a frenzy of agonized     noise that lurches full bore into closer ""Jackpot"".  ""Jackpot"" is full of fluttering piano beset by     scrolling tape noise, like an old Disney score put through a paper shredder and haphazardly rearranged.     It's unsettling, but pretty at the same time, an industrial sound that still manages to come off as     playful and lighthearted before finally morphing into a kind of evil fantasia cut through with menacing     vocals and fractured guitar.</p>
<p>And with that, Braxton closes the disc about as far into left field as you can get-- a pretty good place to     end, as it seems like the place these two artists are likely to spend most of their time in the future.     Parts &amp; Labor are an exciting prospect, drone rock that's as much rock as drone, while Braxton's harshly     experimental approach ought to continue yielding potent fruit for a long time to come.  Braxton's debut     album is still the best place to hear him first (if you can't make it to one of his mind-bending live     shows, that is), but this is an intriguing, challenging album and an excellent introduction to two artists     full of great ideas.</p></div>"|6531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6531-rise-rise-rise/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    Stooges, the political caterwauling of John Sinclair and the screeching MC5, the piercing howls of a
    carnivorous, vine-swinging axman, and the recent commotion kicked up over a brother/sister duo and a
    loping white rapper.  Fold in a handful of press-ready analogies about industry and grime, and a few
    prosaic portraits of clanging pistons, merciless winters, and honest, pink-faced Americans, and unleash
    the wordy enigma that is contemporary Detroit.  Forced to sacrifice a viable cultural identity for series
    of one-dimensional, Upton Sinclair-meets-Norman Rockwell-meets-<i>8 Mile</i> clichés, it becomes impossible
    not to ask: Does Detroit even exist outside the pages of <i>Mojo</i>?</p><p>
    Chances are, The Dirtbombs hate that they've become just another notch in the greasy Motor City totem pole
    (check every White Stripes feature framed by a meaningless Dirtbombs sidebar), but Dirtbombs frontman Mick
    Collins has Detroit roots that can't be easily overlooked, or at least not anymore: former guitarist for
    late-80s garage beasts The Gories, Collins has recently been dragged into the very weirdest kind of
    posthumous regard, with sold-six-copies Gories records suddenly becoming elite status symbols for
    Detroit-crazed garage-rock revivalists.  A crude, pubescent, magnificent mess, The Gories were both a
    reaction to and an embodiment of the city which spawned them; the band sucked up much-discussed local
    influences and then promptly spit them back out on the floor, each rock-soul-garage song a half-digested,
    unrecognizable, and entirely gross hometown homage.</p><p>
    Collins' mission with The Dirtbombs is not so different: <i>Dangerous Magical Noise</i>, the band's third
    full-length (and follow-up to 2001's soul covers record, <i>Ultraglide in Black</i>) quakes with the
    potential for total implosion, always threatening to completely dissemble itself and leave a tiny pile
    of gravel behind.  That danger-- the menace of possible destruction, or of feeling like this record might
    never play again because it's just too fragile to hold up-- is also exactly what makes <i>Dangerous Magical
    Noise</i> so unabashedly glorious.  Stubbornly lo-fi and expectedly scrappy, the album is also tremendously
    listenable, a rhythmic, leg-flailing romp through vintage soul cool, glam boogie, classic rock thrash, and
    punk bravado.</p><p>
    The Dirtbombs boast two drummers (and have recorded with two bass players), but even with all that thumping,
    the band's backing effort is barely enough to support Collins' wild guitar freakouts and billowing
    Henrdix-hollers.  Opener ""Start the Party"" is as clear an introduction to raucous Detroit stomping as
    anyone's ever gonna offer, a fuzz-laden Kick Out the Jams promise that, while breeze-blowing powerful,
    doesn't readily admit to the band's capacity for subtle tinkering.  The rollicking blues-rocker ""F.I.D.O.""
    belies The Dirtbombs' ability to craft emotionally complex, anthemic songs; ""Motor City Baby"" showcases
    the band's readiness to dip into the hooky, bubblegum choruses that made Motown wiggle.</p><p>
    There's not too much here to dismiss: ""Stuck in Thee Garage"" is ultimately forgettable (although its title
    is a nice implication of the Bombs' embrace of high/low dichotomy), but <i>Dangerous Magical Noise</i>
    plays better as one big, somersaulting explosion, aggressive and gentle and smarter every time you look.
    If The Dirtbombs are any indication of Detroit's real ""scene,"" they're proving that the frantic archivists
    and smoking-jacket cognoscenti will never actually come to terms with the anti-poetry of this city.  But
    if the lack of a realistic, cohesive music community means it's possible to create this kind of bizarrely
    assimilated beauty, then Detroit shouldn't even care.</p></div>"|2531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2531-dangerous-magical-noise/|8.2|Amanda Petrusich

    stalled career, the Pop has to go and associate himself with Shat.  Iggy, I will meet you out by the
    flagpole at three o'clock for this; if even one person mistakenly thinks that some of your ""cred"" has
    rubbed off on this jackass, why, I'll...  Well, probably get my ass kicked. I'm no match for a guy who
    used to roll around in broken glass, even if his body has been wrecked by heroin.  But it's the principle,
    dammit.</p><p>
    Ig opens <i>The Cunt Chronicles</i> with a guest monologue, graciously informing us that the
    following eternity of faux-metal schlock is a ""best of"" compilation, but this is a lie; the disc is not
    blank.  The best thing Shat can offer is silence, and not just any run-of-the-mill silence-- impenetrable
    death-silence.  After sixty-five cuts that can only be seen as symptomatic of the growing rate of functional
    illiteracy in this great nation, <i>The Cunt Chronicles</i> is so remarkably vacant that it fails even as
    parody, succeeding only in making the sweet release of death seem all the sweeter with every track.  But
    I, your intrepid reviewer, will hold on just a little longer.  I'm on a deadline.</p><p>
    Okay.  So, the album's not to be taken seriously; granted.  With song titles like ""If She Has a Kid, You
    Know She Fucks"" (the brutal logic underlying the tragedy of teen pregnancy!), <i>Sesame Street</i> lessons
    like ""Open/Close"" (""Open the door/ Close the door""), and the fortune-cookie wisdom of the enlightening
    ""You Can't Just Shit"", this much is clear.  And yet, it may not be a sincere endeavor, but that doesn't
    mean it's funny.  I'd mention Anal Cunt, but they're hard enough to be scary, with far better song titles
    and lyrics.  The Queers' ""Day Late and a Dollar Short"" (an early, brilliant EP collection from before they
    became surf-punk fluff) is really Shat's holy grail-- a goal sought, but never attained; for every cheap
    laugh produced by three-chord shoutalongs like ""This Place Sucks"", The Queers were able to hit on genuine
    humor and some actual music on tracks like ""Kicked Out of the Webelos"".  Shat is not so talented.</p><p>
    Instead, <i>The Chronicles</i> are as relentless and unflagging as brain cancer, and twice as fun.
    Sixty-five tracks of this, y'all.  Sixty-five tracks, and barely three times that many different lyrics
    between them all.  Sixty-five tracks of mindless slog-metal that Def Leppard's drummer could play, with
    some obvious ""ironic"" riff-stealing-- in case you didn't know how funny it was to hear-- oh god, I'd give
    an example of one of the 80s hard-rock already-a-self-parody songs they mimic for kicks, but I'd have to
    listen again.  Sixty-five tracks, but here's one Jeff Wood (the chief mastermind behind Shat) forgot to
    include.  It's called, ""Shat is Shit"":</p><p>
<i>""Shat is shit!<br/>
    Shat is shit!<br/>

    I wrote that!  Me!  I had you fooled, admit it.  Strap that baby to a two-chord progression (everyone knows
    the third chord is a cliché, anyway) with full distortion while I wail the lyrics like a cross between Jello
    Biafra and Glenn Danzig, and I have just written and performed every single song Shat ever wrote.  All of
    them.  If there's any justice, some honcho over with at ASCAP will read this and investigate why I'm not
    receiving royalties for this album.</p><p>
    Don't think it's that easy?  Let's ask Jeff.</p><p>
    Jeff, how do you write most of your songs?</p><p>
    ""Most of them I write at work.  Like the song 'I Stepped in Shit'.  I walked into this person's backyard,
    because I spray chemicals on lawns, and I fucking, I just stepped in shit and I was like 'Fuck.'  And my
    friend said 'What?' and I said, 'I stepped in shit.' And it was like *bing*, that's a song, so I ran to
    the van and fucking wrote it down.  My memory is shot.  I've got to write it down because as soon as I
    write it down the song is done.""</p><p>
    This is the future of music.</p><p>
    Think this sounds funny?  Think this album might be ""good for a laff?""  Oh my no.  One song.  That's it.
    One song, and then run as fast and far as you can.  If I were to humbly suggest the tune of choice, how
    about ""Cunt Flavored Lollipops"", primarily notable for an amusing breakdown of the song's one and only
    line-- that's right, ""cunt-flavored lollipops""-- to the tune of ""The Good Ship Lollipop.""  But don't even
    sit still long enough to laugh at it, even if you'd like nothing more than to savor literally the one
    moment of humor on <i>The Cunt Chronicles</i>.  Flee before you are caught and devoured.  There's nothing
    funny about realizing that you'll never get back a full hour of your life that could have been spent more
    productively having sex with a power sander, forgetting how to read, or simply letting the blood flow out
    of your wrists and into the bathtub drain, gently...  so gently...</p></div>"|7724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7724-the-cunt-chronicles/|0.2|Eric Carr

    most exciting thing I can say about it.  Which is shocking given that Zumpano's two early 90s full-lengths
    for Sub Pop, <i>Look What the Rookie Did</i>, and <i>Goin' Through Changes</i>, both brimmed with sprightly
    blasts of instantaneous hookiness and shimmering youthful exuberance.  But despite Zumpano getting its
    namesake from their drummer, Sparrow's debut may serve as yet another unfortunate reminder that Carl Newman,
    ex-Zumpano frontman and current New Pornographers guru, seems to have been the man behind most of Zumpano's
    kitschy irreverence.</p><p>
    
    If one chooses to disregard Zumpano's past, then Sparrow's tunes sound exactly as flaccid as one might
    expect coming from a band named Sparrow.  The dreadful cover art alone can be considered a disclaimer for
    the tedious and mind-numbingly dull exercise in chamber-pop within; the cover displays a colorless
    illustration of a bird from whence the band assumedly gleaned their thrilling name, while the back of the
    album features a gray photo of Jason Zumpano, hands firmly tucked in his suit pant pockets, with an
    dispossessed expression across his face-- which also, ironically enough, was my reaction after attempting
    to remain focused on this grueling album.</p><p>
    
    Zumpano may be a fucking ridiculous drummer, but as exemplified by the relationship kiss-off ""Don't Stand
    on Me"", the guy can't sing worth a damn.  Lines like, ""Don't you think of standing on me again/ I knew that
    you were heartless,"" should spill over with sincerity, but instead seem completely callous and disconnected.
    By the time Zumpano reaches the liberating declaration of the song's conclusion, ""You are gone, and I am
    happy,"" his delivery has been so indifferent that the words drift by in an empty fog without making the
    slightest impact.</p><p>
    
    Though Zumpano's vocals are seemingly beyond help, Sparrow would have faired somewhat better had the
    accompaniment sounded at all inspired.  There's a possibility that it once did-- Sparrow was originally
    conceived, just after the breakup of Zumpano's band in the late 90s, as an instrumental affair.  However,
    each number here seems plagued by their predominantly piano-driven arrangements, while an unrelentingly
    gray mix holds any potential charms captive.  On the album's pastoral opening track, ""Mountain on Mountain"",
    a rolling piano motif, which should come off as an intricately melodic counterpoint, instead seems
    remarkably plaintive and uneventful.  The would-be piano-and-drums bombast of ""One Eye Closed"" sounds more
    like a whimper, as ex-Zumpano guitarist Michael Ledwidge's lively chiming guitar chords, and the band's
    earnest attempts at backing vocal harmonies are, for better or worse, buried beneath the murky mix.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the only winning moment on the entire album comes with the very last number, the resigned acoustic
    ballad ""A Broken Sign"".  Maybe it's that, amidst the colorless piano tones of Sparrow, the casual strum of
    an acoustic guitar can sound like a revelation, or that for the first time on the whole record, Zumpano's
    disenchanted vocal style seems to fit better with the generally apathetic lyrics of the song.  Either way,
    its note of resignation by now echoes that of the listener; as <i>Sparrow</i> pensively draws to a close,
    so do its fans' expectations.</p></div>"|7725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7725-sparrow/|3.4|Hartley Goldstein

In other words, she's
    indiedom's pet mainstreamer, a slightly humiliating vocation that can be traced back to a massive contextual
    mix-up. Here's what happened: Orton's prolonged stint as the Chemical Brothers' ashanti (to launch a term
    for the go-to hook girl) got her 1997 solo debut, <i>Trailer Park, into thousands of Discmen theretofore
    unsullied by chanteuses.  Brit ravers who'd never mind Orton's Lilith Fair kin-- or, later, Dido-- embraced
    her music as a particularly luxurious species of chill-out.  Critics, for their part, acted as if Orton were
    the first to dress acoustic folk in loops and ambient beds. (Actually, it was Suzanne Vega, whose 1992 album
    </i><i>99.9\xBA F was so far ahead of the curve that it sounds, well, current).</i></p><p>
    Two more song collections followed, with predictably diminishing returns.  Orton never fiddled with the
    formula enough to alienate her original audience, but the ardor gradually faded. Both <i>Central Reservation
    and </i><i>Daybreaker were roughly three parts twang to one part electronica-- a docile, infinitely accommodating
    recipe that absorbed contributions from Dr. John, Emmylou Harris, Ben Harper, Ryan ""Rock'n'Roll"" Adams and
    the Chemical Brothers with equal ease.</i></p><p>
    So: three albums (each with a cover photo featuring the gawky singer in a sun-dappled outdoor scenario),
    zero hits outside the UK, and a dwindling supply of critical benevolence.  Doesn't <i>quite</i> sound like
    the moment for a greatest-hits album.  And yet here is <i>Pass in Time, containing no less than 54.5%
    of </i><i>Trailer Park (six songs out of eleven!), 41.6% of </i><i>Central Reservation and, mercifully,
    only 20% of last year's </i><i>Daybreaker.</i></p><p>
    Until the chronology begins to hiccup toward the end of disc one, the collection scans like a producer's
    progress report: from album to album the sonic spaces grow wider and the instrumentation more lush.
    <i>Trailer Park's ""Sugar Boy"" is typical early Orton-- simple, delicate and almost imperceptibly
    stilted by its own politesse.  ""Stolen Car"", which opened </i><i>Central Reservation, is a darker Beth,
    the main harmony alternately caressed and bruised by mewling backward guitars. The album provides a two-song
    glimpse into the singer's ""embarrassing"" pre-debut, an early 90s recording called </i><i>Superpinkymandy--
    in reality, the iffy production is the only factor setting these tunes apart from the rest; as a songwriter,
    Orton is consistent to a fault. </i><i>Pass in Time's second disc culminates with her collaborations with
    William Orbit, an EP's worth of echoey pop that may hint at a future direction. The future, as you might
    have guessed, sounds fairly familiar.</i></p><p>
    The single most interesting thing about Beth Orton remains her unique voice, best described as a kind of
    guttural lilt. An all-purpose instrument, it glides as smoothly alongside Princess Superstar's blabber as
    it does over the Chemical Brothers' crunch (whose deafening coda to ""Where Do I Begin"" off the <i>Vanilla
    Sky soundtrack delivers this collection's sole moment of urgency). The awful truth about Beth Orton
    may be that she is still, at heart, an ashanti.</i></p></div>"|6049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6049-pass-in-time-the-definitive-collection/|5.1|Michael Idov

    dubious, if not misleading.  To apply this term to the band's third box set seems nothing short of comical.
    But I'll be damned if the boys at Matador weren't on to something when they slapped a big yellow sticker on
    the <i>Hardcore UFO's</i> box set that reads, ""The definitive GBV box set.""  Rather than simply lumping
    together a bunch of marginal or unreleased material, <i>Hardcore UFO's</i> actually pulls together a bunch
    of material fans have been anticipating for a good long while; a decent GBV live album, the perpetually
    out-of-print debut EP <i>Forever Since Breakfast</i>, and most of the B-sides from the band's Matador heyday.</p><p>
    
    The last GBV box, <i>Suitcase</i>, was an impenetrable mess.  Though a surprisingly high percentage of its
    100 unreleased songs were wonderful, there was no discernible organization to the set, making it a real
    challenge to wade through.  <i>Hardcore UFO's</i>, on the other hand, compiles five easy-to-swallow and
    separately titled CDs, a DVD, and a book of photos into one nicely compartmentalized, intensely approachable
    package.  And like the best box sets, <i>Hardcore UFO's</i> manages to be representative of GBV's greatness
    without rehashing too much previously available material.</p><p>
    
    The one questionable inclusion here is that of a chronologically sequenced <i>Human Amusements at Hourly
    Rates</i>, the band's also-separately-released best-of album.  Pollard's sequencing proved pretty essential
    to the enjoyment of the best-of disc, and hearing the songs ordered chronologically only brings out the
    disparities between GBV's fractured and imaginative early work and their more straightforward recent output.
    On a more practical level, it's pretty safe to assume that somebody willing to drop $55 on a box set is
    pretty familiar with the band's albums-- with the best-of album also available separately, it's hard to
    justify its inclusion in a ""hardcore"" box set.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, <i>Human Amusements</i> is the only disc here that needlessly rehashes old material.  <i>Demons
    &amp; Painkillers</i>, a collection of B-sides and compilation appearances from the <i>Alien Lanes</i> through
    <i>Mag Earwhig!</i> period, shows just how much of the band's best output has never been released on one
    of their full-lengths.  Studio-produced versions of ""Motor Away"", ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"", and ""Game
    of Pricks"" are welcome inclusions, if they ultimately prove less dynamic than the basement versions from
    the albums.  The B-sides from the underrated <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>, including a fantastic rocked-up version
    of ""Now to War"", while the epic ""(I'll Name You) The Flame That Cries"" may be the best songs on the disc,
    speaking to the wealth of fantastic post-<i>Under the Bushes</i> material.</p><p>
    
    Much of this material pops up on <i>Live from the Wheelchair Races</i>, by far the best GBV live document
    ever to see release.  Culled from throughout the band's career, the disc captures spot-on performances of
    the band's best songs, the inebriated antics of previous live releases played down in favor of excellence
    and energy.  Enthusiasm has always been one of the band's greatest strengths, and this is the first of the
    band's live recordings, apart from the video-only <i>Live in L.A.</i> performance, to truly capture this.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the most predictable disc in the set, <i>Delicious Pie &amp; Thank You for Calling</i> is the latest in
    a seemingly endless batch of previously unreleased demo recordings to see the light of day in recent years.
    Thankfully, the overall quality of the songs is slightly higher than usual this time around.  Early demo
    versions of <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>'s balls-out rockers demonstrate Pollard's excitement at having a more
    virtuosic band at his disposal.  Super-early demo recordings show that the ""lo-fi"" setup used by Pollard
    to record most of GBV's classic output doesn't sound so awesome on its own.  As per usual, there's little
    here that challenges the best from <i>Bee Thousand</i> or <i>Alien Lanes</i>, but plenty of interesting
    material for fans to dig through.  The <i>Forever Since Breakfast</i> EP also proves a compelling listen,
    showing that Pollard was honing his big-rock chops long before he began to explore his inimitable melodic
    sensibility.</p><p>
    
    And then there's <i>Watch Me Jumpstart</i>, a fascinating documentary directed by Banks Tarver that perfectly
    rounds out Hardcore UFO's.  The film loosely chronicles the band from their early days through their mid-90s
    ascent.  About as far as you can hope to get from a glamorizing rockstar biopic, <i>Watch Me Jumpstart</i>
    watches as Pollard carves out his own private musical universe amidst the boredom and sprawl of Dayton, Ohio,
    and shows that Guided by Voices didn't come out of nowhere-- they grew out of a rock and roll history absorbed
    and recreated in Robert Pollard's basement.  Though by no means a complete document of Guided by Voices,
    <i>Hardcore UFO's</i> is a welcome window into their origins and development.</p></div>"|3598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3598-hardcore-ufos-revelations-epiphanies-and-fast-food-in-the-western-hemisphere/|8.5|Matt LeMay

    finally released the latest chapter, <i>600% Dynamite</i>. For those who aren't familiar with the Teflon
    label's releases, the Dynamite records are a cross-section of Jamaican music, past and present. Rather
    than cramming what can be an exhausting sound to some listeners into genre-oriented compilations (as the
    Trojan cut-price three-disc boxes do), Soul Jazz strives to present an eclectic look at the rich history
    of Jamaican music.</p><p>
    
    The result is that instead of the monolithic nature of many comps, the London-based label combs the archives
    of Studio One, the famed label run by Coxsone Dodd and presents something for everyone. The label offers a
    chance for people to check out the variety of Jamaican music and determine what they favor from the likes
    of ska, rocksteady, reggae, roots, soul crossovers, DJs, lover's rock, dancehall, ragga, dub, and so forth.
    So far, <i>100%</i> is the one for completists and <i>200%</i> was the head-turner that expanded into dub
    and featured a solid mix of classics and lesser-known tracks. Perhaps the best introduction to the series,
    though, is <i>300%</i>, which has the highest strike rate but features a lot of well-known tracks and
    compilation fodder. It's the place to start for the Jamaican music novice, but may prove superfluous to
    some longtime listeners. Follow-up <i>400%</i> nearly matches the quality of its predecessor, but features
    many more lesser known tracks-- it's the pick for the connoisseur. Last year's <i>500%</i> expanded to
    include dancehall and ragga while still maintaining a high hit-miss ratio.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, <i>600%</i> picks up where <i>500%</i> left off, leaning heavily on dancehall. It kicks
    off with a 2003 version of Barrington Levy's dancehall classic ""Under Mi Sensi"". Although a great track,
    it's a slightly regrettable choice because it also appears on both <i>Ragga Ragga Ragga 2003</i> and <i>The
    Biggest Dancehall Anthems 2003</i>, the two compilations that casual observers of dancehall would most
    likely track down to get a solid cross-section of this sometimes difficult-to-follow scene. What the
    inclusion of ""Under Mi Sensi"" does do, however, is continue the series' dialogue between tracks over
    different discs, highlighting the incestuous and back-scratching nature of Jamaica music. (The original
    ""Under Mi Sensi"" was featured on <i>400% Dynamite</i>).</p><p>
    
    Despite the presence of that update (and other popular favorites, such as Dennis Brown's ""Westbound Train""
    and Yabby You's ""Conquering Lion""), the track most familiar to most listeners will be the Johnny Osbourne's
    Winston Riley-produced ""Ready or Not"", the inspiration for the Fugees track of the same name. Osbourne's
    warm, mellifluous vocals are also featured on the uncharacteristically frantic, almost scat of the low-rent
    disco ""Budy Bye"". The underrated Winston Riley also provides Sister Nancy's ""Transport Connection"" and he
    outdoes his ""Ready or Not"" with Prince Mohammed's ""Come Mek a Rub a Dub"".</p><p>
    
    Osbourne""s ""Budy Bye"" is representative of most of the compilation's dancehall sounds. Rather than the
    sometimes harsh and masculine ragga-vocaled dancehall that's currently at a commercial and artistic peak,
    <i>600%</i> mostly highlights the sweeter, more feminine side of dancehall-- sort of the two-step to ragga's
    grime garage. The sweet-voiced Tenor Saw pitches in with the soulful, horn-driven ""Golden Hen"". Cynty &amp; The
    Monkees' ""Lady Lady"" (produced by Lee Perry) draws a line between gospel-inspired soul and girl-group music.
    Even the harshest ragga track, Papa San's ""Give Her the Credit"" is praising the feminine (but, playfully,
    only ""when she deserve it"") with a chopped-up beat that's part Public Enemy (literally) and part Todd
    Edwards.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Lloyd Chalmers' cheeky, proto-dub fascination with playful sounds and a bit of echo is highlighted
    on Tall T &amp; The Touchers' ""Touch the President"" and Chalmers' group, The Uniques, pays tribute to another
    regal figure on ""Queen Majesty"". (The In Crowd's ""His Majesty Is Coming"" is also included, but they're
    anticipating spiritual guidance rather than any political figure.)</p><p>
    
    Slanted heavily toward early dancehall and more soulful vocals than many of the previous additions, <i>600%
    Dynamite</i> sort of tilts some scales by dropping roots and ska music from its lineup. It's another
    outstanding and worthy addition to the series-- one that thankfully shines a light on a great number of
    lesser-known gems. Soul Jazz's inclusion here of primarily rocksteady and dancehall tracks is fitting.
    Those are the Jamaican sounds that seem to be getting the most critical scrutiny and praise at the moment,
    demonstrating that the label has its finger on the pulse of the now just as surely as it does on that of
    the past.</p></div>"|1992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1992-600-dynamite/|8.0|Scott Plagenhoef
